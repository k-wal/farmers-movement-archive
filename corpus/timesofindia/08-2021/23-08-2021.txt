And when the judges, Rajesh Krishnan, Harikrishna and Raghu Dixit, lauded his performance, Sandesh was overcome by emotion. “It’s been a long journey until here; one filled with tears, hopelessness, poverty and days when I didn’t have money to even have a meal,” reminisces Sandesh. Having nursed the passion to sing since he was six years old, it was Sandesh’s neighbour, a professional singer, who introduced him to a local bhajan group. Sandesh has been with that group for 21 years now. “We’ve won several awards on national and state level and I’ve been recognised individually on several occasions, too. Soon, I graduated to singing movie songs and was part of orchestras. I also doubled up as a courier boy to make a living, but the pandemic put an end to that, as well as my efforts to become an autorikshaw driver and fish monger,” he tells us. So now, Sandesh has become a food delivery boy. “There have been days when I’ve cried that my dreams of making it big in the world of singing have been shattered. I work from 7 am to 10 pm, which leaves me with no time to follow my passion? The task of putting food on the table takes over all else. To make myself feel better, I’d sing on my bike while delivering food to different homes. My wife is my biggest support system. On days when I lose all hope of pursuing my dream, she says ‘your time will come, too.’ I’m elated to have made it till here; it’s the best gift I could give to my parents and my wife who never lost hope even when I felt hopeless. Now my ultimate dream is to sing all my life across all genres,” sums up Sandesh. — Madhu Daithota||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/from-food-delivery-boy-to-singer-on-music-reality-show-sandesh-neermarga-has-a-dramatic-journey/articleshow/85533227.cms||Madhu Daithota

While students from MVJ College of Engineering bagged first prize at National Aerospace Conceptual Design Competition for their design of ‘Air Taxi’ — Inter-city Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing Aircraft (ICeVTOLA) — RV College of Engineering students clinched the top spot for their design of hybrid race car at the Formula Hybrid Competition held in 2021 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, USA. Students of the aeronautical engineering branch at MVJ College of Engineering designed an air taxi that aims to make travelling convenient while reducing congestion on roads, improving safety and mitigating emissions. The team comprised Keerthi GN, Amruthamshu KP, Koushik Udayachandran, Mithun Francis P and Atyab Hakeem. Their creation is similar to the conventional plane but can land and take off vertically, requiring less space to land and recover, making it runway independent. The MVJ team, named Abhimanyu 4.0, was awarded a cash prize of Rs 20,000 and certificates. The competition was organised by the design division and Mumbai branch of The Aeronautical Society of India. Keerthi said their product is expected to enter the market in 2031 and they now plan to publish their paper. “Our design made the cut because it was not complex and ticked all the boxes of an innovative, eco-friendly option,” she said. The Formula Hybrid Race Car designed by RV College of Engineering students won the Best Project Management award. A team of 29 students from Ashwa Racing — the racing division of Ashwa Mobility Foundation, a student research and development project undertaken by students of the college — took part in the virtual event. Members of the team conceptualise, design and construct various mobility prototypes. Dhruv Gupta, the team captain, said their prototype won owing to their project plan, ideas and design. “Ashwa Racing has secured a podium since 2017 at the Formula Hybrid event and stood first in 2020 and 2021. This year, our car has a feature which gives the driver a choice to pick a combustion engine (petrol/diesel-powered) or electric engine as per requirement,” Gupta said. “A focus on sustainable green mobility development inspired Ashwa Racing to adapt in-house developed parallel hybrid architecture. The design certainly paves the path for a future with less dependence on fossil fuels,” he said. Ravindra S Kulkarni, faculty advisor, Ashwa Racing, and prof and head, aerospace engineering department, RVCE, said the team has come a long way since its inception in 2003.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-engineering-students-bag-top-spots-in-design-competitions/articleshow/85545132.cms||Farheen Hussain

Filled with potholed roads and worn-off surfaces and industrial waste and garbage lying all over the place, BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta got a first-hand taste of the sad state of affairs when he visited the locality on Saturday. An upset Gupta immediately issued an ultimatum to his officers to address all issues pertaining to basic facilities and infrastructure. “All streetlights should be working and potholes fixed in a week. A special team will be deployed on Tuesday to check and clear solid waste,” Gupta told mediapersons later. Established in 1970s by the Karnataka Small Industries Development Corporation, Peenya Industrial Area is still deprived of quality infrastructure though it is hub of thousands of small and mediumscale units. Gupta, his officers and Manunath, MLA from Dasarahalli under which Peenya falls, held a meeting with Peenya Industries Association (PIA) before inspecting the area. “PIA has been making repeated requests to BBMP to improve infrastructure to help industrial units run smoothly. Goods transportation is a problem because of huge potholes. Streets are waterlogged at a whiff of rain,” PIA president Prakash C said. Solid waste management has become a bone of contention between BBMP and PIA. “Garbage is not being picked up from any industrial unit. BBMP officials send letters warning to penalise us instead of picking up solid waste,” rued Prakash. Gupta, however, promised PIA office-bearers that basic facilities and infrastructure will be addressed. He said drains stretching up to 4-5km need to be desilted, encroachments at a few spots will be removed and 14th main road will be developed immediately. Migrant workers to get jabsGiven that Peenya Industrial Area employs lakhs of people, many of whom are migrants, the BBMP chief directed his team to ensure all migrants are vaccinated. "As part of the drive, at least 400 persons should be vaccinated every day,” he said. PIA is demanding township status for their area. “Once it becomes an industrial township, a separate department will take care of infrastructure development,” Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/potholes-streetlights-to-be-fixed-in-a-week-palike-chief/articleshow/85545181.cms||P Pavan

Pegu said an SOP for reopening of educational institutions will be published this week with detailed guidelines as and when it gets approval from chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. “We will start offline classes from September, phase-wise. First, final-year classes like class X, XII, and degree final-year classes will commence,” Pegu told the media on Sunday. He said based on the progress of the Covid situation, rest of the classes will start too. “The SOP is under consideration and likely to be published in the next three days if the chief minister gives his nod," Pegu added. Government sources told TOI that from now onwards, even if Covid cases surge, schools and colleges will be closed district-wise, considering the Covid situation at the micro level. Students have incurred heavy academic losses since last year after the Covid outbreak. Alongwith financial woes to buy smartphones, lack of internet connectivity has been an additional impediment to the government’s plans to help students with online classes. “Several states in the country have already started offline classes, though the second wave still persists. The Assam education department has taken the final decision to start offline classes from September 1 and has sought the views from the state health department as a formality,” said a senior official of the education department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-plans-to-resume-x-xii-ug-final-yr-classes-from-sept-1/articleshow/85545310.cms||---

The accused are Khalid, 30, and Amir Khan, 23, from Panchkula, Haryana. Khudhabakash Khan, regional manager of TSI India Pvt Ltd , filed a complaint against the duo. Khan told police his firm manages State Bank of India ATMs. “We monitor live videos of ATM kiosks after there was a rise in cases of miscreants withdrawing cash using ATM cards and cancelling the cash-disposal transaction using fraudulent methods. The bank used to refund the deducted amount to the card holder’s account. Officials of the firm identified the two suspects involved in a similar fraud a few months ago in the city,” Khan said. The company’s staff noticed the suspects entering the ATM kiosk on Basavanapura Main Road at 11.30am. The two were inside the kiosk for several minutes. Field officers Uma Mahesh and Muralidhar rushed to the spot and nabbed the duo with the help of passersby. Jurisdictional KR Puram police detained the duo and seized Rs 45,000 in cash, ATM cards, a device used for the fraud and other materials. Police registered a case of cheating, theft, forgery and other charges against the two and took them into custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/haryana-duo-caught-using-fake-atm-cards-45000-recovered/articleshow/85545365.cms||Santosh kumar.B

He took the boy to the nearest government health facility and helped him reunite with his parents six hours later. The boy is being treated at the government hospital in Shantigram and met his parents, who were asleep on the train when he fell off and realised he was missing after travelling for more than 90km. The boy, his mason-father and mother had boarded the train at Hassan at 2.30pm. Kabadi Manjappa, 30, who has been patrolling and maintaining tracks as a keyman for five years, said this was the first time he saw someone fall off the train onto the tracks.  “I noticed the child falling around 3.30pm when I was checking the tracks. I rushed towards him since he was crying in pain. The challenge was how to console him as he was speaking in Telugu and I in Kannada,” Manjappa told TOI on Sunday. “Another problem was the boy said his parents hadn’t noticed him fall and didn’t have a mobile,” he said. Despite the language barrier, the keyman realised the immediate thing to do was save the boy’s life. “I carried him for about half a kilometre to reach the nearest village and then took him to the government hospital at Shantigram where he was given first aid,” he said. Reunited with kin after 6 hrsThe boy told the keyman he fell off the train accidentally when he was standing near the door. “I informed my superior officer and the official on duty at Shantigram. They alerted their counterparts who then made announcements at the stations along the route so that his parents would know where their child is,” Manjappa said. The boy’s parents realised he was missing at Thippasandra station and got off. They took a bus to Kunigal and from there boarded another one to Hassan. “After they got down at the station, they contacted me. I briefed them and they took a bus from Kunigal and reached Shantigram at 9:30pm. They were reunited with their son more than six hours after the incident,” Manjappa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/keyman-rescues-7-yr-old-boy-who-fell-off-train/articleshow/85545442.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||World||7 Afghan civilians killed in a stampede to get into Kabul airport||KABUL: At least seven more Afghan nationals, most of them elderly women, were reported killed over the weekend in a crush of stampeding civilians gathered outside Kabul airport in the hope of being airlifted out of the gathering Taliban storm in Afghanistan. More than 15,000 people had converged on Hamid Karzai international airport in sweltering heat, prompting Taliban fighters to fire in the air to disperse the crowd, news agencies said quoting a spokesperson for the UK’s ministry of defence. The swelling tide of civilian crowds headed towards the airport since Saturday was apparently fuelled by rumours about the US and the UK planning to wind up their evacuation mission within days. The Taliban checkpoints on all roads and the rush at the gates to the airport, however, stalled thousands in their march to the facility. A Nato official was quoted as saying at least 20 people had died in and around Kabul airport since the Taliban seized control of the capital. "Our focus is to evacuate all foreigners as soon as we can," the official said. "Our forces are maintaining strict distance from outer areas of Kabul airport to prevent any clashes with the Taliban." A member of the Taliban’s cultural commission, Abdul Qahar Balkhi, said it was unfortunate for people to be rushing to the airport despite the new regime's assurances that they wouldn't be harmed. "We have announced a general amnesty for everyone in the security forces – from the senior to the junior level. This fear, this hysteria that has taken place, is unfounded," he said. Hordes of people trying to flee the country don't have travel documents. They have been waiting outside the airport for a couple of days now, hoping to be evacuated on humanitarian grounds. "If we leave, we won’t be able to come here again as Taliban don’t allow people towards the airport without travel documents," Hashmatullah, 41, a chef at an Afghan restaurant in the capital city, said. He was accompanied by his wife, three daughters and two sons. Hashmatullah had lost his brother, an Afghan soldier, last month while fighting the Taliban in Kandahar. "After receiving the mutilated body of my younger brother, I can’t imagine that they (Taliban) have changed," he said. About 4,500 US troops are in temporary control of the airport, with some 900 British soldiers also on patrol at the site as part of efforts to secure the evacuation flights. Taliban fighters have been manning checkpoints on roads leading to the airport and blocking Afghans without travel documents from entering. Amid the prevailing uncertainty, talks between the Taliban and the Afghan political leadership continue, with the two sides deliberating on the contours of a new government, women's rights and an "inclusive set-up". The former Afghan president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, a key Afghan politician, have met members of the Taliban political office. "Both sides exchanged views on the current security and political developments, and an inclusive political settlement for the future of the country," Abdullah’s office said, but gave no further details. The Taliban leadership, however, said that the consultations were aimed at reaching an agreement on an inclusive system. Balkhi said they were also negotiating on whether to keep Kabul as the country’s capital or move it to Kandahar, the former headquarters of the armed group. The point of intra-Afghan talks, according to Balkhi, was also to find common ground on women's rights. "Islamic law is known to everyone and there are no ambiguities about the rights of women, the rights of men and children. And right now, we’re in consultations to clarify what those rights are," the Taliban leader said. Meanwhile, an anti-Taliban resistance movement in northern Afghanistan has said it is willing to negotiate with the Taliban, but also prepared for a long-term struggle. A spokesman for the National Resistance Front led by Ahmad Massoud, the son of slain Afghan leader and politician Ahmad Shah Massoud, has gathered around 9,000 fighters in the Panjshir valley to the northeast of Kabul. Massoud told the London-based newspaper Al-Sharq al-Awsat that his movement hoped for talks but was "prepared to defend until the last man". "We are ready to form an inclusive government with the Taliban through political negotiations. But what is unacceptable is the formation of an Afghan government characterised by extremism, which would pose a serious threat not only to Afghanistan, but also to the region and the whole world." The Taliban had said if they failed to take control of Panjshir through negotiations, they would capture it by force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/7-afghan-civilians-killed-in-a-stampede-to-get-into-kabul-airport/articleshow/85545818.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The organisation urged "the future Afghan leadership" and the international community to work together to ensure that Afghanistan is never again used as a platform or safe haven for "terrorists". "Terrorist organisations are not allowed to have a foothold (in Afghanistan)," said a final communique, issued after the Saudi Arabia-based organisation held a special meeting called by Riyadh to discuss the situation in the war-torn country. The body's calls and decisions are mostly symbolic, but it shows mistrust towards the Taliban who took over Kabul last week, and how some Muslim countries are concerned about the new reality on the ground in Afghanistan. The statement called on Afghan parties to resolve their differences "peacefully".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/will-seek-to-help-achieve-peace-in-afghanistan-says-organisation-of-islamic-cooperation/articleshow/85546390.cms||---
---||World||US orders 6 commercial airlines to help transport Afghan evacuees||WASHINGTON: The Biden administration on Sunday commandeered 18 aircraft from six commercial airlines to airlift American nationals and allies from Afghanistan amid the ceaseless crisis in Kabul where the Taliban continued to pose hurdles before evacuation efforts. Orders for requisitioning aircraft came from the defence department, which invoked the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) provisions created after World War II to access "commercial air mobility resources." The programme, arising from the Berlin airlift, involves pledges by private airlines to loan aircraft to the Pentagon within 24 hours upon activation. The commercial planes will not fly into Kabul airport but instead be used "for the onward movement of passengers from temporary safe havens and interim staging bases," the Pentagon said in a statement, indicating that they will be used to airlift evacuees from pit stops in Gulf countries. Aircraft being requisitioned include three each from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines and Omni Air; two from Hawaiian Airlines; and four from United Airlines. The US has so far evacuated only around 2,500 Americans from Kabul over the past week, and an estimated 15,000 Americans and upwards of 50,000 Afghan allies still need to be airlifted. The Taliban is not making it easy, with reports of hurdles and threats facing those wanting to leave Afghanistan. US officials acknowledged that Americans have had "tough encounters" with the Taliban in trying to get through to the airport. There has been some talk of US forces going beyond the airport perimeter to facilitate evacuation but the general approach has been one of caution and not wanting to provoke a firefight. President Biden is expected to address the issue again after he scrapped a scheduled vacation getaway on Saturday following widespread criticism of his administration's handling of the crisis. A CBS News poll showed nearly 75% of respondents saying the US withdrawal from Afghanistan had gone badly (30%) or very badly (44%), although a majority (63%) supported the withdrawal of US forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-orders-6-commercial-airlines-to-help-transport-afghan-evacuees/articleshow/85546491.cms||Chidanand Rajghatta

"We want to make the Taliban realise that the only way forward is through negotiation," he told Reuters by telephone from his stronghold in the mountainous Panjshir valley northwest of Kabul, where he has gathered remnants of regular army units and special forces as well as local militia units. "We do not want a war to break out." However he said his supporters were ready to fight if Taliban forces, which have so far stayed out of Panjshir, tried to invade. "They want to defend, they want to fight, they want to resist against any totalitarian regime." Massoud, son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, one of the main leaders of Afghanistan's anti-Soviet resistance in the 1980s, said the forces did not just come from Panjshir, which also held out against the Taliban prior to 2001. "We are defending the whole country in one province." He called for an inclusive, broad-based government in Kabul representing all of Afghanistan's different ethnic groups and said a "totalitarian regime" should not be recognised by the international community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/anti-taliban-leader-massoud-says-negotiation-only-way-forward/articleshow/85547029.cms||---

Since the Taliban's takeover of Kabul on August 15, China and Pakistan have stepped up contacts amid a sense of their delight over a "humiliating defeat" of the US after a 20-year war in Afghanistan despite lingering concerns over the return of the Taliban with all its baggage of the al-Qaida and the Islamic State. Pakistan only stands to gain in terms of stability on its western border if the Taliban were able to govern effectively.... (But) if they are unable to do so, Afghanistan could face an unstable future which will not be in Pakistan's interest," said Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to the UK, the UN and the US. Also, the US-Pakistan ties would remain strained, with Washington asking for counterterror pressure on Taliban, Stanford analyst Asfandyar Mir said. Chinese analysts too had a similar warning. The US withdrawal will not only create uncertainties and risks in regional stability but will also allow Washington to focus more resources on countering China, Wang Xiangwei, former editor-in-chief of South China Morning Post, wrote in his column in the paper. Afghanistan could also again become a staging ground for terrorists because of the Taliban's links with extremists, including the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a group of Uigur militants blamed by China for terror attacks in Xinjiang, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/as-china-pakistan-weigh-recognising-taliban-experts-warn-of-long-term-losses-us-ire/articleshow/85547391.cms||---
---||World||Kabul a ‘city of fear’: Afghans seek to flee but losing hope||On Saturday morning, a former interpreter for a US company in Kabul plunged into a mass of humanity outside a gate at the Kabul airport with her family in tow. Even as she was jostled and elbowed by people in the throng, she pushed ahead, desperate to secure a flight out of the country for everyone accompanying her - her husband, 2-year-old daughter, disabled parents, three sisters and a cousin. Then the crowd surged. The entire family was slammed to the ground. People trampled them where they lay, the woman recalled just hours later. She remembered someone smashing her cellphone and someone else kicking her in the head. She could not breathe, so she tried to tear off her abaya, a robelike dress. As she struggled to her feet, she said, she searched for her toddler. The girl was dead, trampled to death by the mob. "I felt pure terror," she said in a telephone interview from Kabul. "I couldn't save her." A 39-year-old former interpreter for the US military and Western aid groups was hiding on Saturday inside a home in Kabul with his wife and two children. He said the Taliban had telephoned, telling him, "Face the consequences - we will kill you." The interpreter, whose identity was shielded like others in this article for safety concerns, said he had given up trying to secure a flight after a harrowing and ultimately futile attempt to force his way past Taliban gunmen. "I'm losing hope," he said by telephone. "I think maybe I will have to accept the consequences." Another former interpreter for the US military was also in hiding. He, too, said he had abandoned any hope of getting a flight for him, his wife and young son after two terrifying forays to the airport. "I've lost trust in the US government, which keeps saying, 'We will evacuate our allies.' Evacuation is impossible." A female Afghan journalist in Kabul said she finally ventured outside after hiding indoors since last Sunday. Trying to obey randomly enforced Taliban strictures on women, she wore a full-body abaya. "It was so heavy, it made me feel sick," she said. And in the street, she said, "there is no music, nothing. All you hear is the Taliban talking on TVs and radios." She said her sister-in-law appeared in front of male family members with her hair uncovered. Her brother-in-law gave her a vicious kick and said, "Put your bloody scarf on!" Also in hiding was a former interior ministry police officer who had seen Taliban ransack the ministry, combing through paperwork that contained information about employees. "Kabul has become a city of fear," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/kabul-a-city-of-fear-afghans-seek-to-flee-but-losing-hope/articleshow/85547577.cms||---
---||World||FDA issues 'you are not a cow' warning after people use livestock drug for Covid||Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug commonly used for livestock, should not be taken to treat or prevent Covid-19, the Food and Drug Administration said on Saturday. The warning came a day after the Mississippi state department of health issued a similar statement in response to reports that an increasing number of people in Mississippi were using the drug to prevent a Covid infection. Some studies last year spurred use of the drug against Covid-19, especially in Latin America, and Fox News has promoted some of those studies' findings on air. But the National Institutes of Health said in February that most of the studies related to Ivermectin and the coronavirus "had incomplete information and significant methodological limitations," including small sample sizes and study outcome measures that were often unclear. In Mississippi, where only 37% of the population is fully vaccinated, more than two-thirds of recent calls placed to the state's poison control center were related to "ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of Ivermectin purchased at livestock supply centers," the state department of health said in a news release. Of those who called about ingesting Ivermectin, 85% had mild symptoms and one person was told to "seek further evaluation" because of the large amount they were reported to have taken, the state's health department said. Ivermectin, which is also formulated for use by people to treat parasitic worms, had been controversially promoted as a potential Covid treatment earlier in the pandemic, but recent studies found that the drug's efficacy against the coronavirus is thin, and the FDA has not approved the drug. On Twitter, the FDA was more declarative in its warning. "You are not a horse," the agency said. "You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it." The FDA said it has received reports of people who have "required medical support and been hospitalised after self-medicating with ivermectin intended for horses."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/fda-issues-you-are-not-a-cow-warning-after-people-use-livestock-drug-for-covid/articleshow/85547688.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Revive farm pond scheme to deal with monsoon vagaries, say experts||BENGALURU: With farmers being distressed by fluctuating monsoon rainfall for successive years, experts feel having farm ponds (krishi honda) in fields will minimise their woes. They have urged the government to revive the Krishi Bhagya scheme to ensure a pond in each farmland. The suggestion comes in the wake of a prolonged spell of weak monsoon in August following excessive rain in June and July. About 86 taluks were hit by floods when there was copious rainfall, but crops are now drying in these and other areas due to lack of water. The water scarcity is despite most reservoirs being almost full. For instance, the dams in Krishna basin are 99% full (overall) — they have 411.9 tmc ft of water as against their cumulative storage capacity of 417.5 tmc ft. About 106 tmc ft is stored in the dams of Cauvery basin against their maximum capacity of 114.6 tmc ft. “Fields are not getting adequate water despite dams being full due to lack of connectivity between major reservoirs and minor irrigation tanks. Most of the canal works are incomplete or they are continuously under repair. It’s been the same story during monsoon for many years,” said Dr HS Shivaramu, agrometeorologist, Gandhi Krishi Vigyan Kendra (GKVK), Bengaluru. According to data from Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), only 42% of the total 3,639 minor irrigation tanks in the state have storage more than 50% of their capacity at present. Shivaramu noted that the lack of canal connectivity is also the reason for frequent floods as water discharged from reservoirs during heavy rain inundates farms and human habitats instead of flowing into tanks. He said a scheme ensuring farm ponds in all fields of more than one hectare is necessary for sustainable agriculture, adding a hectare of farmland should have a 12x12m pond with 3m depth to hold about 2.5 lakh litres of water. “Water filled in the ponds during excessive rain fulfils the critical need of the crop during an interim dry spell. It also provides the long-term benefit of recharging groundwater apart from neutralising the effect of flash floods,” opined Shivaramu. The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in 2013 introduced Krishi Bhagya scheme under which farmers were entitled to 80% subsidy on construction of farm ponds. The scheme saw over 1.8 lakh farm ponds constructed till 2019. The BJP government discontinued the scheme when the state economy was hit by the Covid-induced slowdown. “With the economy showing signs of recovery and the state’s revenues improving, the government should think of reviving the farm pond scheme,” said BDA Sataya Babu Bose, director, Centre for Rural Studies and Development. Such ponds being built under MGNREGS: MinisterAgriculture minister BC Patil said the government has not stopped the farm pond scheme, and they are being constructed under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme. “We preferred doing it under the national scheme as we wanted to protect livelihoods amid Covid distress. More agricultural fields will have ponds in the near future,” Patil said. An official from the rural development and panchayat raj department said the government has set a target of building one lakh farm ponds this year, of which 38,000 are ready.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/revive-farm-pond-scheme-to-deal-with-monsoon-vagaries-experts/articleshow/85548290.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||India||Indian-origin SA people get threats, go into panic mode||CHENNAI: As uneasy calm settled over the troubled KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces of South Africa, worst affected in the July violence following the arrest of former president Jacob Zuma, cracks are beginning to show. Their prime targets - Indian-origin South Africans in Durban and Johannesburg - say they have been receiving WhatsApp messages threatening renewed or 'Part-II' of the violence, asking "Indians to go back from where they came". Kimeshan Raman, a 33-year-old resident of Durban and social activist, who has recently applied for an OCI (Overseas Citizenship of India) card, said, "It's a panic reaction. Messages and videos are being circulated targeting Indians. We want to protect our families." At least 330 people, two of them Indians, were killed in the riots that ravaged parts of South Africa for about two weeks, from July 9. It was four days after deadly arson and looting before President Cyril Ramaphosa deployed the army to quell the violence. Indian-origin South African citizens have gone into panic mode, desperate for a "back-up" plan. Several of whom spoke to admitted they have applied for the OCI cards or were in the process of doing so. Potential applicants blame poor upkeep of documents, including the ship list of indentured labourers brought from India nearly 150 years ago, and the lackluster response of the Indian Embassy to their plight. "We are scared of another round of violence. I will be applying for an OCI card," said Krishna Jagarnath, 35, a Durban resident, whose ancestors hail from Bihar. Mahatma Gandhi's granddaughter Ela Gandhi, who resides in Durban, said, "We are trying to unite people across racial lines and build peace and goodwill." But there's a lot of uncertainty and insecurity because of threats from certain sections. "We don't know where they are going to attack and when they are going to attack," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indian-origin-sa-people-get-threats-go-into-panic-mode/articleshow/85548605.cms||Jaya Menon

The incident took place around 2.30am when police intercepted an auto-rickshaw and a motorcycle at Bhotgaon, 6km south from Kokrajhar town. Special DGP LR Bishnoi said police had inputs that a gang of six dacoits was planning to rob a bank at Bhotgaon. "As per our information, the branch had around Rs 30 lakh cash. Accordingly, nakas were set up at four different locations," the officer said. The dacoits violated the police signal at a naka and tried to flee. "They opened fire at the police party. In retaliation, three of them sustained bullet injuries and the other three managed to flee. The injured were rushed to hospital where they succumbed to injuries," he said. The accused have been identified as Siraj Doulah Sheikh (26) of South Salmara Mankachar district, Aminul Sheikh (28) of Goalpara district and Manirul Hussain (27) of Goalpara.

---||India||Farmer runs from pillar to post for 5 years to return Rs 53k to govt||JIND: A Haryana farmer is having to go through an "unusual ordeal" for the past five years to pay back money wrongly disbursed to him from the state coffers. The farmer from Jind district has been making fruitless rounds of the office of the state revenue department to return Rs 52,920 that was credited wrongly to his and his brother's bank accounts on August 18, 2016. Surajmal Nain of Kharainti has "gone everywhere" - from block offices to the chief minister's house in Chandigarh - but his "desperate struggle" continues. Surajmal's family runs the farm jointly and the revenue department in August 2016 deposited Rs 34,735 into his State Bank of India account and credited a similar amount to his brother's account as well. The money totalled Rs 69,470. The brothers had sought compensation for pest attack on their cotton crop but were eligible for only Rs 16,550, the farmer told TOI. After realising that they were paid an extra Rs 52,920, the two brothers wrote to the tehsildar to know the process for repayment as they were clear they would only accept the rightful amount due to them. In 2016, the family's cotton crop covered a little over two acres out of a total of 12 acres, and the Haryana government at the time had approved compensation of Rs 8,000 per acre. So, the payment should not have exceeded Rs 16,550. After no response from the tehsildar, Surajmal went to the CM's residence in Chandigarh to lodge another complaint. Surajmal even complained against the then Julana tehsildar, claiming that the revenue officer had deliberately transferred an extra amount of compensation to harass him, yet the same tehsildar was appointed to investigate the issue. "Whoever returns a misplaced purse is appreciated, but the Haryana government made me run from pillar to post for five years," Surajmal told TOI. The farmer traced the source of his woes to an RTI he had filed in 2015 seeking details of the compensation awarded to cotton farmers in 2014. The RTI details, Surajmal claims, revealed that the revenue officials had distributed compensation wrongly. "Thereafter, I lodged a complaint with deputy commissioner and the Haryana government but nothing has happened so far," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmer-runs-from-pillar-to-post-for-5-years-to-return-rs-53k-to-govt/articleshow/85548897.cms||Vijender Kumar

Haribhau Waghmare, Shinde's collegemate said, "He was the eldest of seven siblings and was instrumental in arranging for the marriages of all his sisters". Shinde took 13 bullets and died on the spot when a small group of armed Maoists fired on a squad of ITBP personnel during an area domination exercise in Narayanpur.

---||Chandigarh||Amarinder hits out, calls remarks by Sidhu advisers 'atrocious', 'anti-India'||CHANDIGARH: Taking serious note of the recent statements by Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu's advisers on issues like Kashmir and Pakistan, CM Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday warned them against making what he described as "atrocious and ill-conceived comments". He said such utterances were potentially dangerous to peace and stability of the state and the country. The CM also urged Sidhu to rein in his advisers before they end up damaging India's interests. He urged the two advisers, Malwinder Singh Mali and Pyare Lal Garg, to "stick to advising the Punjab Congress president and not speak on matters of which they had little or no knowledge, and have no understanding of the implications of their comments." He was reacting to reported remarks by Garg questioning Capt Amarinder's criticism of Pakistan as well as the earlier controversial statement by Mali on Kashmir. Expressing shock at the statements, the CM said these statements were misplaced and antagonistic to the stated position of India and Congress on Pakistan and Kashmir. "Kashmir was and is an inalienable part of India," said Amarinder, adding that with his proclamation to the contrary, Mali had effectively and inexplicably toed Islamabad's line. "This is totally anti-national," he said. The CM also slammed Mali for not withdrawing his statement despite widespread condemnation it had evoked not only from other parties, but also from within the Congress.Ridiculing Garg's statement that criticism of Pakistan by Amarinder was not in the interest of Punjab, the chief minister said Sidhu's adviser was clearly disconnected from the ground reality. "The fact, which every Punjabi and every Indian knows, is that Pakistan's threat to us is real. Every day, they are pushing weapons and drugs into Punjab via drones in a brazen attempt to destabilise our state, and our nation. Punjabi soldiers are dying at the borders at the hands of Pakistan-backed forces," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amarinder-hits-out-calls-remarks-by-sidhu-advisers-atrocious-anti-india/articleshow/85548946.cms||---

---||India||Covid third wave looms, may peak in October, hit kids: MHA panel to PMO||NEW DELHI: A committee of experts constituted under the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) has warned of an imminent third wave of Covid that could peak around October and sought better medical preparedness for children who might be at similar risk as adults. The report of the committee, set up on the directions of the home ministry, has noted that “paediatric facilities — doctors, staff, equipment like ventilators, ambulances, etc. are nowhere close to what may be required in case a large number of children become infected”. The report has been submitted to the PMO. Coronavirus in India: Live updatesPanel: States need to boost Covid care facilities for kidsThe report has called for prioritising vaccination among children with co-morbidities and a special focus on those with disability. Even with “strict interventions”, the peak of the third wave is expected to arrive by late October, the experts have concurred with earlier assessments of different institutions. Several studies have spoken of the likelihood of a third wave but these are estimates. The vulnerability of kids as they haven’t been vaccinated has been discussed, with most experts of the view they are not prone to severe infections though it can pass the virus to others. Other estimates have said the third wave, seen to be the result of renewed mobility, may prove to be less severe than the second. The study: “Third Wave Preparedness: Children Vulnerability and Recovery,” has looked into the possibility of Covid-affecting children and the required strategies to deal with the pandemic. The recommendations made by the committee has suggested “a holistic home care model, immediate increase in paediatric medical capacities and prioritising mental health issues among children”. It has mooted structuring of Covid wards in a way that allows children’s attendants or parents to safely stay with them through their recovery. Read AlsoDocs, parents welcome move to inoculate kids against Covid-19Ranchi: Even as the state government is yet to receive an official letter from the Centre about the administration of Zydus Cadila India’s Covid vaccine for children above 12 years, paediatricians and parents hailed the decision on approval of the shots for emergency use among children. AdditionalExperts have expressed concern about 82% shortage of paediatricians in primary health centres and 63% vacancies in community health centres (the data cited from a parliamentary standing committee). “The situation is already dire, and might worsen due to lack of adherence to Covid Appropriate Behaviour (CAB), insufficient medical facilities and lagging vaccination,” the report said. It pointed out how during the second wave, about 60%- 70% children hospitalised due to Covid had comorbidities and their low immunity was the primary cause behind many developing MIS-C (Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome), a “rare but serious condition” developed post-Covid recovery. Read AlsoExperts urge parents to be cautious over 3rd Covid wave fearWorried over the prediction that the third wave of Covid-19 would affect children more, experts have advised parents to take extra care of their wards.“Preparedness is the key, learning from the past two waves. We need to take proactive actions now in anticipation of the third wave. States may start enhancing paediatric Covid care facilities for treatment, ICU, paediatric ambulance, medicine, including paediatricians,” said Santosh Kumar, coordinator of the committee of experts and professor head of governance and public policy at NIDM. The report said the third wave is already upon us if we look at the rising R value, the reproduction rate of Covid-19 that has increased from 0.9 to 1 over the last week of July. “Kerala, which is reporting a high daily caseload of Covid infections is currently showing an R value of 1.1. This indicates that a third wave is upon us and these indicators must not be ignored,” experts have warned. The committee of experts included Anurag Agarwal, director of CSIR-IGIB; MC Mishra, ex-director of AIIMS; Naveen Thacker, president of the Indian Paediatricians Association; Gagandeep Kang, professor of CMC, Vellore and AK Pandey, chairman of state monitoring committee on shelter for urban homeless. Read AlsoCentre prepared to tackle possible third wave of Covid-19: Anurag ThakurSHIMLA: The Centre is fully ready to tackle a possible third wave of Covid-19 and a provision of Rs 23,123 has been made for this purpose, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said here on Friday. He said special emphasis is being given to strengthening paediatric care amidThe third wave can complicate the situation with “the new and more virulent mutated variants of SARS Cov-2 that have the ability to escape immunity from earlier infections and in some cases even the prevalent vaccines”. The report said this has pushed the target immune population for achieving herd immunity to 80%-90%. The report has expressed concern about “slow rollout” of vaccines which is seen as the only way out of this pandemic. India’s vaccination rate is at 9% compared to the USA’s 52% (fully vaccinated), it said. Experts have called for “a scientific approach coupled with focused public spending” to deal with pandemic management. “There is a huge gap between urban and rural India in terms of awareness, digitisation and medical facilities. It seems like the pandemic outbreak has only exacerbated social inequities and highlighted shortcomings of our society,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/states-need-to-boost-covid-care-facilities-for-children-expert-panel/articleshow/85549194.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||Bengaluru||Don’t rush to Delhi, talk to local leaders first: BJP central leadership to Karnataka legislators||BENGALURU: To reinforce discipline among the party’s rank and file, the BJP central leadership has barred legislators from rushing to New Delhi to air their grievances and instead asked them to hold talks with local leaders first. During the last leg of BS Yediyurappa’s term as chief minister and in the first few days after Basavaraj Bommai formed his cabinet team, dissidents and those seeking plum portfolios have been trying to visit Delhi to make a strong case for their induction into the cabinet. To stem this practice, the party has said disgruntled leaders must hold a closed-door meeting with the chief minister or the party’s state president or members of the state core committee who, in turn, will get in touch with the Delhi leadership after assessing the merits of a claim. “We want to ensure organisational discipline that the party is known for. We want to send out a strong message that ruling party members must focus on governance and not go around making public statements,” said BJP state general secretary & MLC N Ravikumar. A senior Union minister from Karnataka is learnt to have been given informal charge to liaise between the state unit and the central leadership. The minister will closely work with national general secretary in charge of Karnataka, Arun Singh. The party has been struggling with dissidence for a few months now, first with then CM Yediyurappa’s style of functioning and then with Bommai’s team selection. ‘JD(S) to bail out govt if need be’While Aravind Bellad and CP Yogeeshwara, who missed the cabinet berth, rushed to Delhi, several ministers openly expressed unhappiness over portfolios allocated to them. Anand Singh, who has been given departments of environment and tourism, has refused to assume office despite the CM’s efforts to assuage him. Central leaders have not given him appointment yet. “The ministers seeking plum portfolios are pursuing self-interest. The same applies to those sulking over missing cabinet berths. We hope the high command will crack the whip and curb indiscipline among them,” said senior BJP MLC Lahar Singh Siroya.  As Bommai seeks to douse dissidence among ministerial hopefuls, JD (S) supremo HD Deve Gowda on Sunday reiterated support to the government. He said, “It is true I had assured Bommai — when he met me after taking charge as CM — that he can approach us if his government faces any difficulty. While I’ve advised him to avoid such a situation, we will be there to help if required.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bjp-dont-rush-to-delhi-talk-to-local-leaders-first/articleshow/85549234.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Manjunath Maali from Bagalkot, Dastgir Mulla from Chikkodi and Ravi Neelagar from Gadag are currently quarantined in New Delhi. Belagavi/Gadag: Three Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel from North Karnataka returned home from war-torn Afghanistan, much to the relief of their families. Dastgir Mulla from Chikkodi, Manjunath Maali from Bagalkot and Ravi Nilagar from Gadag had been deployed as commandos, part of a security team at the Indian Embassy in Kabul, which was attacked after the Taliban took control of the Afghan capital. The trio was in Kabul since 2019, and currently quarantined in New Delhi. Maali recounted to TOI the harrowing experience they endured when the embassy came under attack. “We were attacked four times when we were en route Kabul airport from the embassy,” he said. Senior diplomatic officials and the commandos left Afghanistan on board a special flight on August 16. Worried about Mulla’s safety, wife Ravoof, who is in the eighth month of pregnancy, had been calling him frantically since August 13. Mulla said while instances of violence were common in Afghanistan, the situation turned particularly chaotic after the Taliban seized power in the capital. “People could be seen running on the streets and one could hear shots being fired every 30 minutes. The Taliban did not want those in the Indian Embassy to leave since they wished to negotiate with our government. When they learnt we were evacuating, they surrounded the office and started firing in the air. We defended the embassy and did not allow them to enter the office,” Mulla added. The commandos, who arrived in Gujarat from Kabul, travelled to New Delhi by road. They are expected to stay there for a month, complete formalities and then travel to Karnataka. In Gadag’s Balaganur village, Ravi Nilagar’s family was elated on learning of their son’s safe return from Afghanistan. Nilagar has been a constable with ITBP for 13 years. His mother Neelavva, wife Yellavva and son Santosh, who are in Hulkoti village, expressed joy during a video call with him from Delhi on Saturday.

Her employer made her work twenty hours a day, without sufficient food and didn’t pay her. She escaped by leaping off the window of her employer’s house and later sought asylum at the Indian embassy. She finally reached Bengaluru on Friday. Twenty hours of work a day without being paid a paise, no change of clothes and passport snatched away — this sums up the four-month ordeal a 27-year-old Bengaluru woman experienced in Abu Dhabi. She finally escaped by leaping off the window of her employer’s house and seeking asylum at the Indian embassy. On Friday evening, the woman reached Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), the relief of being back home writ large on her face. Nimisha (name changed) was born and raised in Bagalur, Bengaluru Urban, and supported her family, including elderly parents and three young siblings, by working as a domestic help in the locality. But the Covid crisis left her unemployed and she struggled to feed the mouths she was supporting and buy medicines for her parents. Then she came across someone she thought was a godsend: Aisha from Goripalya, an illegal agent, who promised to place her as a domestic help in Abu Dhabi for a monthly pay of Rs 30,000. “For someone who was struggling to make ends meet in Bengaluru, the offer was enticing. So she took accepted it and flew to UAE in March-end,” said PN Nagendra Babu, officer attached to Office of Protector of Emigrants, Bengaluru, who received Nimisha at KIA. On landing in Abu Dhabi, Nimisha was received by a Sri Lankan agent, identified as Ajmal, who drove her to her employer, an Emirati family. But what awaited the Bengaluru woman was non-stop work, including cleaning, washing and gardening. “She was woken up at 4am for work and subjected to harsh treatment with not enough food, water or change of clothes. Even after two months, the family didn’t pay her anything,” Babu said. Nimisha wasn’t even allowed to keep a cellphone. She somehow managed to contact Ajmal and narrated her plight to him. He, however allegedly asked for Rs 3 lakh to give back her passport. Finally, on July 25, 2021 when her employers were asleep, Nimisha jumped off the first-floor window of the house and ran to the Indian embassy in Abu Dhabi determined to come back to Bengaluru. The embassy team contacted the office of Shubham Singh, IFS, Protector of Emigrants, in Bengaluru and the process of repatriation began. After days of uncertainty, the 27-year-old landed here on an Air India flight. The Indian embassy issued her an emergency certificate for travel as she couldn’t retrieve her passport. Landing in Bengaluru, Nimisha turned emotional after meeting her brother who had arrived to pick her up. “I can’t believe I am back here. I just want to get back to my family and begin afresh,” she added tearfully. Beware of fraudsters promising jobs: Officer“Any Indian citizen seeking job abroad should approach only registered recruiting agents whose list is available on our portal emigrate.gov.in. Currently, there are only 35 such registered agents in Karnataka and people shouldn’t fall prey to fraudsters promising jobs,” said Singh. For issues related to overseas recruitment frauds or verifying authenticity of an agent, people can approach the Protector of Emigrants under the ministry of external affairs via 080-25711499/599 or poebengaluru@mea.gov.in and can get response in an hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ill-treated-woman-jumps-off-uae-bldg-reaches-kia/articleshow/85545029.cms||Petlee Peter

The country reported just over 2.2 lakh fresh cases in the week (August 16-22), down from 2,55,819 in the previous seven days. This was the first double-digit fall in weekly cases since the June 28-July 4 week, when the number had dipped by 11.4%. Meanwhile, on Sunday, fresh cases dipped to a 166-day low of just around 22,500. A day after Onam, Kerala posted 10,402 new cases - its lowest daily tally in more than a month since 9,931 infections were detected on July 19. During the August 16-22 week, Kerala was among other major Covid-hit states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Odisha to report a dip in the number of cases as compared to the previous seven days. However, with testing affected in Kerala due to festivities, the daily positivity rate in the state has climbed to over 16% in the past few days. Meanwhile, the northern states continued to report a very low number of new cases through the week.

---||Ahmedabad||In Gujarat, mafia turn beggars into lab rats for new drugs||AHMEDABAD: Beggars can't be choosers. And, when the drug mafia in Ahmedabad decide to conduct trials for their new synthetic drugs, this saying turns quite literal. An on-ground probe by has revealed that the drug mafia are targeting beggars to try their narcotic pills and powders to check its effect and efficacy. If the drug 'trial' succeeds, then it is introduced to other people through the black market for drugs. The mafia usually pick up beggars and homeless people from walled city areas as well as railway stations and bus terminuses. In many cases, the drugs put the beggars in a life-threatening situation. Salim Mohammed's home is the footpath outside Kalupur railway station. The 38-year-old begs for a living. His vice is smoking ganja but when another beggar who lives on the same footpath recently offered him a new drug, he decided to give it a try. Within minutes though, he began vomiting and bleeding from the nose. Mahesh Dantani, who lives on the footpath in Khamasa, was given some powder-like stuff to snort. The 25-year-old earns his livelihood by working as a labourer. When he doesn't have a job, he turns to begging. Some days ago, someone gave him a new drug which turned him violent. He banged his hands repeatedly on a wall so hard that he fractured his limbs. Similarly, Mehrunnisa Shaikh, 24, was given a tablet by two unidentified men who convinced her that it would save her from various diseases. "I consumed the tablet with water. The men then gave me some milk. After about 15 minutes, I began to feel giddy," she said. Raju Rohit, 24, and Rekha Kumari, 20, who live on the footpaths in Kalupur and Panjrapol areas respectively had similar experiences. Rohit was given a tablet which he crushed and snorted. He lost consciousness for two-three days. Rekha, who can't even speak her name properly, said some men constantly provided new drugs to her. "After taking them, I am unable to act, walk, or speak properly. When I do not get the drug, I slit my hand with blades," Rekha said, showing a blade in her hand. A crime branch officer said that they have come to know of such a modus operandi by drug mafia but are yet to file a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-gujarat-mafia-turn-beggars-into-lab-rats-for-new-drugs/articleshow/85549749.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Guwahati||‘Accused a state asset, is talented’: Gauhati high court bail for student in IIT rape case||(By Robikuz Zaman) GUWAHATI: The Gauhati high court, while holding that there is a prima facie case against the accused in the IIT, Guwahati rape case, has granted him bail on the ground that the accused being a talented student is the state’s future asset. The police on April 3 had arrested a 21-year-old student for allegedly “sexually assaulting” a female student of the institute on March 28. He was subsequently “suspended” by the IIT authorities. The bench of Justice Ajit Borthakur after hearing the counsels for both sides — with reference to the FIR, medical report and statements under Sections 161 and 164 CrPC, the contents of the charge-sheet, the fact finding committee report — said there was a clear prima facie case as alleged against the accused. “However, as the investigation in the case is complete and both the informant/victim girl and the accused are the state’s future assets being talented students pursuing technical courses at the IIT, Guwahati, who are young in the age group of 19 to 21 years only and they hailed from two different states, continuation of detention of the accused in the interest of trial of the case, if charges are framed, may not be necessary,” the court in its August 13 order said. Appearing on behalf of the victim girl, advocate Sumitra Sarma and additional public prosecuter D Das, vehemently opposed granting of bail to the accused in such a serious offence. Sarma cited the ratio of the judgments relating to the factors to be considered while granting bail rendered by the Supreme Court. The accused have been charged for the offence under Section 376 (rape)/328(causing hurt by means of poison)/307(attempt to murder)/120B(criminal conspiracy) of IPC. However, the court found that there is “no possibility of the accused tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses directly or indirectly, if released on bail”. “It is judicially well settled that while dealing with a bail application, the court is not called upon to discuss the merits or demerits of the evidence available against the accused, but some reasons for prima facie concluding while bail is being granted need to be indicated in brief,” the order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/gauhati-hc-grants-bail-to-accused-in-iit-rape-case/articleshow/85549880.cms||---

While the six-day public outreach rally by BJP witnessed mega celebrations in Aurangabad on Friday and Saturday, city police have registered offences against local office-bearers of the saffron party along with some party workers and president of the local unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA) for flouting Covid norms. Kranti Chowk, Cantonment, Vedant Nagar, Jawahar Nagar, Vedant Nagar, City Chowk and Mukundwadi have registered separate offences in connection with the rally under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) among other charges, an official release by city police said. Three police stations — City Chowk, Satara and Mukunwadi — have also invoked section 51 (B) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, that prescribes “punishment for obstruction” for refusal to comply with any direction given by or on behalf of the central or state government or the National Executive Committee or the State Executive Committee or the district authority. As per section 51 (B), any violation shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term that may extend to one year or with a fine or both upon conviction. When contacted, BJP city president Sanjay Kenekar said Covid-appropriate behaviour was followed during the yatra. “The state government has put pressure on law enforcement agencies for registering offences against our rally. Needless to say, the ruling party leaders have also been holding different political events, but get away with police action,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jan-aashirwad-yatra-over-60-booked-for-violation-of-covid-norms/articleshow/85540895.cms||---

The state government filed the affidavit in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition moved by former IPS officer V V Lakshminarayana challenging the Union government decision to privatise the steel plant. In its affidavit, the state government said Visakhapatnam Steel Plant was established after the sacrifices of the people and in which 32 lives were lost. Though the Union government has taken a decision as part of its disinvestment policy, it ought to have considered viable alternatives in the case of RINL, to put it back on the path of profit. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote to the Union government and to the Prime Minister, outlining various alternatives to increase the profitability of RINL. It was stated that by allocating captive mines and completing recent expansion plans to increase productivity, RINL could become a profitable venture. The state government also observed that the Union government was silent in exploring the alternatives before giving an in-principle approval for 100% divestment of RINL as part of its strategic privatisation of non-core sectors. It was further mentioned that notional losses RINL posted in the last few years was because of slowdown in the steel cycle and capital expenditure on expansion plans. As the steel cycle is once again back on track and capacity expansion is almost complete, the RINL is all set to post profits. With the allocation of captive mines, raw material costs will reduce considerably, further increasing profit margins. The state government said by considering alternatives to put RINL back on the growth path, the asset can be continued as a public sector undertaking that will create more wealth, instead of opting for privatisation.

Responding to a media query, Nitish said the demand for caste census was an important issue. “We have been demanding it since long,” he added. Nitish would lead an 11-member delegation of 10 political parties from Bihar and meet the PM in New Delhi on Monday to press for caste-based census in the country. The meeting will be held at 11am. Asked if the demand for caste census would be met during his meeting with the PM, Nitish said, “Let us see.” “If our demand is accepted, nothing could be better than that. It is not that only the people of Bihar are asking for the caste-based census. The people in the entire country are in favour of it. Leaders of all political parties from Bihar will together meet the PM and put forward the demand,” Nitish said. The CM and some other members of the delegation reached Delhi on Sunday evening. Leader of opposition in Bihar assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who will represent RJD in the delegation, is already in Delhi. The long-pending demand for holding caste census was revived in July this year after the Union government informed the Lok Sabha that it would not enumerate population caste-wise, except those from the SCs and STs. Earlier, the state governments of Maharashtra and Odisha too had requested the Centre to collect caste details in the forthcoming census. Reacting to the Centre’s reply in the Lok Sabha, Nitish had urged the Centre on July 24 to reconsider its decision. The Bihar assembly had unanimously passed a resolution on February 18, 2019 and again on February 27, 2020; demanding caste-wise enumeration of population. Nitish had said both the resolutions were sent to the Centre and it was requested to hold caste-wise enumeration of population during the Census-2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/caste-census-should-be-held-at-least-once-nitish/articleshow/85543052.cms||Madan Kumar

The main road was closed to facilitate the work a year ago and now the locals are using alternative routes to reach their destinations. Madhuranagar has become a prime area in the city after the completion of the flyover bridge connecting it with Devi Nagar and Ajith Singh Nagar areas. Population in the area crossed 1.5 lakh mark and traffic problems worsened due to the presence of railway level crossing. Huge traffic snarls and congestion at the level crossing have even forced the locals to stage agitations demanding the RUB. Railway authorities started work on the project and completed their part during the lockdown in May last year. The state government sanctioned around Rs 17.5 crore for the RUB project as a part of city development and started work in August 2020. “How many years will the government take to complete this RUB? We are forced to take a diversion and travel an extra 5 km to reach a place that is just 200 metres away from my home. Project work has stopped completely and the VMC should focus on it,” M Satyam, a local, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/delay-in-rail-underbridge-project-irks-residents/articleshow/85542580.cms||Venu Lanka

With continuous rains and inundation of residential colonies, the mosquito menace is thriving across Vijayawada and in rural parts of the district, causing cases of malaria, dengue and viral fever. The Krishna district administration is on its guard as rural areas report an increasing number of fever cases. Officials have ramped up Covid-19 testing facilities and taken measures for early identification and tracing of cases. With a majority of fever cases registered in the district testing negative for Covid-19, health officials are focusing on malaria and dengue tests. The fever survey is helping officials identify cases early and start treatment. District collector J Nivas directed officials to take up such surveys every week and identify patients with cough, cold and symptoms of fever. “Early detection of fever cases will help prevent fatalities. Our teams are closely monitoring the situation. Fogging and anti-larval activity will be intensified at municipalities and panchayats will focus on sanitation,” the collector said.  The malaria department of the Vijayawada Municipa Corporation (VMC) is focusing on slums and colonies adjacent to canals. Fogging under culverts and spraying of insecticide is being carried out across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/viral-cases-rise-but-most-test-covid-ve/articleshow/85543467.cms||Venu Lanka

With Covid-19 restrictions being relaxed, the brush with reality where ‘marriages are made in the wilderness’ is unfolding yet again in the African landscape for couples and wedding planners.

There are a lot of couples today who want to have their weddings in the wild, away from the hustle and bustle of the cities,” said Hirani who hails from Kutch and has settled in Kenya for a long time now. He said that the wedding halls have been shut down by the government due to Covid-19 hence there is a renewed in interest in Maasai Marai which is one of the most renowned and visited nature reserves in Kenya. Currently, 150 guests are allowed for participating in marriages, he added. Nitin Maldev, former chairman of Hindu Council of Kenya said many of his friends and relatives have booked resorts at Maasai Mara recently for marriages. The weddings are held for a five-day long period, he said. The guest list includes visitors from US, Canada, New Zealand, UK and Gujarat. Apart from Maasai Mara, Mombasa which is on the seaside and Lake Nakuru are other preferred wedding destinations in Kenya. Laxmiben Vekariya, another Gujarati who has been a wedding planner for over 15 years in Kenya said many resorts are located close to waterholes where wild animals can be spotted from a safe distance from the confines of indoors. “Watching zebras from the glass walls of resorts is a sheer delight,” she said. Another attraction is having a wedding destination where one can watch whales splash in the deep blue seas at Mombasa. Kapil Joshi, a professional photographer, who hails from Kutch says he has attended two weddings at Mombasa as part of his work. “Be it underwater or seashore, Mombasa is a visual marvel,” said Joshi.

The department in a public notice on July 9 called for comments and suggestions to reach it by August 2 on the draft policy. Goacan stated that the daft policy is only available in English making it difficult for consumers who are used to reading in vernacular languages and asked that the translated version be uploaded on the Goa government website. Goacan has asked for an extension of time of 30 days from the date when the translated draft policy is uploaded on the official website of the Goa government. The contents of the document are important if consumers in Goa are to start using electric vehicles as they need to change their mindset and understand the benefits of environmentally friendly technology and financial benefits from such a policy being implemented in Goa. “The draft Goa Electric Mobility Promotion Policy-2021 is a very important document that requires it to be made available to the elected representatives from the Goa Legislative Assembly, Zilla Panchayats, municipal councils and village panchayats.

The district administration made available colourful threads, rakhis, packets of sweets, balloon and readymade garments to let the people enjoy Rakshabandhan with homely feeling. With great enthusiasm, girls and women put ‘tilak’ on the foreheads of their brothers, tied rakhis around their wrists and shared sweets. At Barh, Bakhtiarpur and Patna Law College Ghat relief camps, large number of children were seen queueing up for getting rakhi on their wrists while the elders were busy in capturing the memories. A nine-year old girl staying at the Bihar Vidyapeeth relief camp tied rakhi to the wrist of Patna DM Dr Chandrasekhar Singh, while others did with other officials like SDO and circle officer. About 6,500 flood-affected people are staying in 17 flood relief camps in Patna. The DM said festivals have their own importance in people’s lives and Rakshabandhan is one which symbolises the great bond of affection between brothers and sisters. “Readymade garments and toys are being provided to children in these relief camps to lessen their stress and erase memories of the devastating floods which washed away their belongings,” the DM added. Danapur SDO Vinod Duhan, who was at Baldeva High School relief camp, said the people’s mood was celebratory and they appreciated district administration for arranging Rakshabandhan far from their homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/brother-sister-bonding-at-flood-relief-camps/articleshow/85543161.cms||VK Tripathi

He hoped that all sisters and brothers would continue to honour the bondage. Earlier, he took a swipe on his uncle and Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras for ignoring the people of his constituency during floods and sitting in Delhi. “The people have been left to fend for themselves in the constituency,” he alleged. A day earlier, the Jamui MP organized a road show at Hajipur in Vaishali district to gauge the mood of his supporters in the constituency, which was earlier represented by his father and former union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan. A die hard supporter of Chirag said, “He is trying to strengthen the party's support base in the constituency, which was earlier held by his father late Ram Vilas Paswan. His uncle was fielded from Hajipur by senior Paswan.” Earlier, LJP's Paras faction's spokesperson Shravan Kumar Agrawal said that Paras, who is a union minister for food processing industries, would visit Hajipur on August 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-accuses-paras-of-ignoring-flood-hit-people/articleshow/85543435.cms||Ramashankar
---||Vijayawada||Female infanticides rise again across Andhra Pradesh||VIJAYAWADA: In the last four months, at least five separate instances of parents killing their girl child across the state once again brings forth horrific memories of Andhra Pradesh’s notorious past of having the highest number of female infanticides in the country. These five incidents were reported from East Godavari, Vizianagaram, Vijayawada, Tirupati and West Godavari districts. According to cops, in all the five incidents, the parents’ preference for boys led to the killings. Five days ago, a woman killed her 14-day-old baby girl by tossing her into a water sump near a private hospital at Eluru in West Godavari district. Police arrested the mother, Mahalakshmi, who confessed to the killing citing that she was disappointed at having given birth to a girl child. On July 10, a daily wager driven by preference for a male child allegedly banged the heads of his two daughters, aged four and two years, against a wall at their house in Jodimamidivalasa area in Vizianagaram district. While the four-year-old, K Siri, managed to survive, the two-year-old, Pavani, died. On June 1, a woman killed her three-year-old ailing daughter at PM Palem police limits in Tirupati. Apart from this, killings of children as a part of spousal revenge too have seen their fair share of cases as domestic violence spiked during the lockdown. Since 2020, based on reported cases, around 16 children have died due to filicides—eight of them girl children. Speaking to TOI, K Kumari, a women’s rights activist in the state, points out that many such instances that go unreported as infanticides, are conducted with the consensus of the family members, with no witnesses or complainants to initiate a police case. “The full extent can be found after the 2021 census in the state. Despite awareness, women children are still not preferred in the state and not surprisingly, AP also stands amongst the top in child marriages,” K Kumari told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/female-infanticides-rise-again-across-ap/articleshow/85542535.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

He tells B K Mishra in an interview that the university will soon be shifted to its own campus at Nalanda. Excerpts: Open universities have their own limitations in imparting education to the learners. How do you propose to overcome the constraints and make it a vibrant university? As the open universities have to cater to the academic needs of distance learners, they must have a student-friendly approach. I would ensure timely printing and distribution of study materials to the students. For some reasons, NOU has not been distributing the study materials on time, causing dissatisfaction among the students. Study centres located both in urban and rural localities will be strengthened in such a manner that any leaner need not visit the university headquarters for redressal of his/her grievance. The number of students seeking admission to different courses in this university has declined from 1.25 lakh to just about 20,000 in recent years. How would you improve the enrolment figures? This sharp decline in student enrolment clearly indicates that all is not well with this university. I will soon find out the reasons and try to plug the loopholes by taking corrective measures. Increasing student enrolment is also crucial for enhancing the state’s gross enrolment ratio. It would be ensured that the students get quality study materials and proper guidance from the university. A separate cell with competent staff would be set up at the university headquarters to answer the students’ queries. The university has been functioning from rented buildings at Patna right since its inception obstructing its desired expansion. When would it be shifted to its proposed campus at Nalanda? The construction of university’s building on the land allotted at Nalanda is nearing completion. Hopefully, the entire university will start functioning from its Nalanda campus next year. How would you streamline the functioning of the university office with only a few regular staff? Steps will be taken to regularise the services of all the officers and staff of the university as per government rules. I have come to know that some posts of full-time teachers and staff have been sanctioned to the university recently. Necessary steps would be taken to make appointment against all these posts. Steps would also be initiated for receiving the annual budgetary grants from the state government for its better functioning. How do you propose to raise the academic standard of this university, one of the oldest open universities in the country? The university would have to meet the guidelines set by the UGC and other regulatory bodies of the country if its academic standard were to be raised. Necessary steps will be initiated for getting it assessed and accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) at the earliest so that its courses might not be derecognised by the Distance Education Bureau. Then, semester system and choice-based credit system will also be introduced in all the academic programmes of the university without further delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nou-to-shift-to-its-permanent-campus-in-nalanda-next-year/articleshow/85542352.cms||---

But despite the special drives, the illegal encroachments are still seen in the city,” said HUDA estate officer Mamta Sharma, the brainchild behind making officials sign on the dotted line. Sharma divided the city into four parts and told the JEs were to submit a certificate signed by them assuring no illegal encroachments. “The JEs will have to answer if any encroachment is found in their area during checking,” said Sharma. Sharma said JE Vinod Kumar has taken the responsibility of sectors 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28, JE Naveen Kumar of sectors 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20 and 21, JE Amit Kumar of sectors 5, 6, 7, 8 and 19, Mansa Devi Complex sectors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and JE Darshan Lal of sectors 1, 1-A, 2, 3, 4, 12, 12-A, 31 and 32. On the other hand, the municipal corporation (MC) is carrying out anti-encroachment drives through its teams formed in the district. Residents alleged the rehriwallahs were back in business, demanding a permanent solution to the problem. “The MC and HUDA officials must take rounds time and again so that they do not come back to the spot. Clicking photos of the anti-encroachment drive and producing it before officials or ministers will not end the problem,” said resident welfare association members. Will making officials liable after making them sign forms work?

The Hasanpur MLA quoted a few lines from Hindi poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar’s composition ‘Rashmirathi’ on his Twitter account to indicate that he is in no mood to budge this time. He tweeted, “Do nyay agar to aadha do, par ismei bhi yadi badha ho, to dedo kewal paanch gram, rakho apni dharti tamam.”   In fact, Tej is unhappy with the recent developments in the RJD. Tej’s supporter Akash Yadav was removed from the post of the state president of Chhatra Janata Dal by RJD state president Jagadanand Singh after he (Tej) compared the latter with Hitler and demanded action against him. The comparison was made at a meeting of the Chhatra RJD earlier this month. Tej, who considers his younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as Arjuna and himself as Krishna, had on Saturday described Tejashwi’s political adviser Sanjay Yadav as Duryodhana and Jagadanand as Sishupal, characters in the epic Mahabharata. “Just like Krishna was abused by Sishupal in Mahabharata, I am being insulted by Jagadanand,” he pointed out. Meanwhile, the ruling NDA leaders took a dig at shadow boxing between two brothers for power. BJP Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi tweeted, “In this internal fight, who will become Dara Shikoh and who will rule like Aurangazeb, only time will tell.” A senior RJD leader, however, said Lalu would find out a solution for the ongoing power tussle between the two siblings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/angry-tej-pratap-ups-the-ante-again/articleshow/85543283.cms||Ramashankar

The Covid-19 pandemic notwithstanding, most sisters visited their brothers and tied them colourful rakhis and wished for their lifelong protection from evil forces. The brothers, in return, showered varieties of gifts upon their sisters. Long queues were seen at makeshift rakhi stalls and sweetshops in all the localities of the city. Many sisters had, however, ordered designer rakhis with sweets online in advance. Magadh Mahila College student Pragya said, “I bought special rakhis for my brothers and tried to make the occasion special as it comes once in a year.” Despite ban on public entry at religious places due to Covid, a large number of people visited small temples in their respective localities and offered prayers. Boring Road resident Suhashini Singh recalled the time when rakhis were simply made of colourful threads. “Now-a-days they are getting inspired by the latest jewellery trends which make them relevant even after the occasion,” said said. There are countless options to choose from such as ‘rudraksha’ rakhi, ‘quirky’ rakhi, silk thread rakhi, ‘chandan’ rakhi, metal rakhi, stone rakhi, ‘swastik’ rakhi, ‘mauli’ rakhi, personalised rakhi, diamond rakhi, peacock rakhi, silver rakhi, ‘kundan’ rakhi, pearl rakhi, designer rakhi, said Lakhan, a rakhi seller of Kadamkuan locality. Another seller at Nala Road crossing Narendra has an exclusive collection of rakhis for kids ranging from Rs 25 and goes up to Rs 350. “The bracelet rakhis are designed with cartoon heroes like angry bird, pokemon, chota bheem, ben10 and many more,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rakshabandhan-celebrated-with-enthusiasm/articleshow/85543095.cms||B K Mishra

As a result, illegal sand mining continues unabated in the state, senior IPS officers said. Illegal sand mining, especially from the Sone river, has been hitting headlines since last two months as government first removed at least 60 officers from field posting and then suspended 35 of them, including IPS officers Sudheer Kumar Porika and Rakesh Kumar Dubey, for their alleged nexus with sand smugglers. A senior IPS officer said illegal sand mining in Bihar or any other state is a deep-rooted nexus in which all stakeholders, including police, government officers and those in power corridors, are minting money. The officer said special powerful boats of iron and steel are manufactured in several places in Saran, Bhojpur and other districts for use in sand mining from riverbeds, which is prohibited as per National Green Tribunal. “One boat costs around Rs 20 lakh,” he added. Another senior officer said Sone yields coarse yellow sand, which is costly and used in construction. “In rest of the state, rivers mostly yield white sand useful for filling. They are of no value. That’s why illegal mining takes place only from Sone,” he said. The officer said firms having licences mine large strips near ghats against small spots for which they are authorised. “They show mining of 50 trucks, but in reality they mine 150 trucks of sand. Weighing stations with mines department officers and police should be installed on those roads which connect main roads to mining ghats,” he said. Dinesh Kumar Mishra, an IIT-Kharagpur alumni and a noted structural engineer who has been working at grassroots level for countering floods for several decades, said illegal sand mining is destroying water cycle and groundwater table. “The sand on riverbed acts as a cushion. It retains water even in dry season. Even monkeys have this knowledge. I have seen monkeys in Palamu during 1993 famine digging riverbed and drinking water,” he said. Misha said illegal sand mining has picked up in last several years and it’s now an established market and sand from Bihar is sent to other states too. Environmentalist Dr Gopal Krishna said aquifers and surface water are getting destroyed due to sand mining. “Villages around such areas will become ghostly places in our lifetime due to non-availability of water,” he added. Mines and geology department minister Janak Ram, however, said government’s crackdown has put a brake illegal sand mining in the state. He said sand mining remains prohibited from July to September. “Those involved in such illegal activities are in panic. They are hiding here and there,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/curbing-illegal-sand-mining-a-daunting-task-for-bihar-cops/articleshow/85542275.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The woman, identified as Sureddy Divya (32), had lost her husband to Covid-19 recently, and was living with her in-laws. According to D Kasi Viswanath, inspector in-charge of Patamata, Divya had disputes with her in-laws over the sharing of property after her husband’s death. She had asked for her share of her husband’s property to secure the future of her children, but her in-laws were reluctant to part with it and had allegedly been harassing her to leave their house. Depressed with her husband’s death and the disputes, Divya decided to commit suicide, and also end the lives of her children, Bhargav (7) and Rohith (5). She came to know about sodium azide, a highly toxic chemical used as a preservative in medical laboratories and as a component in pesticides. After finding out that sodium azide can be ordered online, she purchased the chemical. On Saturday night after dinner, she consumed two grams after mixing it in water and fed her children 0.5 grams each. After consuming the chemical, Divya fell sick with symptoms of nausea. Frightened, she informed her sister about her and the children’s condition. They were rushed to hospital where they are undergoing treatment. Kasi Viswanath said their condition is said to be stable, but doctors have said they should be in observation for at least 36 to 48 hours as the chemical affects the central nervous system. A case has been registered against Divya’s in-laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/woman-kids-consume-poison-in-suicide-bid/articleshow/85543380.cms||---

The sudden jump in purchase price has brought relief to salt cultivators across the coast. Sources said the damage of large quantities of salt fields along the Tamil Nadu coast due to adverse weather in the last two to three months has resulted in a sudden demand for stock produced in the AP coast. Sources said salt prices at the field have seen an almost 100% increase with traders offering nearly Rs 200 per quintal against Rs 100 per quintal offered during last season. Traders are ready to offer even Rs 300 per quintal for the old stock, which has low levels of moisture content. Several farmers in Prakasam and Nellore districts stored large stocks in local godowns during the last season as prices offered by traders were not remunerative. “Those who stored the stocks have hit the jackpot as exporters are not hesitating to offer over Rs 300 per quintal. This will help salt farmers to clear their old debts and make decent profits,” said Ch Chalamaiah, a salt cultivator of China Ganjam area in Prakasam district. Salt is cultivated on about 20,000 acres in Prakasam and Nellore district. Although, AP has a long coastline, it lags behind other states, such as Gujarat, in salt cultivation. “Poor demand for the local stock and increase in labour costs are discouraging farmers. Many have left the field in the past few years due to poor demand,” said a farmer, K Venkateswarlu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/salt-farmers-in-prakasam-nellore-jubilant-as-prices-see-100-jump/articleshow/85543427.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vadodara||Young bridge Vishwamitri with people||Vadodara: Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s attempt at ‘cleaning’ the Vishwamitri river had sparked a furore among the environmentalists and activists, yet the civic body went ahead with its drive. The work has stopped now after the civic body received a rap from the National Green Tribunal. Now, the young generation of the Banyan City has come forward to raise awareness among Barodians about the river, its ecology and to reconnect them with it. The group under the banner of ‘Voices of Vishwamitri’ has started nature walks and talk series to make people understand that the river is not just flowing water that they see and pass by daily, but a living water body that also consists of a thriving population of crocodiles, insects, birds, vegetation and several other living beings. “Several initiatives are being run to save the Vishwamitri but none of them had participation of the younger generation. Also, the youth of the city do not know much about the river. So, we started this initiative where we call experts for talks in an attempt to pass on the knowledge to the young generation so that they can connect with the river,” said Rutvik Tank, an urban planner. “Earlier people used to go to the river to fetch water for their daily purposes, but as every house now has taps, people have forgotten the importance of the river and have been disconnected from it,” he added. Apart from nature walks along the river, the group has so far organized two talk sessions — one on hydro-geological features of Vishwamitri and other on its cultural history and historical structures located around the river. “Once a person understands the importance of the river, they can then contribute by continuing to spread the awareness among more people. We are focusing on Vishwamitri but on a larger scale, this is applicable to all urban rivers,” said Zameen, another group member. The group consisting of civil engineers, biologists, artists and architects are planning to organize more talks on pollution, wildlife, botany, water system, law, planning, mythology among other themes along with cultural and art sessions. Tank told TOI that at every session, the number of participants has been swelling. “There is curiosity among people and they now feel that something should be done at a bigger policy level,” Tank said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/young-bridge-vishwamitri-with-people/articleshow/85543481.cms||Jay Pachchigar

---||Ahmedabad||Mafia turn beggars into lab rats for new drug trials in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Beggars can’t be choosers. And, when the drug mafia in the city decides to trial their new synthetic drugs, this saying turns quite literal. An on-ground investigation by TOI has revealed that the drug mafia are targeting beggars to try their narcotic pills and powders to check its effect and efficacy. If the drug ‘trial’ succeeds, then it is introduced to other people through the black market for drugs. And, if it doesn’t, no one is the wiser about the beggars, who are already a faceless entity -- their presence registering only when you hear their whining voice or their grimy hand on your sleeve. The mafia usually picks up beggars and homeless people from the walled city areas as well as railway stations and bus terminuses. In many cases, the drugs put the beggars in a life-threatening situation. Salim Mohammed’s home is the footpath outside Kalupur railway station. The 38-year-old begs for a living. His vice is smoking ganja but when another beggar who lives on the same footpath recently offered him a new drug, he decided to give it a try. Within minutes though, he began vomiting and bleeding from the nose. A witness, refusing to be named, said, “Another beggar called Raja, a 40-year-old with whom Mohammed used to smoke ganja, gave him a tablet. This happened in the first week of August. Raja said that the tablet would give them a pleasant feeling. “Mohammed took the tablet. Within half an hour, he began vomiting. Soon, he began bleeding from the nose, too. This continued for two days. Then, an unidentified man came and inquired about him. He took Mohammed to a doctor who gave him some medication. Mohammed’s condition improved after that.” Mahesh Dantani, who lives on the footpath in Khamasa, was given some powder-like stuff to snort. The 25-year-old earns his livelihood by working as a daily wage labourer. When he gets no job, he turns to begging. Some days ago, someone gave him a new drug which turned him violent. He banged his hands repeatedly on a wall so hard that he fractured both his limbs. Similarly, Mehrunnisa Shaikh, 24, who lives near Sarangpur bridge with her five-month-old daughter was given a tablet by two unidentified men who convinced her that it would save her from various diseases. “I consumed the tablet with water. The men then gave us some milk which my daughter and I consumed. After 15 minutes, I began feeling giddy. It felt as if the Sarangpur bridge was going to fall on me. I stayed in that state of delirium for around a day,” she said. “When I gained consciousness around one and a half days later, I found my baby’s health condition had deteriorated since I had not fed her properly,” she added. Raju Rohit, 24, and Rekha Kumari, 20, who live on the footpaths in Kalupur and Panjrapol areas respectively also had similar experiences. Rohit was given a tablet which he crushed and snorted. He lost consciousness for 2-3 days. Rekha, who cannot even speak her name properly, said that various men constantly provided new drugs for her to consume and snort. “After taking these narcotics, I am unable to act, walk, or speak properly. When I do not get the drug, I slit my hand with blades,” she said, showing a blade in her hand. A crime branch officer said that they have come to know of such a modus operandi by drug mafias but are yet to file a complaint regarding such incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mafia-turn-beggars-into-lab-rats-for-new-drug-trials-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/85545396.cms||Ashish Chauhan

In a tweet on Sunday Manjhi said, “India needs ST judges in the apex court. However, the collegium system is working as a deterrent for them. I request the President to give due representation to them in the apex court.” The former CM, however, expressed happiness over ST people becoming governors, CMs, top officers, doctors and engineers. “It’s a matter of delight that they have acquired top positions in other fields,” he added. Manjhi himself comes from the Musahar community, which is the most backward among the Mahadalit caste in the state. Manjhi's demand came barely a few days after the collegium recommended names of nine people for their appointment as judges in the apex court. Among them eight are judges chief justices of high courts and one is a senior advocate. Three of them are women judges—Justices Hema Kohli, BVNagarathna and Bela Trivedi. “The recommendation has been made to fill the vacancies of judges in the SC,” a Patna high court lawyer Rajiv Ranjan Kumar Pandey said. He, however, said all eyes will be on how long the Centre takes in clearing the names. The collegium has sent its recommendation on August 17. The Centre was earlier not in favour of appointment of judges through the collegium system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-seeks-representation-of-st-judges-in-sc/articleshow/85543384.cms||Ramashankar

HDFC Bank will make available to its merchant customers Paytm’s range of Android PoS (point-of-sale) devices. Through the partnership, HDFC Bank’s salespersons will start selling Paytm’s payment solutions in the market. HDFC Bank will be the payment partner, while Paytm will be the distribution and software partner. The partners will jointly offer merchants a combined package including a payment gateway and PoS machines in the first leg of the tie-up. Going forward they will also enable credit products including Paytm Postpaid (buy-now pay-later - BNPL) solution, Eazy EMI and Flexi Pay. IPO-bound Paytm is looking to consolidate its position in the merchant acquiring space, where it extends services beyond what is provided by banks. According to Paytm Lending CEO Bhavesh Gupta, the partnership will strengthen the financial services ecosystem by bringing together Paytm’s technology & digital solutions and HDFC Bank’s retail and credit prowess. “Through this partnership, we will also be jointly delivering enhanced SmartHub solutions to the market. We believe that this is the start of a great partnership and the cumulative strength of both HDFC Bank and Paytm will help us strengthen our respective leadership positions,” said Parag Rao, group head, payments, Consumer Finance, Digital Banking & IT, HDFC Bank, said. SmartHub is the bank’s payment system designed with a mobile-first approach.

Paytm also provides point-of-sale devices to merchants and technology-enabled credit solutions like BNPL. The partnership will leverage HDFC Bank’s network, products and credit appraisal capabilities and Patym’s technological platform to push payments in semi-urban and rural India and bring more people into formal banking channels. HDFC Bank has issued over five crore cards and has 20 lakh merchant acceptance points. This has helped the bank get a 48% market share on merchant acquiring volume. Despite facing an eight-month embargo on issuing new cards, which was lifted last week, the bank remains the number one credit card issuer in the country with a spend share of over 27%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-paytm-team-up-for-digital-payments/articleshow/85548436.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The ITAT has held denial of the lower rate of tax according to the India-US treaty, in the hands of a US tax resident, on his India source income was “absolutely misconceived and in fact misplaced,” merely because a TRC from the US authorities was not furnished to the I-T officer during the course of assessment, but was produced at a later stage before the Commissioner (Appeals). Non-residents are generally subject to tax in India, only in respect of their India source income — say bank interest, interest on fixed deposits, rent from property in India, dividends from investments in India. The taxpayer can opt to be governed by the Indian Income-tax Act or the tax treaty, whichever is more beneficial. In this case, which was heard by the ITAT, in FY14, Haresh C Seth, a non-resident, had earned bank interest and interest on fixed deposits aggregating to Rs 17.9 lakh. However, the I-T officer declined to apply the lower rate of tax of 10% and 15% available under the India-US tax treaty. The commissioner (Appeals) also upheld this course of action, as he concluded that Seth had failed to file the TRC and Form 10F (which provides overseas tax residency details) with the I-T officer during the course of assessment. The ITAT took into consideration the genuine challenges such as the very short time period that was provided for furnishing the TRC to the I-T officer. Puneet Gupta, director, people advisory services, at EY-India, said, “The ITAT decision reinforces that while the TRC is a prerequisite for claiming the concessional rates of tax under the relevant tax treaty, non-furnishing of this certificate at the time of filing of the I-T return in India, does not deprive the taxpayer of obtaining the beneficial tax-treaty rate during assessment or appeal proceedings.” Differences between the tax year in India and the other country, sometimes creates practical difficulties in furnishing the TRC or other details at the time of filing the I-T return in India. This decision will be of great help in genuine cases, said tax experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/itat-upholds-tax-treaty-relief-on-delayed-trc/articleshow/85548486.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The drive has been launched with the help of Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the local administration. According to Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Prabhat Kumar, the Patna-Gaya (PG) section has illegal crossings over railway tracks at several places, which result in mishaps. “In fact, people of two villages living on each side of the railway tracks have constructed ‘crossovers’ illegally. Such crossovers on tracks are being used as pathway to negotiate their vehicles in utter violation of safety measures,” he said. Railways is now counselling villagers with the help of village ‘pramukh ‘and ‘mukhiya ‘ not to indulge into such illegal activities and remove the illegal cross overs located on different locations on the PG section of the Danapur division, the DRM said . According to sources, railways had earlier carried out a survey and identified 14 such illegal crossovers in Jehanabad district, followed by Patna district (13), Gaya (21), Nawada (20 ) and Seikhpura district (02). With the help of RPF, railways has already removed several illegally built crossovers while efforts are on to remove all of them, sources said. Meanwhile, railways has so far given appointment letters to 82 family members of the railway employees on compassionate grounds following their death due to coronavirus in its second wave. A total of 135 such cases were received in the five divisions of the ECR, said ECR chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar. Kumar said with six more goods sheds made functional, the ECR now has 110 goods sheds. Seven goods sheds have been functioning 24x7 to cater to the needs of businessmen of the state, he said, adding railways has also made two escalators functional at Darbhanga and one at Gaya Junction this year. Besides, railways has installed Wi-Fi at 13 more stations in the ECR while the number of computerized passenger reservation system (PRS) and unreserved ticketing system (UTS) counters has gone up to 123 and 80 respectively, Kumar said, adding railways has earned a record Rs240 crore revenue from scrap disposal in the current 2021-22 fiscal so far, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/railways-removing-illegal-crossings-in-danapur-division/articleshow/85542769.cms||Kumod Verma

While the public want a swimming pool at the park as planned, local elected representatives are promoting a yoga centre. The park on Narayana Shastry Road once housed Bahusar swimming pool, which was a landmark in the city for over five decades. It was demolished after Mysuru City Corporation took over it and had proposed to construct a hi-tech swimming pool and commercial complex at a cost of Rs 11 crore. But the project did not take off. Meanwhile, the swimming pool in Saraswathipuram which is managed by University of Mysore, had started to overcrowd. During summers, pool authorities were forced to make nine batches per day, including a general batch and for professionals, to allow around 2,000 persons who came to practice swimming. To reduce the burden at Saraswathipuram, work on a pool at Chamundi Vihar Stadium and at Pandit Puttaraja Gavayi Sports Complex in JP Nagar was taken up. But as both the pools are not in the city's heart, people continued to depend on the pool at Saraswathipuram. Swimmer Srikanth from Agrahara said yoga can be practiced anywhere in open places, but as there is a dearth for swimming pools in the city. “We need a pool which is close to our place and MCC should construct a swimming pool at the park,” he said. International swimming coach S Sundaresh told TOI that seven years ago, authorities had planned to build a centre of excellence with a 25-metre-long swimming pool at the park under PPP model. “But the project did not start. Professional swimmers submitted several memorandums to authorities over the years. We hope the authorities hear our plea,” he said. Reacting on the issue, Mysuru acting mayor Anwar Baig said MCC is chalking out a plan to construct a yoga centre inside the park. “I will discuss with the local MLA on constructing a swimming pool for the benefit of people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/want-swimming-pool-not-yoga-centre-at-freedom-fighters-park-swimmers/articleshow/85541954.cms||---

It is normal for monsoon season. Only light and scattered rainfall is occurring in Nepal,” a WRD official said. “According to the revised IMD forecast, moderate to heavy rainfall would occur only in a few districts in the state,” the WRD official said. Meanwhile, the Ganga was flowing below the danger level at Digha and Gandhi Ghat in Patna and also at Munger on Sunday. However, it was flowing 63cm above the danger mark at Hathidah, 30cm at Bhagalpur, 1.20 metres at Kahalgaon, and 1.54 metres at Farakka. Reports from flood-hit Amdabad and Manihari blocks of south Katihar district on the north of the river said the floodwaters have slowly started receding. The water level in the Mahananda river was also falling. Meanwhile, WRD minister Sanjay Kumar Jha on Sunday visited Darbhanga and inspected the soil erosion being caused by the Bagmati river in the Ratnopatti locality of the town. He said a technical team would assess the situation after the floodwaters recede, following which the work on preventing the soil erosion in the Ratnopatti locality of Darbhanga town will also be undertaken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ganga-continues-to-show-receding-trend-in-state/articleshow/85543220.cms||Abhay Singh

Speaking on the occasion, Nitish said he has been observing Rakshabandhan as ‘Vriksh Raksha Diwas’ since 2012 to protect trees in order to increase the state’s green cover. “Just like people save each other and brothers protect sisters, we all should protect trees to protect the environment,” he said. The CM further called upon people to plant saplings and save them to conserve environment. “Today, planting saplings and saving them is very necessary to minimize the harmful effects of climate change,” Nitish said. The CM also said that the state government this year has fixed a target of planting at least 5 crore saplings under the Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Abhiyan. “The state government has also fixed a target of increasing the state’s green cover to 17% from the existing 15%. We are making all efforts to increase the green cover,” he said. Nitish further said necessary steps were being taken to develop eco-tourism in the state. “For this, an eco-tourism wing will be created in the tourism department. The government is also drafting an eco-tourism policy,” he said. State’s education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, building construction minister Ashok Choudhary, principal chief conservator of forests Ashutosh, the OSD to CM Gopal Singh, Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh, Patna SSP Upendra Sharma and several other officials were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/protect-trees-save-environment-nitish/articleshow/85544713.cms||Madan Kumar

Petitioner L Vinoth was travelling on the bus on October 6, 2007 when the incident happened. He was getting down when the driver moved the bus in a negligent manner resulting in its rear wheel running over his left thigh. The petitioner sustained injuries and was admitted to government Rajaji hospital and subsequently shifted to a private hospital where he underwent surgeries. The motor accident claims tribunal (MACT) at Madurai which he petitioned for compensation had directed the district transport corporation to pay Rs 62,500 to him in 2010. Challenging the order, he filed the present civil miscellaneous appeal before HC Madurai bench in 2014. The appellant submitted through his counsel that he was 19 years old at the time of the accident. He underwent two surgeries and had submitted bills for medical expenses worth Rs 82,828 but the same was not considered by the tribunal. The transport corporation counsel submitted that the appellant was travelling on the footboard of the bus and invited the accident. Hence, contributory negligence should be fixed on the appellant. Justice R Tharani observed that the compensation fixed by the tribunal for the percentage of disability was less. Hence, the judge enhanced the compensation from Rs 62,500 to Rs 1.40lakh and directed the transport corporation to disburse the amount in eight weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/court-raises-relief-amount-for-injured-bus-passenger/articleshow/85547472.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena leader razes his illegal Murud sea-facing bungalow||MUMBAI: High profile Shiv Sena leader Milind Narvekar, a trusted aide of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, on Sunday demolished his own bungalow on Dapoli-Murud seashore in Ratnagiri district after it was confirmed that there were blatant violations of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules. Narvekar is seen as one of the most powerful persons in the Shiv Sena circles; he is directly involved in most of the decision-making processes. A senior Sena leader confirmed to TOI that in view of the possibility of stringent action by the district administration, Narevkar himself asked his architect to demolish the bungalow as early as possible. “Narvekar will seek fresh approval from the coastal zone authorities and reconstruct the bungalow,” he said. Earlier reports of Narvekar constructing the 2,000 sq ft sea-facing bungalow on the 7,600 sq m plot without obtaining due perm-issions had stirred a controversy. The land, when sold by its earlier owners, had a house and two we-lls, besides a few trees. According to the records, Narvekar purchased it for Rs 6 lakh on July 11, 2013. Officials from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority and ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change had visited the site earlier. When asked for his comment, Narvekar merely said, “Politics is a game of patience.” BJP leader Kirit Somaiya has, however, taken credit for the demolition. “We have done it; we have taken up the illegal construction work not only with the district-level coastal authority, but at the state- and national-level too. When we established that there was blatant violation of rules, particularly CRZ norms, Narvekar had no option to demolish the bungalow. Had he not razed it on his own, the authorities would have directed the district administration to carry out the demolition,’’ Somaiya told TOI. He alleged that the district-level administration was protecting Narvekar in view of his association with Thackeray and the chief minister’s office. “I will visit the site on Monday. Merely demolition of the bungalow is not enough, we demand that the district administration initiate criminal proceedings against Narvekar for CRZ violations,” the BJP leader said. Somaiya had, on June 30, called on the Union environment secretary in Delhi to lodge a complaint against Narvekar’s sea-facing bungalow. It was preceded by a meeting with Ratnagiri collector on June 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-leader-razes-his-illegal-murud-sea-facing-bungalow/articleshow/85547469.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

However, surgeons at Cardiology and Research Centre at U N Mehta Institute in Ahmedabad not only saved little Viju’s life but breathed new life into the Parmar family from Singach village in Lalpur taluka of Jamnagar district. What seemed to be an impossible dream for the hand-to-mouth family led by Viju’s father Naran Parmar, who works a driver to eke a living, their prayers were answered by Rashtriya Bal Suraksha Karyakram (RBSK) which performed the surgery that would have cost them Rs 4 lakh for free. “We are poor and our daughter was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. We were very worried about her health as we could not afford her operation charges while a surgery was urgently required. Doctors in Jamnagar advised us to go to U N Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre in Ahmedabad for her surgery. Not only our daughter recovered fully from the birth but we did not have to pay a single penny here,'' Parmar told TOI. Doctors say that if untreated, the hole might increase the amount of blood that flows through the lungs over time, and might cause damage to the blood vessels in the lungs, risking her life, said the father. “We perform over 1000 such surgeries on children every year free of cost here at U N Mehta hospital and give pain free new life to kids,” says Dr R K Patel, Director, U N Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre, Ahmedabad.

Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) has issued a circular asking for reducing fee depending upon various facilities provided by the college that were not used due to the pandemic. Earlier in June this year, state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant had requested universities to consider reduction in fees due to Covid. Educational activist Tukaram Saraf said Bamu should not cause further delay in asking its departments and affiliated colleges to reduce the fees. “The inordinate delay in taking an official stand on part of Bamu is affecting the students and their parents. The university will be responsible if students start dropping out due to inability in paying fees,” he said. Bamu has also not responded to demand for complete fee-waiver to students who have lost their parents due to Covid-19. Jitendra Dehade, chancellor’s nominee on Bamu senate, has sought immediate announcement in support of such waiver. “Students who have become orphan due to Covid-19 must receive waiver in fees till he or she completes the higher education. Bamu should reach out to such students by declaring the fee waiver,” he said. BAMU vice-chancellor Pramod Yeole could not be reached for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bamu-yet-to-take-call-regarding-fee-waiver/articleshow/85541005.cms||---

Especially overwhelmed were his five sisters, as instead of tying rakhis to their brother on Raksha Bandha, they had to attend his cremation on Sunday. Shinde was cremated with full state honours on Sunday morning. He was killed in a Maoist attack in Chhattisgarh’s Narayanpur district on August 20. His six-year-old son, Kabir, lit the pyre, as family members, relatives, neighbours and residents of the Bamni village broke down in tears. Haribhau Waghmare, Shinde’s collegemate said, “He was the eldest of seven siblings and was instrumental in arranging for all his sisters’ weddings. Shinde had to shoulder the responsibilities of his family from a very young age. His parents are marginal farmers. He was the primary breadwinner of the family for many years until things improved recently.” Shinde took 13 bullets to his body and died on the spot when a small group of armed Maoists fired on a squad of ITBP personnel during an area domination exercise in Narayanpur. He is survived by his wife, a four-year-old daughter and a six-year-old son, and elderly parents. The young son of martyr lighting up the pyre of his father Shinde, who had done BSc in agriculture from Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, had joined the ITBP and gone on to become an assistant commandant. Ramchandra Jadhav, the sarpanch of Bamni village, said Shinde was of very humble nature. “As he had seen hardships growing up, he was very sensitive. We have always been proud of him,” he said. Maharashtra PWD minister Ashok Chavan, who attended Shinde’s last rites along with other public representatives, said the state government would provide all support possible to the martyr’s family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/on-raksha-bandhan-five-sisters-attend-martyred-soldiers-cremation-in-nanded/articleshow/85541057.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Mumbai||Mhada tells govt it’s ready to forego its share of FSI if paid a premium||MUMBAI: Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority (Mhada) told the state government it was willing to forego its share of FSI for creating social housing stock if paid a premium for it. The state urban development department invited objections/suggestions to Mhada’s proposal for amending regulation 33 (5) of Development Control and Promotion Regulations-2034, which will allow the authority to settle for a premium. The rule prescribes that for all plots in Mhada layouts that are more than 40,000 sq ft and which front an 18-metre wide road on redevelopment will be allowed with an FSI of 4. The additional 1 FSI is to be shared with Mhada on a 33:67 basis, with Mhada getting the larger share, and the entire FSI was to be used by both entities for social housing. Mhada’s share of FSI was to be handed over free. Mhada proposed that instead of FSI it be allowed to accepting a premium at the rate of 60% of the ready reckoner rate in 35:65 ratio. This time, the society/developer share has been increased to 65%. Also, there is no obligation on the society/developer to use this 1 FSI for creating social housing. Architect and activist P K Das said the condition must not be changed and Mhada must not be given the option of encashing FSI as it will defeat the very objective of setting it up (to create affordable housing). Activist Chandrashekar Prabhu said under the earlier law Mhada’s share of FSI was 67%, which under the new proposal is reduced to 35%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mhada-tells-govt-its-ready-to-forego-its-share-of-fsi-if-paid-a-premium/articleshow/85547568.cms||Clara Lewis

Then what about Jinnah? If Godse would have killed Jinnah, the undivided country would have been retained.” Slamming Raut’s column, BJP leader Ashish Shelar said: “Pakistan started experiencing a pain in the stomach after PM Modi’s announcement to observe Partition Horrors Remembrance Day. That pain and feelings are reflected in Saamna through Raut’s pen. I feel the paper’s name should be changed to Pakistan-nama or Babar-nama.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raut-likens-partition-to-afghan-crisis/articleshow/85547646.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

We called up the village sarpanch and informed him about the two lost kids who we found from the road and were kept in the police station,” a police official said. “On Saturday evening, the parents — Savita and Mangubhai — reached the police station and got united with their kids. The couple hails from Ukai village in Songadh taluka of Tapi district and had come to Kharvas village near Surat in search of livelihood,” police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/cops-unite-lost-minor-siblings-with-parents/articleshow/85543014.cms||---

PWD officials are working on the relocation with activist K Syed of Coimbatore, who has been engaged in the transplantation of trees for close to six years. After razing the century-old structure building, the focus has shifted to clearing the trees on the campus. The PWD had initially planned to remove 32 trees from the place where the library would be established. “After visiting the place we found that seven trees could not be touched and we suggested the officials to spare them as they will not affect the construction,” Syed told TOI. Of the remaining 25 trees, five of them would be axed as they are tamarind trees that cannot be relocated or trees that would not survive relocation. “The 20 trees that will be relocated were planted between 15 and 50 years. Since there is ample space close to the periphery of the premises they will be relocated within the same compound,” Syed added. The trees of native breed such as usil, neem, pongan and vilvam, will be relocated 20 to 50 feet from their existing spot. Works like pruning the branches and roots of the trees has begun . Simultaneously, pits will be dug for a diameter of eight feet and a similar depth, which would be then watered and layered with organic fertilizers such as vermicompost and neem wastes. It will be left to set for seven to 10 days before the tree is relocated. On the day of relocation, the tree will be lifted with a crane and replanted. On the chances of survival of relocated trees, he said that it is 80-90%, Syed added. Chances of survival at the Kalaignar Memorial Library in Madurai are more as the soil from where it is lifted and the place where it is relocated is the same., he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/work-begins-to-transplant-20-trees-to-give-way-to-kalaignar-memorial-library/articleshow/85547625.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra property registration revenue in July reaches 93% of pre-pandemic level||PUNE: Riding on high-value property transactions, the state registration department has achieved 93% of the pre-pandemic revenue target of July 2019, this year. “It is a good sign that we were able to come close to achieving the 2019 target even as there were no sops in July this year. The total revenue earned by the department in July was Rs 2,411.8 crore as against Rs 2,594.2 crore in July 2019,” state inspector general of registration and controller of stamps, Shravan Hardikar, said. The department had registered nearly 1.7 lakh documents in July as compared to 2.6 lakh documents in 2019, but the revenue amount is less by just 7%. Maharashtra had seen a four-year high in registrations and revenue collection in November and December last year due to the stamp duty waiver. Realty experts said that while citizens availed of the stamp duty waiver from September to December and again from January to March, the volume of actual transactions could have been affected. “Registrations in big projects seem to have happened in July, which helped in increasing the revenue,” said a property expert. Property registration department officials said low-value sales were impacted, with low-cost housing projects not getting registered as much since the second wave hit the state. “More land transactions and bigger projects seem to have been registered, which has definitely brought in more revenue,” an official said. Credai vice-president national Shantilal Kataria told TOI that there was more sale in July, but actual registrations could have suffered due to the rainfall and flood affecting many areas. “We are expecting more projects being announced. After the Unified DCR, developers are now changing the plans accordingly. The registrations will slowly pick up,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-property-regn-revenue-in-july-reaches-93-of-pre-pandemic-level/articleshow/85547675.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Agra||25% of basmati rice crop hit by Bakanae disease in Kasganj||AGRA: Continuous rainfall and poor sunshine over the past few weeks has adversely affected a high quality variety of basmati rice sown across 16,000 hectare of land in Kasganj district. At least 25% of this delicately fragrant rice has been affected by seed borne fungal disease, Bakanae, according to farmers here. Paddy is a major kharif crop in Kasganj district. Bakanae is a seedborne fungal disease that infects plants through the roots or crowns. It then grows systematically within the plant. The infected plants are conspicuous as they are abnormally tall with pale, thin leaves. The affected plants produce fewer tillers (grain bearing branches) and produce only partially filled or empty grains. On its part, the district agriculture department has sounded an alert for Bakanae disease. Farmers are being updated on remedies to prevent crop loss. Kasganj district agriculture officer Sumit Kumar said, “Bakanae is a seed borne disease caused by the fungus, Gibberella fujikuroi. It can significantly affect the crop yield. Following high moisture and less sunshine, cases of Bakanae disease have surfaced in different parts of the district. In this regard, we have issued an advisory for the farmers.” Farmers are worried. Jaipal Singh, a paddy farmer of Ratanpur village, said, “Plants are showing abnormal growth and not bearing grain. Some of the plants have rotted. Around 25% of the crop is affected. We have informed the agriculture department about the damage to the crop but so far, no official has come for inspection and guide us to prevent our entire crop from the disease.” District agriculture officer Kumar advised that farmers should uproot the diseased plant and bury it to prevent further spread of the infection. “In severe conditions, we are recommending use of a few permitted chemicals to prevent damage to the crop. Our teams are going to villages to guide farmers. In case of doubt, farmers can also directly contact agriculture officers using mobile numbers available on the department's website,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/25-of-basmati-rice-crop-hit-by-bakanae-disease-in-kasganj/articleshow/85543003.cms||Deepak Lavania

We are also ensuring that all our staff are getting the vaccine jab. But, we are still awaiting the SOPs to finalize on how the college will be functioning,” said Dr Davamani M Christober, principal, The American College. Colleges have already been taking measures to encourage Covid-19 vaccination among staff and students. “We already organized two Covid-19 vaccination camps and most of the staff are vaccinated. With reopening set to be on rotational basis, I guess we will still have online classes alternatively. Mainly, it is the science students who would have to have practical classes and make use of labs on campus,” said Dr D Pandiaraja, principal, Thiagarajar College of Arts and Science. “We are ready to reopen as per norms mandated by the state government. We have to be careful about how we’ll be ensuring social distance in our small campus. We might consider reopening first for final year students. Also, some parents may prefer to send their children to college while others may not, accordingly, we have to arrange,” said Dr Christianna Singh, principal, Lady Doak College. N Shalini, a second year BSc student at a city college said that being at college campus is just as safe as being in any public place in terms of Covid-19 safety. “Last year, we entirely missed out on the campus experience so we are praying that at least this year, it gets better. Ideally, if both offline and online classes are alternatively allowed, it would relieve students of mental stress,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-colleges-awaiting-sops/articleshow/85547698.cms||---

However, this can change, if there is a third wave of Covid-19, said Cdr Anil Rana, director, MIT, Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). He told TOI, “Presently the students can expect conduct of physical classes and workshop-related activities, continuation of their major projects, and creative pursuits of their ideas in innovation centres and workshops. All this shall be done under strict observance of covid-appropriate behaviour. Special sessions shall also be conducted to clarify the theory-related enquiries from students. Guest lectures by industry experts, adjunct faculty and alumni are being planned. Quizzes, case study discussions, and other methods of evaluation will continue as usual,” Cdr Rana said. He said in the last year itself their classrooms were fixed with lecture capture modules, which enabled live and recorded streaming of lectures. “We have a campus wide licence of Office 365, which provides an opportunity to use MS Teams in our teaching and assessment process. The faculty members were able to upload all the reading material, adopt the techniques of online learning such as quiz and video observation, and employ innovative evaluation practices. Meanwhile, the faculty too have been able to understand how the students respond to online education, and have tweaked the system accordingly, by conducting quizzes, and discussing case studies, thus giving a break from the monotonous mode of learning. The online mode can never replace the physical mode. We are also looking at at transcription and gamification to be incorporated in online mode of learning,” Cdr Rana added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mix-of-online-on-campus-classes-to-continue-at-mit/articleshow/85543080.cms||---

However, they expect only a minimal crowd this week as there are no new releases, besides the safety concerns from the public. On Sunday, theatre premises across Madurai district were cleaned and disinfected and Covid-19 safety standard operating procedures (SOPs) were being put in place. Theatre staff have been asked to be vaccinated for Covid-19. “For now, there are no new releases, so we are not so keen to open on Monday, but rather wait for a couple of days more. We are yet to know which movies are available and what we can screen. Even last year, when theatres reopened, it took more than a month for the usual crowd to return to theatres, that too after some new releases. So, this time, we can expect the same,” said Rajasekaran, manager, Ambika Theatre. Theatre owners said that for now, they consider old Tamil movies, relatively new movies that were released on OTT platforms and some English movies for screening. The number of shows is also set to be limited. Initially, the occupancy is also expected to be much less than 50% and hence owners are not too worried about crowding. “We believe that the general crowd who has the habit of going to theatres regularly will come back to theatres. These audiences are loyal to theatres and they’ll start returning once we start screening movies,” said RMM Annamalai, former president of the Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners’ Association. Theatre owners said that despite movie releases on OTT platforms last year, there was good demand for shows in theatres for blockbuster movies. “The Covid-19 pandemic is not likely to deter movie-goers especially as Covid-19 cases have declined drastically. We are not expecting much of a crowd now, but we are hoping to be fully back in business by October when there will likely be Diwali releases of new movies,” said P K M Rajangam, Priya Enterplex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cinemas-gear-up-for-reopening/articleshow/85547730.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The programme which was inaugurated online on Saturday by school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi will see around 2,500 children across the state, including those from rural and marginalized backgrounds, being sensitized. It hopes to carry the messages of democracy, freedom and social justice which are integral to upholding the Constitution to the children. Led by the NGO Vaanmuhil, it will be conducted in two phases. “We will take up this module for three categories of children, including students from Class VI to VIII in schools, adolescent students in hostels and adolescent boys’ and girls’ groups in communities. We will start 125 clubs in the first phase in 15 districts in Tamil Nadu, including Puducherry,” said its director M A Britto. Training sessions will be conducted with around 40 trainers who will be going to the villages. They will effectively educate children through reading, writing, story-telling, games and practical demonstrations. V Vasanthi Devi, former vice-chancellor of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, is to lead the advisory committee while professors E Devasahayam and L Bernard are preparing the study material. Various child rights and human rights activists and educationists besides NGOs working with children will be working together to form the clubs. “Through the clubs, training will be provided through both online and offline means. The study material will be printed in a limited manner but in digital form. We can take it directly to schools with computers or laptop to teach children,” said Britto.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/programme-begins-to-educate-students-on-constitutional-rights-through-clubs/articleshow/85547747.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Sunday became a landmark day as the city recorded only one new positive case, for the first time since March 2020, and one of the very few days of the feat. In both the waves of the pandemic, Ahmedabad city was one of the worst-hit with high cases and mortality. To put the figure in perspective, the city alone accounted for 1.6 lakh out of 5 lakh Covid cases recorded in April and May 2021 – two of the worst months for the state in terms of positive cases and deaths – accounting for about one-third of the cases.  Since start of August, Gujarat has recorded 425 positive cases, out of which 104 were recorded in Ahmedabad city, accounting for 24% of cases.  The city has not recorded daily cases in double digit since July 11. On Sunday, Gujarat also reached another milestone – the state has not crossed 100 daily positive cases in eight weeks or 56 days. On June 27, the state had 112 cases. On June 28, the cases recorded 14% dip at 96. Since July 10, the daily cases have not breached the mark of 50 daily cases, according to the state health department figures. In the past two months, the state has recorded 2,104 cases and deaths of 28 patients, giving mortality rate of 1.3%. Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that the second wave had the hospital scurrying for resources and putting in more beds on urgent basis with 1200-bed hospital almost full. “But for the past one month, the figure of admitted patients hovers around 10-20. Triage area also looks after 1-2 cases only,” he said. “Sustained vaccination drives is one of the factors behind reduced cases and even reduced mortality.” In private hospitals, the cases are zero for the past three days. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that the average number of patients have not exceeded 10 across 100-plus hospitals in August. “But it doesn’t mean that we let our guards down. During the festive season, please be very careful. We don’t want to hasten the third wave,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-records-1-case-in-24-hours-a-first-after-march-2020/articleshow/85548772.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Ahmedabad||With[Out]: How pandemic changed time and reality||AHMEDABAD: Covid cases are at an all-time low, and life is back on the track to normalcy — or is it? Has the pandemic left an impact on individuals and society at large? What did it feel like when there was no linear time, no one to touch, or when even reality as we know it seemed to have altered? These were some themes chosen by the students of exhibition design of National Institute of Design (NID) for their 2X2 metres installation space. Named With[out], the exhibits talked about ‘absence of …’ different concepts ranging from reality to time to sound to transparency. The students used props ranging from polystyrene blocks to wooden wheels and bricks to alarm clocks to convey life during the pandemic. The course was guided by Jonak Das, Aayushi Agarwal, and Aishwarya Edakhe. Shivani Sankar, one of the students, explored the theme of absence of context. Her exhibit had a giant ‘OK’ interspersed with myriad of meanings. “I got inspiration from the chats we had with friends and relatives, when we hardly had the full grasp of what they wanted to say with those words,” she said. “An ‘OK’ in a chat can have so many connotations. During the pandemic, we comprehended that we communicate not just with words, but also with our body language and the tone of speech.” The project of Vrushali Mehta, another student, focused on the absence of free will. “The idea stemmed from my personal experience and background in philosophy. Many started wondering whether there’s free will,” she said. “…whether the situation could have panned out differently, whether they could have reacted to events in a more meaningful way.” She added: “My exhibit had a man on invisible strings, which one can or cannot see depending on lighting.” Students such as Harshi Lal and Avani Samaga employed games as the mode of engagement about the absence of choice and reality respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/without-how-pandemic-changed-time-and-reality/articleshow/85548766.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Kolkata||Only 53 bike taxis in Kolkata have permits||KOLKATA: There are only 53 authorised bike taxis with yellow number plates in the city. Not a single two-wheeler has registered as commercial vehicle since 2018. More than 99% of bike taxis ferrying passengers are deemed illegal by cops. This has put both the transport department and enforcing agencies in a spot. Bike taxis have become a source of earning for thousands of jobless youths and more importantly, thousands of commuters have become dependent on bike taxis to reach their destinations. Bike taxis are easy on pockets and they are effective in providing last mile connectivity and above all, they are easy to book on the app. They can beat traffic snarls and take alleys to reach a commuter to his or her destination in time. But bike taxis are often caught for ferrying passengers illegally as they don’t have yellow number plates. Under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, the states may issue permits for taxi under section 72 and 73. Therefore, it is legal for the states to issue taxi permits to all kinds of vehicles, including two-wheelers,” said a transport department official. However, Section 53(1) (b) of the Act states that private vehicles or the ones with white board licence plates can have their registration suspended if used for “hire or reward without a valid permit for being used as such,” he added. However, a prominent bike-cab app operator said the service cannot be deemed illegal due to the absence of any specific legal prohibition within the Motor Vehicle Act against private bike owners sharing their pillion seat with customers. “We always champion the rules of road but there is a lack of clarity. While the law does talk about the use of a yellow board for commercial purposes, bikes aren’t yet a part of the Motor Vehicle Act. We are hoping the shift will happen (in regulations), making it easier (for bike-taxi startups) to do business,” said a senior official of a very popular app-aggregator with pan-India operation. “A regular consumer vehicle cannot ply as a transport service,” said an official of public vehicles department. They need yellow number plate and permit. “We have simplified the process. Any body can apply for it. But there is hardly any taker. Perhaps, the bikers found too much hassle in it,” said another transport department official. One reason why bikers refused to take the hassle as it is always very difficult to spot a bike taxi. “Most of the bike taxis and commuters have an understanding to face the police. The biker says that the pillion is a friend, the commuter only nods his head in tandem. However, it is not too difficult to find one these days. Thousands of youths delivering food are supposed to have commercial registration plates,” said a cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/only-53-bike-taxis-in-kol-have-permits/articleshow/85545586.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

A specialised programme will help create a pool of talented workers for the defence sector, and for their final year thesis, the postgraduate students will be presented with opportunities to work at DRDO laboratories, defence public sector units (PSUs) and industries. Confirming this development, Cdr Anil Rana, director, MIT, told TOI: “We are aiming at launching this course this year. We have taken up the responsibility after DRDO and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) rolled out this programme. In the second year, students can opt for subject specialisation.” “It is a one-of-its-kind opportunity because many of the labs that would be required by the students taking up these courses are with the DRDO. We are coordinating with DRDO, and are finalising on the labs and other aspects. There are a lot of opportunities, not only in DRDO labs, but also with several private players entering the defence equipment manufacturing and system integration sector,” he said. The present intake for the course is 30, and MIT is working closely with the DRDO and Institute of Defence Scientists and Technologists (IDST). “While the lab is one aspect, MIT is also looking at employing ex-DRDO scientists as faculty, because some technology may be sensitive, and the expertise may not be available in private organisations. There is a lot of paperwork and planning going on. The team is working hard to launch the course at the earliest, “ said Cdr Anil Rana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mit-students-may-soon-get-to-work-in-drdo-labs/articleshow/85543134.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Police recovered a suicide note from the home in which Darshana claimed that she was fed up of life and did not wish to live. “She told police in her statement that her mother and sister were emotionally attached to her and used to depend on her for most of their needs. She thought that their life would become miserable after her death, hence she killed them,” said a police officer.  Investigators said Darshana gave them an 10 ml injection of an anesthetic drug whose normal dose for patients is just two ml. Since there was not enough of this drug left at home, she consumed sleeping pills. In her statement, Darshana told police that she gave the injection to mother and sister saying that it was a pain reliever, since they both had joint pain.  Gaurav, who is married, told police that there were no issues among the family members. Cops claimed that further investigation after Darshana recovers will help to know the exact cause. Gaurav and his wife went to Mumbai three days ago and were to return on Sunday morning.  Darshana would have died if Gaurav had not reached early, said police. When no one opened the front door Gaurav entered the house by opening the lock of the back door. He was shocked to find his mother and sister dead. “Noticing that Darshana had consumed some medicine Gaurav made her puke by inserting fingers in her mouth. Only quick actions by him saved her life,” said police. He later shifted Darshana to hospital and her treatment could start.  Darshana practices as a homeopath doctor in her private clinic that she runs from a rented space. The family lived in a one-storey house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/doctor-kills-mother-sister-attempts-suicide/articleshow/85543217.cms||---

As stray dogs roam around Charminar in search of food, shopkeepers say the canines should be sterilized and put in a shelter. “This becomes a serious threat to the people especially at night, since most families prefer to visit the Charminar then as its free from public rush,” said a trader. “The Charminar is a fairly popular spot to visit at night, that is where a group of dogs is seen regularly. GHMC, and other concerned authorities, should take immediate note of the situation and make sure it doesn’t get worse,” said Mohammed Khasim, a resident. Locals said that the increasing dog menace at many places in Old City was brought to the notice of the authorities. They added that the issue was exacerbated by the mounting piles of garbage. They said that despite several complaints, no garbage bins were put up. “There is no proper mechanism to keep the areas neat and clean. Piling up garbage has made the dog menace worse in these areas, and it has now become a matter of concern,” another resident Saddam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/charminar-dogged-by-stray-menace/articleshow/85547832.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: CM Capt Amarinder Singh calls Pakistan, Kashmir remarks by Navjot Singh Sidhu’s two advisers anti-national||CHANDIGARH: Taking note of recent statements by Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s two advisers on issues of Kashmir and Pakistan, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday warned them against making what he described as “atrocious and ill-conceived comments”. He said such utterings were potentially dangerous to peace and stability of the state and the country. The CM also urged Sidhu to rein in his advisers before they end up doing more damage to India’s interests. He urged the two advisers, Malwinder Singh Mali and Pyare Lal Garg, to stick to giving advice to the state Congress president and “not speak on matters of which they had little or no knowledge, and have no understanding of the implications of their comments”. He was reacting to reported remarks by Garg questioning Capt Amarinder’s criticism of Pakistan as well as the earlier controversial statement by Mali on Kashmir. Expressing shock at the statements, the CM said these statements were misplaced and antagonistic to the stated position of India and the Congress on Pakistan and Kashmir.  “Kashmir was and is an inalienable part of India,” said Amarinder, adding that with his proclamation to the contrary, Mali had effectively and inexplicably toed Islamabad’s line. “This is totally anti-national,” he said. The CM also slammed Mali for failing to withdraw his statement despite widespread condemnation it had evoked not only from other parties, but also from within the Congress. Ridiculing Dr Garg’s statement that criticism of Pakistan by Capt Amarinder was not in the interest of Punjab, the chief minister said Sidhu’s adviser was clearly disconnected from the ground reality. “The fact, which every Punjabi and in fact every Indian knows, is that Pakistan’s threat to us is real. “Every day, they are pushing weapons and drugs into Punjab via drones in a brazen attempt to destabilise our state, and our nation. Punjabi soldiers are dying at the borders at the hands of Pakistan-backed forces,” he added, dubbing Garg’s remarks as irrational and unjustified. The CM said Garg may have forgotten that thousands of Punjabi lives were lost in the fire of Pakistan-backed terrorism of the 1980s and 1990s, but he has not and nor have the people of Punjab. “And we will continue to do everything in our power to fight off Pakistan’s dangerous games,” said the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cm-calls-pak-kashmir-remarks-by-sidhus-two-advisers-anti-national/articleshow/85547860.cms||---

Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, who also holds the state health portfolio, announced this as the "Rakshabandhan gift" for the doctors and medical college teachers, who were pressing for it and had even gone on strike over the demand. “Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel has approved NPA as per the 7th Pay Commission to the eligible in-service doctors of government hospitals and GMERS medical college teachers as a Rakshabandhan gift,” said a note on Patel's Facebook page. The nod comes a few months after the state government in May approved the NPA for teachers of six government medical colleges, as per the 7th Pay Commission, as a condition for them to call off their strike along with teachers of eight GMERS medical colleges. The GMERS medical colleges are semi-government institutions established under the Gujarat Medical Education and Research Society of the state health department.

---||Thane||Thane: Three get pre-arrest bail in case of harassment||THANE: The Thane court granted anticipatory bail to three accused in the harassment case filed by a woman against her 'husband' as well as her 'father-in-law' and one other female family friend. The complainant in the case said that she got ‘married’ to the accused husband on January 28, 2021. She alleged that she was subjected to cruelty to meet their unlawful demand in which the third accused who is a family friend, used to abuse and threatened her by making phone calls. Also, she submitted that her husband and his mother she was beaten up for flimsy reasons. Hence she registered a case under 498 A , 323, 504 , 506 of the Indian Penal Code at Shree nagar police station. Interestingly, after one month after registration of this case, the complainant gave a supplementary statement to the investigation officer, and thereby, submitted that the accused had not married her but pretended the same. She further submits that from April 2019 to July 26, 2021, the accused established sexual relations with her by giving false promise of marriage. She further stated that the prime accused also had unnatural sexual intercourse with her due to which she was pregnant twice and both times she was forced for abortion. On the basis of the supplementary statement, the Investigating Officer added sections of rape, unnatural sex and abortion of the Indian penal code. Advocate Aniket Gawand, appearing for the accused, submitted that the trio are innocent and falsely implicated in the offence. Also, the victim was having an affair and by consent they indulged in sexual relationship with each other. Also, he was never married nor promised to marry her and their relation was consensual. The judge after hearing both sides granted anticipatory bail. In his order, the judge along with other points stated, “…. considering the facts of the case, it comes to my knowledge that the applicant No.1 (accused husband) had an affair with the informant, they indulged in sexual relationship and for some reason their relations ended into a breakup. Thus, undoubtedly they had consensual sexual relationship with each other. The informant is major and educated therefore, it is expected that she was fully aware of the consequences of having sexual intercourse with the applicant No.1 (accused husband) before marriage. The informant stated that her consent for sexual intercourse was obtained by fraud. In the event of consent obtained by fraud, the inducement is a necessary ingredient. Thus, there should be some material on record to believe prima facie that the informant (complainant) was induced by the applicant No.1 (accused husband) to such an extent that she was ready to have sexual intercourse with him. Herein, informant stated that the applicant no.1 made a false promise of marriage and thereby played a fraud upon her to obtain consent for sexual intercourse. Thus, in such circumstances, promise to marry cannot be said to be an inducement to obtain the consent by fraud."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-trio-get-bail-in-harassment-case/articleshow/85547849.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

This will be the second meeting after February this year. Cops are planning to re-introduce special re-training centres for them across the 25 traffic guards in the city if the Covid situation in the city does not worsen in the next few weeks. The decision by Lalbazar came days after the passenger of a bike taxi died as the two-wheeler skidded on the road near the Park Circus 7-point crossing. The biker and his pillion rider (the passenger) were hit by a KMC vehicle coming from behind. The top brass at Lalbazar also wants to discuss the long pending issue of commercial licence plates for app bikes, which is mandatory, according to the government guidelines, but it is hardly used in the city. There is also a third issue that is likely to be discussed at the meeting. “We are now also getting complaints against a section of these riders for insisting that their passengers directly enter into a contract with them. The riders refuse to provide a ride, according to the fares fixed by the aggregator. This becomes a headache for the passengers travelling to far-off places across the city after evening,” said an officer. Cops said they have asked the app bike aggregators to respond to certain queries on security raised by the passengers before going ahead with the planned meeting. "The most important question is how the new riders are being verified. We want them to follow the app-cab models,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-to-meet-aggregators-for-safe-rides/articleshow/85545639.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||India||Day before key meeting, BJP strongly backs caste census||NEW DELHI: A day before the Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar-led all-party delegation from the state meets Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a caste-based census, BJP strongly endorsed the move for a caste-wise head count . Senior BJP leader from Bihar and Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi said the party has always supported the caste-based census and will be part of the all-party delegation meeting the PM on Monday. "BJP has never been against caste census, that's why we have been a part of the resolution passed in the legislative assembly and legislative council on this issue", Sushil Modi tweeted in what was seen as a move to highlight the ruling party's "in principle" agreement with the growing clamour for estimating the numerical strength of hundreds of castes The statement of the former deputy CM of Bihar, follows Prime Minister Narendra Modi giving record representation to members of OBCs in his team and intervening to ensure promulgation of all India quota in medical courses. Earlier, the party's member of Lok Sabha from UP Sanghmitra Maurya had strongly supported the caste-based census while speaking on the 127th amendment bill restoring powers of the states to make their own OBC quota list. Sushil Modi also recalled the statement of the then rural development, late Gopinath Munde in 2014 in Parliament where he had said that government could not accept findings of the Socio-Economic Caste Census as reliable because of the infirmities in data collected. "At that time, on the instructions of the central government, when the Social Economic Caste survey was conducted by the ministries of rural development and urban development, crores of errors were found in it. The number of castes reached into the millions," Sushil Modi said that the report was not made public because of inacuracies. The BJP leader said at the time of the last census of 1931 under the British Raj, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa were one. "The census of only 22 castes was done in the population of about 1 crore of Bihar at that time. Now after 90 years there has been a big difference in the economic, social, geographical and political conditions," Modi said. He said although there are many technical and practical difficulties in conducting caste census, yet BJP is in support of it in principle. On August 10, BJP MP Sanghmitra Maurya, while participating in the 127th amendment bill, had made a strong pitch for caste census. The MP, who hails from a backward caste and whose father Swami Prasad Maurya is a minister in the Uttar Pradesh government, had said, "Even animals were counted earlier but not the backward castes. The BJP government is now doing it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/day-before-key-meeting-bjp-strongly-backs-caste-census/articleshow/85550022.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Groundwater goes deep underground near Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Mehsana today is one of the worst affected districts in the state when it comes to rapid groundwater depletion. Mehsana, Ahmedabad’s neighbour, is suffering because groundwater exploitation has remained unchecked. The situation has led the Gujarat Water Resources Development Corporation (GWRDC) to urgently procure 2,200 groundwater-level measuring devices and a similar number of water quality testing kits to assess the presence of fluoride and arsenic. The urgency is not without reason. A recent study by the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Isro, Dehradun; IIT-Dhanbad; and the department of remote sensing and GIS, University of Jammu, published on February 6 this year painted a grim picture. The study said that Mehsana district faced a critical problem with 151.17% of groundwater being exploited in eight talukas of the district since 2004. The first alarm about groundwater over-extraction in the country rang out almost three decades ago in Mehsana, coastal Saurashtra, and Kutch in Gujarat. Warnings were also given for Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, Kolar in Karnataka, Jaipur in Rajasthan, Chandigarh in Haryana and Punjab, and Dewas in Madhya Pradesh. “The equipment to measure groundwater levels is being procured under the Atal Bhu Jal Yojana which was launched by the central government in December 2019. The prolonged Covid period had delayed the project,” said a senior official of the GWRDC. “We are also installing rain gauges across the district to correlate rainfall and groundwater recharge.” It is worth mentioning that the groundwater storage (GWS) change between 2003 and 2007 varied from 60mm/year to 72 mm/year. “The GWS depletion had begun early in Mehsana largely owing to cash crops as they require a lot of water,” the official said. “There has been a shortage of water for cash crops such as cumin, isabgul, and wheat.” In the 24 villages between Vijapur and Mansa, water is available only at about 1,200 feet; the figure was 600 feet earlier. Farmers are being forced to quit agriculture and they can’t find jobs.  Produce prices are not sustainable and farmers are thus angry at the government. The Atal Bhu Jal project, powered by World Bank funding, focuses on drawing a framework for participatory groundwater management and bringing behavioural changes at the community level for sustainable resource management. Seven states were chosen for the scheme: Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. In these states, 8,350 gram panchayats in 78 districts are being considered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/groundwater-goes-deep-underground-near-ahmedabad/articleshow/85548787.cms||---

One more person has been arrested, and, according to a senior police officer, a team has left for Tamil Nadu to arrest another accused. The gang was promising jobs including nursing in Australia and Lithuania and preliminary investigation reveals that at least 20 people have been cheated by collecting a minimum of Rs 2-3 lakh each. The incident came to light, after the Protector of Emigrants released a list of legal overseas recruitment agencies and Mangaluru list was shared on various media and social media platforms by city police, following which, a woman who was offered a work visa for an office job in Lithuania for a salary Rs 3.5 lakh per month, for which a payment of Rs 5.5 lakh had to be made, filed a complaint. A senior police officer said that the Protector of Emigrants had sought the help of the State police in cracking down unauthorised overseas recruitment agencies. Many illegal agents use middlemen to dupe people and will have no direct contact with their victims. The middleman collects money, keeps his cut and gives the rest to the main agent. They buy more time to provide offer letters and visas citing pandemic and the ban of flight operations to many countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/illegal-overseas-recruitment-agencies-under-scanner/articleshow/85543256.cms||---

The speed limit on this new Nagpur-Mumbai route is 150 km per hour. While MSRDC has begun an inquiry into the allegations, the two private companies against whom Gupta has levelled allegations have denied any such lapse in the quality of work. In his complaint, Gupta said, “I worked with Vijay Nirman Company Pvt Ltd on package-4 between chainage 192 and 217. The work executed by private companies is not as per the approved designs and drawings. I observed companies removing steel reinforcement like extra bars from structures after inspection and approval by MSRDC’s third party agency (TPF Engineering Pvt Ltd) which was engaged for quality check. This kind of malpractice has been done at all over passes, under passes, box culverts and minor bridges. To verify the irregularities, start the investigation from the right hand side raft of the box culvert of 198+478 and left hand side raft of the box culvert of 201+280.” Gupta added, “I was shifted from these sites and later sacked from the company when I brought these malpractices to the attention of the company’s project manager.” Gupta told TOI that over 25% of steel reinforcement was removed after inspection. “Steel reinforcement plays a crucial role in the sustainability of flyovers, under, over passes, bridges etc. Such poor quality of work is unacceptable when the common schedule of rates (CSR) are much higher compared to the projects of the state PWD and NHAI,” he said. Public works minister Eknath Shinde said a proper inquiry will be conducted regarding all the complaints. “Action will be taken if inferior quality of work is detected,” he said. MSRDC superintending engineer Sangeeta Jaiswal said that the inquiry report is expected soon. “I don’t think there is any malpractice. We are ensuring concretization after inspection and approval of reinforcement by the third party agency. Now, work on almost all structures has been completed. Even vehicles engaged in construction work are passing by. There are no cracks on the structures.” The MSRDC assigned package-4 to PNC Infratech Ltd. Gupta said, “Inferior quality of work was under way due to the nexus between the engineers of PNC Infratech and Vijay Nirman Company. Many times I brought it to the notice of MSRDC officials, including Jaiswal, but none took cognizance. MSRDC is not giving details under RTI too.” Deputy project manager of PNC Infratech Sheikh Namatulla said there is no question of inferior quality of work. Chief operating officer of Vijay Nirman Company, a sub-contractor to PNC, Anil Shankar Mahalle too said the same. “Our company has a good reputation and has been in this sector since many years. I’m not aware about Gupta and his complaint.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/engineer-of-private-company-alleges-shoddy-work-in-samruddhi-e-way-sacked/articleshow/85547905.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

So far three FIRs have already been registered against Patel, a BJP worker in city and district, for cheating almost a dozen people of over Rs 30 lakh. On Saturday, a 23-year-old electrician named Rameez Raja Sindhi told police in his complaint that Patel lured him by offering a job in Canada. Sindhi said that Patel won the trust of his family by establishing good relationships with all the members over the last few years. In January last year, when Patel said that he would secure a job for Sindhi in Canada and also manage his visa, the family readily agreed to give him money. Patel told the Sindhi family that the entire process would cost around Rs 18 lakh. Initially, Patel took Rs 1 lakh from Sindhi for his visa application and medical check-up. In November, Patel said that Sindhi’s job in a hotel has been fixed and he will be paid Rs 2.5 lakh every month. He then took another Rs 80,000 and Sindhi’s passport. After pocketing Rs 1.8 lakh, Patel limited his interaction with Sindhi and his family. Whenever Sindhi asked about the status of his Canada job, Patel cited the Covid pandemic as the reason for the delay. Later, Patel stopped answering Sindhi’s calls and did not return his money and his passport. Recently, when Sindhi learnt about police action against Patel, he lodged a complaint at Dabhoi police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fourth-case-of-cheating-filed-against-bjp-worker/articleshow/85543715.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: As part of midday meal scheme, 121 govt, aided schools develop nutrition gardens||PANAJI: In Goa, as many as 121 government and aided primary and high schools have developed nutrition gardens within their premises over the past few years. The gardens have been developed as part of the Union education ministry’s nutrition garden programme under the midday meal scheme. The idea behind the scheme is to create an interest in nature and gardening among children, while also raising awareness among them about organic produce and nutrition. Work on creating the gardens was carried out with the involvement of children during the pre-pandemic period. During the recent review of the midday meal scheme, Goa officials told the Union ministry that 121 schools have created such nutrition gardens. As per the ministry’s target, Goa has to develop such gardens in all 1,462 government and aided primary and high schools in the state, where children get the benefit of midday meal scheme. The ministry said that nutrition gardens being developed in 121 schools meant that only 8% of Goa’s target has been met. Goa officials told the central government authorities that work on the nutrition garden scheme had slowed down due to the pandemic during the last academic session. “The state has developed school nutrition gardens in only 121 schools out of 1,462 school,” the meeting noted. “It was informed that due to closure of schools during 2020-21, the development work of school nutrition gardens could not be taken up,” it was noted in the minutes of the review meeting held with the ministry’s officials. Goa was in turn told that the state should develop school nutrition gardens in remaining schools in convergence with local krishi vigyan kendras, agriculture department, panchayat department and horticulture department. “The funds available under MNREGA of the department of rural development for certain eligible components may also be utilised in convergence with them,” Goa was told. Vegetables and edible herbs are grown in the nutrition gardens. In Goa, agriculture department officials are already involved in the scheme’s implementation in schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-part-of-midday-meal-scheme-121-govt-aided-schools-develop-nutrition-gardens/articleshow/85547923.cms||---

The Statue Of Unity Area Development And Tourism Governance Authority has announced that they will go ahead with the construction of six new homes for chimpanzees— which will be a dome — followed by an enclosure for orangutans. Then there will be a special place hyenas and separate enclosures for rabbits, geese and swans. The cost of the project is estimated to be Rs 17.37 crore. The efforts to bring rare apes like the chimpanzees has been on since November 2019 when CM Vijay Rupani had sought three chimpanzees seized by the Customs department at Kolkata airport. Rupani had requested these chimps for the SoU zoological park. He had even written to the Union minister for environment and forests, Prakash Javadekar. The chimpanzees were believed to be illegally smuggled from abroad. In his letter, Rupani said the apes would “generate additional attraction for thousands of tourists who are expected to visit the Jungle Safari”. It is worth mentioning here that the Gujarat government had raced against time to develop the SPZP within six months. “It was a dumping site for the debris excavated to erect the SoU, and the plantations were undertaken using the Miyawaki technique and some fully grown trees,” says a senior SSNNL official in Gandhinagar. Most of the animals for the Sardar Patel Zoological Jungle Safari were brought in October 2019. But before the park could open in February, there had been tragic incidents. Three giraffes had died earlier along with two impalas and one zebra owing to natural causes according to authorities. “Two of the three giraffes had died because of a pre-acute mortality syndrome while the third had died of diaphragmatic hernia,” claimed the SSNNL official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-guests-for-jungle-safari-at-kevadia/articleshow/85548782.cms||---

Back in 2006, his uncle had brought him here and got him admitted to Class-I at M P Birla Foundation, where he studied for two years, dropped out in Class-III and went back to Afghanistan. Today, he lives in a rented apartment at Parnasree, not too far from where his school was situated. Faiz reached the city on June 17, when the Talibans had already started striking and the turmoil had begun, he recounted.  “I have elderly parents there but they sent me to Kolkata so that I can settle down here. From June 22, the fight intensified as the Talibans launched a series of attacks in the northern part of the country, far from their traditional strongholds in the south, just five days after I reached Kolkata,” Faiz added. He left the city as a nine-year-old school child, but the memories of that time remain vivid in his mind. Twelve years later, he finds the city has changed but its essence of peace and friendliness is intact. “I have started my dry fruit business and I stay with friends at a rented place in Parnasree,” he said. Though he is safe, he is extremely worried about his parents’ safety. Phone lines are not working and his continuous efforts for the past two weeks to connect with them at Kabul went in vain. Finally on Friday, he was able to talk to them over a satellite phone connection and found that they were safe. He has made it a routine to be at the Maidan every Sunday with his Afghan friends to play cricket but last Sunday was an exception — the day Talibans officially regained control of his country. “The whole day and night I was watching TV, surfing channels to get as much information as I could. This Sunday, my tension reduced a bit as I got to hear from my parents and so I went back to the Maidan again. This Sunday ritual is a favourite with all Afghans in the city,” he said. Cricket is his favourite game since his childhood. His favourite cricketer is Rashid Khan, Afghan cricket captain. “I am a great fan of Indian cricketer Virat Kohli and follow all his actions,” Faiz added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/afghan-youth-rushes-to-city-days-before-taliban-attack/articleshow/85545770.cms||---

With a year-long delay in diagnosis and consequent commencement of medical treatment, many have lost their chance of a recovery, they feel. “The fear of the pandemic was so high that people took all other complaints lightly. Every day, I see a new cancer patient,” said Dr Jose Filipe Alvares, a senior gastroenterologist and endoscopist. Alvares said that people mustn’t ignore the smallest symptom, and said that as long as one wears a mask and has been vaccinated, there’s no reason to be scared to visit a doctor. Another gastroenterologist. Dr Harish Peshwe, said that it’s not just the number of patients that have been worrying, but the stage they’re presenting. Their postponement, often till things get too bad, is a consequence of their fear of Covid. In Goa, cancers of the gastrointestinal tract are common, with malignancies in the colon, stomach and liver only behind breast cancer in prevalence. “Colon cancer is otherwise treatable, but when a patient reports at an advanced stage of the disease, the option of surgery is not available, and neither is the patient likely to bear chemotherapy. Otherwise, we operate even on seventy-plus patients,” he said. “Unfortunately, cancer doesn’t rest during a pandemic,” says the Mayo Clinic. “The earlier cancer is detected, the better the chances for successful treatment.” Oncologist Dr Eugene Rent said that the progression of cancer from stage-0 to I is slow, and even from stage-I to II isn’t fast, but after that, “it will advance speedily”. “We are seeing a lot of patients coming in at stage-IV, and the delay was because of their fear of Covid-19,” said Rent. Ironically, some patients who went to hospital for Covid treatment ended up being diagnosed with a malignancy after an echocardiogram or CT scan. “When questioned about the delay, they said that they chose to be home because of Covid,” he said. “I have seen at least 15 patients over the past few months who were diagnosed with breast cancer when they came for Covid treatment.” In one case of fear-driven delay, Rent said that he recently saw a patient who was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. The patient refused to undergo treatment out of fear of the potential third wave. “The patient went home without treatment even as she was advised that she may not live to see the third wave, as and when it happens, if she chose to stay without treatment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/amid-covid-fears-specialists-warn-about-late-stage-cancers/articleshow/85547943.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: New civic body, aging engineers||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat’s youngest civic body, the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation, is dependent on the state’s eldest set of retired engineers to deal with strenuous, day-to-day tasks. In June 2020, the GMC’s boundary recorded the largest expansion in the state, increasing from 177 sq km to 326 sq km. These engineers deal with road and underpass constructions, laying of underground civic utilities, and the redevelopment of open spaces. The key posts currently occupied by retired officers, all in their mid-sixties, include that of the city engineer and three deputy city engineers. They have been hired on contracts. The officers were the employees of the state roads and buildings department. “The senior posts have been outsourced for the past five years and since then there have been no recruitments,” said a senior GMC official. “The post of the additional city engineer too has been lying vacant for many years.” The Union government recently provided grants to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore for Gandhinagar Smart City projects. Officials said that delays have hit the implementation of key projects such as creating Wi-Fi zones across the city, intelligent traffic integrated transport management, smart water and waste management, and real-time environment monitoring. Apart from its own projects, the GMC is also responsible for carrying out development works under Gandhinagar Smart City Development Limited (GSCDL), a special purpose vehicle. Various area-based development projects come under the purview of the SPV. Officials added that GSCDL’s ambitious project to create an Integrated Control and Command Centre (ICCC) for seamless and intelligent traffic management was launched about four years ago but no development has taken place so far. “Setting up of the ICCC is the responsibility of the city engineering department,” an official said. The official added: “Recently, two underpasses were inaugurated in Gandhinagar but both had to be shut a few days later because of flooding and water leakage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-civic-body-aging-engineers/articleshow/85545799.cms||---

The technology will map with laser precision the exact contours, natural structures to buildings, including their cracks from the top with precision. Principally, according to Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) authorities, the technology will map features including natural streams, forest cover, roads, utility lines and area boundaries. The authorities said that LiDAR technology will also map in detail the entire Statue of Unity with such precision such that one can recreate the entire bronze plate laden statue with laser data. The technology has been employed for the first time in the state for an area authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hi-tech-lidar-to-map-sou-stretch/articleshow/85548783.cms||---
---||Kochi||Navigating Kochi’s footpaths is a challenge for pedestrians||KOCHI: In spite of authorities mooting projects for ensuring hassle-free transportation in the city, including mega ones like Metro rail, flyovers and smart roads, the condition of footpaths in the city remains pathetic. Illegal parking, cables, petty shops and street vending, dislocated and broken slabs over drains, dumping waste – the issues a pedestrian has to face are numerous. “Cables by various telecom service providers and KSEB make a cobweb across footpaths. That forces us to walk on the roads in such stretches. Another issue we frequently face is unauthorised parking. Vehicles can be seen parked on footpaths, even on the one near the collector’s camp office,” said T N Prathapan, who has lodged complaints to various authorities seeking solutions to the problems faced by the pedestrians. Cables on footpath along Thottakkattu RoadRiding motorcycles over footpaths along certain stretches where there are no barricades between the road and footpath also poses a threat to pedestrians. “Riding motorcycles over the footpaths along Mathrubhumi - Kaloor stretch is a regular sight. I had several times asked many bike riders not to drive over the pavement reserved for pedestrians. There have been even incidents where the riders scold me for protesting,” said 68-year-old Prathapan. The absence of zebra lines is another hurdle. There had been proposals for constructing foot overbridges at busy junctions, but the authorities so far could not erect most of the overbridges. “Even the ones installed by the authorities are not pedestrian-friendly. The best example is the foot overbridges across Edappally- Vyttila stretch of the national highway. The staircases are steep and even a young person cannot climb it. The authorities should visit the foot overbridges in other cities before constructing the bridges here,” Prathapan said. Recently, some telecom service providers have also started erecting poles on footpaths for drawing their cables. “In our division, we complained forcing them to remove it within a day. Still, we can see poles erected by several telecom companies and KSEB on footpaths at various places. We have given complaints to Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) and Kochi Corporation, the agencies which reconstruct many roads in the city. But, there have not been any results so far,” said K S Dileep Kumar, president, Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi, an NGO. Meanwhile, Mayor M Anil Kumar said the corporation has been adopting measures to ensure smooth movement of pedestrians through city roads. “We had held a couple of meetings with the telecom service providers to remove all the cables they have drawn illegally. Instructions have been given to the corporation officials to identify all the cables which were drawn with the consent of the local body,” Anil Kumar said. “On the issue of street vendors, we have started steps to relocate them from footpaths. We are identifying street vending zones for relocating them. A special meeting of the council was held a few days ago to discuss the issue. We are giving utmost importance to pedestrians’ issues. We will sort out the difficulties one by one,” the mayor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/navigating-citys-footpaths-is-a-challenge-for-pedestrians/articleshow/85543387.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The complainant said that she got married to a man from the Danilimda area of city in 2011 after which she began living with him and his family members. She said that soon after their marriage, she was selected as a junior clerk in the GST department. She was told to travel from AMTS bus only to save money, she told cops. The complainant said that she was allowed to spend only Rs 50 a day by the family and in case of violation of this rule, she used to get beaten by her husband and in-laws. She alleged in the FIR that her husband used to object whenever she tried to dress up nicely for office, suspecting extra-marital affair. On August 15, she was thrashed badly by her husband. She then went to her father’s place when her father noticed that things were not right at her in-laws’ place. She said that when her family members raised this issue before her husband, her husband again assaulted her badly while her brother-in-law held her forcibly.

While many families organized their first get-togethers, many chose to visit public places ranging from Sabarmati Riverfront to Kankaria Lakefront to mark the day. Eateries were full to the brim and some chose to drive out of the city. At many places, however, the masking and social distancing norms went for a toss, observed public health experts, warning citizens that the pandemic is not over yet, it has just ebbed. At Jagannathji Temple, the deities were tied rakhis by Mahant Dilipdasji. Several women from Muslim community tied rakhis to the Mahant as a gesture of communal harmony. Special prayers were organized at several temples. At Kala Ramji temple near Calico Dome in the Walled City, about 100 Brahmins changed janeu (sacred thread) according to ancient customs. Several communities, however, did not organize their annual get-togethers keeping in mind pandemic conditions. In Gandhinagar, women tied rakhis to CM Vijay Rupani. A team of Abhayam 181 helpline, led by coordinator Falguni Patel, also tied rakhis to the CM, praying for progress of the state and end of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/low-cases-trigger-rakhi-extravaganza/articleshow/85548813.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Anderson club kicks off centenary celebrations, honours members||Kolkata: Indian Life Saving Society (ILSS), popularly known as Anderson club, on Sunday began its centenary celebrations by honouring its members with Gold Card, who have 30 years of membership and attained the age of 60 years. The club also felicitated its oldest security staff Lal Bahadur Gurung (88) who has been serving the club over half a century. The birth of ILSS was a strange coincidence. “The elites of the city used to spend the summer evening at Babu Ghat, where they saw a boy drowning. No one could help as none present there knew swimming. They decided to build a society to save people from drowning. The society was established in a small house at Ahiritola Ghat in 1922. The house still exists and we still pay Rs 2 rent to the Kolkata Port Trust. But it was occupied by a local club,” said Arabinda Roy, general secretary of ILSS. The club later shifted to its present address at the eastern end of Rabindra Sarobar where the house of John Anderson was located. “We now have 7,000 members and we trained 5,000 children every year. We still impart life saving training to a large number of youths at free of cost , who get recruited at various institutions,” said Roy. “Over the years, the club with its twin swimming pools, has evolved into a social club where families and friends of the members meet in the evening. But we have not deviated from our main motto — saving life. The club has an illustrious history with swimming luminaries who used to train here. Legendary coach Anil Dasgupta, after whom writer Moti Nandi created the character, swimming coach Khitish Sinha, who was portrayed in the movie by Soumitra Chatterjee. The students included Nafisa Ali and Sriparna Banerjee who acted in the film,” Roy added. ILSS is commonly referred to as Anderson club. Beside the central theme of swimming, this old institution is found to carry the heritage of rich and elite culture of old Kolkata and it was once the gathering point of the elites of the city. “Surely, that elegance is not still there but the essence of the elegance could still be found there in this swimming club of Kolkata,” said an old member||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/anderson-club-kicks-off-centenary-celebrations-honours-members/articleshow/85545846.cms||---

Mukherjee had joined BJP in November 2020 but didn't get a ticket to contest the assembly polls. He lost the 2016 state polls on a Trinamool ticket. Mukherjee, who was the municipality chairman for five terms since 1990, was found to be involved in corrupt practices in tender processing that involved defalcation of Rs 9.9 crores, Bankura SP Dhritiman Sarkar said. Bihsnupur SDO Anup Kumar Nanda had filed a complaint for irregularities in the tender process during Mukherjee's tenure as chairman. A local court remanded him in police custody for four days. The SP said Mukherjee has been charged under sections of the IPC. Defence counsel Gouri Prasad Biswas said he had been falsely implicated. District Trinamool chairman Shyamal Santra said Mukherjee had passed bills without doing any work. "He submitted utilisation certificates but no work was done. Law will take its own course," he said. BJP district chief Sujit Agasty said: "What Mukherjee did was while he was in Trinamool. So why were police so late in acting?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ex-tmc-mantri-who-crossed-over-to-bjp-held-in-10cr-scam/articleshow/85550161.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Delhi||EDMC offers 15% rebate on 3-year general trade licence||New Delhi: In a bid incentivise issuance of long-terms trade licences, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has decided to provide a 15% rebate on the fee if traders apply for a three-year general trade licence. Several other changes have been introduced in accordance with the new trade licence policy, which will be applicable from April 2021. An EDMC spokesperson stated that some trade associations had submitted their suggestions and feedback for simplifying the policy regarding general trade and storage licences. "We have incorporated the feedback in making these amendments. A processing fee will now be charged at the time of applying for a new licence. However, in case of renewal or amendment of an existing licence, only half of the processing fee will be charged , irrespective of the number of years-- with the maximum limit of three years-- for which a licence renewal is applied for," a senior EDMC official said. No fee will be charged from an applicant if they surrender their licence within the validity period. "However, in case the applicant wishes to surrender its licence after expiry of its validity, they will have to pay a licence fee for that financial year. The applicant will be liable to pay the difference in the licence fee in case of an increase in the area," the official stated. A restructuring of the factory license fee has also been carried out. According to a circular issued by the factory licensing department on Thursday, in case of new factory licences, the registration fee will vary between Rs 2,000 and Rs 50,000 per annum. Similarly, the licence fee will vary between Rs4000 and Rs40,000 per annum, depending on the power load. The processing fee for all categories will be Rs1,000 per application. No revision has been carried out in household industry licenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-offers-15-rebate-on-3-year-general-trade-licence/articleshow/85545925.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The committee will have secretary of the department of ports as the chairperson and managing director and CEO of Vizhinjam International Seaport Ltd (VISL) as the convener. Other members include chief engineer of harbour engineering department, CEO of Kerala maritime board and director of fisheries. Fishermen who operate from Vizhinjam harbour had raised concerns on wave disturbances and tranquillity issues at the entrance and within the existing fishing harbour. According to the fisherfolk, this was due to the ongoing construction works at the port. VISL had then entrusted the central water and power research station (CWPRS), Pune, to undertake a physical wave model study to assess the impact, if any, due to the work on the Vizhinjam international multipurpose seaport to the existing harbour at Vizhinjam. The study by CWPRS is still in progress. The committee constituted by the government will review the report of the physical wave model study. As per the half-yearly compliance report between October 2017 and March 2018 on Vizhinjam project pertaining to environmental impact and status of mitigation measures, detailed modelling studies were carried out on tranquillity conditions in the fishing harbour with the port development. The studies revealed that the tranquillity conditions would be improved in fishing harbour with the construction of the port and that further minor accretion happening within the harbour would be arrested, the report has pointed out. The report also cited that the progress of the fishery berth was affected by the fact that fishing boats were docked in the proposed area. In May, three fishermen drowned as six fishing boats capsized off Vizhinjam coast. The fishermen had said that the small fishing boats which went from Poonthura and Vizhinjam met with the accident due to strong winds and heavy shower. Owing to the bad weather, some of the boats soon returned to the shore. There was a dangerous channel near the harbour where boats were lashed by strong waves and that’s where the accident occurred, they had said. The families of fishermen had raised concerns over the manner in which the ships capsized close to the harbour. According to them, they had never encountered such high waves in that channel close to the harbour and this was the reason why many boats were caught in the strong waves in the channel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/special-committee-to-review-report-on-wave-disturbances/articleshow/85543493.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 40,000 ticketless commuters on locals fined Rs 1 crore in a week||MUMBAI: More than 40,000 commuters who were either not vaccinated or only had taken a single dose were caught for travelling ticketless on the suburban network since August 15 and nearly Rs 1 crore in fines recovered from them, officials said. The rules permit only those with double vaccines to travel by local trains 14 days after their second shot, with a monthly season pass. In just a week after the rules were relaxed, there were 3 lakh general commuters with double vaccines travelling using season passes. Passenger rights groups have demanded that the railways also issue daily tickets to the fully vaccinated. Those caught ticketless at 53 stations were mainly citizens who were going to their workplace and were ‘desperate’ to travel. Some of them were daily wage earners, who do not want to buy monthly passes at all. A commuter, requesting anonymity, said: “There is a gap of 84 days between two vaccines and we have to wait for 15 more days before we are authorised to travel by train. It is too long a wait. Since trains are the best mode of transport, there will be cases of ticketless travelling.” The general public is denied daily journey tickets and hence travel ticketless, said a CR official. Subhash Gupta, president of Rail Yatri Parishad, said: “The railways usually appeal to people to travel only if it is necessary and urgent. So, they should be issuing daily tickets as many double vaccinated commuters may not want to travel by train everyday. They should have the option of buying a ticket for a single day journey for some urgent work or in case of an emergency.” Statistics provided by the CR showed that between August 11 and August 20, a total of 34,391 passengers were caught without tickets. CR collected a fine of Rs 1.42 crore from these offenders. Of these, nearly 14,100 were fined between August 15 and August 20. On CR, the average number of passengers caught without ticket per day since August 15 stood at 2,348 compared to 1,450 passengers per day between August 1 and August 14. On WR, since August 13, 167 passengers were caught without tickets. WR collected Rs 34.12 lakh from these offenders. In the period from August 15 to August 21, nearly 4,622 passengers were caught from whom Rs 12.05 lakh was collected as penalty. A WR official said, “On an average, 40 passengers more are caught without ticket per day since train travel was opened to fully vaccinated people from August 15. Prior to August 15, the average number of passengers caught without tickets stood at 610 per day.” The railways has so far recovered over Rs 8 crore in fines from ticketless travellers since April. Gupta said he woud petition the government to allow those in the 18-44 age group to travel with a single dose vaccine as they have “higher immunity” than those above 45 years of age. “We are stringent when it comes to imposing fines on ticketless travellers. In fact, we have been conducting fortress checks (TCs at all entry/exit points of a station and on FOBs etc) during office peak hours and catching these illegal travellers,” said CR chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar. The fine is Rs 260 plus the train fare, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/40k-ticketless-commuters-on-locals-fined-rs-1cr-in-a-wk/articleshow/85548074.cms||Somit Sen
---||Ludhiana||AAP yet to pick CM face in Punjab, but Bhagwant Mann backers start campaign||JALANDHAR/BATHINDA: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) search for its chief ministerial face in Punjab is not yet over but party workers expect a decision soon. After the announcement following a meeting of party MLAs with AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal, an aggressive campaign is on by MP and state unit president Bhagwant Mann’s supporters on social media. However, sources said Mann is angry with the party for not believing in him and has stopped political activities. A common refrain in social media posts is Mann is AAP’s only option, not only due to his prominence and popularity but also because he worked hard for the party and without him, it can collapse in Punjab. Some posts suggest the party can form government in Punjab only if Mann is declared CM candidate. In a TV interview recently, AAP youth wing vice-president and Kharar constituency in-charge Anmol Gagan Mann said, “He (Mann) worked really hard for the party in Punjab and he should be the CM face.” Speculation increased after Kejriwal announced that a Sikh would be CM face in Punjab. After the August 1 meeting, party supporters expected the announcement to be made this month. After AAP announced its CM face from Uttarakhand, the Punjab unit also wants central leadership to make public its choice as elections are due in both states in February 2022. “In what direction the party’s campaign would go mainly depends on the announcement of CM face, especially after AAP made it clear that a CM face would be announced, unlike the 2017 elections. If party volunteers are anxious, Mann’s supporters in the last few days have been openly campaigning for his name,” said an old party activist. “While a lot would depend on how the party takes its campaign further and raises issues, the most crucial factor now would be the CM face. There are not many options,” said a local AAP leader. Mann has been silent on the issue despite being vocal on other issues, including attacking other party leaders. Sources said the MP is angry over party hints of not announcing him as CM face and has stopped all political activities over the last few days. They said as Mann declined to attend a party meeting (rally) at Baba Bakala in Amritsar on the occasion of Rakhar Puniya on Sunday, the party decided not to go ahead with it. Even as many AAP volunteers claim they do not fear disciplinary action for starting a campaign in Mann’s support, AAP has suspended a youth leader from Zira in Ferozepur for writing against the leadership and in support of Mann. Sandeep Singh from Gurthari village in Mansa said Mann’s contribution in getting the party to this level should not be overlooked and he should be made the CM face. “A campaign has started on social media for this. If Bhagwant Mann is not announced as the CM face, the campaign will be intensified,” he said. Mann’s NRI supporter with roots in Ludhiana, Sunny Rai claimed no other AAP leader had what “Bhagwant Mann has done for the party”. He added, “Despite all this if the party ignores him, it will not be acceptable. Hundreds of party volunteers and members are approaching me to intensify the campaign and we are of the view that we want to raise this campaign within the party for its benefit.” While Mann wasn’t available for comment, AAP general secretary Harchand Singh Barsat said, “Any decision to be taken is to be done by the political affairs committee and workers should wait for it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/aap-yet-to-finalise-cm-face-but-mann-backers-say-hes-the-man/articleshow/85548111.cms||IP Singh

The POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act has been invoked as well. The girl died on Saturday. According to police, the girl was a resident of government quarters near the Chartoda burial ground. She was taken to Shardaben Hospital in Saraspur with lower abdominal pain and severe bleeding. When doctors examined her, they found that she was pregnant and was about to give birth. Police were informed as it became evident that she was a minor and, in all probability, a victim of rape. Doctors took her to the labour room where she delivered the stillborn child and her condition deteriorated. “Due to excessive bleeding, she went into a coma and died 15 to 20 minutes after giving birth,” said inspector J K Rathod of Gomtipur police. Rathod said that the accused is unknown because the girl died without being able to speak. “According to the hospital records, she gave the name of someone called Sahil but did not know anything about his whereabouts,” he said. Police suspect that the girl was raped eight to nine months ago. Investigators have sent DNA samples of the dead child for a forensic examination. As the girl died while delivering a child, police have charged the accused with culpable homicide not amounting to murder as raping her took her life, said a cop. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/teen-dies-as-mother-cops-file-rape-case/articleshow/85545968.cms||---
---||Amritsar||AAP yet to pick CM face in Punjab, but Bhagwant Mann backers start campaign||JALANDHAR/BATHINDA: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) search for its chief ministerial face in Punjab is not yet over but party workers expect a decision soon. After the announcement following a meeting of party MLAs with AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal, an aggressive campaign is on by MP and state unit president Bhagwant Mann’s supporters on social media. However, sources said Mann is angry with the party for not believing in him and has stopped political activities. A common refrain in social media posts is Mann is AAP’s only option, not only due to his prominence and popularity but also because he worked hard for the party and without him, it can collapse in Punjab. Some posts suggest the party can form government in Punjab only if Mann is declared CM candidate. In a TV interview recently, AAP youth wing vice-president and Kharar constituency in-charge Anmol Gagan Mann said, “He (Mann) worked really hard for the party in Punjab and he should be the CM face.” Speculation increased after Kejriwal announced that a Sikh would be CM face in Punjab. After the August 1 meeting, party supporters expected the announcement to be made this month. After AAP announced its CM face from Uttarakhand, the Punjab unit also wants central leadership to make public its choice as elections are due in both states in February 2022. “In what direction the party’s campaign would go mainly depends on the announcement of CM face, especially after AAP made it clear that a CM face would be announced, unlike the 2017 elections. If party volunteers are anxious, Mann’s supporters in the last few days have been openly campaigning for his name,” said an old party activist. “While a lot would depend on how the party takes its campaign further and raises issues, the most crucial factor now would be the CM face. There are not many options,” said a local AAP leader. Mann has been silent on the issue despite being vocal on other issues, including attacking other party leaders. Sources said the MP is angry over party hints of not announcing him as CM face and has stopped all political activities over the last few days. They said as Mann declined to attend a party meeting (rally) at Baba Bakala in Amritsar on the occasion of Rakhar Puniya on Sunday, the party decided not to go ahead with it. Even as many AAP volunteers claim they do not fear disciplinary action for starting a campaign in Mann’s support, AAP has suspended a youth leader from Zira in Ferozepur for writing against the leadership and in support of Mann. Sandeep Singh from Gurthari village in Mansa said Mann’s contribution in getting the party to this level should not be overlooked and he should be made the CM face. “A campaign has started on social media for this. If Bhagwant Mann is not announced as the CM face, the campaign will be intensified,” he said. Mann’s NRI supporter with roots in Ludhiana, Sunny Rai claimed no other AAP leader had what “Bhagwant Mann has done for the party”. He added, “Despite all this if the party ignores him, it will not be acceptable. Hundreds of party volunteers and members are approaching me to intensify the campaign and we are of the view that we want to raise this campaign within the party for its benefit.” While Mann wasn’t available for comment, AAP general secretary Harchand Singh Barsat said, “Any decision to be taken is to be done by the political affairs committee and workers should wait for it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/aap-yet-to-finalise-cm-face-but-mann-backers-say-hes-the-man/articleshow/85551569.cms||IP Singh

The apartment complex needs to be within a five km radius of the legislative assembly building, and the period of accommodation will be two years. The Pamba block of the MLA hostel is at present in a bad condition and needs to be revamped. The legislative assembly secretariat has laid down a set of conditions in the EoIs notification. It states that all rooms need to be fully furnished and visitors shall be allowed to the apartment complex. Resting rooms for assembly staff and security staff deployed for the service of MLAs in the apartment complex needs to be arranged. The assembly secretariat will take care of rent, water and power charges. The provision of maintenance fee payment is not mentioned in the EoIs notification. Given the high rent rates in areas around the assembly complex, the authorities will have to shell out a sizable sum for a period of two years. The officials said the drawings by PWD for the reconstruction of Pamba block have been completed and an estimate is being prepared for the reconstruction works. As per the EoI notification, each apartment should have two bath attached rooms, an office room, a dining hall, a kitchen, and a common bath room.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/eois-invited-for-flat-complex-for-18-mlas/articleshow/85543525.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On August 19, a SUV had rammed a tree along the road at Khandala ghat village in Pusad tehsil. The four-wheeler coming from Madhya Pradesh was headed to Ramnagar near Mahur. Senior PI Bodkhe said the accident had occurred on a road with sparse traffic movement. “While inspecting the car, a water bottle was found stuck under the brake and clutch pedals. It had to be pulled out with force. It almost became clear that the driver was unable to operate the brake and clutch,” said Bodkhe. Bodkhe said he asked a constable to shoot the video on the spot to explain how the accident took place and its cause. “There was neither script nor preparation but just an impromptu effort to create awareness and ensure motorists don’t repeat this mistake of keeping anything under the driver’s seat,” he said. The senior PI said the accident reminded him of a similar incident few years back on Solapur-Pandharpur Road in which around eight people had died. “A bottle was found stuck under brake and clutch pedals then,” said Bodkhe who has also worked in Nagpur city in the past. Bodkhe said he regrets not making a bi-lingual video which was shot in Marathi. “I had been receiving calls from across Maharashtra appreciating the content of the video. It could have been forwarded to other states too had it been shot in Hindi,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-ghastly-accident-cop-makes-on-the-spot-awareness-video/articleshow/85545992.cms||Soumitra Bose

Police said Arti and her toddler son, Prashant, had come to her parents’ house on Saturday to celebrate Rakshabandhan. Arti lives in Mahagun society in Indirapuram and her husband Chetan is a tour operator. In the evening, Arti and her mother, Rajini, went out shopping in the local market along with the child. While returning, they were caught in the sudden downpour. As they did not carry any umbrella with them, Arti and her mother decided to wait under the dilapidated building until the rain subsided. “A few minutes later, a portion of the building gave away. All three were trapped under the debris. Residents from nearby houses rushed to their rescue and took them to a nearby private hospital. The child succumbed to injuries during treatment while his mother was referred to Safdarjung hospital as she had suffered grievous injuries to the head,” said Abhay Mishra, the circle officer of Indirapuram. The body was handed over to the family after an autopsy. No complaint had been lodged into the incident till late on Sunday evening. Residents said the house had been abandoned several years ago. “It had been like this for the past five years at least. We had asked the municipal corporation to demolish the building as it could collapse anytime,” said Anil Sharma, a resident. A senior officer of Khoda police station said they would write to the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation to identify dangerous buildings. “We will urge them to demolish such structures. They could pose a threat to anybody passing by,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/toddler-dies-as-abandoned-building-collapses-in-gzb/articleshow/85546026.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana govt not doing enough for Hyderabad’s Kamans, say experts||HYDERABAD: When you think of heritage in Hyderabad, all that comes to mind are the forts, palaces and tombs. But what we often fail to notice are the more ubiquitous structures – the Kamans (arches), which stand as an epitome of the glorious past. Most of these Kamans, that once served as grand entrances for some important landmarks, are now wallowing in neglect. One such arch is the historic Hussaini Alam Kaman, on the busy road of Dhoodhbaoli and Hussaini Alam. The kaman, which was erected during the Nizam era, stands as an entrance to the 400-year-old Ashoorkhana in Hyderabad’s Old City. However, with chunks of concrete falling off every now and then, locals urge the authorities to take up immediate repairs. “The situation is worse during the monsoon. Even after several representations to the authorities, no official has ever visited to conduct an inspection and gauge the structural viability,” said Mohammad Ahmed, a social activist. He said the Kaman may end up facing the same fate as the Nizam-era Bela Kaman in Shalibanda which had to be razed by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation after a portion of it crumbled down last year. Another Kaman, also on its last legs is the Mir Alam Mandi Kaman, with chunks of concrete falling off every now and then. The Kaman, which was erected during the Nizam era, stands as an entrance to one of the oldest and most bustling markets in Hyderabad. “Instead of renovating the heritage structure, authorities have erected iron pillars to support the weight of the concrete about two years ago. The iron pillars were only a temporary fix to the problem and we are not sure how long we can rely on this arrangement,” said Ghulam Dastagir, 62, who has been selling vegetables in the market for the past 40 years. SN Surya Kumar, the GHMC official who inspected the Kaman in December last year, said that there is no threat to the structure collapsing. But Mir Muzaffer Ali, president, Mir Alam Mandi Vegetable Commission Agent Association said, “Many vehicles pass through the kaman, which causes vibration inside the structure and chunks of concrete keep falling.” Historians said that the four arches near Charminar that were built along with Charminar in 1591 are also in need of repair. “The Shahi Julu Khana Kaman was one of the many entrances to the Chowmahalla Palace. Unfortunately, due to lack of attention, the plaster is gone and only some broken stones remain,’’ rued Mohammad Saahil, one of the shopkeepers in the area told TOI. Since we are now aiming for the world heritage tag for Hyderabad, heritage activists said that is time that the government takes up restoration of these historical arches that dot the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-not-doing-enough-for-citys-kamans-say-experts/articleshow/85548145.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Hyderabad||Locals in peril as Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation sits on restoration of dug-up roads||HYDERABAD: The dug-up roads in many busy stretches in the Old City have reduced commuting to a daily hazard for the past few months. Most connecting roads and by-lanes have been lying in a state of neglect after being ripped open for civic works, turning them into danger zones for pedestrians and motorists alike. “The stretch starting after Subhan bakery road near Ek Minar in Nampally was dug up for some civic work a few weeks ago. But nothing has be done after that. There is absolutely no space for pedestrians and traffic crawls here during peak hours,” said Mohammad Aslam, a mechanic. At Charminar, civic authorities have left open drains on either side of the road across Laad Bazaar. For over two months now shop owners from Charminar to Moti Galli have been forced to lay wooden planks over these drains to help out potential customers. “The civic body dug up the road in April during lockdown. At the time we were told that it would not take more than a month to finish the work. Our customers risk their lives to enter our shops by walking on these planks arranged by us,” said Osman Baig, a bangle store owner. The GHMC officials, however, said that they have asked all government and private agencies to restore these roads at the earliest. “GHMC has banned road cutting from June 1 to October 31, including those that come under the comprehensive road maintenance programme. We will certainly take up the matter if work has been left pending,” said GHMC chief engineer (maintenance) M Devanand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/locals-in-peril-as-ghmc-sits-on-restoration-of-dug-up-roads/articleshow/85548149.cms||---

There is provision for parking of more than 1,000 cars at this single location. One of the features of this facility is that it does not have ramps and is automated. This will be the largest addition to the parking infrastructure in the city. The smart parking facility is under development opposite the Event Ground on the west side of riverfront. The upcoming iconic Foot Overbridge will be directly connected to the multi-level parking facility, claimed a Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Limited (SRFDCL) official. He added, “Visitors can directly go to Flower Park or access the promenades from the parking facility. There will be an E-zone for electric vehicles, where visitors can charge their vehicles.” The city presently has 74 authorized parking sites. Of these, 40 are off-street parking lots, four are multi-level parking facilities, nine are on-street parking and the remaining 21 are below flyovers.

However, as the western end of the monsoon trough is likely to shift northwards, the rain activity may be subdued from Monday. India Meteorological Data shows Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station, and Palam recorded 9.2 mm and 12.4 mm rainfall, respectively, till 8.30am on Sunday. However, both stations did not record any rainfall between 8.30am and 8.30pm on Sunday. Some observatories reported light to very light rain during the same period. Sports Complex recorded 11mm rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm. SPS Mayur Vihar, Najafgarh and Pitampura reported 0.5 mm rainfall each during the same period. Ridge observatory recorded ‘trace’ rainfall. A Met official said a cyclonic circulation lies over northeast Rajasthan and, hence, the western end of the monsoon trough passes through south of its normal position. Under its influence, light rain or drizzle was recorded at some places on Sunday. “As the cyclonic circulation becomes less marked by Monday, the western end of the monsoon trough is very likely to shift northwards from Monday and, consequently, rain probability over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, West Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan would reduce substantially thereafter,” said a met official. The forecast of the Met department says light rain or thundershowers at isolated places is predicted on Monday. There is a possibility of very light rain or thundershowers on Tuesday. No rain activity is expected from August 25 to 28. “Strong surface winds at the speed of 20-30 kmph are predicted during the day on Monday and Tuesday,” said a met official. The maximum temperature was recorded at 34.3 degrees Celsius on Sunday. The minimum temperature settled at 24.5 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 97% and 69%. A met official said the maximum temperature is likely to hover around 35-36 degrees Celsius over the next few days. Delhi’s air quality, meanwhile, continued to remain in ‘satisfactory’ category. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of the national capital was 59.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-to-lose-intensity-from-today-temp-to-rise-slightly/articleshow/85546108.cms||---

An FIR has been lodged. Sushil Kumar (34) was managing traffic near Chipiyana when three men travelling in a car reached the area around 8 pm. They allegedly stopped the vehicle in the middle of the road, which led to congestion. “Due to Rakshabandhan, several people were out on the streets. The car suddenly stopped in the middle of the road and it led to a jam, which lasted 30-45 minutes,” Kumar said. He added that when he reached the area, he saw the person driving the car was on a call. “Two others were consuming liquor inside the vehicle. When I asked them to stop, one man got off and started arguing with me. Soon, the other two joined him and they started hitting me. They tore my uniform and then fled in the car,” Kumar said. He contacted Bisrakh police and later, filed a complaint. He said he took a picture of the car as well.Anita Chauhan, SHO, Bisrakh, said an FIR has been lodged against three unidentified men under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. “We are trying to trace the vehicle,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/traffic-cop-thrashed-in-bisrakh-3-booked/articleshow/85546070.cms||---
---||Pune||Trail to siphoned-off funds from Pune leads to gang in custody of UP police||PUNE: An investigation into the siphoning-off of funds from the bank accounts of three people from the city between February and May has led the Pune cyber police to an 11-member Gorakhpur-based gang which is now in the custody of the Uttar Pradesh police. The gang is suspected to have siphoned off money from another 10 to 12 bank accounts in Pune. The gang used forged Aadhaar cards to link their own mobile numbers in place of the victims’ contact numbers with the bank and changed PINs to carry out fraudulent transactions. The suspects also cloned ATM cards, police said. Last week, the UP police had arrested the gang members for cheating several people using a similar modus operandi. Deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Bhagyashree Navatake told TOI, “The victims told us that they had never shared their PIN or other confidential account details with any person nor did they click a suspicious link or download an unknown file.” She said the city cyber police traced the fraudsters to Gorakhpur after gathering details of the bank accounts into which the victims’ money was transferred, the ATMs from where cash was withdrawn etc. “By the time we got in touch with our UP counterparts, they were already on the gang’s trail and arrested them last week,” said Navatake. “Our investigation is now focused on finding out when and how the victims’ account details, such as the name, account number, bank branch and others, were obtained,” she said. “We are verifying with the banks how the accounts were compromised,” said the officer. The police’s preliminary investigation has revealed that after fraudulently obtaining bank account details, the suspects cloned ATM cards with the same PIN. “They initiated a KYC update to link their cellphone number with the victims’ bank accounts using fake Aadhaar cards and then siphoned off money,” said Navatake. The money from the accounts of the victims was withdrawn from different parts of Uttar Pradesh, Noida and other northern cities,” she said. Police suspect that apart from victims in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, the suspects also targeted people based in other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/trail-to-siphoned-off-funds-leads-to-gang-in-custody-of-up-police/articleshow/85546121.cms||Gitesh Shelke

As many as 136 mandals have an active caseload between 5 and 9 each. Only five mandals currently have more than 100 active cases each, including three in Prakasam and two in East Godavari, as per the data available with the TOI as of August 16. The disease hotspot, East Godavari, has at least 10 active cases in 56 mandals, the highest for any district in the state. When it comes to the 111 municipalities and corporations, only 10 urban local bodies have more than 100 active cases each. Vizag city leads the chart with 475 active cases, followed by Ongole (450), Vijayawada (371), Nellore (218), and Rajahmundry (184). As many as 95 ULBs have less than 50 active cases each. Seven municipalities and corporations have an active caseload between 50 and 100. The daily Covid-19 infections started to increase from the first week of March in what was presumed to be the beginning of the second wave, after the first wave had flattened with just 30 cases on February 15. Andhra Pradesh recorded only some 2,100 cases in the entire February. The daily infections peaked to 24,171 on May 16 in the second wave. In May alone, the state recorded nearly 5.9 lakh Covid-19 cases, averaging 20,000 cases a day. From the second half of June, the daily case numbers witnessed a gradual improvement. The daily infections have settled around 1,500 to 3,000 for the last several weeks with an average case positivity rate of 2-3% from the peak of about 25% in May. The state denotified nearly 380 hospitals from the Covid-19 services in the last two months with the gradually improving situation. Even though the state is currently reporting manageable daily infection numbers, the state officials ask the public not to lower the guard against the pandemic. Dr K Rambabu, State Covid-19 nodal officer, said that several countries are reeling from the third wave of the pandemic. “There are early signs of the third wave in several parts of the country. Public should adhere to all the Covid-19 precautions,” said Dr Rambabu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-19-cases-drop-but-no-time-to-lower-guard-govt/articleshow/85543672.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Ahmedabad||Cannot ask a woman who her child’s father is: Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has raised a pertinent question on whether a woman can be forced to reveal the name of child of her father, when she reaches alone for delivery of the child. Justice Paresh Upadhyay repeatedly asked the question to government lawyers, “If a woman conceives a child and she is not married, and goes to a hospital, will the doctor ask who is the father of the child? If the woman says that she does not want to answer the question, in such circumstances, is she under obligation to disclose whose child she is carrying?” The judge raised the question while hearing an appeal against a conviction filed by a man from Junagadh district, who has been punished for rape. In this case, after elopement, the couple had one child. While the woman was pregnant for the second time, the couple planned to marry. However, they could not do so as the woman reached marriageable age on March 25, 2020 when lockdown was in force. Finally, their marriage took place in January 2021. Unhappy with their union, the girl’s family lodged an FIR against the man for rape. On August 9, the high court granted bail to the man upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs 100 only. During a hearing on his appeal against his conviction to 10-year jail term on August 19, the court discussed about making the age of minority from 16 years to 18 years as any sexual relations with a woman under 18 years invites charges of statutory rape. Hinting at the Nirbhaya rape case protests, the judge orally observed that there were protests in urban areas and the government had amended the laws. He then asked, “Why should the girls in rural areas suffer (because of this)?” The court was discussing rural traditions of marriages at an early age, and particularly in tribal areas where marriage is not a pre-condition to giving birth to a child. The judge further said that the woman cannot marry before she turns 18 years of age, but she can give birth to a child. “When the woman is not making any complaint of rape and insists that it was her choice, will we be able to read criminality (into it)?” the court asked further, “The pure question of law would be if a woman conceives and she does not make any complaint and she is not married, which provision (of law) will be violated?” In this particular case, the court also said that the victim in this case was expelled from a hostel, but she still insisted on giving birth to her second child. “This daughter should be respected,” the judge said while hinting that the court may trash the charges against the father of the children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cannot-ask-a-woman-who-her-childs-father-is-hc/articleshow/85546135.cms||---

My son continues to be in his water grave and decaying unto his bones due to ill equipped search, experimentation and ‘jugad’ by concerned authorities,” said Capt Jayant’s father Harish Joshi (60), from Mamun Cantt over the phone. Search operation underway for Indian Army pilots and helicopter that crashed into Ranjit Sagar Dam, in JammuLt Col Abheet Singh Batth and Capt Jayant were on a low-level training sortie when their Advanced Light Helicopter-Weapon System Integrated (ALH-WSI) chopper, also called Rudra, developed a snag and crashed into the Ranjit Sagar dam in Jammu and Kashmir on August 3 morning. It went down at least 80 metres deep inside the water. The body of Amritsar native Lt Col Batth was recovered from the reservoir on August 15. “Imagine, my wife is a serving Colonel in the Military Nursing Service (MNS). She gave her son to the nation. Today she is waiting to see her son’s body, which is decaying in deep waters,” he added. Capt Jayant’s mother, Colonel Jiwan Tara is posted in the eastern theatre and has completed 40 years of service. Capt Jayant (27) took inspiration from her mother to join the Army. “There is no sensitivity and no respect for a soldier on the part of those leading. That is the fate of a soldier,” said the father in a choked and emotional voice. Neel, Capt Jayant’s elder brother, told TOI that his brother’s loss is now leading to a lot of trauma as well as health conditions for him and other family members. The search operation needs to conclude as soon as possible and if any help is required in terms of international equipment then that should be expedited, he added. “It is very surprising that two arms of the defence forces — the Army and the Navy — are engaged and after 20 days we are still waiting for the retrieval of chopper’s wreckage and Jayant’s body from a lake. It raises a lot of questions about the operation but we don’t want to go into that. At least give us back whatever is left there,” said Neel.  About Capt Jayant Capt Jayant Joshi was a product of Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan, in Delhi. He completed his graduation in electrical and electronics engineering before being commissioned in the Army in June 2017. For two years, he was attached with the 9 Sikh Light Infantry and served at the LOC. Thereafter, he joined the aviation branch, completed one year flying training and was posted at Mamun Cantonment. 3 pilots of same squadron killed in a month Capt Jayant’s father pointed out that in the last seven months, three pilots of the squadron have lost their lives in two separate crashes of Rudra chopper developed by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. One more pilot was seriously injured and may not be able to fly again, he said. “One by one, they are dying and it is a cause of concern which should be probed,” he alleged. In earlier incident on January 25 this year, a chopper had crash landed in Lakhanpur area of Kathua district in Jammu and Kashmir in which Lt Col Rishubh Sharma (36) had died while the co-pilot Capt Anjani Kumar Singh was seriously injured. The Questions Harish Joshi says it was on the second day of the crash that the Navy divers who were flown in from Mumbai dived into the waters beyond humanly possible capabilities, nearly up to 60 metres down. “They gave detailed first-hand account to the authorities on the same day that there is flush and mud below there and the visibility is very low. But even then the authorities could not decide what actually should be the strategy and indulged in experiments one after another,” he alleged. The father says that it was the family’s luck that by God’s grace Colonel Baath’s body was found at the depth of nearly 75 metres on August 15 evening when the team was winding up the operations for the day. “It was only an incidental finding,” he claimed adding that “the body was lying outside the chopper at least at a distance of seven metres”. The Joshi family says they have no problem with the human efforts being made to search the body by the divers as they are going beyond what is humanly possible and one of the divers even had to be admitted to ICU. They say though the search team has located the chopper but their equipment is unable to see what is inside the chopper. Western Command responds When contacted by TOI for the update on the search operation, the Army’s western command authorities said, “Indian Army is making earnest efforts to retrieve the second crew of the ill-fated helicopter which crashed in the Ranjit Sagar reservoir on August 3. All possible methods continue to be undertaken by the Army and the Navy, including employment of specialist divers, use of latest available hi-tech equipment like multi-beam sonar, side scanners along with underwater remotely operated vehicles. Salvage operations will continue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/indian-army-chopper-crash-20-days-on-family-disheartened/articleshow/85548243.cms||Sanjeev Verma

Responding to a media query, Nitish said the demand for caste census was an important issue. "We have been demanding it for a long time," he added. Nitish will lead an 11-member delegation of 10 political parties from Bihar and meet the PM in New Delhi on Monday to press for caste-based census in the country. The meeting will be held at 11am. "The people of Bihar are not the only ones asking for a caste-based census but the entire country is in favour of it. Leaders of all political parties from Bihar will together meet the PM and put forward this demand," Nitish said. The CM and some other members of the delegation reached Delhi on Sunday. Leader of opposition in Bihar assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who will represent RJD in the delegation, too is in Delhi. The long-pending demand for a caste census was revived in July this year after the Centre informed the Lok Sabha it would not enumerate population caste-wise, except those from SCs and STs. Earlier, Maharashtra and Odisha governments too had requested the Centre to collect caste details in the forthcoming census.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-led-10-party-team-to-meet-pm-modi-on-august-23/articleshow/85550213.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Road rage turns to rioting near Jejuri, 5 injured||PUNE: A quarrel that started over a tractor operator not letting three car drivers overtake him, led to rioting and firing incident around 8.15pm on Saturday at Pargaon near Jejuri in Purandar taluka. No one was reported injured in the firing. Five members of a farmer’s family were injured in a brutal assault by 12 men, mostly criminals on police records, from Kapurhol, Narayangaon and Bhilarewadi in Bhor taluka, besides, Veer and other villages in Purandar. Soon after the incident, the Pune rural police launched an elaborate combing operation in Bhor and Purandar villages and managed to detain eight of the alleged assailants while a hunt continued for the remaining four, including the person, who opened fire at a tractor being driven by the complainant Sachin Memane’s cousin, Ganesh. A police case was registered early on Sunday morning and the combing operation continued till late Sunday evening. Earlier on Saturday afternoon, the Memane’s father and other members of the family were travelling in a tractor being operated by his cousin, from Jejuri to Pargaon, when the suspects, who were travelling behind in three cars, honked several times to let them overtake the vehicle. The tractor operator took some time in giving them the way at an opportune moment on the narrow road. The suspects lost their patience in the process, the police said. They started quarrelling with the Memane family and left the spot. Inspector Sunil Mahadik of the Jejuri police station told TOI, “Around 8.15pm, the 12 suspects, most of them in the age group of 19-23 years and armed with stones, sharp weapons and rods, came back to Pargaon and barged into the Memane’s home to attack the family members present there. They also created a ruckus in the area. The complainant’s cousin came to know about the ruckus and he drove his tractor towards Memane’s house. On spotting the tractor, one of the suspects opened fire in the direction of the vehicle. The suspects then fled in their cars.” “In the assault, the family members sustained cuts on their hands and head injuries,” police said. A case has been registered on the charges of attempt to murder, rioting, voluntarily causing grievous hurt, and criminal intimidation against the 12 men.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/road-rage-turns-to-rioting-near-jejuri-five-injured/articleshow/85546145.cms||Gitesh Shelke

The KMC has appealed to the operators of commercial establishments to register their staff for vaccination and accordingly a drive can be organised. As per recent order issued by the state government, it is mandatory for operators of commercial establishments to have their staff fully vaccinated. Those with one or no doses are not be allowed to work. Most of the staff of commercial establishments is young and non-vaccinated. Kadambari Balkawade, chief administrator of KMC, said, “Special vaccination camp is being arranged not only for those working with large commercial establishments, but also for small traders, vegetable vendors, among others. We have asked our teams to make the stakeholders aware of the government rules and then initiate action against those who have not vaccinated their staff.” The customers entering the malls too should be fully vaccinated unless they are below 18 years in which case documents showing their age should be carried by them. Recently, district collector Rahul Rekhawar asked the local bodies to form ward level committees to randomly check whether rules are being followed strictly and has asked heads of civic bodies to ensure strict implementation of rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vaccination-camp-for-staff-of-commercial-establishments/articleshow/85541772.cms||---

With Nashik receiving good showers over the past few days, there have been many incidents of bikers falling on the road between Mumbai Naka and Swami Narayan Chowk. The road apparently becomes slippery due to accumulation of mud brought in by rain water. Bhartakumar Surayawanshi from the city traffic branch said water drainage system on the flyover has led to leakages at various places due to which water comes down through the pillars of the flyover and falls onto the tree-bed made on the divider of the road. This mud from the tree-bed gets washed on to the road making it slushy and slippery. This eventually leads to incidents of bikers falling on the road. However, once the rains are gone and the weather is dry, the problem of bikers skidding on the road stops. Highway officials on their part said there is no leakage in the drainage system and mud on the road comes from the tyres of vehicles. Now police and NMC have been asked to look into the issue and take measures to solve the problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/bhujbal-tells-police-nmc-to-resolve-problem-of-2-wheelers-skidding/articleshow/85541813.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The police have so far detected more than 12 such cases and recovered the stolen handsets. A crime branch officer said, “The men were involved in more than 15 such cases. We are questioning them.” He added that the duo mainly targeted employees of private companies as they waited for their buses early in the morning. “Most employees would either be talking on their cellphones or they’d be busy checking their messages. The duo took advantage of the situation and started snatching the cellphones,” the officer said. After identifying a person waiting for the bus by themselves, the duo would stop their motorcycle near them. The pillion rider would snatch the handset and they’d speed away, the officer explained. The duo operated in various areas in Pimpri Chinchwad since March. “We have so far solved five robberies registered with the Chikhali police station, three with Nigdi and one each from Pimpri, Chinchwad, Bhosari MIDC, Chakan and Wakad police stations,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crime-branch-arrests-two-for-snatching-cellphones/articleshow/85546157.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: NIBM Road gets 14 CCTV cameras after residents complain of nuisance||PUNE: A total of 14 CCTV cameras were installed on the NIBM Road after residents repeatedly complained of passers-by creating a nuisance on the stretch. “Since the lockdown, there has been an increase in people driving at a high speed on this road late at night, past the curfew. They play loud music and honk while driving, creating a nuisance. It has become important to identify these persons and take steps for increased surveillance in the area,” a resident of Cloud Nine housing society said. A resident of Raheja Vista Premier, said, “Youngsters perform and record dangerous stunts on this stretch leading to Undri. Bikers, who have installed modified silencers, are found plying at a high speed in the middle of the night. This has led to accidents. We have also appealed for installation of speed breakers.” Local corporators of Prabhag 26 NIBM Mohmmedwadi Kausarbaug, Pramod Bhangire, and NIBM corporator Nanda Lokar took these complaints into consideration and with the help of the PMC, installed 14 CCTV cameras for increased surveillance in the area. Bhangire inaugurated the project of 14 CCTV surveillance systems installed at Raheja Vista Chowk, Ganga Florentina, Elina Living Chowk and other spots, where people had complained of the nuisance. He said some burglaries had also been reported in the area. “Many people have been complaining about people taking drugs, throwing syringes on the road, drinking alcohol and driving at a high speed. Sometimes, when the residents try to reason with the culprits, they get aggressive. Police complaints have also been made,” Lonkar said. In May, the residents met the police to find a solution to these problems, which have been ongoing since the lockdown last year. QR codes were installed at three housing societies in the area, where focus was on patrolling. Police also appealed to the corporators to install CCTV cameras for better surveillance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nibm-road-gets-14-cctv-cameras-after-residents-complain-of-nuisance/articleshow/85546190.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Social security schemes data show low expenditure||Thiruvananthapuram: Though the state has been taking immense pride regarding its strides in the social security sector, especially during the ongoing pandemic period, government data on physical achievements show otherwise. According to the state planning board data, only 9.62% of the total funds earmarked for 22 social security schemes have been spent in five months in the ongoing financial year. As per the data accessed by TOI, only Rs 15.44 crore of the total allocated Rs 160.46 crore for 22 social security schemes being implemented under the Kerala social security mission have been spent till date in the ongoing financial year. Even worse, 10 schemes of the 22 have not spent anything from the funds allocated. These include cancer Suraksha fund for child patients, Snehapoorvam (scheme for providing financial assistance to orphans living in a family, with their relatives, friends, or the support of the community), Ashwasa Kiranam (assistance to caregivers of bedridden or mentally- or physically-challenged patients), Sneha Sparsham (rehabilitation of unwed mothers and their children), package for victims of Endosulfan, Thalolam (free treatment to children below age of 18, suffering from kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cerebral palsy, brittle bone disease, Haemophilia, Thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, orthopedic deformities and other neuro-developmental disabilities, congenital anomalies and accident cases which need surgery), care providers for inmates of institutions under social justice department, funds for district early intervention centres, providing assistive solutions for persons with disabilities among flood victims and for providing trainings, research and new initiatives. For some of the schemes that have begun spending, the expenditure is miniscule. For example, the Samashwasam scheme that aims at providing financial assistance to kidney patients below poverty line, the expenditure is only Rs 18 lakhs (3.7%) out of Rs 5 crore allocated for the ongoing financial year. The highest expenditure among the social security schemes is for hunger-free city programme, for which only a miniscule Rs 50 lakh has been earmarked, out of which Rs 42 lakh have been spent. The highest allocation among all 22 schemes is for the Ashwasa Kiranam scheme for which Rs 40 crore has been allocated, but nothing has been spent till date. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said that such a lukewarm approach by the government towards social security schemes especially during the pandemic period is unjustifiable. “Funds are being allocated, but are not being spent would mean that there is serious lapse in monitoring the schemes. It is during testing times like Covid-19 that social security schemes become all the more important. For example, several petitions seek intervention for getting the funds released under Ashwasa Kiranam, which would have been of great relief to the beneficiaries,” Satheesan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/social-security-schemes-data-show-low-expenditure/articleshow/85543806.cms||KP Saikiran

Chugh said while the BJP had always stood for justice for the Sikhs, it was the Vajpayee government which had for the first time laid the list of the Congress leaders involved in the anti-Sikh riots. The Modi government has subsequently made sure that the culprits were brought to book. Chugh questioned the Congress leaders for their “affection and favour” to Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler even after they had been held guilty by the inquiry commission. The BJP leader questioned if Mali has been officially asked by Sidhu to attach such posts on Facebook. Earlier, Mali had ridiculed the nation by saying in a tweet that Jammu and Kashmir was not part of India, said Chugh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-praises-sidhu-aide-for-1984-talk/articleshow/85548280.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi court lowers sentence for woman in fraud case, calls for sensitivity||NEW DELHI: The agony of facing a criminal trial for three decades is in itself no less a punishment than the one eventually inflicted upon conviction, a Delhi court has said while reducing the imprisonment term of a woman, convicted of cheating in a financial crime case, from three years to five months. The court said that this deserved greater consideration in matter of sentencing since the prime of the woman’s youth was lost in facing criminal proceedings. “She (woman) is nearing the status of a senior citizen. The agony of facing a criminal trial for three decades is in itself no less a punishment than the one eventually inflicted upon conviction and deserves greater consideration in matter of sentencing since the prime of appellant’s (woman’s) youth was lost in facing criminal proceedings. There was no loss or destruction of public property nor any personal injury inflicted on any government official or to any member of the civil society. Appellant has been convicted of a financial crime. Apart from the present conviction, there has been no other allegation of criminal misdemeanour by the appellant,” special judge Ajay Gulati said in the order. The woman was convicted of cheating the Joint Controller of Import & Exports (Jt CCI&E) for getting sanctioned a higher amount of cash compensatory support (CCS) on the basis of an inflated invoice. The case was registered in October 1990 on the complaint by the office of Jt CCI&E, alleging that she had forged certain documents – bank certificates, disclaimer certificates, airway bills and invoices on eight occasions to claim the benefit for export of readymade garments. A magistrate court had in In July 2019, sentenced her to three years of rigorous imprisonment for the offences under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), and two years of imprisonment under section 468 read with 471 (using as genuine forged document) of the Indian Penal Code. The court had also directed her to pay a cumulative fine of Rs 5 lakh. She had challenged the magistrate court’s order before a sessions court. The sessions court said that it did not concur with the finding of the magistrate court so far as conviction of the woman under section 420 IPC read with section 467, 468 and 471 and under section 468 read with section 471 IPC was concerned. It said the prosecution was not able to prove forgery by the woman or use of forged documents by her. It, however, said that the conviction of the woman under section 420 IPC alone was affirmed since it stands proved that she had induced the office of Jt CCI&E to sanction her a higher amount of CCS on the basis of an inflated invoice. It also reduced the fine to Rs 4 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-lowers-sentence-for-woman-in-fraud-case-calls-for-sensitivity/articleshow/85546214.cms||Usha Das

Under the DBT scheme, the government will deposit the entire amount of electricity bill(s) into the accounts of farmers, and the farmers would pay to the Discoms. According to the state energy officials, the state government has introduced the DBT for the free power scheme, which the Union government also suggested implementing to improve the quality of power with accountability. The DBT scheme, which was implemented as a pilot project in Srikakulam district, was successful with 98.6 per cent of the farmers giving their consent voluntarily. As of now, there is no practical assessment or accurate measurement of the electricity load in the agriculture sector in the state. As per an official statement issued by the energy department on Sunday, energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli informed the energy minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy about the progress of the DBT scheme over the phone. “Under the DBT scheme, no farmer needs to pay a single penny from their pockets. The government will deposit the entire amount in the accounts of the farmers. The farmers will pay to power utilities, which will give a right to farmers to question the utilities to provide high quality power. This will certainly improve transparency and accountability among power utilities and provide right to demand for farmers” Srinivasa Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ryots-ready-for-installation-of-meters-under-dbt-scheme/articleshow/85543773.cms||---

Delhi government had recently approved the comprehensive action plan to phase out single-use plastic. A report prepared by the environment department in June said around 1,000 tonnes per day of plastic waste was being generated in Delhi and there were nearly 315 recyclers, 251 producers and 364 manufacturers in the capital. The notice issued by DPCC stated, “All producers, importers, brand owners, recyclers and manufacturers of carry bags, recyclable plastic bags, multi-layered packaging and processing of plastic waste in Delhi are directed to apply online on the DPCC website for registration and under Plastic Waste Management (Amended) Rules, 2018 and consent to operate under Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 by August 31.” It also said action would be taken against defaulters, including closure of units, disconnection of electricity and water supply and levying of environmental compensation. An official said the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change had notified Plastic Waste Management (Amended) Rules, 2018 and it applied to waste generators, processors and manufacturers of plastic carry bags and multi-layered packaging material. With the Centre aiming to phase out single-use plastic by 2022, the notification of the environment ministry said polythene bags of less than 75 microns in thickness would be banned from September 30 this year and bags of less than 120 microns would not be allowed from December 31, 2022. At present, polythene bags of less than 50 microns are banned. However, manufacture, sale, distribution and use of single-use plastic commodities would be prohibited from July 1 next year. Such items include earbuds with plastic sticks, candy sticks, plastic flags, ice-cream sticks, cutlery and wrapping films for sweets boxes. Last week, Delhi government gave a nod to the Comprehensive Action Plan for elimination of identified single-use plastics. The plan has steps to be taken by various agencies while adhering to the deadlines. The Delhi environment department had also conducted virtual meetings with all stakeholders on identifying potential single-use plastic alternatives and their feasibility. Earlier this year, Delhi government had constituted a special task force under the chairmanship of the chief secretary to take measures to eliminate single-use plastic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/noose-is-tightening-around-generators-of-plastic-waste/articleshow/85543941.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The workers will be hired on a temporary basis for a period of six months. “The NMC has inadequate staff for sanitation in the city. Hence, outsourcing manpower will help maintain cleanliness at these two major Covid hospitals of the civic body during the third wave of the pandemic,” an NMC official said. Around 400 posts of sanitation workers are vacant following retirement of old workers during the last few years. As no recruitment has taken place in the past due to lack of permission by the state government on the ground of high administrative expenses, the solid waste management department is facing manpower shortage. In order to meet the requirement of sanitation workers, the NMC had outsourced 700 workers from a private agency on the contract basis around a year back. These workers were deployed in two of the six divisions. But the pressure on existing sanitation workers has increased in the city due to Covid-19. Due to this the NMC has decided to outsource 200 workers and deploy them at its two Covid hospitals. While 150 workers are to be deployed at Bytco hospital, 50 will be deployed at Zakir Hussain hospital. Meanwhile, the general body of the NMC during its recent meeting had adjourned the proposal of the civic administration due lack of financial information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/200-sanitation-workers-to-be-outsourced-by-nmc/articleshow/85541850.cms||Tushar Pawar

While addressing the 28th Foundation Day of the National Research Center for Banana (NRCB) Trichy, he stressed on taking the banana cultivation to next level by including the latest technologies. Chief guest at the event, S K Malhotra, agriculture commissioner, government of India, said that the banana has nutritional importance for human health and there is a need to increase the banana export potential by promoting the ‘Cluster approach’. “Under the Atmanirbhar Bharat, the importance of branding has been gaining momentum for all the products besides the ‘One district one product’ (ODOP) programme. The development of small and medium-scale industries is also being given importance. Trichy and Theni districts were covered under ODOP for banana development. Further, tissue culture plants were promoted for uniform growth and development to attract lucrative prices in the export market in banana cultivation,” he added. S Uma, director of NRCB, in her presidential address, said that the institute brought a change in banana cultivation by introducing banana improvement, production, protection and post-harvest technologies. The bananas produced here are categorized under banana value chain (BVC) 1 and BVC 2. BVC 1 is the traditional value chain in which small farmers sell their products in nearby market destinations. BVC 2 is the state of the art value chain in which farmers sell their produce to both major and independent dealers. Still, the approach of BVC has to be improved in order to double the farmers’ income. Hence, the institute is focusing towards improved BVC and its marketing, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/modern-tech-can-raise-banana-export-triple-farmers-income/articleshow/85546256.cms||---

Also, 43,727.89 acres were destroyed in wild-fire over the last one decade. As per data available with assembly records, 261 court cases are pending in various courts of Kerala in connection with encroachment. Forests minister AK Saseendran had stated in assembly that only after the disposal of these cases the department will be able to evict all the encroachments. The government evicted encroachers in 522.9302 acres of forest land in the past five years. But, as per statistics, the extent of area under forests in state increased in the last one decade. Between 2011 and 2019, the total area under forest increased by 210.5826 sq km. It was 11,309.4754 sq km of forest in 2011, it increased to 11,520.058 sq km by 2019. Government was taking steps to include mangroves, puramboke land, forest areas that are yet to be declared as reserve forests under the category of forests to preserve them. The government has already notified 237.92 hectare of mangroves in Kannur and 3.3853 hectare in Thrissur as reserve forests under Section 19 of the Forest Act. Additionally, it has proposed to declare 536.3709 acres as reserve forests in Alappuzha, Thrissur, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Kasaragod under Section 4 of the Forest Act. The government has also proposed to take over private estates, lying close to forest boundaries, under Rebuild Kerala Development Programme (RKDP) and formulated another project to take over human-inhabited areas within the forests with funding from Kerala infrastructure investment fund board (KIIFB). Thirteen private estates under six forest divisions were shortlisted for takeover under RKDP. As much as Rs 385.31 crore has been earmarked for taking over these estates under Section 4 (1) of the Kerala Forests (vesting and management of ecologically fragile lands) Act, 2003, or the Land Acquisition Act. However, the government is yet to finalize the boundaries of such private estates, said the data. Saseendran had also said that the government has been taking multiple steps including re-surveying the forest boundaries, taking instant action against encroachments, setting up more forest stations, modernizing the department with more vehicles, wireless stations and other equipment in order to protect forest land. As much as 29.65% of the total area of the state are forests, of which 9,195.735 sq km are reserve forests, 291.575 sq km are proposed reserves and 1,905.476 sq km are vested forests and ecologically-fragile lands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/forest-encroachments-crossed-12000-acres/articleshow/85553855.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Pune||Maharashtra IGR department almost matches revenue in pre-pandemic time in July||PUNE: Riding on high-value transactions, the state registration department has this year achieved 93% of the July revenue target of 2019, or the pre-pandemic time. “It is a good sign that we were able to come close to achieving the 2019 target even as there were no sops in July this year. The total revenue earned by the department in July this year was Rs 2,411.75 crore as against Rs 2,594.2 crore in 2019,” state inspector General of Registration and Stamps (IGR) Shravan Hardikar said. The department had registered 1,69,532 documents in July this year as compared to 2,58,632 in July, 2019. But the revenue amount is just less by 7%. Maharashtra had seen four-year highest registrations and revenue collection in November and December last year due to the stamp duty waiver. Realty experts said while citizens availed of the stamp duty waiver from September to December and then from January to March, the volume of actual transactions could have been affected. “Registrations in big projects seem to have happened in July, which helped in increasing the revenue,” said a property expert. Property registration department officials said low-value sales were impacted, with low-cost housing projects too not getting registered as much since the second wave hit the state. “More land transactions and bigger projects seem to have been registered, which has definitely brought in more revenue,” an official from the department said. Credai vice-president national Shantilal Kataria told TOI that there was more sale in July, but actual registrations could have suffered due to the rainfall and flood affecting many areas. “We are expecting more projects being announced. After the Unified DCR, developers are now changing the plans accordingly. In Pune itself, nearly 100 projects may be rolled out in the festive season. The registrations will slowly pick up,” he said. Data on 23 registration offices submitted to the government: officials ‘Data on 23 registration offices submitted to govt’Data from 23 sub-registrar offices in Pune city has been submitted to the state government, registration department officials said. The move follows an in-depth investigation into suspected cases of property registrations of unauthorised constructions and illegal plotting. “The action comes after complaints were made to the government alleging illegal registrations taking place in the city in connivance with officials. A committee was assigned by the state government and the report was asked to be submitted after visiting and checking documents from each of the offices,”an official of the registration department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-igr-department-almost-matches-revenue-in-pre-pandemic-time-in-july/articleshow/85546257.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Trichy||Demand goes up for disinfectant services as schools set to reopen||Trichy: With only days left for the educational institutes to reopen after over 4 months, the demand for disinfection and pest control services providers has shot up. Even as few private schools and colleges were utilised as vaccination centres in the recent weeks, the institutes are looking for professional disinfection service providers for a safe restart. As the standard operating procedures (SoP) were already informed to the schools and colleges, the disinfection and pest control service providers have started receiving enquiries. While the local bodies and health department will help the government institutes to clean and sanitise the classrooms for eligible students to attend the classes, private institutes rely on professional disinfectant service providers to induce confidence among parents. “Disinfection process has already started, we will continue the same till the end of the month. Even after the schools reopen once, the sanitisation protocols will be made routine,” said Padma Srinivasan, president of Rockcity Sahodaya school complex, Trichy. As Trichy corporation had hosted vaccination camps and even RT-PCR testing at the school complexes in recent weeks, the civic body coordinating with the education department will conduct disinfection drives. “Educational institutes are also approaching us for pesticide management. Beehive removal, rodent control and fumigation drives were sought since schools were shut for months. We are anticipating the demand to peak in the ensuing week,” said Immanuel Christopher, proprietor, Biochem pest control in Trichy. While the housekeeping staff in schools can manage to disinfect the floors, professional service is sought to disinfect furniture and common access areas and ceilings. “There are around 50 self-financing colleges in the Trichy region, the principals were advised to follow the SoPs. Private institutes will have to independently complete the disinfection drives,” said A Mekala, regional joint director, collegiate education, Trichy region. As disinfection is considered a compelling factor to encourage parents to send their wards to school, educational institutes were keen to avail themselves of the professional service. Meanwhile, with over 90% of the vaccination camps, thus far, organised in the schools and colleges, Trichy corporation has embarked on a survey to identify safe vaccination sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/demand-goes-up-for-disinfectant-services-as-schools-set-to-reopen/articleshow/85546278.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Delhi||Welcome with open arms: Delhi’s entry points are set for makeover||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government’s plan to beautify entry points of the capital to make them aesthetically pleasing is finally set to take off from the Tikri Kalan border. The government had announced in early 2019 a project for beautification of all the entry points of the city. However, the proposal for the project prepared by Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) didn’t get the nod at that time from Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC), which wanted some modifications. “DUAC has now given the green signal for the Tikri Kalan Delhi-Haryana border entry project on NH-9,” a Delhi government official said. Sources said that DTTDC had to make modifications in its proposal quite a few times to finally receive the nod from DUAC, which reportedly didn’t want any permanent construction at the entry point. The Delhi-Haryana border at Tikri Kalan is located on National Highway-9. “The viaduct of Delhi Metro’s Green Line (Inderlok-Brigadier Hoshiyar Singh) is located right in the middle of the national highway and is also proposed to be beautified along with the entry point stretch,” the official said. “After Tikri Kalan border, Delhi Tourism plans to take up entry gate beautification projects at the Apsara border and Kapashera border next, following approvals.” According to sources, the project will see not only an aesthetically pleasing entry gate to welcome those visiting the capital but also beautification of a 200-metre stretch with sculptures and other installations. “Large LCD screens will display audio-visuals encapsulating Delhi’s heritage and culture, apart from pollution level, temperature, etc.,” they said. In the annual budget announcement of 2019-20, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had allocated Rs 25 crore for the beautification drive and the creation of entry gates. Sources said Rs 11 crore would be spent on the beautification of the entry point at Tikri Kalan border. “Entry points to Delhi will be given an aesthetic look. In Phase-I, five entry points will be beautified, including the borders at Gurgaon, Tikri Kalan, Ghazipur, Apsara and Anand Vihar near Kaushambi,” Sisodia had said, adding that seven others will be identified for beautification in Phase-II in the next fiscal. Historical monuments like India Gate, Rashtrapati Bhavan and events such as Dandi March will be showcased through sculptures along the stretch at the border points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/welcome-with-open-arms-delhis-entry-points-are-set-for-makeover/articleshow/85546307.cms||---

The results are likely to have some impact in the political perception battle in Punjab, where assembly elections are scheduled next year, as Shiromani Akali Dal will be looking to retain its control of the committee. In the three-cornered contest, SAD did not use pictures of party president Sukhbir Singh Badal or patron Parkash Singh Badal and only select leaders of the party from Punjab came for campaigning on ground. The party used faces of present president Manjinder Singh Sirsa and general secretary Harmeet Singh Kalka for campaigning. All publicity material used on ground or on social media carried their pictures only along with candidates or local leaders and avoided top brass of the party in Punjab. The work of last two years, when Sirsa became president of the Sikh body, was used as the main election plank. The main slogan was: “2 saal, kamm bemisaal (unparalleled work for two years).” In 2017 too, pictures of top brass of SAD were avoided as issue of getting Sirsa dera support in Punjab assembly elections was strongly used by opposition leaders Paramjit Singh Sarna and former Akal Takht jathedar Ranjit Singh. At that time, party had woven its campaign around then DSGMC president Manjit Singh G K. Alliance of Sarna and Ranjit Singh, and Manjit Singh GK’s party are the other main contenders in the fray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dsgmc-voting-over-result-in-3-days/articleshow/85548359.cms||IP Singh

As the state government has allowed the theatres that were closed on April 24 to reopen, managements of the cinemas in the city on Sunday started sanitizing the theatres. Some of the employees who were migrated to other jobs were recalled by their respective management. While a question is raised whether a 50% cap on the capacity of the screens may affect the revenue of the theatres, the owners said that they have no other choice but to utilise the opportunity. “We will follow all the restrictions mentioned in the SoP. Of course, public cooperation is needed,” S Sridhar, representative of the Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners Association, said. While a section of theatres is planning to reopen on Monday, some theatres opt to reopen from the ensuing weekend. “So far, release of one movie is confirmed on Friday (August 27). We need time to prepare the ticket booking mechanism too. It will take a few days to resume the full-fledged operations,” S Mohan, proprietor of a theatre, said. The theatre managements are planning to vaccinate employees as the state government has made it mandatory. The theatres are planning for an extensive disinfection drive in the coming days as the adherence to SoPs might be scrutinised by the authorities randomly. Theatre owners said that the screens were closed for eight months during the first wave and for four months during the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/staff-who-switched-jobs-recalled/articleshow/85546301.cms||Deepak Karthik

The planned surgeries, that were put off when the number of Covid cases was high in the rural areas, have now restarted. “The surgeries began step-by-step. First, we started taking up planned surgeries at the district hospital after the Covid cases reduced significantly. Now the surgeries are also being conducted in the rural areas after a significant drop in Covid cases there,” said Dr Ashok Thorat, the civil surgeon of Nashik district. The surgeries in the rural areas are carried out at the rural hospitals as well as the primary health centres (PCH). While the surgeries in the PHCs are limited to tubectomy and carried out twice every month, other minor surgeries are conducted in rural hospitals. “At PHCs, we conduct the tubectomy surgeries on camp mode. The beneficiaries are counselled and admitted to the hospital a day before the surgery camp. They are discharged a day after the surgery,” said Dr Anant Pawar, the medical superintendent of Kalwan. He said the diagnostic camps are also being conducted in the rural areas, including eye check-ups, camps for gynaecological issues, those related to the heart and other ailments. “People generally tend to overlook their health issues. The situation in the rural areas is no different. They do not take any medical advice. Such camps help us screen the people from the rural areas about their ailments and refer them for further check-ups at the respective hospitals, after which the patients are treated,” the officer said. The health camps in the tribal areas stress on the malnourishment issues faced by women and the children. The health department can identify the moderate acute malnourished and severely acute malnourished cases, which are then treated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/diagnostic-surgical-camps-in-rural-areas/articleshow/85541897.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Several locals have started using the pits meant to raise tree saplings as public garbage bins. In June-July 2021, Trichy corporation identified Anna Nagar link road, Sasthri road and Thillai Nagar main road for planting native tree saplings on either side of the roads. Since the beginning stage, the initiative earned public opposition as the road space and parking space is shrunk by the saplings. Undaunted by the opposition, Trichy corporation claimed that around 300 saplings were planted in the roads. However, at least 20 such pits meant for raising native trees on Sasthri road and Sivaprakasam road is filled with facemask, plastic waste and even empty liquor bottles. “The civic body could have left the road as it was, at least people would have utilised the vacant space to park vehicles. Now, the space is a burden for commuters as the road’s width has shrunk,” said SR Kishore Kumar, advocate. The pits seem to have either been planted with a tree sapling that was perished due to poor maintenance or the civic body left the space unutilised. Motorists lamented that the sum spent on digging pits and establishing RCC rings was futile. As the commercial establishments lack dedicated parking space and with the vacant space occupied by the pits, vehicles are parking on the right of the way (RoW) now. On being contacted, Trichy corporation officials said the pits will be cleared to raise native tree saplings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/pits-to-plant-trees-turn-waste-dumps-in-trichy/articleshow/85546308.cms||Deepak Karthik

While Ajay and Vijay were resilient enough to pursue higher education, Anita couldn’t withstand the embarrassment and gave up studies after HSC. Their parents were also unable to find suitable match for Ajay and Anita when they neared marriageable age. The three siblings, now aged between 29 and 20, had a rare genetic disorder dentinogenesis imperfecta — absence of crown part of the teeth — which was the cause for an elusive normal life. Poor financial condition — father being a labourer earning little over Rs100 a day — and reluctance of several doctors had delayed their treatment for 5 years, as it can be started at the age of 15. Ultimately, the family was referred to maxillofacial surgeon Dr Vipin Dehane, who took up the challenge and started treatment fixing 28 artificial teeth and 18 dental implants in each of them. “Dental implants treatment has to start from 15 years of age when mandible and maxilla have developed,” said Dr Dehane, director of Apple Dental Clinic, Facial Surgery Unit and Implant Centre. The procedure — full mouth rehabilitation — brought a pleasant smile back to the family members with Ajay and Anita getting married while Vijay has now completed his engineering. Ajay, the eldest who is a government engineer, said before Dr Dehane, a dentist tried but couldn’t fix our teeth. “We faced immense problems from finding the right doctor to arranging the treatment cost. My father passed away in 2019 while we were still under treatment. After I got a job in 2016, the first thing we decided was to get treated. We started with our sister first,” he said. Gradually, Ajay too received the dental implants and artificial teeth followed by the youngest Vijay, who recently completed BE. Ajay said he had to avail a bank loan of Rs18lakh to meet the treatment, travel and accommodation costs in Nagpur between 2018 and 2021. Beside treatment, Ajay also ensured his youngest brother and fourth sister, who is normal, completes their BE. Their mother is a housewife. Dr Dehane said the three siblings had only roots while the crown (of teeth) was missing from mandible and maxilla. “The youngest brother had a big cyst in mandible anterior,” he said. Dr Dehane said it is rare that three siblings in a family had severe dentinogenesis imperfecta. Regarding high cost, the dental surgeon added, “We placed Osstem implants, one of the best suited in these cases, under CSR initiative. Considering the patients’ economic status, we got the implants at subsidized rates,” he said. Ajay said by 2017-end, many doctors had refused to treat them in Nagpur. “To place an implant, sufficient bone density was not available. Their maxilla was inside and mandible out. This condition was opposite to normal placement. It is called Class III malocclusion which complicated the case,” said Dr Dehane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doc-gifts-teeth-implant-and-smile-to-sibling-trio/articleshow/85546365.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada Municipal Corporation to step up mask enforcement||VIJAYAWADA: The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) has decided to step up mask enforcement. Even though the Covid-19 positivity rate stands at less than 1 per cent, officials will continue to keep watch on busy areas like vegetable markets, shopping malls and supermarkets and strictly enforce the Covid-19 protocol. As experts have sounded alarm bell on a possible third wave of Covid-19, Krishna district administration has focusing completely on preventive measures. Despite warnings, many commercial establishments and individuals are ignoring guidelines like compulsory masks and physical distance. Huge crowds of buyers are noticed at shopping complexes and malls in the city and the managements are simply flouting the norms. In a bid to curb this tendency, the VMC formed special teams to conduct surprise inspections. Teams conducted a series of inspections in the city and imposed fines on a reputed supermarket. “Masks are made mandatory in public places. We have noticed that sales teams are not wearing masks at a few shopping malls. We have imposed Rs 10,000 fine on them and issued notices to the management. We will intensify the raids in coming days,” said VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh. Meanwhile, officials are having a tough time controlling crowds at weddings and other functions conducted at convention centres in the city. Many wedding planners are flouting the Covid-19 norms and cramming halls with 600 or more people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vmc-to-step-up-mask-enforcement/articleshow/85543878.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Hyderabad||HRCTs for Covid detecting early-stage lung cancer||HYDERABAD: The extensive use of HRCT (high resolution CT scan) screening in India during the Covid-19 pandemic has been instrumental in early detection of lung cancer cases. A study conducted on ‘The role of HRCT in screening lung cancer’ by city-based Grace Cancer Foundation revealed that 51 cases of lung cancer were detected through HRCT tests conducted for Covid-19 by 115 healthcare professionals during the first and second waves. The study was conducted between April 2020 and June 2021. The study assumes significance as, currently, 70 per cent of lung cancer cases are being detected in advanced stages in the country and there is almost no detection in early stages. “We came across 51 cases of lung cancer, with majority of them having early-stage disease (single lesion, with hilary or mediastinal nodes). The other incidentally detected lesions were thymomas, tuberculosis and chest wall sarcomas,” read the survey report. While detection was almost nil in the general population — non-smokers and those not in the high-risk category — earlier, the study indicates a 0.02 per cent incidence among general population. “It would be higher if HRCT was done on high-risk people. There seems to be a definitive role for low-dose CT-scan chest as screening modality for high-risk individuals between 50 and 80 years age. A larger study on the incidental detection during Covid-19 will be undertaken soon by Grace Cancer Foundation,” said Dr Chinnababu Sunkavalli, cancer specialist and CEO, Grace Cancer Foundation, who headed the study. The projected incidence of cancer in Indians was 94 out of 1,00,000 population in males and 103.6 out of 1,00,000 population for the year 2020, as per the National Cancer Registry Programme, India. According to its report, “1 in 9 Indians will develop cancer during their lifetime and one in 68 males would develop lung cancer. Majority of lung cancer patients were diagnosed with advanced stage (distant metastasis) at the time of presentation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hrcts-for-covid-detecting-early-stage-lung-cancer/articleshow/85547958.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Fraudsters bait seniors, go phishing for their savings||HYDERABAD: Senior citizens are increasingly falling prey to phishing calls, particularly calls made in the name of banks, as several bank mergers in the recent past have come in handy for cyber crooks. Phishing cases against elderly in the city are estimated to have risen by 15-20% now. To ensure that the target doesn’t wise up to their act, these fraudsters engage the elderly in small talk so that they do not notice the fraud in the first few hours. By the time they realise that they have been defrauded, the amount would have passed through various payment gateways and deposited in the fraudulent account safely, officials said. Many of the senior citizens who dished out personal details to the tricksters have been shut out of their life savings/pension, sometimes running into lakhs. “The calls are usually made citing an immediate need to update KYC or threat of bank account being closed or credit limit being enhanced. Of late, due to many banks getting merged, these crooks call up senior citizens in the guise of verifying the KYC. This usually gets an immediate response and they share all details about their savings and pension,” said S Harinath, ACP (cybercrime), Rachakonda, adding that on an average they are now getting five complaints every month from senior citizens. There are about 10 such phishing cases each month in Hyderabad and Cyberabad commissionerates as well. In majority of the cases, the amount has not been recovered due to delay in discovering and reporting the fraud. “By the time they realise that their accounts have been wiped clean, it is often a day or two, sometimes more as well,” said a source. ACP Harinath added: “They keep them talking and don’t let them see their SMS. So, they don’t realise what has happened. If a complaint is made within 3 to 4 hours, it is possible to shoot letters to the banks and wallets to stop payment and revert it as it takes some time for the money to go through the various gateways.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fraudsters-bait-seniors-go-phishing-for-their-savings/articleshow/85548113.cms||Amrita Didyala

Anvar told a news channel over the phone from Sierra Leone that he has been in the West African country during the last two months amid criticism from the opposition. However, he refuted the opposition charges of failing to discharge his duties as people’s representative and added that he had made arrangements to ensure that his absence doesn’t adversely affect the people of Nilambur. “The MLA office is working on all days and I have appointed seven staffers at the office,” he said. Anvar’s absence from the constituency had sparked off a row earlier this year before assembly elections but he got re-elected. On the charge of not being present during the recent assembly session, he said that he had raised 88 questions in the assembly and received responses to starred and unstarred questions. “I came to Sierra Leone on a business visit on June 15 or 16 after taking permission from the party which had granted me three months leave. I am planning to return in a month,” he added. Anvar said that he had to take up this business in the African country to overcome the losses he sustained after his businesses in Kerala were closed due to false allegations. He added that the party knows about the personal loss he suffered due to politics. Anvar said that he had returned to Nilambur from Sierra Leone 18 days before elections and had told the people of his constituency that he will have to go there again but will make arrangements to ensure that their needs are addressed. Meanwhile, Congress leader K Muraleedharan lashed out against Anvar for his absence. If one is so preoccupied that he can’t even find time to attend the assembly session, then he shouldn’t have taken up this job (of the MLA). “For a people’s representative to stay away from the house for personal purposes when the assembly is in session is an affront to the voters of the constituency. The chief minister should intervene and make Anvar tender an apology for speaking to the media person in derogatory language,” he said. Anvar, who had successfully contested as LDF’s independent candidate from Nilambur for the second term, had said before the elections in March that he was engaged in the works of setting up a Rs 20,000 crore gold and diamond mining business in the African country which will be up and running in one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/mlas-repeated-absence-reignites-row/articleshow/85544001.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Sacked engg faculty now in demand, get hired for a day as colleges eye affiliation||HYDERABAD: Engineering faculty members, who were relieved during the pandemic, are now said to be in demand as several colleges are hiring them for the one-day inspection to get affiliation for the academic year 2021-22. Colleges are said to be paying Rs 15, 000 to ‘act’ as faculty for one day and are looking for ratified faculty with all necessary documents-- Selection Committee Meeting (SCM) record, faculty ID and relieving letter. Messages are said to have been sent out through third-party consultancies to lure faculty who are without pay for the last one-and-half years or so. “Vacancies for M Tech-CSE visiting faculty. Certificate verification. Only a single visit Rs 15,000. Only ratified candidates having 2020 and 2021 as relieving years are eligible,” read a message received by some of the faculty members in the state. Faculty said that a majority of colleges are having openings across the branches and have been hiring thousands of them since the last week to have the required number of faculty members for inspection. “When I called on the number mentioned in the message, they said that they will hire immediately and that I just have to go on the inspection day,” said a faculty member, who used to work in the computer science engineering department at a private college. In the state, there are about 175 engineering colleges, of these, majority are affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTUH). While JNTUH officials said that about 25, 000 faculty members are working as engineering faculty in affiliated colleges, faculty members claimed that not even 50% of these faculty are being paid salaries and many of them have been sacked during the pandemic. The JNTUH officials questioned why faculty members are supporting managements by accepting their offer for a day. “There is no way for us to see if a faculty member just came for inspection or has been working in that particular college. Faculty should not take up such offers as we go by the data uploaded by colleges on our website and verify the same when our teams go for inspection,” said an official. The official added that if found guilty, the number of seats will be reduced according to faculty-student ratio. Colleges have time till 7 pm on Monday to apply for affiliation with a 100% late fee.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Fuel prices see slight dip after record highs||HYDERABAD: After constantly rising for nearly four months, petrol prices in Hyderabad dipped marginally by 20 paise on Sunday for the first time. The price of petrol has risen by Rs 18 since February this year. The current pricing is still the highest in the city at Rs 105.69 per litre, a small decline of 20 paise from Rs 105.89 in the last several days. “Petrol costs (per litre) have been steadily rising every month. The price was roughly Rs 89.13 in the last six months, Rs 101.39 in the last three months and Rs 105. 75 in the last one month. For the last one year, the average price was roughly Rs 83.47. This explains whatever increase occurred in the last five months,” said VK Reddy, owner of a petrol pump. In July, prices jumped by 5%, the highest increase in any month in the last year. Along with fuel, the price of a litre of diesel fell to Rs 97.33 from Rs 97.96 on Sunday. But citizens are concerned that in addition to petrol, diesel prices are also increasing “We planned to buy a diesel car, but the way costs are increasing, there is no difference between the two, prices of commodities have also gone up,” RV Raju, a private employee, said. Prior to 2017, petrol prices were adjusted every 15 days or two weeks, with the rate changing on the 1st and 16th of each month. The pricing approach was based on both the international market’s 15-day average crude oil price and the rupee-to-dollar exchange rate. However, India is now implementing a new dynamic fuel pricing system across all cities and states, including Hyderabad. Using this approach, the fuel price in the city is adjusted on a regular basis, taking into account the 14-day average crude oil price and the rupee-dollar exchange rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fuel-prices-see-slight-dip-after-record-highs/articleshow/85548043.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

They said that in the next one week or so, the technical education department officials or universities concerned should take this step and initiate action against thousands of faculty members and college managements, who are joining in colleges just for one day. “The officials should take stern action against erring managements and faculty as per the All India Council for Technical Education norms,” said A Santosh Kumar, president, Telangana Schools Technical Colleges Employees Association. Faculty members said that the officials should cancel the affiliation and blacklist faculty members if they are found violating norms. They alleged that the fact-finding committees (FFC), which are inspecting colleges, are not even checking bank statements of the faculty to see if college managements are paying salaries regularly to faculty members and are only going by the count given by the managements. They said that FFC should strictly verify whether the colleges have required infrastructure and faculty and only then grant affiliation to colleges for the current academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/faculty-demand-biometric-attendance-at-engg-colleges/articleshow/85547926.cms||---
---||Mysuru||B’luru-Mysuru expressway: Mahadevappa slams Pratap Simha for claiming credit||Mysuru: As the works of the ambitious Mysuru-Bengaluru ten-lane project is nearing completion, a war of words has erupted over who should take credit for the project implementation. After MP Pratap Simha’s press conference on the project and a visit to the project site and a video documentary, former public works department minister HC Mahadevappa slammed him over his statements. However, Simha justified his claim and questioned the contribution of his critics in the implementation of the project. In a lengthy social media post, Mahadevappa stated that himself, former Union minister Oscar Fernandes, former CM Siddaramaiah, and current minister Nitin Gadkari are behind this project. “Pratap Simha and other BJP leaders are good at renaming the projects,” he criticized. “Bengaluru-Mysuru-Bantwal stretch of the state highway was notified as a national highway when Oscar Fernandes was the Union minister for transport, road, and highways. A detailed project report (DPR) was prepared when Congress was in power. There are documents to prove that the project was conceived and sanctioned when I was the PWD minister. I had carried out multiple review meetings, inspections in this corridor stretch. The project office was opened at Ramanagar for the swift implementation of the scheme,” he explained to TOI. “When I was the PWD minister, several new highway projects were taken up in the state. People know the truth,” he said. “The BJP leaders are good at spreading false news. However, documents can’t lie. My statements in the state legislative assembly and council are the proof for who brought this project,” he said. “Pratap Simha is trying to mislead the people in this regard,” he alleged. BJP MLC AH Vishwanath, reacting to Simha claiming credit for the ongoing expressway project, said that the project was initiated during UPA government headed by PM Manmohan Singh. The project was started by then Union minister for transport, road and highways Oscar Fernandes, CM Siddaramaiah and PWD minister HC Mahadevappa. “As Mysuru MP, I along with MPs from Chamarajanagar, Mandya and Ramanagar held several meetings to take up the upgradation of 1,882-kms state highway to national highway including the Mysuru-Bengaluru expressway. A detailed project report was prepared and work was started,” he told reporters. MP Simha should claim credit for the works he has done and not others, he said. Earlier Simha and Mandya MP Sumalatha also engaged in a bitter war of words over the way in which project works are executed. This project is expected to bring down the travel time between Mysuru and Bengaluru to 90 minutes. However, Simha hit out at his critics. “None of the leaders who are criticizing me were able to bring even 8 paise for this Rs 8,000-crore project. The project was approved in February 2018. As Nitin Gadkari is also the part of the Modi-led government, what is wrong in claiming a credit,” he questioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/bluru-mysuru-expressway-mahadevappa-slams-pratap-simha-for-claiming-credit/articleshow/85542431.cms||---

The one-day strike was announced by the National Task Force on Hallmarking formed by 350 associations/ federations representing all four zones of the gems & jewellery industry in the country. “The new HUID system is impractical and unimplementable,” a city task force member told TOI. He claimed that the HUID system, which was made mandatory by the Bureau of Indian Standards’ (BIS) since June 16 along with the BIS hallmarking, has adversely affected the jewellery business. He said that the six-digit HUID was taking a long time at ‘assaying and hallmarking centres’ (AHCs) and as a result jewellery was piling up. The BIS mandate has brought jewellery operations to a standstill in the state for the past couple of months, claim traders. While a gold merchant from Punjagutta claimed that HUID was against customer interest and defeats the principle of ease-of-doing business. The task force, which comprises all reputed gold jewellery merchants in Telangana, has been holding consultations among members on issues being faced by them in implementing HUID. Chanda Sreenivas Rao, director, CapsGold Trading Company, Hyderabad, said, “The task force members are united in taking part in the one-day token strike in response to the nationwide protest call.” All the gold jewellery showrooms will be closed on Monday to express solidarity, he added.

Such state-of-the-art infrastructure would be included in eight educational institutions at Jahangirpuri, Aya Nagar, Dwarka, Rohini and Raghubir Nagar, which have been chosen to be created as “smart” schools. There are around 1,000 Delhi government-run schools, including 54 model schools that offer facilities on a par with some of the most sought-after private schools in the city. While the government plans to revamp 100 existing schools as model schools, new institutions would also be created on a similar pattern. According to Delhi government, there is a demand from the public to provide adequate educational infrastructure due to growing needs. The government is trying to make quality education available to students near their homes. The government feels there is a need to construct school buildings with state-of-the-art facilities on the pattern of pilot schools that have already been created and commissioned. The work of construction and development of school buildings has been assigned to Delhi Tourism & Transportation Development Corporation. The corporation is trying to empanel architects for comprehensive architectural design and engineering planning services for the new buildings. The new schools would boast of smart and lab-based classrooms, with the provision of smart school furniture. Each school would have at least one elevator for differently abled children. The annual maintenance contract would be given for five years. The structure would have a green building concept, like maximum utilisation of natural light and rainwater harvesting system. They would have sewage and water treatment plants. All project components would have “green features” to allow the schools to obtain a minimum of three-star rating on the GRIHA rating system by The Energy and Resource Institute or equivalent rating from any other body framing guidelines for newly constructed buildings for energy and environmental performance. The buildings would be fire safety compliant and ensure that the campus has adequate open space for assembly of students, teachers and staff during a natural calamity like earthquake. The government wants the schools to have all modern and latest facilities based on best practices within the country and abroad. It also wants the new schools to look aesthetical with features like an elegant entrance gate, boundary wall and an entrance lobby.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-new-govt-schools-to-be-model-ones-have-state-of-the-art-infra/articleshow/85544002.cms||Sidharatha Roy

With ample availability of vaccines, the vaccination centres were able to administer the highest number of doses on Saturday. The previous single-day vaccination record in the district was on August 14, when 54,486 doses were administered. On Saturday with the new record, the vaccination in the district crossed 22.5 lakh-mark. Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare has congratulated the health teams for putting up another stellar performance in carrying out the vaccination. drive “While the new records of vaccination are being created by the health teams, the number of people being covered under the vaccination programme is also increasing by leaps and bounds,” he said. Ganesh Misal, the deputy collector, who is also the nodal officer for the vaccination programme in Nashik district, said the availability of the vaccine doses had helped in achieving the record. “The supply of vaccines has got better recently and so the number of vaccine doses being administered are also increasing rapidly. This is a good sign amid the warnings of the Covid third wave,” said Misal. The health officials said the vaccination drive has picked up pace in the rural areas as the efforts in raising awareness among the masses, especially tribal areas, have started paying off.

We haven’t received any complaint.”On whether the contractor should have barricaded the area before carrying out construction work, he said, “Tiles are being installed on the road. Roads are being constructed at many places, including Rani Jhansi Road.”Dr Ashish Ahuja, who lives near the spot, wrote on social media, “Major accident on Rani Jhansi Road due to negligence of local authorities who have kept a large pit open from the last one week and there is no ‘work in progress’ (board). Two women, two children rescued from a damaged car… sounds of children crying, women screaming in pain during the festive time, but who cares!”Talking to The Times of India, Dr Ashish said, “I had called councillor Narinder Sharma Kala’s representative three days ago and told him that the pit could lead to a major accident and so, it should either be covered or the work completed. I was told they were arranging pipe, which is to be laid.”Despite repeated attempts, councillor Narinder Sharma couldn’t be contacted. A netizen, Jaswant Singh, wrote “Contractor and authority concerned must be held accountable for the accident.”AAP functionary Keemti Rawal said, “They must carry out construction work in a time-bound manner. Such works must be completed in minimum possible time. Lights should be installed at these areas. Accidents occur when the rules are not followed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/open-pit-leads-to-two-cars-collision/articleshow/85544011.cms||---

Else, Chodankar demanded the chief minister should apologise to Goans for the mining ban effected by the BJP government that led to the destruction of livelihoods of mining-dependent Goans. “Parrikar misled and fooled Goans by alleging a false mining scam of Rs 35,000 crore to grab power in 2012. I challenge the chief minister to reveal the details of the progress of recovery of this Rs 35,000 crore and status of investigation in the false mining scam,” Chodankar said, while addressing a meeting of party workers at Nuvem held to induct social activist Jose Raju Cabral into the party. He demanded that the government put in the public domain the Public Accounts Committee report on mining referred to by Parrikar then. Stating that BJP was “copying” Parrikar’s Salcete Mission agenda by promoting some zilla panchayat members as prospective independent candidates for assembly election in a few Salcete constituencies, Chodankar urged people to be wary of and reject BJP’s “hidden” Salcete mission “the way you did to Parrikar last time.” Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat, reacting to chief minister’s statement accusing him of failing to effectively implement the telecom policy during his tenure as chief minister leading to current poor internet connectivity issues, demanded that Sawant explain to the people why the BJP government failed to expand the Optic Fibre Cable internet network connectivity, which had reached every panchayat by 2010. “In 2010, Goa was the first state to have broadband connectivity. But for the last 12 years, the BJP government did nothing to expand it. Don’t blame others to hide your faults,” Kamat said. He also assured the people that Congress will scrap the proposed three linear projects if it came to office “just the way it had scrapped the SEZ”. AICC membership incharge Rajesh Griglani, South Goa district president Joe Dias, former minister Alexio Sequeira, were among those present for the function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-must-reveal-recovery-status-in-rs-35k-cr-mining-scam-or-apologise/articleshow/85548483.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Not cow-ed down by A2 storm, Raipur co upbeat on Holstein||Nagpur: At a time when the market is being flooded with brands of milk claiming to be that of the indigenous cow, there is one company which is banking on its herd of the Holstein Friesian cattle. The Indian cow milk, also dubbed as the A2 type, is being sold in premium segment these days priced as much as Rs80 to over Rs100 a litre. Raipur’s Sarda Dairy and Food Products Limited (SDFPL), which markets Vachan brand of milk and by-products, is planning to enter the same niche segment with milk of the Holstein cow. SDFPL brand ‘Farm Classic’ is expected to be launched in Nagpur soon and would target the niche consumer. The packet would have a picture of the white and black Holstein cow signifying the breed. A number of A2 milk vendors also put the picture of Gir cow, an indigenous breed, on the packets. Lately, a dairy unit in Nagpur launched a brand of desi cow milk with picture of Gir cow, although not claiming it to be A2. Desi cow milk has become a latest trend in the market. There are groups advocating consumption of the A2 milk claiming to have health benefits as against A1 milk which is said to be of foreign breeds. This has led to focus on the Gir cow with groups pushing it as an alternative to other breeds like Holstein or Jersey. However, it as also been clarified that A1 milk has no harm. SDFPL is arguably the only organized dairy player in the region having its owns livestock. Pankaj Sarda, the joint managing director SDFPL, said that he is confident of the brand and expects that it would generate a good response in the Nagpur market. There are plans to start with 10,000 litres of milk for the Nagpur market. Sarda said, “Our USP is the scientific method of dairy farming. The entire process from milking to packaging is untouched by human hand.” Sarda claimed that the health of the cattle is regularly checked by a team of veterinarians to ensure that even the milk is healthy. He said rather than the breed their focus would be in quality of milk in terms of hygiene and other parameters. “Irrespective of all the theories about A1 or A2 milk, we are proud of the Holstein breed that SDFPL maintains,” said Sarda. SDFPL maintains a livestock of 2,000 cattle head and during lean season the milk output touches up to 15,000 litre. In the flush season it is more than double. Milk is procured from farmers too. Sarda said that the cattle have been procured from breeders in South India. Sarda said the company has also upbeat about the Nagpur market for its other products. “With Nagpur at a distance of 290 km from Raipur, fresh milk can be easily transported. The market in other centres like Bhandara, Chandrapur, Amravati and Gondia can also be tapped,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-cow-ed-down-by-a2-storm-raipur-co-upbeat-on-holstein/articleshow/85546421.cms||Shishir Arya

NMC’s public works department (PWD) has submitted the proposals seeking administrative approval, and allow the Nehru Nagar zone to invite tenders for asphaltation of two roads before the standing committee meeting to be held on August 24. TOI has been reporting on the pathetic condition of tar roads in Nagpur city. Recently, standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar had announced that the city has around 3,360 potholes only. A couple of days before Bhoyar’s statement, TOI had published that the NMC’s hotmix department itself claimed to have repaired 5,465 potholes on various roads in 10 zones across the city. As per PWD’s proposal, the first tar road which will be asphalted is in Amba Nagar Three Star Cooperative Housing Society. The department has prepared a proposal of over Rs40.52 lakh for this work. Similarly, the zone proposed another asphaltation of tar road worth Rs26.21 lakh in the same ward 28-D, which is the constituency of BJP corporator Rekha Sakore. On Friday, Congress corporator Neha Nikose alleged discrimination by the ruling party in allocation of funds for development works. The other proposals included spending of Rs70 lakh for purchasing printing material (worth Rs20 lakh) and office stationery (Rs50 lakh) for a year, giving one year’s extension to women’s counseling centres, purchase of two chain crawler excavators worth Rs45.21 lakh each (which will be used for solid waste management at Bhandewadi dumping yard), and strengthening streetlights in Dharampeth zone by erecting electric poles at a cost of Rs27.84 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/standing-panels-nod-sought-for-laying-2-tar-roads/articleshow/85546413.cms||---

The state government has announced a crop insurance scheme with the participation of the Union and state governments with the objective of protecting farmers from natural calamities. Although the scheme is welcome, it is disappointing that the kuruvai season paddy is not included in it, Ramadoss said in a statement on Sunday. In fact, the state government's announcement that paddy will not be included in the scheme during the current monsoon season has come as a shock to the majority of farmers who raise paddy. Farmers do not stand to benefit from insuring any other crop unless paddy is insured. So, both the governments should bring the kuruvai paddy under the purview of crop insurance, Ramadoss said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/extend-pms-crop-insurance-to-kuruvai-paddy-pmk/articleshow/85546409.cms||---
---||Delhi||Fretting over bad network? Here is some fresh hope for south Delhi||NEW DELHI: Mobile tower installation is expected to speed up in key areas of the city as South Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to slash the rates by 40%. According to the newly notified rates, cellular operators and telecom service providers will need to pay a fee of Rs 3 lakh for five years for rooftop as well as ground-based towers. Earlier, the rates for five years were Rs 5 lakh per site. For poles less than 12 metres high, a fee of Rs 25,000 has been fixed per operator for a period of five years. The Cellular Operators Association had moved the Delhi high court against the earlier fee hike. An SDMC spokesperson stated that the civic body had earlier approved a proposal of fixing the fee at Rs 1 lakh per annum. The agency had also fixed a 25% extra amount per site for sharing of towers. "The cellular operators and telecom service providers were supposed to pay a minimum fee of Rs 5 lakh for five years. The Cellular Operators Association and the Telecom and Infrastructure Provider Association moved the Delhi High Court against the fee hike. After the court's direction, the municipal corporation, the Cellular Operators Association and the Telecom and Infrastructure Provider Association have fixed the new fee through intervention (sic)," the civic body stated in an official statement. The spokesperson said that the move was likely to improve facilities for citizens by strengthening the mobile network and related infrastructure. Cellular operators will now have to pay Rs 3 lakh per site for five years, which translates into a monthly fee of Rs 5,000. "Though the move will reduce the corporation's revenue to an extent, it will help in strengthenin the mobile network," the spokesperson said. However, the civic body has clarified that in case of towers/poles that were installed without permission before January 5, 2021, the permission fee would be charged as per the previous applicable rates. "Telecom service providers will have to pay a one-time fee of Rs 10,000 for every application to meet administrative expenses. The permission fee can be reviewed after five years," the SDMC official stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fretting-over-bad-network-here-is-some-fresh-hope/articleshow/85544094.cms||Paras Singh

Swab samples for RT-PCR testing were being sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) and the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) in Pune; the IGGMCH in Nagpur, and even the Government Medical College Hospital in Dhule, before a laboratory at the Dr Vasantrao Pawar Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre in Nashik. The district administration has since installed capacity to test 35,000 samples per day with the help of private institutions. The district had achieved a daily testing capability of around 5,000 samples with the help of a private medical college in April 2020 and with the laboratory at the Civil Hospital by August 2020 during the first wave. The capacity has now increased seven times with the laboratory at the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) also pitching in. “We had tested more than 4,500 samples per day during the peak of the first wave, and more than 22,500 daily samples during the peak of the second wave. We are now capable of testing about 35,000 samples per day if and when the third Covid wave hits,” said Dr Utkarsh Dudhedia, the nodal officer for laboratories, Nashik. With the RT-PCR laboratories at the Civil Hospital and the Nashik Municipal Corporation, the government testing capacity now stands at about 8,000 samples. Moreover, there are the reservations in at various government laboratories that add another 1,000 tests per day. “There has been a marked improvement since the first wave. As against seven private laboratories providing testing facilities, now there were 17 private laboratories that were pitching in. Besides, if the number of daily samples exceeds the 35,000-mark, the provision of testing samples is being made with more private laboratories,” Dr Anant Pawar, the nodal officer for Covid at the Civil Hospital, said. It may be noted that the laboratory at the Civil Hospital has so far conducted 1.6 lakh tests, while the NMC laboratory, functional since April 2021, has conducted over 50,000 tests. The turnaround time for sample testing has significantly reduced from over 72 hours to less than 48 hours. This has helped in early start of treatment. During the first Covid wave, the number of samples tested stood at 5.42 lakh, of which, 1.22 lakh tested positive. During the second wave, 16.99 lakh tests were conducted and 2.75 lakh samples tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashiks-daily-rt-pcr-test-capacity-increased-to-35000/articleshow/85541946.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Trichy||Power minister questions predecessor’s claim on missing coal||TRICHY: If officials had found earlier that 2.38 lakh tonnes of coal had gone missing at North Chennai Thermal Power Station, former minister P Thangamani would have been informed about it, electricity minister Senthil Balaji told reporters in Karur on Sunday. Responding to Thangamani’s statement that the report was submitted by a committee formed during his tenure, Balaji said, “Had they really formed a panel to probe the incident it would have been reported, also what the report of that committee was and the action taken against the culprits. If the irregularities were detected earlier, what was their action against the culprits,” the minister asked. However, Senthil Balaji promised to take unbiased action if irregularities were found during the audit. The minister said a three-member panel comprising directors of generation and distribution as well as plant CFO was formed on August 2 to look into the matter after Tangedco officials came to know that coal from the reserve at the power plant was missing. The panel conducted inquiry on August 6 and 9 and submitted a report stating that a total of 2.38 lakh tonnes of coal worth Rs 85 crore was missing. P Thangamani had said in Namakkal on Saturday that Balaji was only reporting the findings of the committee set up by the previous regime after getting to know the disparities in stock. “How come the minister knew about the missing coal on March 31 when he deputed a team only on August 6,” he said. He had also alleged that the minister had done it to defame the previous government. They were ready to support him if he takes fair action. He also denied any wrongdoing when he helmed the department. He said the debt burden of TNEB increased due to the outstanding debt of Rs 36,000 crore of the previous DMK regime and implementation of new projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/power-min-questions-predecessors-claim-on-missing-coal/articleshow/85546432.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Sack Kedar from cabinet: Ex-MLA to CM||Nagpur: Former MLA Ashish Deshmukh has accused party colleague and state cabinet minister Sunil Kedar of getting a “friend” appointed as government pleader in a case in which the latter himself is an accused. These allegations were made in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in which Deshmukh also demanded that Kedar not only be dismissed from the state cabinet but also be prosecuted separately. The case which Deshmukh referred to is about financial irregularities in Nagpur District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) of 2002. Speaking to TOI, Deshmukh said, “It has been 19 years since then and the hearing is in the last stage. Kedar, one of the accused, has been trying various strategies to wriggle out of this case. His latest move is to ensure one of his friends Asif Qureshi being appointed government pleader.” “Qureshi also happens to be the state Congress legal cell chief. It seems to be a clear case of conflict of interest,” said Deshmukh, claiming that he was a whistle-blower in the NDCCB scam case and that’s why he is following it up so closely. TOI tried to get a response from Kedar regarding this letter, but he did not respond to either calls or text messages. Qureshi expressed shock at such allegations, which he claimed questioned his “integrity”. Qureshi said, “I have been a government pleader for quite some time and handled multiple cases. I was appointed based on merit and as per proper protocol. The previous pleader resigned due to which this responsibility fell on me. She too had succeeded others, but it’s only on my appointment that a person is raising a question.” When TOI mentioned Deshmukh’s allegation of ‘conflict of interest’, Qureshi said, “I do my job with utmost integrity and if the government has entrusted me with some responsibility, I shall give my 100%.” He further added that almost all of the legal processes had been completed before his joining. “Around 54 witnesses are there, of which I had to deal with only one. Frankly we are almost at the end of the judicial process now,” said Qureshi. Deshmukh had contested the state assembly polls against Kedar from Saoner constituency in 2009, which the latter won. “Don’t look at the letter to CM from a political point of view. The CM also happens to be in-charge of law & judiciary department and that’s why it’s addressed to him,” said Deshmukh.

---||Ludhiana||That sinking feeling||Ludhiana: The residents faced a tough time after heavy rainfall led to severe waterlogging in the city on Sunday when people were hurrying to reach their siblings to celebrate Raksha Bandhan. The submerged roads and traffic jams due to festive rush made commuting a nightmare. Waterlogging was witnessed in Haibowal, Hambran Road, BRS Nagar, Kitchlu Nagar, Chandigarh Road, Bharat Nagar Chowk, Civil City, Chander Nagar, Jassian Road, Panj Peer Road, Jamalpur and Samrala Chowk. There was a traffic jam at PAU Road after a little break in rainfall as people hastened to reach their destinations. Besides, shopkeepers had extended their shops to the roads, adding to the mess. A resident of Kitchlu Nagar, Kapil Dev, who clicked pictures of waterlogging in BRS Nagar, said, “If this is the situation in posh areas, then what would be the condition of low-lying areas? The authorities have failed to find a permanent solution to the problem. Whenever it rains, even if it’s for half-an-hour, driving becomes difficult.” A resident of Chander Nagar, Silky Sood, said, “The MC had dug up road for laying the sewerage line and rain made the stretch muddy and risky. Driving on this road was frightening. Some two-wheeler riders lost their balance as it was difficult to judge if there was road or dug-up portion under water.” Harneet Kaur, a commuter who passed through Jassian Road, said there were deep potholes and due to waterlogging, she was about to fall from her two-wheeler. “The authorities don’t care about the safety of commuters otherwise they would have filled the potholes,” she added. “Waterlogging spoiled the festival fun on Sunday. I got drenched in the middle of Hambran Road when a fast-moving car splashed water on me,” rued Shilpa Jain of Kitchlu Nagar. Municipal corporation SDO Anshul Garcha said heavy rainfall would obviously lead to waterlogging, but when it stopped the water drained out quickly. The civic body had taken steps to address waterlogging woes at Rani Jhansi Road, Damoria Bridge, Clock Tower Road and Panj Peer Road. There was some relief at Rani Jhansi Road and Damoria Bridge, but Clock Tower Road posed problems for the commuters because it’s yet to be constructed. However, waterlogging was witnessed at Panj Peer, mayor Balkar Sandhu’s ward, too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/that-sinking-feeling/articleshow/85544104.cms||---

In a statement on Sunday BJP state secretary C Krishnakumar “has demanded to register a case against the speaker for betrayal of the nation for comparing Bhagat Singh with Mappila rebellion leader which is a great insult to martyrs like Bhagat Singh”. The BJP secretary said, “Variyamkunnath Mohammed Haji had butchered Hindus during the rebellion. The speaker has made such a statement to appease Muslim militants. The CPM state acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan should clarify whether the party agrees with the speaker’s view.” “Malabar rebellion is the first organized terrorist attack in Kerala like the one going on in Afghanistan by Taliban,” Krishnakumar added. Yuva Morcha organized a protest meeting at Anchu Vilakku memorial at Fort Maidan against the speaker and burned his effigy “for trying to twist history by comparing Bhagat Singh with Malabar rebel leader Mohammed Haji”. Yuva Morcha district president Prashant Sivan alleged, “Mohammed Haji had butchered many Hindus during the uprising. The speaker compared him with Bhagat Singh but did not prefer freedom fighters like Vaikom Abdul Khader and Afarullah Khan.” The centenary of the rebellion known as the Mappilah (Muslim) rebellion in Malabar was observed on Saturday. It is described as an armed revolt by Muslim farmers against the British rulers and their Hindu allies. But some like Sangh Parivar believes it to be an attack against Hindus by some Muslim militants. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sangh-parivar-protests-against-speakers-insult-to-bhagat-singh/articleshow/85544119.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Wadettiwar held a meeting with PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye, APCCF, East Nagpur, BH Huda, and local forest and administrative officers on the issue and directed them to take strong measures to mitigate the rising conflict in the area. The guardian minister claimed that there are over 150 highly sensitive villages located in fringe forest areas in Bramhapuri. “The number of tigers has grown to 110, while there are 114 leopards in the forest division. These predator figures are higher than that of Tadoba. There is strong resentment among the people towards the predators following higher number of attacks,” he said. Wadettiwar directed the forest officials to look into the possibility of relocating tigers. He underlined the need for shifting the tigers from conflict-prone areas and also from the areas where attacks have not taken places. “Tigers are valuable, but human lives are equally valuable. It is, therefore, necessary to undertake the measures to prevent intrusion of predators in villages and train the residents to handle the situation that may arise,” he said. The minister directed the officials to select five capable youths from each village and build a PRT in 150 highly conflict-sensitive villages. Erecting solar fence around fringe agriculture fields and putting channel fencing around sensitive villages by extending the expanse of Syama Prasad Mookerjee Jan Vikas Yojana in 150 tiger sensitive villages was discussed during the meeting. Wadettiwar also recommended Rs10,000 aid to farmers for not carrying out farming in fringe forest areas and procurement of special batons to help them drive away the predators. He also directed the officials to look into the possibility of starting forest safari circuits in areas having higher number of tigers and leopards and help locals gain livelihood through tourism. The minister informed that in next few days, he would meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to discuss the issue of mitigation of man-animal conflict and promoting eco-tourism in Bramhapuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/relocate-excess-tigers-to-curb-man-animal-conflict-min/articleshow/85546457.cms||Mazhar Ali

Since the launch of the facilities in residential areas on June 11, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has collected and processed 25 metric tonnes of waste from 400 people while around 1,300 Delhiites had registered on its website. East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has received 25 queries after announcing the facilities 19 days ago. There’s no minimum quantity criterion and even a single electronic unit will be collected from a caller’s home. The civic bodies are also pursuing residents welfare and market associations to help in bulk collection of e-waste through special campaigns. SDMC has engaged a private company to dispose of e-waste after the Union environment ministry notified E-waste Management Rules 2016, said an official. People are invited to register and file their queries on https://ewaste.mcdservices.online and toll free number 1800-123-005566. “The company disposes of old and unserviceable IT equipment collected from individuals, RWAs, markets etc at a recycle workshop where these items are dealt with in a scientific manner,” said the official. In addition to residential areas, EDMC is also accepting serving individuals running commercial establishments and shops. “We don’t want to give any scope for disposing of e-waste carelessly and is asking small shops to contact us on toll free number 1800-102-9882,” said an official. The NGO appointed for the initiative is storing the e-waste at EDMC’s warehouse located in Patparganj Industrial Area. “It will then be sent to the world-class e-waste recycling facility in Uttarakhand’s Roorkee for disposing of all metals, plastics and other materials without any impact on the environment,” said the official. “Though all materials such as monitors, keyboards, laptop, TV are being picked up, most requests/enquiries are for collection of feature and smart phones,” the official added.

Places like banks of river Godavari in Ramkund area and Someshwar waterfall witnessed good number of people coming to spend some quality time with their families. The city had received steady rainfall on Saturday due to which people decided to remain indoors. But lack of rains on Sunday helped the citizens plan and come out of their homes. Policemen deployed at river banks in the city said though there were people, the rush was quite less. “Our bandobast at tourist spots to keep a check on violation of Covid norms remains intact,” a policeman said. Police inspector Sandeep Randive of Trimbakeshwar police station said they have maintained strict bandobast in the temple town as large number of devotees come here on the occasion of third Shravan Somvar to offer prayers. “Around 100 police personnel, including officers, have been deployed at various points to turn away the devotees in view of the Covid-19 scenario,” he said. “Hundreds of thousands of devotees come to Trimbakeshwar on every third Monday of the Hindu Shravan month. Hence, were are being more vigilant and cautious,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/weekend-rush-at-tourist-spots-reduces-due-to-raksha-bandhan/articleshow/85541987.cms||Santosh Sonawane

He said the state government was committed to clear all the dues owed by the Agrigold financiers in a phased manner.  Speaking at the party office, Appireddy said the government had already received over 7.76 lakh applications through village and ward volunteers and all the eligible applications would be cleared for payment after thorough verification. He told the depositors not to worry about getting their dues back as chief minister was ‘committed to do justice to all those duped by the financial company.’ The state government has already filed a petition in Telangana high court for transfer of the case to AP high court for speedy disposal. “The state government is also contemplating to set up fast track courts to expedite the trial and render justice to all the depositors who lost money in the scam-hit company,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rs-20k-relief-for-agrigold-depositors/articleshow/85544082.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Grant 3-day relief after rejection of anticipatory bail: HC||NAGPUR: In a landmark judgment which will come as a relief to those seeking anticipatory bail from sessions court under section 438 (4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) that mandates the accused’s physical presence, the Nagpur Bench of Bombay high court said that at least three days of interim relief shall be granted if such a bail is rejected. Justice Manish Pitale’s August 21 judgment is set to have far-reaching effects on the law relating to anticipatory bail matters and the rights of the prosecution as well as the accused. In his order, Justice Pitale wrote, “If the sessions court rejects the application for anticipatory bail upon final hearing and the accused is present before the court as per section 438(4) of the CrPC (Maharashtra Amendment), the court shall extend the interim protection of the accused for at least three working days, on the same conditions on which interim protection was granted during pendency of the application, or on such further conditions as the sessions court may deem fit.” The order also made it clear that such an interim relief period must not exceed seven days. However, the accused shall have to abide by all conditions set by the sessions court while granting interim protection, and if any violation is noticed then “such interim protection shall cease to operate instantaneously”. Senior advocate Avinash Gupta, who along with advocate Aakash Gupta appeared for the applicant Dr Sameer Paltewar, said, “Many times the prosecution mandates physical presence of the applicant in court even for anticipatory bail using section 438(4). However, no concrete reason is ever given as to why the applicant has to remain present for such a hearing. Naturally the applicant fears that if bail is rejected, s/he falls into the mouse trap and may get arrested within court premises.” Justice Pitale’s judgment also addresses the ‘physical presence’ question. The order says the prosecutor “shall state cogent reasons while seeking the obligatory presence of the accused before the sessions court at the time of final hearing of the application for anticipatory bail. The sessions court shall consider such an application and pass a reasoned order as to why the presence of the accused is necessary at the time of final hearing.” Advocates Shyam Dewani and Sahil Dewani, who appeared for the intervenor, said, “This judgment is truly pathbreaking because it brings clarity to an important legal issue.” Advocate SA Ashirgade appeared for the prosecution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-grant-3-day-relief-after-rejection-of-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/85546544.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Talks fail, Punjab cane farmers to continue rail, road blockades||CHANDIGARH/JALANDHAR: As the sugarcane farmers’ meeting with Punjab co-operation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa to discuss price rise and release of payment remained inconclusive here on Sunday, they decided to continue the rail and road blockades they had launched from Jalandhar on August 20. Randhawa said 12 farmer unionists had come to the meeting and the next round of talks will be on Tuesday. The minister said: “At 3.30 pm tomorrow (on Monday), the farmers will again sit with our negotiators from the state agriculture department and Punjab Agricultural University to discuss price calculation details.” On August 19, the Punjab government had revised the state advisory price (SAP) of sugarcane by Rs 15 per quintal to reach Rs 325 for the early variety, Rs 315 for mid variety, and Rs 310 for the late-maturing variety. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has come out in support of the farmers and asked for increasing the SAP to at least Rs 380. Also, nine co-operative and seven private sugar mills have to pay the farmers about Rs 160 crore for the last season. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) said on Sunday that the Punjab government had promised to get its research experts to consult the farmers on Monday on the cost-of-cane-production details, after which the CM will take a decision on Tuesday. The sugarcane growers will continue their Rail Roko agitation in Jalandhar, which on Sunday forced the Ferozepur division of the railways to cancel and divert many trains. The farmers continued occupying the national highway and railway tracks as well in the city. Their sisters came to the protest sites to tie them rakhi. The farmers opened the service road for two-wheelers and cars because of festival. The farmers claim that the sugarcane price had remained static for four years, and if they fail to get their dues of Rs 200 crore for the two previous seasons, they will be forced to reduce the area under this cash crop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/talks-fail-pb-cane-farmers-to-continue-rail-road-blockades/articleshow/85548491.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||In Mansa, panchayats of 2 villages ban politicians, warn locals of fine, boycott||Bathinda: A number of villages have placed banners at their entrances which announce a ban on the entry of political leaders, but two such hamlets in Budhlada block of Mansa district have gone a step further. The gram panchayats of Hero Khurd village and Kulrian village have passed resolutions to not allow the entry of any politician in the villages or even keep ties with one. In Hero Khurd, the panchayat has passed the resolution in writing, while the panchayat in Kulrian has passed the resolution orally. In its resolution, Hero Khurd’s panchayat has warned residents with social boycott and a fine of Rs 5,000 if they campaign for a political leader or call them for electoral purposes. In another resolution, the panchayat has asked residents to obey the roster of assigning duties to attend the farm protest at the borders of Delhi. If any person violates it without any reason, they too will have to pay the fine. A meeting of locals was called in Kulrian, where Punjab Kisan Union block Budhlada general secretary Babbu Singh sought their opinion on debarring the entry of politicians in villages and residents gave their consent with a voice vote. They even asked the union to put banners announcing this at all entry points of the village. Sources said the decisions had been taken under pressure from farm organisations as elections to the state assembly are less than six months away. Hero Khurd sarpanch Jugraj Singh said the panchayat had unanimously resolved not to keep any political relations with political parties for elections till the demands of farm organisations were not met. “We have asked residents to stay away from politicians and attend the protest at borders of Delhi or they may have to face the fines,” he said. Kulrian sarpanch Rajvir Singh said the decision was only taken after consulting all residents. It is learnt that the panchayats of other villages too are ready to pass similar resolutions in Mansa. ‘No such demand from SKM’ Senior farmer leader Ruldu Singh Mansa said he had learnt about the panchayats’ action, but Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) had asked farmers not to indulge in such things and only hold protests against BJP. “They have been asked to question political leaders when they visit villages,” he said ‘Can’t pass such resolution’ A government official who did not wish to be quoted said no village panchayat was allowed to pass a resolution which was against the spirit of Constitution and against fundamental rights of an individual||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-mansa-panchayats-of-2-villages-ban-politicians-warn-locals-of-fine-boycott/articleshow/85548506.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Cultivation of paddy creates higher CO2 emissions, says study||HYDERABAD: One hectare of paddy production releases 30,671 kg of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions into the atmosphere and impacts climate change, states a new study by Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA) conducted in Telangana. The study further said that the harmful methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20) emissions are part of CO2 equivalent, according to international standards. A tonne of CO2 contains 32 tonnes of methane and 300 tonnes of nitrogen dioxide (N20). Researchers said the study is important in the wake of recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report which said CO2 emissions must be reduced by 50% by 2030 from now to decrease the pace of climate change. CSA completed this study to understand the ecological footprints of paddy cultivation. Paddy farming creates higher emissions than all other crops due to water retention in the field, which produces methane (20,223 kg per hectare) and field energy usage (6,240 kg). According to agricultures scientist GV Ramanjaneyulu, who was actively engaged with the study, since paddy production has nearly doubled in seven years since Telangana’s formation, there is increased CO2 emission, and meeting the suggested objective set by the IPCC on lowering CO2 emissions is very challenging. “What we computed is simply at the farm level, but if we add water retention at large dams and irrigation projects, as well as power use, the CO2 emissions will be significantly higher,” he said. There is a need to examine how much overall impact paddy cultivation has when compared to CO2 emissions created by vehicles and industry, he noted. The study showed that wheat, groundnut, and tomato cultivation create considerably fewer carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per hectare than paddy cultivation. The study was carried out in Jangoan, Vikarabad, Adilabad, and Siddipet districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cultivation-of-paddy-creates-higher-co2-emissions-study/articleshow/85546508.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

They find it very difficult to reach a hospital in case of an emergency. More than three such emergency cases were reported in the region recently. Meanwhile, demand for laying roads to hilly areas has grown louder. Just a week ago, a pregnant woman in Vizianagaram Agency was taken to a hospital around 7 km away in a doli (makeshift stretcher). The incident took place at Chittampadu village under S Kota Mandal. Janni Atchiyyamma of Chittampadu village developed labour pain and due to lack of road connectivity, she was carried to Mettapalem Junction in a doli from where she was shifted to the government hospital at S Kota in an ambulance. A few days ago, a pregnant woman from Rega Punyagiri village under S Kota Manal in Vizianagaram Agency had to be carried in a doli for around 9 km before a vehicle could be found to take her to the hospital. Vanthala Shanthi developed labour pain on Friday. Due to the absence of road to her village, her husband Rajesh and her family members carried her in a doli to Punyagiri Junction from where she was shifted to the government hospital at S Kota. In the latest incident, O Budarayya, who fell sick, was taken to a hospital in a doli from Gunapadu village to S Kota Junction, around 9 km away, on Saturday. More than 500 hamlets in north Andhra Pradesh, comprising Vizag, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts, are yet to enjoy road connectivity. “The people in the hilly areas are deprived of proper roads, health facilities, safe drinking water and other amenities. We see doli carrying a pregnant woman or a sick person at least once a month. There were incidents in which some patients died on the way,” said K Lokanatham of CPM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/lack-of-road-connectivity-takes-toll-on-sick-in-north-andhra-pradesh-districts/articleshow/85544199.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Delhi||East Delhi civic body gives new life to old tyres||NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation is giving new life to old vehicle tyres in the junkyard by reusing them to develop street furniture and benches in municipal parks. The corporation has roped in Metro waste company for the project. EDMC earlier used old trucks to create a mobile children's park. With initiatives like Waste To Wonder park, recycled street furniture and mobile park, the three civic bodies are finding new ways to reuse waste. EDMC spokesperson Rakesh Gupta said that this is the third in the series of initiatives undertaken to re-use waste. “We are collecting old tyres from scrapyards and municipal stores. We have also started using old metal scrap from our horticulture stores to create small public art installations, which are being used in places like parks and municipal offices. No additional money has been spent on these projects,” he added. Earlier, the civic body had converted an old garbage truck into a small mobile park with swings and a children's play area. “This mobile park is being taken to congested places that do not have parks and play areas for children,” Gupta said. The first such mobile park was inaugurated at Delhi Tourism’s Garden Festival at Saket in February. More such parks will be developed, depending on the feedback. They would be placed in 14 wards in east Delhi with no playing areas or parks.  South Delhi Municipal Corporation is setting up a second park with the same concept as Waste to Wonder park in Punjabi bagh where Indian monuments are being created from scrap metal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-gives-new-life-to-old-tyres/articleshow/85546572.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Third mega vaccination drive on Monday; 1 lakh beneficiaries to be inoculated in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: As part of the health department's third mega vaccination drive, at least one lakh people will be administered Covid-19 vaccines in Uttarakhand on Monday. The department plans to vaccinate 50,000 people who have already booked vaccination slots and the remaining 50,000 will now need to furnish their identity cards to get the vaccine dose. The third leg of the inoculation campaign comes at a time when the pace of vaccination drive has slowed down in the state. “We have been organising several vaccination sessions but the influx of people has reduced due to excessive rainfall, poor road connectivity and landslides. We hope to record a good turnout on Monday,” Dr Kuldeep Singh Martolia, Uttarakahnd state immunisation officer, told TOI. So far, 75.4% of adult residents in Uttarakhand have received the first dose and 23.6% of the adult population has been fully vaccinated. This is better than the national average of 50.3% of adult citizens receiving the first jab and 14.3% getting both doses. Till date, Uttarakhand has received 78.03 lakh doses of Covishied, 6.7 lakh doses of Covaxin and 100 doses of Sputnik V, according to health department data. On Sunday, 66 people were given doses of the Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine that was procured by a medical college in private capacity. With this, Uttarakhand is now among those states where all three vaccines approved by Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) — Covaxin, Covishield, and Sputnik V — are being administered. The ZyCoV-D vaccine, which received the DCGI nod for emergency use on Friday (August 20), has not been rolled out in markets yet. Earlier on August 8, 1.75 lakh people were administered vaccine doses in the second mega vaccination drive. Similarly, 1.20 lakh people were jabbed in the first such drive. In Uttarakhand, 51.33% men, 48.63% women and 0.04% others have been vaccinated till date according to the data of health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/third-mega-vaccination-drive-on-monday-1-lakh-beneficiaries-to-be-inoculated/articleshow/85542130.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Hyderabad||Telangana urges central agency to continue funding PRLIS||HYDERABAD: Telangana government has shot off a letter to the Power Finance Corporation to continue loans for “unapproved” Palamuru-RangaReddy Lift Irrigation Scheme (PRLIS) at least under the component “drinking water scheme”. The Corporation had asked the state why it should continue to extend loans to PRLIS after the Centre’s recent gazette notification taking over irrigation projects on Krishna and Godavari termed the project as “unapproved”. “The state government explained to the central Corporation that there are two components in the project. The first priority is to complete work on supplying drinking water to over 1,200 villages and the second is to provide water to irrigate 12.30 lakh acres,” said a senior irrigation official. The Corporation had earlier approved a loan of Rs 6,160 crore for PRLIS and released about Rs 3,000 crore as the first instalment. After the Centre’s gazette notification, the Corporation has been sitting on the release of remaining loan component. The Andhra Pradesh government too has raised questions with the Union Jal Shakti ministry and the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) over loans being extended to “unapproved projects” by central government agencies. The state government has been executing work on PRLIS with an estimated cost of Rs 35,200 crore to supply drinking water to over 1,200 villages and irrigation supply to 12.30 lakh acres in Mahbubnagar, Rangareddy, Narayanpet, Vikarabad, Nagarkurnool and Nalgonda districts. The target is to divert 90 TMC flood water from Srisailam reservoir in 90 days every year through PRLIS. There is no threat of diversion of any assured water supply meant for Andhra Pradesh, officials said. The construction of reservoirs is under progress and experts have not ruled out the possibility of the project cost escalating to over Rs 50,000 crore by the time it is completed. In its letter to the Corporation, the state government informed that even the public hearing for environment clearance for PRLIS was held recently. While the state government is expecting to get environment clearance for the project at the earliest, it urged the Corporation to continue the loans “under drinking water component” until then. The state government also faces “loan-crunch” for its other projects which have been listed as “unapproved” by the gazette notification of the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-urges-central-agency-to-continue-funding-prlis/articleshow/85546564.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Nagpur||7 dalits tied up, thrashed brutally for ‘practising black magic’||Chandrapur: Seven members of two dalit families were tied to wooden poles of a shed and beaten mercilessly by a mob in village Wani (Khurd) in hilly Jiwti tehsil on Saturday. They were attacked for allegedly practising black magic, and the thrashing continued for hours till police came to their rescue. Seven people, including Eknath Huke (75), Sahebrao Huke (45), Prayagbai Huke ( 65), Shantabai Kamble (65), Shivraj Kamble (70), Dhammashila Huke (38) and Panchfula Huke (55), were injured in the mob assault. Five seriously injured elderly victims have been admitted at Chandrapur GMCH, while Dhammashila and Panchfula Huke were discharged after primary treatment at rural hospital in Jiwti the same day. Police took no action till Sunday evening, and began rounding up operations only after Sunday midnight. There is an eerie silence in the village after deployment of heavy police deployment as the news spread like wildfire everywhere. Bitterness had been brewing against the Kamble and Huke families since some time. The matter took a turn for the worse when four woman allegedly possessed by spirits (Bhanamati) named the two families on Muharram, on Friday. “The villagers held a meeting on Friday night and hatched a plan against us. A group marched to our house on Saturday morning, asking us to reach the village main square, as we were named for practising back magic by persons possessed by spirits. We agreed to go as we are innocent,” said victim Prayagbai Huke. She said four women allegedly possessed by spirits were making a scene at the square. They were raving and babbling nonsense, and struck some of the Kambles and Hukes with sticks or threw handful of soil. This, people said, showed the spirits have nailed these people and mob hysteria took over. The Huke and Kamble family members were then thrashed. Later, people tied Shivraj Kamble, his wife Shantabai Kamble and Prayagbai Huke to the poles and again thrashed the black and blue. Eknath Huke was beaten so mercilessly that his right hand was fractured. The village Wani (Khurd) has no phone coverage. A youth ran from the village to coverage area and informed the police. They reached hours later to rescue the victims. TOI is in possession of videos showing the women possessed by spirits nailing the victims by throwing soil on their faces, and the mob dragging them and beating them mercilessly with kicks and punches. Shivraj Kamble and Prayagbai Huke claimed they are afraid of their lives if they go back to their village. “Villagers are keen to drive us away and might kill us. We demand police protection for our families,” Prayagbai said. Subdivisional Police Officer (SDPO) Sushilkumar Nayak claimed the situation is under control now. “We have arrested 13 in connection with the mob assault and more arrests are likely,” he said. Those involved in the thrashing of Huke and Kamble families also belong to dalit community, but from different sect, he added. The arrested were identified as Sugriv Shinde, Datta Kamble, Prakash Kotambe, Santosh Panchal, Dadarao Kotambe, Balaji Kamble, Amol Shinde, Govind Aerekar, Keshav Kamble, Suraj Kamble and Datta Bhalerao. The four women who named the victims for practicing black magic while allegedly in possession of spirits have been admitted at psychiatric ward in GMCH Chandrapur. These women could be arrested on discharge, sources said. SP Arvind Salve also visited the village. A team of Andhshraddha Nirmulan Samiti headed by Anil Dahegaonkar visited the village and held a meeting to create awareness on Monday. People were enlightened about superstitions and explained there was no black magic or spirit possession. “Some people have hallucinations and delusions, go into trance-like condition, which people feel is possession by spirit or goddess. Hence, whatever they say during this trance is considered the words of spirit or goddess,” explained Dahegaonkar. He explained the spirit-possessed women naming Kambles and Hukes on Muharram created mass hysteria. “Even while we were holding awareness meeting, these women went into trance. We have strongly recommended their psychiatric treatment,” he said. Dahegaonkar underlined the need for strong awareness among people and demanded that the government, which has passed a law in this regard, should take the initiative to create awareness after such incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/7-dalits-tied-up-thrashed-brutally-for-practising-black-magic/articleshow/85563258.cms||Mazhar Ali

The villagers used to cross the checkpost to reach Hasanur in Tamil Nadu, from where they went to Sathyamangalam for various purposes. Thalavadi is near Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border. “The Pulinjur checkpost was closed by the Karnataka government during a lockdown imposed due to Covid. Officials in the checkpost allow people from Tamil Nadu only after they produce Covid negative certificates,” M Govindan, a resident of Thalavadi, said. “But it is not feasible for us to produce a certificate every time we cross the checkpost to reach Tamil Nadu.”So the villagers approached the forest officials to use the Thalamalai forest route to reach Sathyamangalam for various needs including medical purpose. Subsequently, officials allowed villagers to use the route only after verifying their documents and collecting a toll charge.Meanwhile, villagers petitioned the collector to use the route without prior permission or any charge until the Pulinjur checkpost is opened again. The collector, after consulting with the forest department, issued an order to the same. Before lockdown, the forest department did not allow villagers to use the route fearing man-animal conflicts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/erode-collector-allows-villagers-to-use-forest-route-sans-restrictions/articleshow/85546579.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||GHMC to introduce Cycle Sharing System||HYDERABAD: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has planned to introduce Cycle Sharing System (CSS) on a pilot basis at about 20 locations in GHMC’s Khairatabad Zone. According to the civic body, the initiative has been taken up to encourage people to turn towards an eco-friendly and low-cost mobility solution. This scheme will involve providing cycles in a closelyspaced network of fully automated stations in which users can check out cycles at one station and return them to any other station in the network. The civic body has invited requests for proposals to develop, design, procure,install, operate and maintain the CSS at various locations in Khairatabad Zone. “The service provider needs to submit the proposed station positions and layouts to GHMC for approval,” the GHMC said. The rollout of CSS would be paired with the introduction of dedicated cycling facilities in Khairatabad Zone for providing 20 docking stations, which are viable for the public and each station will be in the range of two to three kilometre of radius. The Hyderabad Public Bicycle Sharing (PBS) system will connect these stations to key modes of public transport, including Metro stations, bus stops etc. CSS would introduce cycling facilities in Khairatabad and provide 20 docking stations, which are viable for the public. Each station will be within a radius of 2-3 km||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-to-introduce-cycle-sharing-system/articleshow/85546607.cms||---

She was given the option of removing only the affected part of her uterus and for regular check-up. She, however, chose to have her uterus removed. She went under the knife on August 11 and was discharged a few days ago.Nirmala was one among the 190 rural women screened in western districts through a mobile cancer detection unit for breast and cervical cancer of Project Heal, launched by Kovai Medical Center & Hospital (KMCH) and Rotary Mettupalayam in February. Under the project, free medical camps are being conducted in villages to identify breast cancer and cervical cancer with a mobile mammogram and cervical cancer screening unit.“We can diagnose cervical cancer at a stage even before it starts becoming a cancer. This stage of precancer is called precancerous lesions,” said Anbukkani Subbian, gynecologic oncologist at KMCH. “Woman can be saved from developing cancer only if precancerous lesions are detected at this stage. Be it precancer or early stages of cancer, the patient will not have any symptoms. They can only be found out if they have a screening test,” she said.Medical professionals say that women over the age of 30 are encouraged to take the screening test to detect it in the pre-cancer stage itself. The precancerous stage is found in women who are over the age of 30. It may take more than 5-15 years for precancer to slowly develop into cancer.Project Heal gives a window of opportunity to detect precancer and treat them with simple surgeries, without going for advanced treatments like radiation or chemotherapy that cause side effects. “People would accept an ailment if they go to hospital for check-ups following symptoms and get it confirmed from doctors. Here, we are going to the doorsteps of normal and healthy women for screening. Most of them refuse to acknowledge when they are made aware of the early condition,” said Suresh Ananthakrishnan, COO of Project Heal Trust. “Most of the patients with cervical cancer are identified only at the final stage as there are no symptoms for the ailment in the early stage. By early screening, we can avoid 50-60% cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cervical-cancer-screening-initiative-project-heal-boon-for-rural-women/articleshow/85546568.cms||---

The day saw the state make up 21.14% of all vaccine doses that were administered in the country. The figure for fully vaccinated people rose to 1.4 crore in the state. The number of people who have received a single vaccine shot climbed close to 2.5 crore. Total vaccine doses administered in the state crossed 5.3 crore. The estimated adult population of the state is around 8.5 crore. Of the vaccine doses administered in August in the state, 20% have been in the city, which has administered 85 lakh doses till now, including nearly 21.61 lakh full vaccinations. Prvate hospitals have admnistered 36.92 lakh doses. Vaccination numbers in August were dwindling due to a shortage of vaccines at public centres. This was after the state had vaccinated over 1.21 crore in July and 98.64 lakh in June. The state is now confident it will be able to repeat July’s performance. “Saturday’s nationwide Covid-19 vaccination figures were 52.23 lakh doses, of which 11.04 lakh were administered in Maharashtra,” Dr Pradip Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), said. Among districts, the city administered the highest doses at 2,58,288. While the number included 1,47,175 vaccinations done in private hospitals over Friday, Saturday and Sunday, it also comprised 1,03,325 vaccinations done in the public sector on Saturday alone, which civic officials said was a record. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the city now had 438 vaccination centres, including private ones, that can administer up to 2 lakh doses on any given day. After Saturday’s vaccinations, the city has managed to deliver over 16 lakh doses in August. Over 10 lakh doses have been given in the private sector, or 62%, and six lakh in the public sector. Civic officials blamed the lag in the public sector on the shortage of supply that forced them to cancel the drive for five days. The highest vaccinations in the city so far have been in June, when 22.34 lakh doses were given. Former KEM dean Dr Avinash Supe said the higher vaccination coverage of people over 45 years old in the city could mean greater protection if the third wave comes. As per civic data, nearly 11 lakh senior citizens have taken at least one dose of the vaccine, while among people over 45 years old, over 16 lakh have taken at least one dose. From the age group of 18-44, over 32.36 lakh have taken at least one dose in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-administers-a-record-11-04-lakh-doses-in-one-day/articleshow/85546645.cms||---

Nehru college of arts and science closed courses closed BSc Physics, BSc Microbiology with nano-technology, MSc electronic media and BSc electronics and communication. Sri Ramakrishna college of arts and science for women has removed MCA program from this year. Bharathiar University has also approved the closure of these courses. V Radhika, principal of Sankara college of arts and science said students were preferring courses like commerce that offer jobs immediately after graduation. Microbiology is more a research-oriented with limited scope for jobs immediately after graduation, she said. Industry experts are asking colleges to offer programmes like nano-technology, artificial intelligence and data science which are relevant in the present day, said an academician. Such programmes are more viable with more job opportunities than the conventional courses, he said. Nehru arts and science college, Coimbatore, was receiving applications in single digit for courses like BSc electronics and communications system and BSc Physics. “We closed some programmes only to offer new courses. For instance, we are closing a section of the BBA CA programme to accommodate BBA logistics which has had good demand in the recent years,” principal Dr B Anirudh said. “Any self-financing programme would not be viable to run with students’ strength in single digit. Courses like BSc Physics occupy a large space. By freeing up the space, we are accommodating programmes like BSc data science, Artificial Intelligence and robotics and machine learning and BSc digital forensic science and cyber security,” the principal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/2-colleges-close-4-courses-each/articleshow/85546576.cms||Sampath Kumar

Gold and jewellery traders said that they are facing problems in loading and unloading goods due to the redeveloped area being declared as a non-motorised vehicle zone. Traders met special CP, traffic police, to express concerns about the security of their goods and problems faced by vehicles carrying jewellery. Chandni Chowk hosts two huge gold and jewellery markets — Kuncha Mahajani, one of Asia’s biggest gold and jewellery markets and Dariba Kalan, a retail market for gold and silver jewellery. Yogesh Singhal, who heads the bullion and jewellers association at Kuncha Mahajani in Chandni Chowk, said that vehicles carrying gold and ornaments are being stopped arbitrarily near the Red Fort end of the pedestrianised stretch. “The distance between the market and the barrier is around 600-700m and it is unsafe to carry the goods on foot or rickshaws. Sometimes the vehicles are allowed to enter, but sometimes barred,” he explained Gold traders state that their concerns were raised at the planning stage, but not taken into consideration. “Bank cash vans are exempt from the pedestrian rule, but vehicles carrying ornaments are not,” Singhal said. Singhal said that in a meeting of traders and special CP (traffic) on Thursday, police agreed to look into the matter after Independence Day. The association has stated that there are 25 vehicles from four companies that transport gold and ornaments by turn. “The list of vehicles should be present with police officers at the checkpoint. On a given day, only eight such vehicles come to the market. The vehicles are changed due to safety purposes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pedestrinised-chandni-chowk-transportation-of-gold-jewelry-at-risk-say-traders/articleshow/85546636.cms||Paras Singh

They said the work was likely to be completed in 10 days. After the sidewall breached at Kannavelampalayam near Perundurai, agricultural lands in five villages were inundated, as water gushed out of the canal. The water flow is yet to be arrested. Housing and urban development minister S Muthusamy, district collector H Krishnanunni and PWD officials had inspected the breached area the same day. S Nallasamy, secretary, LBC Farmers’ Welfare Association, said there was no such breach when the sidewall was constructed with mud. “The concrete wall wasn’t strong enough to withstand the aquatic pressure.” He has appealed officials to check the entire canal pathways while laying concrete structures. A PWD official, who is monitoring the civil work, said the sidewall had breached because of soil erosion. “The concrete wall collapsed only because of the soil erosion. The restoration work will be completed in the next 10 days.” PWD officials had released water into the Lower Bhavani Canal from the Bhavanisagar dam on August 15 to irrigate 2.5 lakh acres of fertile land in Erode, Tirupur and Karur districts. Close to 1000 cubic feet per second water was being released into the canal from the dam. After the sidewall breach, officials have stopped the water release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/officials-fast-track-work-to-restore-bhavani-canal-bund/articleshow/85546632.cms||---

Now that she will be participating in Club Throw F51 event at Tokyo 2020 Paralympics, she is happy and proud of herself. Her journey, however, has been tough and she overcame many obstacles to reach this position. Lakra, who is wheelchair-bound, said, “I have been training as a wrestler since childhood and have been a national-level player. I always dreamt of representing India. However, during a practice session in November 2017, I sustained an injury and could not walk properly. I was shattered and thought that my life would be confined to a room.” She was forced to drop out of school for a year due to her injury. “However, I never lost hope. When I came in touch with my current coach Satyapal Singh, he informed me about being a para-athlete. Under his guidance, I started practising for the club throw,” said the Mundka resident. She is currently in Class XII. “It gives me immense happiness that I will be participating in the paralympics event at such a young age,” said the elated girl. Though she is nervous about the event, Lakra will be flying to Tokyo on August 26 aiming to give her 100% in the competition. Similarly, despite suffering from a pulled hamstring in her left leg, Simran Sharma (22), who is visually impaired, is determined to give her best in the 100-metre race. “My doctor had initially advised me to go for therapy. I was required to take rest for a month for the treatment of my pulled hamstring. As I cannot compromise with my training, I’m undergoing rehabilitation exercises,” she said. Her husband, Gajendra Singh, who is a Naik in the Indian Army, is her coach and motivates her a lot. “My husband was a marathon runner, but he quit to support me. I’m not under pressure for a medal, but I will be running in the event with an aim to give my best in the competition,” said Sharma, who started professional training under her husband in 2019. Praveen Kumar, an 18-year-old physically challenged youth, is excited to participate in the high jump E44 event. Though his training was affected due to the lockdown, Kumar aims to make a jump of at least 2.05 metres. “I used to play volleyball in school and my jump was good. Once I participated in a high jump competition in school. As I did well, I started undergoing training for it,” said the youth, whose father is a farmer. Satyapal Singh, head coach, Indian Paraathletics team, said, “Four para-athletes from Delhi will participate in the paralympics. Praveen bagged a silver medal in the Junior World Championship in July 2019 and occupied the fourth place in the Senior World Championship in November 2019. He won a gold in World Grand Prix and created Asia’s record of 2.05 metres in high jump.” Another Delhi youth, Sharad Kumar, would be participating in the high jump in 42 category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fighting-odds-3-para-athletes-from-delhi-hope-to-make-india-proud-at-tokyo-games/articleshow/85544343.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

He said that the appointment of former union finance minister P Chidambaram as the party’s election observer was an indication of the its seriousness about party affairs in Goa. “In the past, election observers were usually appointed barely two months ahead of the elections. It is for the first time that the party leadership has appointed observers a good six months ahead. And the fact that a senior leader of the status of Chidambaram has been appointed as observer shows that the party wants to leave nothing to chance this time,” Chodankar said. He further said that candidates for the polls are likely to be declared two months ahead of the polls. “We are confident that the way we are getting tremendous response from the people, the way social activists and politicians are joining Congress with their large number of supporters, Congress will definitely form the next government in Goa,” Chodankar said. Senior Congress functionaries told TOI that the party leadership has, for the first time, commissioned multiple agencies for conducting independent in-depth political surveys about its prospects and potential here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aicc-serious-about-2022-polls/articleshow/85548557.cms||---

The result of the research was published in the recent issue of the science publication, Journal of Water and Climate Change. According to the projections, the average rainfed gap in yield of paddy will be 1.49 tonnes per hectare in the future. “The trend of seasonal climate variables shows an expected increase in maximum temperature, minimum temperature and rainfall, and a decreasing trend in solar radiation in the future i.e. 2030 and 2040s over the study area. Consequently, average spatial water-limited potential rice yield is expected to reduce from 3.62 tonnes per hectare in the historical period to 3.11 tonnes per hectare and 3.02 tonnes per hectare during the 2030 and 2040s, respectively,” the study predicted. The researchers said their finding “contributes to understanding the consequences of climate change on rice yield gap and future food security concerns in India, which is essential for agricultural policy planning and the selection of mitigation strategies to reduce the rice yield gap”. Another research study by the National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) of which CRIDA is a participant research body, projects a potential reduction in yield of kharif rice in extreme climates. Significant reduction in climate potential of current varieties’ yield is projected in RCP 8.5 scenario...Initial analysis on impact of climate change on transplanted rice yield in different management conditions indicated that the magnitude and direction of impact has high spatial variation. If no adaptation is followed, transplanted rice yield may reduce in some regions||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rice-yield-expected-to-dip-in-many-states/articleshow/85546653.cms||---
---||Delhi||Immunity boosting library in northwest Delhi to showcase medicinal plants||NEW DELHI: An “immunity-boosting library” which has been developed at Poothkalan in northwest Delhi has been opened for Delhiites to educate them on the usage of medicinal plants and the process of growing them at home. People will be allowed to take the medicinal plants for free from the nurseries of the forest department. Times ViewThis is a creative and inventive way to make common people aware of the medicinal benefits of herbs and plants. However, the forest department should also inform visitors that these immunity-boosting plants offer no specific protection from the virus; only Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination can do that.Forest department officials said the place was named “immunity-boosting library” to help visitors closely watch and learn about the health benefits of medicinal plants. If any person has health issues, he or she can know what herbs should be added to their diet for improvement. Visitors can enjoy a walk in the library and know the process of growing the plants at home. For instance, for growing giloy in a pot, it should be soaked in water for 24 hours and later cut into five-inch-long pieces. These sticks should be covered in soil in a pot, whose height should be 6 to 12 inches. Deputy conservator of forests (North) Vipul Pandey said, “The purpose is to let people take a walk in the library. They can observe the qualities of medicinal plants and learn how to grow them. They can then go to the nearby nursery and pick up the plants of their choice.” He added that entry is free for visitors. “We beautified a vacant plot which was lying unused for a long time.

---||Coimbatore||Decide on Vinayaka Chaturthi celebrations: Idol makers to govt||Krishnagiri: The idol makers in Krishnagiri district urged the state government to end the uncertainty over Vinayaka Chaturthi celebrations and make its decision on the issue clear soon. They claimed that the wholesale sellers were not placing orders for Vinayaka idols due to the uncertainty. This in turn had placed the lives of many artisans, who are already reeling under huge debt, in a dire state.T V Mani, an idol maker in Krishnagiri, said the government has to announce the maximum height of idols that would be allowed in celebrations. “It doesn’t matter whether it is 8ft or 5ft or even 3ft, but making it clear will encourage the sellers to place orders with us.” He said that last year, idols up to 3ft were allowed to be used in celebrations.“When sales started to pick up, a few outfits announced that they would go on to celebrate the festival by placing huge idols in public places, despite government restrictions. So, police started restricting idol movements and idol making, which poured cold water on the sales.”Mani, who is also the secretary of the Thirunilagandar mud and paper dolls producers’ welfare association, said that last year’s stock remained unsold with many artisans in the district. “About Rs 4 crore worth items from last year remained unsold among100 artisans in Krishnagiri alone.”N Ariappan, another idol maker from Krishnagiri, said, “For more than one year I was struggling to pay interest for Rs 12 lakh loan he borrowed to procure raw materials for making idols. I have a stock worth Rs 15 lakh in hand. Already struggling with huge debt, I also have to pay rent for the godown where the idols are kept. I really don’t know what to do if the government does not allow sales this year also.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/decide-on-vinayaka-chaturthi-celebrations-idol-makers-to-govt/articleshow/85546657.cms||---

The Race Course police said S Vikram, a native of Vani Nagar at Darasuram near Kumbakonam in Thanjavur district, had contacted Lakshmanakumar, a resident of Duraisamy Nagar at Rakkipalayam in Tirupur district, on July 15 based on an advertisement posted by the latter on OLX to sell his bike. The two then struck the deal for Rs 55,000.Lakshmanakumar, a police officer said, asked Vikram to meet him near Anna Statue signal in Coimbatore on July 21 to seal the deal. “Vikram, along with his friend Santhosh, a resident of Saravanampatti, met him as scheduled. Lakshmanakumar showed them photocopy of his Aadhaar card and Vikram brought down the deal amount to Rs 50,000 after inspecting the vehicle. The bike owner also agreed to the revised price.”Vikaram, the officer said, paid an advance amount of Rs 30,000 to the bike owner, who said he had pledged the registration certificate of the vehicle and asked the former to collect the same from his mother, who lives in Coimbatore, after two days.“Before handing over the bike, Lakshmanakumar expressed his wish to ride the bike for one last time and Vikram agreed. The bike owner, however, sped away with his vehicle. He later switched off his mobile phone as well,” the officer said.When Vikram came across the same advertisement on OLX a few days ago, the officer said, he contacted Lakshmanakumar through his employer Parthiban and struck a deal. “Lakshmanakumar asked Parthiban to meet him at Lakshmi Mills Junction in Coimbatore on Saturday around 9am. When the two were talking, Vikaram and his friends caught Lakshmanakumar and produced him before the Race Course police,” the officer said.Based on Vikram’s complaint, police registered a case against Lakshmanakumar under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code and arrested him the same evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tirupur-man-takes-bike-buyer-for-a-ride-held/articleshow/85546661.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hospitals start receiving requests for booster dose from health staff||MUMBAI: Hospital authorities have started fielding requests from doctors, nurses and ancillary staffers to offer them a booster dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The requests are particularly coming from those who took the vaccine in the initial days of the drive in January and February. “There is an increasing belief that a booster dose will protect them against the predicted third wave. There is a strong demand, no doubt. But we need more evidence to say it is required,” said Dr Om Srivastava, an infectious disease expert and member of the Covid task force. Dr Avinash Supe, executive director of Hinduja Hospital, Khar, said healthcare workers have started discussing a third dose and many want it. “Many are worried that their antibody titres have depleted,” he said, while adding that things were largely at the level of discussion. Booster shots have become a topic of a boiling debate the world over as public health officials argue whether it is safe and necessary at all, especially when many have not got any doses in the low- income countries. The US has decided to roll out booster shots from September. The city’s public sector too is abuzz with talks of booster dose. Dr Balkrishna Adsul, dean of SevenHills Hospital, said that many of his colleagues have taken antibody tests recently and found a drop in the titres. “Given that ours is a dedicated Covid hospital, they think a third dose will protect them better. But no decision can be taken at our level,” Dr Adsul said. Healthcare workers who took the vaccine in January and February were fully vaccinated within four weeks, as the gap between doses was 28 days then. So, many have completed six months since full vaccination, said Adsul. Experts say that though a third dose may not have safety issues per se, there is no proof yet that the high level of protection offered by the vaccines against severe disease and hospitalisation is waning. Dr J P Muliyil, a member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), said an observational study from Israel that people who were vaccinated one year ago have less protection from Delta virus has created concerns. “After taking a booster dose, antibody levels come up within hours. But it doesn’t only mean that vaccines work, it indicates that your body remembers. So, even if the virus were to infect again, your body would respond immediately too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hospitals-start-receiving-requests-for-booster-dose-from-health-staff/articleshow/85546668.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Different vaccines may have different schedules. It is being closely watched and studied,” Dr Paul told TOI The Niti Aayog member said the focus now was on covering the country’s adult population with the two doses of Covid vaccine. Against the backdrop of Serum Institute of India (SII) chairman Cyrus Poonawalla emphasising on the need of third or booster dose of Covishield vaccine six months after the second dose, Dr Paul said that very few countries in the world, including the US and Israel, had started withCovid vaccine booster doses. He said there was no recommendation from the World Health Organisation (WHO) about it yet. “We are watching the emerging data in this regard continuously and would be guided by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) in this regard,” he said. About reducing the gap between two doses of Covishield, Dr Paul said there was no recommendation from NTAGI on it either. “The present gap between the two doses of Covishield is based on science and there is currently no issue about it. So, the government is not currently thinking about reducing the gap between its two doses,” he said. At present, the gap between two doses of Covishield is 84 days or 12-16 weeks. The SII chairman had recently said in an interaction that the ideal gap between two doses of Covishield was two months as against the 12-16 weeks gap mandated by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-govt-not-considering-booster-shots-as-of-now-says-niti-aayog-member/articleshow/85546714.cms||Nisha Nambiar

As part of a funded-project by the Defence Materials and Stores Research and Development Establishment (DMSRDE), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), researchers at BITS, Pilani, Hyderabad along with those from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, studied ‘underwater characterisation and monitoring of silicon solar cells in diverse water settings’. “Essentially, sufficient solar energy is available underwater that is enough to run self-powered submarine equipment. The purpose of the study was to develop some capabilities and data repository from various kinds of solar cells for its usage underwater,” said Sudha Radhika, assistant professor, department of electrical and electronics engineering, BITS, Hyderabad. For this, the researchers tested different solar cells coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) — a material that is highly transparent, possesses high light absorption properties and is hydrophobic — underwater. “When the solar cell comes in contact with water, it will short circuit as water is conductive making the optimum encapsulation crucial,” said Sanket Goel, principal investigator and professor, department of electrical and electronics engineering, BITS, Hyderabad. “Such solar cells, covered with PDMS, will convert solar energy into electrical energy, which in turn will help power submerged sensors and other marine equipment.” “Our study found that the power output of solar cells underwater was 70% of that on the surface, and extensive work is going on to enhance it further.” He said that other interesting aspects in submerged conditions, like self-cleaning and natural cooling, help in achieving more power density from underwater solar. The researchers, including Prasanth Kumar, a PhD scholar, developed a test-bed within the BITS, Hyderabad campus where they designed and fabricated an underwater environment wherein they prepared artificial seawater and conducted the characterisation using a solar simulator. They tested the cells submerged in four water environments — de-ionized water, lake water, real seawater and artificial seawater prepared with commercially bought sea salt and other water impurities. Based on the study, it was observed that solar cells have a huge potential to utilise the underwater solar energy into electrical energy, which could power many sensors and other systems used in an underwater environment for commercial and defence applications. “Even though there are challenges and constraints, the obtained results manifest huge potential for solar PV technology underwater for commercial and defence applications with modern electronics. These results further encourage us to explore more by considering other influencing parameters like turbulence, temperature, and also other impurities,” read a research paper, which was recently published in International Journal of Energy Research. The group is now working towards employing other solar cells and performing on-field studies to deploy such capabilities in real applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/solar-cells-by-city-scientists-to-make-waves/articleshow/85548890.cms||Preeti Biswas

Where are the inquiry reports?” Revanth questioned. Speaking to mediapersons, Revanth held KCR responsible for Eatala joining BJP. “TRS and BJP are playing politics of money and power. Congress will contest to win the by-poll to Huzurabad assembly constituency irrespective of the outcome,” Revanth said. Revanth claimed that Congress Dandora meetings were getting good response from the people and would result in the downfall of the KCR government. “KCR has not implemented promises made to Dalits. Do TRS MLAs have the courage to go into their constituencies and announce Dalit Bandhu is a good scheme. Will the people of their constituency not ask them the date of implementation of Dalit Bandhu in their respective constituencies?” Revanth asked. “IAS officer Rahul Bojja is an efficient officer. KCR should not claim he has done a favour by posting him in the chief minister’s office. Even R S Praveen Kumar was an efficient officer, but quit IPS service due to injustice meted out to him,” Revanth alleged.

---||Pune||Fewer people forgo wearing face covers: Cops||Pune: The Pune police have claimed that the number of people violating the norm of not wearing masks has reduced lately. Despite the change in statistics, officers on the ground said the issue is a cause for major concern and it has become difficult to catch those moving around without masks. According to the figures shared, the number of people being caught for the offence on a daily basis has shrunk to a few thousands from some lakhs last year. “Wearing a mask has been the norm since the pandemic began and, by now, most people follow the rule. For a majority of people, the mask has become a habit. However, we still see some cases each day. As compared to September 2020, there has been over 99% decrease in such cases by mid-August this year,” said a senior police officer. However, a constable with the traffic police said, “Each day, we see many people not wearing masks or wearing them inappropriately. A majority of such people are on two-wheelers and are youngsters. It is difficult to stop them unless we have the element of surprise. However, the number of people violating the norm has reduced now. We have standing orders to fine people not wearing masks but there are fewer people without masks these days.” City-based psychologist Swapnil Deshmukh told TOI that the false sense of security among many still persists. “People tend to be alert whenever there is a spike in cases but then when there are fewer cases, they think all is well. Many people also want to portray a ‘bindaas’ image. This is true particularly among youngsters, although vaccines aren’t available for them yet. This is mainly due to the burnout they have suffered for so many months. In addition, there is a misunderstanding that masks are bad for health and there is a tendency not to follow rules even though it is unlawful. These perceptions need to change, and the authorities must think forward rather than just impose fines,” Deshmukh said. “It is concerning to see many people not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. The police should conduct flash raids and cops must move around in civil clothes to implement the rule. We don’t want cases to rise yet again,” said Kondhwa resident Rajesh Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fewer-people-forgo-wearing-face-covers-cops/articleshow/85546725.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kolkata||Number of bikes flouting night curbs on rise across Kolkata||KOLKATA: Bikers, flouting Covid norms or traffic rules, are no longer restricted to the peak hours. The number of two-wheelers breaking the night restrictions, by being out on city roads post 11pm, has seen a significant increase this weekend. Traffic guards across the city say that since May the four-wheelers were consistently flouting night restrictions. “This weekend, things have changed drastically. In areas that fall on the fringes of the city and the added areas — even parts of central Kolkata — the number of two-wheelers flouting the night restrictions is 30% more than four-wheelers. In some pockets, it was almost double the number of four-wheelers,” said an officer at Lalbazar. In the East guard area — comprising area between Loudon Street, Park Circus and Ballygunge — of the 122 prosecutions, more than 60% were two-wheeler riders. At Ultadanga guard, 19 of the 34 prosecuted were two-wheeler riders. Overall, the Kolkata traffic police have prosecuted 511 persons for flouting night restrictions on Saturday night in a drive that lasted just one hour. Till noon on Sunday, the local police ended prosecuting 266 person. The police said several of the motorists and bikers were even charged for not wearing masks or spitting on the road. Yet again, the east and south traffic guards ended up with the highest number of prosecutions. Out of the 180 motorists checked within one hour — between 11pm and midnight — the police found 122 of them flouting the norms. Similarly 34 of the 41 motorists and bikers checked under Ultadanga guard, 34 were found to be breaking the norms. At Tiljala, 29 of the 35 checked could not give a valid reason for being out on the road. Police sources said they are now witnessing a general rise in traffic rule violations among two-wheeler riders. “Across the city, triple riding and not wearing helmets have increased. This has become all the more visible at night. Several app bike riders and those delivering food were also caught defying the general laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-of-bikes-flouting-night-curbs-on-rise/articleshow/85544430.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||India||Gaps in disease control hit livestock sector's growth: Panel||NEW DELHI: Noting large-scale prevalence of animal diseases as “the biggest impediment to growth of the livestock sector” in India, a parliamentary panel has pointed at certain gaps in the country’s disease control programmes, veterinary infrastructure and availability of animal vaccines. It also expressed concerns over the failure of the department of animal husbandry to lay down separate and specific guidelines or provisions for training and education in the field of poultry farming and poultry health despite having rampant annual occurrences of Avian Influenza or Bird Flu in the country. Avian Influenza is a zoonotic disease. Human infections with avian influenza viruses occur after prolonged and close contact with infected birds. The panel, the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture, had submitted its report to the Parliament during the monsoon session on August 10. India has a vast resource of livestock and poultry, which plays a vital role in improving the socio-economic conditions of rural masses. Though various programmes have been going on to deal with animal diseases such Foot & Mouth Disease (FMD), Brucellosis in cattle and buffaloes, and Classical Swine Fever (CSF) in pigs, the Committee felt the need for the Centre and states to scale up their efforts on multiple fronts. On the veterinary infrastructure front, it felt that the efforts of the department need to be focused on identifying the most vulnerable states/UTs and encouraging them to avail funds for strengthening such Infrastructure under existing arrangement. The Committee noted that out of the 10 major deficient states in veterinary infrastructure identified in January, 2019, only seven have submitted proposals for receiving such funds. “The remaining three states of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan witnessed a percentage deficit of 82.7%, 57.9% and 54.3% respectively, with Gujarat being the top-most deficient in veterinary infrastructure among the 10 states in January, 2019,” said the panel, chaired by BJP Lok Sabha member P C Gaddigoudar, in its report. It said, “The Committee feel that such a huge deficit in veterinary infrastructure and services not only hampers the quality and output of the livestock sector of these states but also deprives individual livestock owners of basic facilities regarding health, upkeep and maintenance of cattle, poultry and other livestock while also denying them the opportunity to optimize their output potential.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gaps-in-disease-control-hit-livestock-sectors-growth-panel/articleshow/85550263.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The number of new Covid deaths reported in a single day has not been that low since the very beginning of the pandemic in March last year. During its worst, the city has seen upto 136 deaths registered in a single day. The woman, aged 40-60, did not have comorbidities, the civic body said, adding that Mumbai’s total Covid toll has reached 15,947. The city’s cumulative Covid fatality rate now stands at 2.15%. Mumbai has been reporting deaths in the single digit for three weeks. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that the city’s fatality rate had been less than 1% through most of the second wave. “The key is that people come to hospitals early,” he said. Mumbai had reported the first Covid positive case in March 11, 2020, and first death six days later (March 17). Deaths remained in single digit till April 10, before they started climbing to double digits. By June 2020, the city had seen deaths in triple digits. The most deaths reported in a single day was 136, reported on June 20. During the second wave this year, daily deaths have never crossed two digits in the city. Cases too continued to be under 300 for Mumbai, but there was a marginal rise from Saturday. The city reported 294 new Covid cases on Sunday, up from 262 on Saturday. Mumbai’s cumulative Covid tally has touched 7,41,164. The state continued to see a drop in daily detection of cases. A total of 4,141 cases were reported on Sunday, taking the state Covid tally to 64,24,651. The state also reported 145 deaths, to take the overall toll to 1,35,962. Active cases in the state dropped to 53,182 while that of Mumbai to 2,877. Satara district reported 45 deaths, the highest in the state. Balasaheb Patil, guardian minister of the district, told TOI more tracing, testing and immediate treatment would be done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-single-covid-death-in-city-for-first-time-since-march-2020/articleshow/85546856.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Aaditya Thackeray invites youngsters to lead global collaborations, fight climate change||NAGPUR: Taking a novel initiative to engage the youth in combating climate change, the Maharashtra government has started internships for youngsters under its latest Climate Fellowship Programme. Under this, the selected youngsters will get a rare opportunity to represent the government and lead international coalitions. Designed by the state environment and climate change department under the leadership of environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, the idea of the programme is to expand the environment department and build a solid narrative on climate change. “Though we call upon the youth to take on the challenges and say that they are the future, we hardly entrust them with responsibilities. Being in the 30s myself, I see the difference that the youth can bring about when called upon to do good,” Thackeray told TOI. The state has invited applications for the six-moth internship programme from graduates, post-graduates and research scholars from any background. A total of 20 internship positions have been announced. This is the second cycle of the programme, the first of which was held in February this year. Giving out details, Aaditya said, “Climate change mitigation and adaptation is a sector where the youth will do beyond the call of its duty because it is for them and their future generations. We need innovation, fire in the belly and newer ideas and vigour. That’s what we get from the interns.” Through the initiative, the youngsters will get an opportunity to take leadership roles in taking the climate change dialogue at national and international stages. “What we have realized is that climate change is a very cross-cutting subject and we need young policy-makers to become extremely fluid within the government. Through this programme, the interns will be taking leadership roles in going across different government departments – whether its energy, the pollution control board, agriculture or any other and stitch the climate narrative together,” said Saurabh Punamiya Jain, research and public policy assistant to the state cabinet minister of environment and climate change. To ensure sustainable development of the state and raise awareness about rising climate emergencies, Maharashtra has been pro-active in being a part of C40 Cities, Cities4Forests, U-2 Coalition along with other projects like Majhi Vasundhara. “After partaking in such enterprises, the question then arises how do you keep the engagement going as these are very contemporary forms of networks which can get difficult for a typical government officer to deal with by themselves.

However, vaccination in the first trimester of the pregnancy has remained on the lower side compared to the second and third trimesters, gynaecologists have observed. The first trimester is a period of organ formation and hence needs critical evaluation of every drug or even food supplement. That’s the reason why doctors and women are concerned about opting for the Covid shot during the first three months of pregnancy, experts have said. “Women who are at high-risk of Covid due to professional commitment should take the vaccine,” said gynaecologist Pankaj Sarode, vice-president of the Pune Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society. Vaccination in the first trimester is comparatively low. “It has been our observation that less than 5% of pregnant women opt for vaccination in the first three months of pregnancy,” Sarode said. Gynaecologist Milind Dugad said, “We strongly recommend all pregnant and lactating women to undergo vaccination as soon as possible.” “As compared to the first wave, we have seen higher morbidity and mortality among pregnant women in the second wave,” said gynaecologist Shilpa Naik, associate professor at state-run B J Medical College, and Sassoon hospital. A small survey of 106 vaccinated pregnant women carried out by the Pune-based Gupte Hospital, a dedicated maternity hospital, has revealed that only 36 had taken a shot in the first trimester. “Covid vaccine is safe and every pregnant women should opt for it,” said senior gynaecologist Sanjay Gupte, owner and medical director of Gupte hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccination-low-in-first-trimester-say-doctors/articleshow/85546801.cms||Umesh Isalkar

According to police, preliminary findings suggest suicide. However, they are probing all possible angles. The woman was a resident of Manipur and was planning to get married soon, her brother said. She had gone to visit her friend from Mizoram and later jumped off from the building. Her kin were informed and the body was sent for postmortem, police said. The deceased's friend, in her statement to the police, said the former was living in a rented house in Indira Colony and had come to her place on Saturday evening. "She locked herself in one of the rooms and did not open it even when I knocked several times. I rushed to call the landlord on the ground floor. But, as soon as I reached his floor, she had jumped off the window and died on the spot. The police were informed and they had to break open the door of the room to investigate," her statement added. "Though the exact reason is yet to be ascertained, the autopsy report stated she died of head injury. Her brother, sister and her father have reached the city. The body has been handed over to the kin who will perform the last rites in Manipur," Mamta Bohra, SP (City), said on Sunday. "We have not received any complaint of foul play, so far. But, we are probing the case thoroughly," the SP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/26-year-old-woman-from-north-east-jumps-off-a-building-in-rudrapur-dies/articleshow/85542248.cms||Aakash Ahuja

Delhi Metro stations to get brighter feel, save power too||NEW DELHI: To save energy and provide a better lighting experience, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has undertaken a massive drive to replace the existing conventional lights with LED ones at 155 locations covering stations, depots, parking lots, etc. The incandescent bulbs, fluorescent lamps, CFL lamps, etc were installed under DMRC’s Phase-I project in 2005 and Phase-II in 2010. “Around 75% of the drive has been covered by installing around one lakh LED lights. The remaining part will be completed by the end of October wherein around 35,000 LED lights will be installed,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. The operational life of conventional lights was around 10 years. “DMRC decided to replace these lights, which are well past their effective age, with new age LED lights that are both cost effective as well as energy efficient. LED-based lighting solutions have been implemented at all Phase-III stations and a similar system will be adopted for the upcoming Phase-IV stations too,” said Dayal. “The LED-based light system will help DMRC save around half of the energy expenditure. As a result, the cost of installing these lights will be recovered in around two years,” he added. The lifespan of LEDs is long compared with conventional lights with a much reduced maintenance cost. “The average LED lasts 50,000 operating hours. It is more than 40 times the lifespan of an incandescent bulb. In addition, LED lights have an energy efficiency component that makes them consume a very low amount of power,” Dayal said. Undertaking the drive at operational stations was a challenging task as the work had to be executed at night time for safety reasons, which increased installation time. “Even at night, the work can be carried out for around two hours only since the time window available from the close of last and commencement of first passenger service is very limited. Other important operational preparedness and routine maintenance activities are also undertaken during this period only,” said the official. DMRC had to arrange for special scaffolding and cranes to cover the spaces at twice or thrice the normal height of a building, which is a time-consuming exercise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/led-there-be-light-metro-stations-to-get-brighter-feel-save-power-too/articleshow/85546820.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Confession in ganja case ends in businessman’s murder||HYDERABAD: A businessman from Karmaghat was murdered after an altercation over a confession in a ganja smuggling case, registered in Tenali in Andhra Pradesh. His body was exhumed from a farm in Zaheerabad in Sangareddy district on Saturday. Three persons have been taken into custody. Businessman Madhusudhan Reddy went missing on August 19. “On Friday (August 20), Madhusudhan’s wife got an SMS from an unknown number informing that her husband was kidnapped. She lodged a missing complaint with the Charminar police. On verifying CCTVs, we did not come across anyone kidnapping the victim,” police said. Subsequently, police began gathering details of the phone number from which the message was sent and took one Jagannath into custody. On interrogation, Jagannath disclosed that Madhusudhan was murdered and his body was buried in an agriculture field in Zaheerabad, police said. A team went to Zaheerabad and exhumed the body on Saturday. Police discovered that Madhusudhan, who was an accused in a murder case, became friends with one Sanju Kumar when they were in Chanchalguda jail a few years ago. After coming out on bail, they became close friends. Later, Madhusudhan facilitated Sanju Kumar to get a mortgage loan of Rs 40 lakh. A few days ago, Sanju Kumar’s brother and sister were caught by Tenali police of AP while they were allegedly transporting ganja in a lorry. When asked about the lorry, the siblings, in their confession to police, reportedly claimed that the vehicle was arranged by Madhusudhan. “On learning that he was framed by the two, Madhusudhan got annoyed and reprimanded Sanju as the latter’s siblings took the lorry to transport ganja. Later, a heated argument took place between Sanju and Madhusudhan. The victim asked Sanju to return Rs 40 lakh loan facilitated by him,” the investigators said. On August 19, Sanju asked the victim to meet him near Charminar to collect the money. After the victim came to the spot, Madhusudhan was forced into a car. He was repeatedly beaten, due to which Madhusudhan died, police said. Police took three people into custody, but were tight-lipped about the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/confession-in-ganja-case-ends-in-businessmans-murder/articleshow/85548898.cms||---

He said all such reports are baseless, and the list is still under the consideration of the party high command. The list submitted by the KPCC president had hit a controversy since the dominant groups in the party alleged that their nominees have been sidelined from the list. Prominent group leaders Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala had approached the party high command alleging that they had not been consulted while preparing the list of new presidents. These two group leaders and their group managers feared that Sudhakaran and opposition leader V D Satheesan are sidelining them when the new list was submitted to the party high command. However, Sudhakaran is firm on the list he has submitted and made it clear to the party high command that all these years the group leaders were finalizing the list without proper consultations in the party. But this time, it was made clear that no group affiliations would be considered while deciding the new presidents. However, Chandy and Chennithala are of the view that the new list features names of leaders who are the nominees of Sudhkaran, Satheesan and AICC general secretary K C Venugopal. These two leaders fear that they will lose their grip on the party if the party high command approves the list submitted by the KPCC president, which has the support of Satheesan and Venugopal. Sudhakaran has also urged the party high command that strict action should be taken against leaders who have worked against the official candidates of the party in the recent assembly election. Several party candidates and even constituent parties had alleged that certain Congress leaders in their constituencies had worked against them in the election to ensure their defeat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-leak-of-dcc-list-kpcc-prez/articleshow/85544556.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Tiles used by MC contractor are of inferior quality: Activist||Ludhiana: City-based RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal has raised the issue of sub standard tiles being laid in Model Gram Area, near Malwa Khalsa School. He wrote to vigilance department urging for an inquiry. The activist claimed that contractor who is installing tiles at this road did not use mechanical compactors, hand rollers to settle the material below the tiles. He said only hand rammer was used for a few times to compact the stand, stones and the mud being layered down before fixing the interlocking tiles, which is not appropriate due to which the undoubtedly the tiles fixed will sink with time. Apart from this, the quantity of the sand, stones and the mud being used is also inadequate. Instead of using a required quantity, less material is being used by the said contractor for fixing these interlocking tiles, he alleged. It has been witnessed that the optical moisture content (OMC) of the material being used below the tiles is not in proper quantity. Mostly, the dry material is being used before affixing the tiles due to which, after the monsoon season, these tiles will sink and crores of rupees spent in this project will be wasted. “Before affixing the tiles, it is necessary that the layers of the stones, sand and mud should be wet-mixed in a proper quantity, so that the moisture remains in the material and when the hand rammer is used to compact the material, it gets settled properly so that later when interlocking tiles are fixed they do not get sink. However, instead of following this procedure, mostly dry material is being used below the tiles, which will undoubtedly sink in coming future,” he added. Moreover, on the site, no board has been displayed showing the name and other particulars of the contractor who is carrying out the work, said Sabharwal, adding that no safety measures too are being taken by this contractor for executing his work. “It is quite astonishing to witness that the measurement books (MBs) on the spot are not being filled by the officers concerned of the B&R branch of the municipal corporation (MC), Ludhiana on daily basis. According to the norms, it is mandatory to fill the MBs daily along with the date of the execution of the work,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tiles-used-by-mc-contractor-are-of-inferior-quality-activist/articleshow/85548592.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Chawla had accused UAG members of attack.Meanwhile, Chawla has released a video on social media giving evidence in support of his allegations and urged the authorities to arrest those involved in the attack. In the video, he also said, “On the day of the attack, I tried to expose the wrongdoings taking place in the association from the past eight years, but I was not allowed to do so and attacked. It is sad that KK Seth is saying that no attack took place and I tripped over wires.”Chawla added, “The attackers who entered the UCPMA premises along with Gurmeet Kular and his brother Vicky Kular came with the clear intention of attacking me. All of them have been captured in the video, in which they can also be heard discussing the plan to attack me by dragging me down from the stage. This attack is not on me but on the entire association and on the democracy. Tomorrow it can happen with anyone else if authorities do not take strict action against the culprits. I also urge Akal Takht to take notice of the sacrilege which took place in full public view as the attackers tossed my turban.”An official privy to the investigation confirmed that inquiry has been marked.The UCPMA election process is on track and Monday is the last date for members to deposit the subscription dues. In case of failure in clearing the dues, the member concerned will not be able to vote in the association elections on September 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/police-mark-inquiry-into-claims-of-uag-members/articleshow/85544496.cms||Mohit Behl

Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India (HBI), Pune branch, said, “Small hospitals are registering a rise in footfalls for vaccination after using such communication tools. Some are also approaching housing societies to utilize the doses and push the numbers.” Hospitals and association members TOI spoke to underlined that a small healthcare unit was currently vaccinating 30 to 50 citizens every day as against the previous 10 to 15 per day. “Vaccination newly started at small private hospitals and nursing homes towards the end of July, has now started gathering pace. Besides, there were many technical issues initially which we have overcome now,” said Nivedita Oswal, director and paediatrician of Hadapsar-based Parasmani hospital, which received 1,000 doses of Covishield on July 28. Small hospitals/nursing homes had been struggling to procure doses for almost two months. They started getting the vaccine doses from the last week of July. Despite getting the permission to inoculate beneficiaries, these hospitals had remained out of the vaccination drive for various reasons since June 1. “The small setups are located in every corner of the PMR and their participation can not only speed up the vaccination numbers, but also make neighborhood vaccination a reality,” said physician Aniket Joshi, member of the Association of Physicians of India, Pune branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vax-footfall-in-small-pvt-hosps-increases/articleshow/85546840.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Mysuru||Almost zero convictions in child marriage cases in Mysuru||MYSURU: Though Mysuru has been witnessing cases of child marriages, the conviction rate for the crime is almost zero. Child welfare officers claim that minor girls are “influenced” by relatives during court trials, witnesses turn hostile, and cases are lost on technical grounds. In some cases, where there is photo and video evidence available, the cases are yet to come for trial.  The major challenge child welfare officers face in child marriage cases, is lack of seriousness in treating the cases, and delay in responding to complaints on the part of the authorities. According to child welfare officers, more than 250 child marriage cases were prevented and detected in Mysuru in the last one year. Officers in Periyapatna are active, and rapidly respond to any complaints, without waiting for help from the local police. Despite the fact that they have faced trouble, it has not deterred them from rescuing minor girls. Child welfare officers in Periyapatna, who have the distinction of preventing cases of child marriage, have effectively stopped 32 child marriages in 2020 and 22 of them till July this year. Last year six FIRs were registered, and this year in the first seven months, four FIRs were registered against relatives and parents for conducting child marriages. N Kumar, child development project officer (CDPO), Periyapatna, says that in a majority of child marriage cases, minor girls who do not have fathers are the victims. Their mothers want to do away with the responsibility of raising them, by marrying off their minor daughters. In some cases parents who are sick want to get their minor daughters married. Kumar says child marriages are high among a particular community in the region.  The CDPO of Periyapatna also blames the police for not responding to complaints regarding child marriage quickly, and accuses them of not treating the cases seriously. “I have brought this to the notice of higher-ups in the district in meetings,” he stated. “In most child marriages, the bridegroom is 10-15 years older than the minor bride. We receive alerts on child marriages from child helpline number 1098, or through teachers or anganwadi workers,” he said. “Our efforts in rescuing minor girls is going waste due to the non-cooperation of some officials,” Kumar added. District child protection officer S Diwakar admitted that convictions hae been almost zero in child marriage cases. Recently, we suffered a setback on technical grounds in a case, during cross-examination. We have discussed on how to overcome all these shortcomings. Still cooperation of the police is needed to punish the wrongdoers,” he felt. Cases of child marriage are more in Periyapatna, Hunsur and HD Kote in the district, and officials in Periyapatna are actively working on them, Diwakar said. Mysuru superintendent of police R Chethan said, “All our officers are instructed to be sensitive to cases related to children and women. The primary role of the police here is to first register an FIR and then investigate the case. So far, I have not come across any complaint of delay in responding to child marriage cases against police officers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/almost-zero-convictions-in-child-marriage-cases-in-mysuru/articleshow/85541862.cms||Lawrence Milton

These eggs had to be artificially incubated, as the nest was disturbed by locals,” said Gowri Shankar, the founder director of the centre. He thanked the Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru forest department officials for their support. Writer Shashi Sampalli said that 8 years back, near Heggodu village in Sagar Taluk, the nest of a king cobra was found at an unsecure place, and there were a few eggs in it. “A popular snake catcher brought the eggs home for incubation, and senior officers of the forest department booked him. How is it different now?” he wondered. “The Kalinga centre has experts, but what will be the fate of the hatchlings? If they hatch and grow naturally, they will survive in limited vegetation,” he added. Chief conservator of forest (Shivamogga circle) Ravi Shankar disapproved of the argument that artificial hatching leads to ecological imbalance. He told TOI that he personally monitored the whole process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/artificially-incubated-king-cobra-hatchlings-released-into-wild/articleshow/85542390.cms||---
---||Thane||Maharashtra: Commuters agitated over double-jab rule, say up to 50% essential workers partially vaxxed||MUMBAI: Ordinary local train commuters are miffed at the authorities for what they have termed as a “disparity” between them and essential category workers. While the average commuter must comply with double vaccination, passenger activists point to the fact that just about 50% of essential workers in Thane and 72% in Mumbai have been fully vaccinated. As a result, the activists have questioned a policy that allows large numbers of partially-vaccinated individuals to share congested suburban train compartments. Experts say that most essential workers, given the nature of their work, would have been exposed to the virus by now. As per BMC, 3.04 lakh healthcare and frontline workers in Mumbai have taken both doses of Covid vaccines, accounting for 72% of the category’s targeted population. But 1.21 lakh workers from this category, making just 29% of the target, have taken only the first dose. As for Thane city, only 15,707 healthcare workers, or 49% of the targeted 32,017, have taken both doses. The corresponding number of frontline workers is 13,378, or 55% of the targeted 24,135. Frontline workers include cops and municipal staff, among others. Activists have raised questions on the rationale behind this disparity. Some experts feel that even if a small section of these partially-vaccinated segments use trains, they could pose a risk for fellow commuters. “Having single dose-vaccinated healthcare travellers, who are in direct contact with Covid patients, could pose a risk to others considering the rush and close contact on trains. There are cases where some fully vaccinated people have been re-infected. So, caution has to be exercised,” said Dr Santosh Kadam, president, Thane chapter of the Indian Medical Association. Siddhesh Desai, a suburban railway activist from Kalwa, said the move to allow only fully-vaccinated individuals was “unjust”. “We plan to approach the authorities in this regard. It is unfair on those who have taken a single dose and still have to spend a fortune to travel to work,” he said. However, Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and head of the Covid death audit committee, said healthcare and frontline workers have been exposed to the virus to a greater degree and for a longer time. “Many of them have got the infection, in which case even a single dose will act as a booster,” he said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that if they are not allowed to travel, essential services would be hit. Civic officials also maintain that a higher number of healthcare and frontline workers have been fully vaccinated than shown in the records. “Many had taken second doses but since they registered with a different number, Co-Win didn’t record their full vaccination status,” the official said, adding they estimate 25%-30% duplication. A senior official from Central Railway said, “We are following the same process for issuing tickets or passes to healthcare and frontline workers as was mandated before August 15. There is no protocol set for allowing only fully vaccinated persons from this segment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-commuters-agitated-over-double-jab-rule-say-up-to-50-essential-workers-partially-vaxxed/articleshow/85550444.cms||Manoj Badgeri

On Sunday, 50 cusecs was released keeping in mind the weather predictions for the day. However, the residents claimed that without solving the problem of domestic untreated water and waste coming from dairy units, the authorities are only wasting fresh water. Activist Jaskirat Singh from Naroa Punjab Manch said Buddha Nullah rejuvenation project should be led by an eminent scientists, who understands those pros and cons, not politicians and bureaucrats. The fresh water was released in the nullah near Neelon. MLA Samrala Amrik Singh Dhillon, MLA Payal Lakhbir Singh Lakha and Ludhiana mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu on Sunday inaugurated Rs 9.80 crore project of releasing daily 200 cusecs fresh water. They said under the project, the executive agency water resources department, using sheet piling technology, has constructed an escape regulator to carry 200 cusecs water from Sirhind Canal, for cleaning Neelon river within eight months. Mayor Sandhu said work has already been commenced on two new sewage treatment plants (STPs) for treating domestic waters of total capacity 285 MLD (Jamalpur 225 MLD and Balloke 60 MLD), rehabilitation of existing STPs with a treatment capacity of 418 MLD, two effluent treatment plants (ETPs) for treatment of 6MLD wastewater from two dairy complex in Tajpur and Haibowal, six intermediate pumping stations, laying of 10km pipeline and 10 years of operation and maintenance of entire infrastructure under Rs 650-crore Buddha Nullah rejuvenation project, which would be over by December 2022. Meanwhile, the officials of PPCB said water will be released on regular basis according to the capacity in drain, especially in rainy season, as they cannot let water from drain flood adjoining residential areas. They claimed that regular sampling will be done from drain water to study the result of releasing of fresh water. Harjot singh executive engineer of drainage department Ludhiana, said, “On the first day, we released 50 cusecs water. Due to rainfall, we will release only limited water in the drain to avoid flooding.” According to him, when it stops raining, 200 cusecs will be released as drain has the capacity for 1,200 cusecs of water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/50-cusecs-fresh-water-released-into-nullah-to-dilute-pollutants/articleshow/85548604.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Climate change to bring down rice yield in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh||HYDERABAD: Agricultural scientists, including those from the city-based Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) have predicted a fall in potential rice yield from an average 3.62 tonnes per hectare to 3.11 tonnes per hectare by 2030 and to 3.02 tonnes per hectare by 2040s thanks to climate change and global warming. There will also be reduction in yields of rice cultivated under rainfed conditions from 2.13 tonnes per hectare to 1.67 tonnes per hectare by 2030 and to 1.62 tonnes per hectare by 2040s. The study spanned 17 states including Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Scientists arrived at the potential fall in rice yields based on 6.2 million simulations of climate change and global warming. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana will be hit hard as they are primarily rice producing states. Nizamabad district in Telangana, together with Krishna and Godavari deltas in AP, are considered the rice bowl of south India. The farm scientists have also projected a fall in rice yields based on the increase in temperature by varying degrees. They warned that the rice yield is expected to decrease in 30 to 60% of the states studied as part of the research. The result of the research was published in the recent issue of the science publication, Journal of Water and Climate Change. According to the projections, the average rainfed gap in yield of paddy will be 1.49 tonnes per hectare in the future. “The trend of seasonal climate variables shows an expected increase in maximum temperature, minimum temperature and rainfall, and a decreasing trend in solar radiation in the future i.e. 2030 and 2040s over the study area. Consequently, average spatial water-limited potential rice yield is expected to reduce from 3.62 tonnes per hectare in the historical period to 3.11 tonnes per hectare and 3.02 tonnes per hectare during the 2030 and 2040s, respectively,” the study predicted. The scientists further said there will also be an increase in the yield gap of 20.9% and 22.2% by 2030 and 2040s respectively. A stagnated yield gap in 29.7% and 26.5% and decreasing yield gap in 49.4% and 51.3% of the study area during 2030 and 2040s respectively. The researchers said their finding “contributes to understanding the consequences of climate change on rice yield gap and future food security concerns in India, which is essential for agricultural policy planning and the selection of mitigation strategies to reduce the rice yield gap”. They said their research study also has the potential to be translated for other parts of the world, and for other crops to develop adaptation strategies to reduce the crops yield gap for improving regional and global food security. Another research study by the National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) of which CRIDA is a participant research body, projects a potential reduction in yield of kharif rice in extreme climates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/climate-change-to-bring-down-rice-yield-in-t-ap/articleshow/85548903.cms||Syed Akbar

An FIR has been lodged. Sushil Kumar (34) was managing traffic near Chipiyana when three men travelling in a car reached the area around 8 pm. They allegedly stopped the vehicle in the middle of the road, which led to congestion. “Due to Rakshabandhan, several people were out on the streets. The car suddenly stopped in the middle of the road and it led to a jam, which lasted 30-45 minutes,” Kumar said. He added that when he reached the area, he saw the person driving the car was on a call. “Two others were consuming liquor inside the vehicle. When I asked them to stop, one man got off and started arguing with me. Soon, the other two joined him and they started hitting me. They tore my uniform and then fled in the car,” Kumar said. He contacted Bisrakh police and later, filed a complaint. He said he took a picture of the car as well. Anita Chauhan, SHO, Bisrakh, said an FIR has been lodged against three unidentified men under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. “We are trying to trace the vehicle,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/traffic-cop-thrashed-in-gr-noida-3-booked/articleshow/85546927.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Multiple protest groups may be in fray for Huzurabad bypoll||HYDERABAD: Protest groups of private teachers, unemployed youth and field assistants in Huzurabad are claiming they would file multiple nominations to recreate the Nizamabad 2019 Lok Sabha polls, when 175 turmeric farmers filed over 170 nominations for the MP election to highlight their demands. In 2019, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s daughter and then sitting MP K Kavitha, lost the election to BJP’s Dharmapuri Arvind. Two years later for the Huzurabad bypolls, there could be multiple nominations filed to confront the TRS government, sources said. The field assistants’ joint action committee has stated that 1,000 members will file nominations while the unemployed youth JAC announced t 30 members a are ready to file nominations. Even YSRTP chief YS Sharmila has openly supported the unemployed youth joint action committee’s efforts to file nominations in large numbers. While her newly-floated party itself is unlikely to be in the running for Huzurabad bypolls, sources have indicated Sharmila is keen on being a major player in it through her support for protest groups. She has also expressed support for the cause of field assistants who had lost their jobs with the revenue department. Telangana Martyrs JAC, on the other hand, did not run in the Nagarjuna Sagar by-election despite proclaiming its intention to do so. The JAC alleged they were threatened with not filing the nomination. Elsewhere, the Huzurabad doctors’ organisation has slammed the TRS government for its alleged disregard for the health sector. National executive member of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Dr Vijay Chandar Reddy has backed former health minister and now-BJP functionary Eatala Rajender stating that Eatala had coordinated the health department well during the pandemic. “All around the state, seasonal fevers are being recorded but nothing is being done about it,” Dr Chandar Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/multiple-protest-groups-may-be-in-fray-for-huzurabad-bypoll/articleshow/85546936.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Kolkata||More cops, penalties to control traffic violations on Bailey bridge||KOLKATA: From deployment of additional cops to penalising offenders on the spot, Bidhannagar police swung into action prohibiting motorists violating one-way norm at the Bailey Bridge connecting Lake Town and Salt Lake, a day after TOI wrote about rampant violations of traffic norms. On Friday, TOI had written how vehicles belonging to cops, VIPs, advocates and politicians as well as a section of random bikers, speed dangerously violating one-way traffic norm on the Bailey bridge over Kestopur canal that connects Salt Lake AE Block with VIP Road with cops looking the other way. Following the article, a large team of policemen have been posted on both sides of the bridge, who were found stopping motorists from climbing the bridge from the Salt Lake end and even penalising them for the offence. “We are taking adequate action against those found violating the traffic norms,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. Since it was opened to traffic on October 1, 2019, the bridge is meant to cater one-way traffic from VIP Road to Salt Lake and has become a boon for motorists who can get to Salt Lake from Lake Town without the Ultadanga detour and save several kilometres of deviation. However, over the months, in spite of multiple signage on the Salt Lake end of the bridge, a number of motorists regularly use the bridge to quickly hit VIP Road through Salt Lake AE Block without taking a deviation via Hudco crossing. Last week, TOI had found gross violations through the day a several cars with “on government duty” and “advocate” and “police” stickers violating the one-way norm at will. From Saturday, the scene changed with senior officers of traffic department personally visiting the spot. “The one-way traffic violation had become a regular habit along this bridge, which made driving from Lake Town end difficult especially during the night,” said a senior citizen who lives in AE Block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-cops-penalties-to-control-traffic-violations-on-bailey-bridge/articleshow/85544587.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Mumbai||Masks may be needed till December 2022: Maharashtra task force||Seventeen months into the pandemic and two Covid waves later, experts say we are better placed to handle the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If the first wave showed the importance of ‘testing, tracing & treating’, the second wave underlined the importance of support therapy the need for ensuring oxygen supply and keeping severely ill patients in a prone position and rational use of medicines such as antiviral remdesivir and steroids. Malathy Iyer spoke to state Covid-19 task force members Dr Rahul Pandit and Dr Shashank Joshi on how lessons learnt from the two waves would help better management of the third wave. “The focus should be on working towards zero deaths in the third wave,’’ said Dr Joshi. Increase the gapThe space between the two Covid waves has been 100-120 days. “This is what we have observed over the last 17 months. Right now, we aim to stretch this gap to 200 days so that we can vaccinate as many people as possible and reduce the impact of the third wave when it happens,’’ said Dr Pandit. This can be done by observing Covid-appropriate behaviour and preventing crowding. “It will be in our best interest to use masks till December 31, 2022. It will be the best way to guarantee there is no disruption in our lives,’’ added Dr Pandit, who heads the intensive care in Fortis Hospital, Mulund. The Delta variant, which caused the second wave, has proved to be able to “escape’’ the vaccine antibodies, infecting some who have taken both vaccines. The immediate step should be to unlock “painfully slowly’’ and “in a calibrated way’’ so that we can save lives. Better prepared When the first wave ended in October 2020, the public health system failed to use the time till the second wave began in February-March to upgrade health systems, like it was done during the second wave. “During the second wave, it was only during the stretch point (peak) that we realised the need for more oxygen and gene sequencing to spot variants at the earliest,’’ said Dr Pandit. Mumbai was a haven during the second wave, compared to many other cities in India. “Even though the healthcare system in Mumbai was stretched, we managed,’’ he said. Dr Joshi said doctors were a bit uncertain during the first wave on how to treat patients as little was known about the virus. “But within eight to 12 weeks, we understood the patterns about who would get serious and who needs to be hospitalised,’’ he said. Mumbai focused on setting up jumbo hospitals and getting oxygen-support beds which helped tide over the second wave too. Ready checklist Doctors in the past 17 months know the virus better. A detailed treatment protocol is in place. “We now have an antibody cocktail for patients with comorbidities. We know moderate to severe patients will need steroids and that antiviral remdesivir cannot be given too early or too late,’’ said Dr Pandit. It has to be given to patients between the second and ninth day of infection. Dr Joshi said the turnaround time for RT-PCR test these days was lower now and there was quick access to rapid tests. “We know the red flags and have a checklist the need to monitor temperature, oxygen saturation, sugar levels, among other parameters,’’ he added. Not only individual care, but public care too has been geared up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/masks-may-be-needed-till-december-2022-state-task-force/articleshow/85546947.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Pune||Firms with job offers put emphasis on coding skills||Pune: The emphasis is solely on coding skills as engineering colleges start their placement season for 2021-22. Colleges say that, unlike previous years when companies would have strict criteria to recruit from only certain branches of engineering, many have relaxed the rules and are only looking for coding skills. Colleges said they have had students from mechanical and civil engineering branches appearing for core IT-related placement interviews as they have acquired the coding skills from online platforms. Training and placement officers said some companies offer multi-level packages depending on the level of coding problem the student cracks. Meera Murali, training and placement officer at College of Engineering, Pune, said many companies are shortlisting students based on the resume and hence students need to know how to write a concise resume with good presentation skills. “Presentation matters apart from a thorough knowledge of subjects in any placement interviews,” she added. Amit Rajurkar, training and placement officer, Cummins College of Engineering for Women, said their placement season starts in September, but interest among IT, ITES, IT products, finance, banking sectors has been high. “The number of interested companies, as well as salaries on offer, have increased this year. Nowadays, it doesn’t matter what course you have done. A student could have taken up civil engineering but can apply for a job in core IT, if she has the required programming skills. Everything is now available online and students must make the most of it by enrolling for courses that will help them get placed easily. Many companies have relaxed their recruitment criteria to allow anyone to apply,” he added. Karthick Subramanian, training and placement officer at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, said that it is imperative for mechanical and other branches to learn to code. “Nowadays, even automobiles are going electric, automated and driverless. In this scenario, companies need mechanical or automobile engineers who can program and work these machines. it. Many companies are looking for students with a good grasp of cybersecurity and hence computer/IT students can do a course in this apart from many others available to them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/firms-with-job-offers-put-emphasis-on-coding-skills/articleshow/85544572.cms||Ardhra Nair

Rights, an NGO, facilitates the women from marginalized groups to create their units that produce bamboo crafts and helps them find a market using the online medium.  The women’s units from three districts producing environment-friendly bamboo products now sell through the online platform with the assistance of the NGO. Ajay Kumar, founder of Rights, told TOI that a company “Fibrent” has been set up to sell bamboo crafts through an online platform fibrent.in. “The products are made with natural products, especially natural fibres including bamboo. The aim of the online platform is easy doorstep availability during the pandemic period,” said Kumar. According to officials, the initiative had started to provide an income to tribal and dalit women after the 2018 floods severly affected them. The bamboo craft training started in 2019 and the production started in 2020. “When the bamboo produce entered the market, Covid-19 pandemic affected its sale. Even during the pandemic, the units had not stopped production and huge amounts of bamboo products piled up in the units. The new platform now helps them sell the products online,” said Kumar. “Presently, 58 women are working in three units and they manage the online platform too. The women workers get over 80% of the total selling price,” he added. Rights is facilitating the units to earn break-even profits, said Kumar. “Without proper guidance these units can’t spread their wings. We hope the online platform will provide a good market for bamboo crafts. So far, the online platform has evoked a good response,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/online-route-crafts-a-living-for-women/articleshow/85544766.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Nagpur||Climate change in our backyards, time to act is now: Aaditya Thackeray||NAGPUR: No other government recognizes the need to act on climate change like Maharashtra in the same measure, said state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray in an exclusive interaction with TOI. The minister's statement is indicative that the state has taken the destruction caused by recent climate catastrophe seriously. The deadly floods and landslides triggered by unprecedented rain reportedly took away over 200 lives. Many people remain missing in the flood-ravaged districts of western Maharashtra and Konkan. As the state is limping back from the disaster, the government is gearing up for confronting the climate calamities. “We realized that climate change is here and in our backyards, our lanes and farm fields and the time for messaging is long gone. The time to act is now,” the minister said. Further pointing out that for a state that has faced severe drought, floods, hailstorms in five years and two major cyclones in 11 months, Thackeray said that the compensation spent has been to the tune of Rs 13,000 crore. “Most acts that are in place and environmental norms ensure that climate change action is the norm. However it wasn’t given its due importance previously. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government realises the depth of the issue and we are keen to ensure no rules are flouted and they are the same for all,” he added. The minister stressed that the state’s record in the past one-and-a-half year, even while tackling Covid pandemic, has been of some “stellar work” on climate change action. “Right from protecting 9,800 hectare of mangroves to urban forests and Aarey’s 808 acres in Mumbai, from 10 conservation reserves and two sanctuaries to changing alignments of roads and metros to saving a single heritage tree -- no other government recognises the need to act on climate change than Maharashtra in the same measure. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has spelt out clear that every bit of development must and will be sustainable,” Thackeray added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/climate-change-in-our-backyards-time-to-act-is-now-aaditya/articleshow/85546941.cms||Manka Behl
---||Pune||Mortality rate in breakthrough Covid infections just 0.5% in Pune district||PUNE: The mortality rate in Covid-19 breakthrough infection cases in Pune was just 0.5% so far, the district health department’s data till August 18 revealed, and top health officials claimed that majority of the victims had comorbidities. According to the district health department’s data, a total of 54 people among 10,206 who contracted the virus after one or both vaccine doses (Covishield or Covaxin) had so far died. The breakthrough infections’ mortality rate (0.5%) was barely a third of the progressive Covid death rate of 1.6% in the district in the past couple of months. Covid-19 infection in someone who has been fully vaccinated — two weeks after their second dose of the vaccine — is known as a breakthrough infection. The latest data from the district showed that from a total of 70.06 lakh people vaccinated (one or both doses) in the region till August 18, only 10,206 people went on to contract the infection — a mere 0.15%. The data showed that of the 51.41 lakh people given one dose, a total of 7,124 tested positive for Covid later. Out of 18.65 lakh given both the doses, only 3,082 people went on to contract the virus. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “Mortality in Pune’s breakthrough infections has been found to be just 0.5%. This is a good sign as the death rate in Covid breakthrough infection cases seems to have been significantly lower than that seen in unvaccinated Covid patients. The positivity rate in breakthrough infections is also significantly lower. It means that majority of new Covid cases and hospitalisations are primarily limited to the unvaccinated, and only a small portion of fully vaccinated individuals get breakthrough infections.” He said almost 90% people in the district who succumbed to the breakthrough infections were high-risk patients, with comorbidities and allied infections. A senior Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said, “Of those who died after the Covid breakthrough infections, nearly 95% had taken only the first dose. They were also aged over 65 years and fighting serious underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. The PMC limits’ contribution to this number (54 deaths) was nearly 14. In comparison to the average Covid death rate in the PMC limits, it is much lower. “ Trends in the city hospitals are similar. Dr Sanjay Lalwani, the medical director of Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical Hospital and Research Centre, told TOI, “There is always a possibility that 30% of those who are fully vaccinated may contract Covid-19, but the infection may only be mild in such cases, like mucosal disease. Around 99.5% of those who have taken two doses of the vaccines — with 14 days after the second dose having elapsed — will not need admission in ICUs or require oxygen support. This number is humongous, which is a positive sign. Very few of those fully vaccinated and having diseases like severe diabetes or kidney disease may succumb to a breakthrough Covid infection. But that number is very miniscule.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mortality-rate-in-breakthrough-covid-infections-just-0-5-in-pune-dist/articleshow/85546931.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Pune||Pune: Education office orders probe into charging of fees by Yerawada school||PUNE: The deputy director of education in Pune has ordered an enquiry into the Agrasen High School in Yerawada following complaints from parents regarding exorbitant fees charged by school for issuing leaving certificates, application fees for admissions and also admission forms after confirmation of seats. Parents said schools were built on government-land yet the authorities were earning from parents, a majority of whom are poor. The parents said the school did not conduct the admissions in a transparent manner. The education officer at the deputy director’s office, Audumber Ukirde, issued an enquiry order on August 17 which stated that the complaints raised by the parents of children studying in the schools and those who have passed out need to be looked into at the earliest. Ukirde said, “A detailed enquiry needs to be conducted against the complaints and a report along with remarks on the investigation carried out against the complaints needs to be submitted to the deputy director within eight days.” A parent whose daughter passed out from the school after Std X said, “The school is completely mismanaged and there is corruption within the administration. The authorities are causing unnecessary harassment to the parents by charging very high fees for issuing the school leaving certificates. The management is misusing its powers and authority arbitrarily.” Another parent seeking admission for his son at the school said, “I have found serious laxity in the online admission process of Std I to VII. There were almost 500 applicants who filled the form by depositing Rs 200 and the management compelled parents to pay additional Rs 100 as form fees and over and above they did not display on the notice board the entire list of the applicants who were willing to seek admission in the school.” The school management selected about 150 students via a Zoom meeting by a lucky draw method from the 500 applications. Parents alleged that in total the school management gave 300 admissions and after the lucky draw for 150 students the remaining admissions were given to those who had directly approached the management. Shiv Sena Pune city deputy president, Anand Goyal, who had filed a written complaint with the education office regarding the school said the school started with the sole intention to give standard education to the deserving students who are residing in slum areas. “Due to the pandemic, it was difficult for the parents to pay even Rs 200 for the applications. The school was started with a purely charitable purpose to give education to the needy in English language and hence the state government had allotted the plot in favour of the management but they have been violating government rules and regulations blatantly in all aspects,” Goyal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/education-office-orders-probe-into-charging-of-fees-by-yerawada-school/articleshow/85544617.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Different vaccines may have different schedules. It is being closely watched and studied,” Dr Paul told TOI The Niti Aayog member said the focus now was on covering the country’s adult population with the two doses of Covid vaccine. Against the backdrop of Serum Institute of India (SII) chairman Cyrus Poonawalla emphasising on the need of third or booster dose of Covishield vaccine six months after the second dose, Dr Paul said very few countries in the world, including the US and Israel, had started with booster doses. He also said there was no recommendation from the World Health Organisation (WHO) about it yet. “We are watching the emerging data in this regard continuously and would be guided by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) in this regard,” he said. About reducing the gap between two doses of Covishield, Dr Paul said there was no recommendation from NTAGI on it either. “The present gap between the two doses of Covishield is based on science and there is currently no issue about it. So, the government is not currently thinking about reducing the gap between its two doses,” he said. At present, the gap between two doses of Covishield is 84 days or 12-16 weeks. The SII chairman had recently said in an interaction that the ideal gap between two doses of Covishield was two months as against the 12-16 weeks gap mandated by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-not-considering-covid-vaccine-booster-shots-as-of-now-niti-aayog-member/articleshow/85547012.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Rs 4 lakh in fake currency notes seized as Dubai-based syndicate busted||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Special Cell has busted a Dubai-based syndicate pumping fake Indian currency notes (FICN) into the country and arrested two traffickers with currency having a face value of Rs 4 lakh. The arrested men have been identified as Mohammad Jakir from Kardampuri in Delhi and Kamre Alam from Sambhal, UP. According to DCP Sanjeev Yadav, the seized notes are in the denomination of Rs 100 and 200. The syndicate exchanged the notes at the rate of Rs 60 in real notes for every Rs 100. The Special Cell, mandated to keep an eye on terror and its entire support infrastructure that includes gun-running, fake currency and narcotics, had been tracking multiple international syndicates with links to national capital when it received a tip-off about this module. The information was developed and it cane to fore that a Dubai-based entity by the name of Shariq alias Satta had been smuggling large quantity of fake notes into Delhi-NCR. “A deep deployment operation was launched, which involved careful surveillance and tracking apparatus. To develop the emerging contours of this racket, seasoned sources were carefully selected and deployed and extensive surveillance was also mounted. Soon, it emerged that this racket was being operated on the ground by two men who worked on Shariq’s instructions,” DCP Yadav said. The efforts yielded result when cops received a specific intelligence that a delivery of FICN would take place near Sarai Kale Khan on August 20. A trap was laid and suspect Jakir was arrested with fake currency during the late evening hours. Simultaneously, Alam was also nabbed from Uttar Pradesh on his disclosure. During interrogation, the two men revealed crucial information about Shariq’s network based on which raids are being conducted to nab others. According to special cell, Shariq operates in cahoots with ISI handlers and has been found in constant communication with Pak-based entities. Shariq, DCP Yadav said, was the kingpin of a notorious gang of vehicle thieves, which targeted high-end cars in Delhi-NCR and other states. With building police pressure, he fled to Dubai while leaving his deputies to handle the car theft business back here. "”He is involved in more than 50 cases of auto theft, robbery, dacoity, Gunda Act, NSA etc., After shifting to Dubai, besides operating the motor vehicle theft gang, he also started dealing in FICN. On the direction of Sariq Sata, the peddlers started distributing fake notes in weekly markets and other small businesses to destabilise the Indian economy,” DCP Yadav added. Zakir works as a property dealer for cover and had become a major supplier in a short span of time. He is involved in over nine cases of arms Act, robbery, dacoity and theft in Delhi. Alam has eight cases of murder, NDPS, Gunda Act and criminal assault. He came in contact of Shariq in Moradabad jail while he was undergoing his sentence and joined his syndicate, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-4l-in-fake-currency-notes-seized-as-dubai-based-syndicate-busted/articleshow/85547019.cms||---

It all began when SAD district president Ranjit Dhillon issued a press release and stated that leaders who are for the welfare of farmers and people of Punjab have left BJP and joined SAD. It was also mentioned that BJP had failed all sectors. He had claimed that SAD and BSP will form a government in Punjab in 2022 and work for the welfare of the state. Dhillon also said after BJP leaders have started joining SAD, the BJP workers have started loosing faith in their leaders and they are now under pressure. However, reacting to the statement, BJP district president Pushpendra Singhal also issued a press note on Sunday where he challenged SAD president Sukhbir Badal to tell the people of Punjab why he was silent for six years and when these laws were in the making he did not take any action rather he was also praising these laws. Singhal also alleged that the leaders who left BJP and joined SAD are the ones who used to condemn SAD when they were in BJP so it is to be seen for how long they will remain in SAD. He said his party workers will under no circumstances will buckle to such divisive tactics played by SAD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-leaders-who-joined-sad-criticised-them-the-most/articleshow/85548617.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This is a welcome development considering that the third Covid surge was predicted in the middle of August but cases are decreasing instead. “We are seeing reduction in Covid admissions now, after they increased last week. Vaccination coverage has been wide in the city and most people have developed antibodies against the virus,” said Prof Jagat Ram, director PGI. However, caution has to be maintained as cases have been reported from more than one household in the city. “Initially, there were a few cases from one house or so but now we have been seeing cases from different families. We are keeping a track,” said a PGI faculty. Since the last week, positivity rate in the city has been recorded at around 0.22%. “We see patients from surrounding states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Initially, there were more cases in Punjab, but now the patients have been discharged and not many new admissions have come,” said a faculty in PGI. Despite the fall in daily cases, doctors advise caution as variants of the virus have been reported in states. “Covid appropriate behaviour has to be adhered to. Even a single mask worn properly is sufficient,” said a doctor in PGI. To understand variants and their transmission, the virology department has started genome sequencing at the paediatric department. “This will help in surveillance and proper management,” said a public health expert.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SRA builders beat pandemic blues with record project nods in 2 years||MUMBAI: Builders executing redevelopment projects under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) have beaten the pandemic blues. While a record number of approvals for SRA projects were given between March 2019 and April 2021, the highest number of projects were completed too during this period. According to data from the SRA, 516 Letters of Intent (LoIs) were issued between March 2019 and April 2021, including those that were re-issued as they were stuck for a long time and 82 new ones. In the period from April 2017 to March 2019, 184 LoIs were issued. A builder can begin redevelopment of a slum plot only after an LoI is issued by the agency. “We have not just issued fresh LoIs, but also issued revised LoIs in several cases where projects were stuck and have fast-tracked procedures in the SRA,” Satish Lokhande, SRA CEO, said. “The aim is to ensure that the maximum number of slumdwellers are rehabilitated as soon as possible. We are bringing in several changes to facilitate this,” he added. In December 2020, the agency began sending notices to developers who have failed to start their projects even after getting requisite clearances. Between March 2019 and April 2021, the SRA issued occupation certificates to 28,162 slum rehabilitation units—8,602 in 2019-20, 13,875 in 2020-21 and 5,685 in April 2021. In the period from April 2017 to March 2019, 26,422 OCs were granted. Once an OC is given, the project is deemed to be completed and original tenants can move into the new units. Housing minister Jitendra Awhad had recently said that he was pushing to fast-track SRA projects and that the agency would take over projects where the developer has failed to rehabilitate the slumdwellers. “The SRA plans to take over all projects which are at standstill and have taken big fat loans from financial institutions and left the poor on the streets. The very aim is to give homes to the poor and pump in money for SRA. Just having LoI does not make u the owner of the property,” he had tweeted. According to the data, between March 2019 and April 2021, nearly 2 lakh slum tenements were sanctioned of which 48,104 were okayed in 2021 alone. Between April 2017 and March 2019, only 53,409 slum tenements were sanctioned. Around 2.1 lakh families have got new apartments in the 23 years since the SRA was set up. According to SRA estimates, there are 12.5 lakh slums in Mumbai housing 62 lakh people. In December 2020, the state government had set up a 10-member committee to ensure speedy disposal of complaints pending with the SRA, including cases of corruption and red-tapism. According to officials, projects are stuck for various reasons, including lack of funds or complaints by tenants against the builder. According to estimates, one lakh slumdwellers are affected by the “dead” SRA projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sra-bldrs-beat-pandemic-blues-with-record-project-nods-in-2-yrs/articleshow/85547084.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

A senior government official said that six companies have participated in the pre-bid meeting, and even more are likely to show interest. He said that a lot of queries have been raised at the pre-bid meeting, and that the Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC) will clarify all these. Companies have to submit the request for proposal (RFP) documents on September 14, and bids will be opened the next day. GWMC has floated the tender for the second time. In the first instance, in July, not a single company qualified. Then, a fresh tender was floated with modified criteria. The plant, estimated to cost Rs 200 crore, is expected to cater to Tiswadi taluka, and will have facilities for recycling and sorting lines, segregation, bio-methanation and composting systems. In 2008, the Corporation of the City of Panaji acquired land at Bainguinim to set up the waste management plant, and in 2017, the land was handed over to the GWMC. A public hearing was held by the GWMC and the environmental clearance obtained. The corporation had also invited a request for qualification (RFQ) for the proposed plant. The GWMC decided to undertake the project through the public-private partnership (PPP) model on a design-build-finance-operate-transfer (DBFOT) basis, wherein the plant infrastructure would be erected by the concessionaire along with operations and maintenance for ten years. Union Ayush minister Shripad Naik had said that the location identified for the solid waste management facility at Bainguinim is “wrong and the government should rethink it”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/six-companies-interested-in-setting-up-bainguinim-solid-waste-plant/articleshow/85547139.cms||---

Subhash Jadhav, who had tried to enter Mantralaya, consumed poison but was rushed to hospital. His son Ganesh, who claimed his body on Sunday evening, alleged that his father had gone to meet the home minister and complain regarding land-grabbing in Ambewadi. “Some influential people had grabbed our land and despite complaints to local police, nothing happened, so my father went to meet a minister for justice. When denied entry he attempted suicide. I am holding all accused and government officials responsible for his death,’’ said Ganesh. In 2018, Dhule farmer Dharma Patil (84) died at JJ hospital a week after he consumed poison outside Mantralaya.

---||Mysuru||Mandya: KR Pete vendors suffer loss of materials worth Rs 1 crore||MANDYA: Vendors in KR Pete in Mandya district are in a state of extreme worry after they lost goods and materials cumulatively worth Rs 1 crore following inundation of low-lying market areas in the night on Saturday. KR Pete recorded incessant rain on Saturday, exposing the poor infrastructure in the low-lying areas, where water gushed into homes and shops. Clothes, mobile phones and provisions at groceries were among the casualties of the gushing waters. Vendors of garment stores had to hang all the wet clothes to dry at convention centres. Many of them pointed to the stains on the clothes, left behind by the sewage that rushed inside the stores along with the rainwater, and said that they could no longer be sold. Mahendra Patel, a vendor of a garment store in KR Pete, said, “New clothes at various stores worth nearly Rs 80 lakh have either been completely destroyed or stained by sewage. Had the drains not been clogged, rainwater would not have gushed into our stores and destroyed our stock. The government departments concerned for the upkeep of the drains must take cognisance of this and compensate us.” The vendors alleged that the drains in KR Pete town had been constructed in an unscientific manner, not to mention the slow pace at which work on the project had been going on for the past 10 years. They also lashed out at the civic authorities for neglecting to clear the clogged drains. Officials in the KR Pete town municipality, however, blamed the vendors and residents for connecting the drainage pipes to their homes. “Vendors must not install pipes between drains and shops or houses. When there is heavy rain, these pipes turn into obstacles for flow of sewage, and the drains get clogged,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/kr-pete-vendors-suffer-loss-of-materials-worth-rs-1-crore/articleshow/85542222.cms||---

Nearly 3,000 residents of Kurdi village in UP’s Saharanpur had assembled on Saturday to attend Babuji’s terahvi. Unlike what the name suggests, Babuji wasn’t a village senior — though he was accorded the same respect that is reserved for the elderly. The term of endearment was used by Kurdi residents for a 20-year-old bull that spent his life among them before passing away on August 15, sending the entire hamlet into mourning. In the days that followed, several solemn religious ceremonies were conducted by priests and participated by villagers, including cremation, rasam pagdi and terahvi (death feast), for the animal. “Babuji died of natural causes. He was like a family member to us. So it was important to adhere to all the rituals that are followed in case of the death of a loved one,” said resident Manish Tyagi. The village had pooled in money to cover costs of the rituals, including the grand feast for 3,000 attendees on Saturday. Earlier in the day, some enterprising youngsters had photoshopped a picture of Babuji to crop out the residents standing alongside. The photo, bedecked with flowers and crisp currency notes, took centre stage at the havan. Naresh Pandit, a priest who performed the puja, said it was meant to bring peace and a sense of closure for the residents who missed greeting Babuji on the streets. “He was a gentle giant who never hurt anybody. The children loved to play with him,” said Bhola Tyagi, another resident. Residents said the bull was considered a “gift from the divine”. “Some people found him roaming in Bhumia Kheda, a holy site in the village, when he was very young. Many called him Nandi (sacred bull of God Shiva). He was a gift from God and his presence brought much cheer to our lives. We hope he is at peace now,” said a resident. Just last week, a condolence meet was held for a crocodile in Gujarat’s Vadodara. It was organised by wildlife activists on the ghats of Vishwamitri river in the city and attended by dozens of residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/babuji-is-dead-long-live-our-beloved-bull/articleshow/85542468.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) is planning to open the subway by the next weekend towards the end of this month. Officials said that a team of artists are drawing mural art work on the interior wall on one side of the subway which is expected to be completed by this Friday. “We are expecting to open the subway by next weekend. The interior wall of one side of the subway will be having beautiful mural art works based on old and New Kolkata to give the commuters walking along the subway corridor a wonderful feeling,” said a Hidco official. On the other side inside the subway opposite the wall where the mural art work is being done, the authorities are planning to have small book, newspaper and dry food stalls. “This will not only give a sense of security among those who will be walking along the subway corridor, specially during the night, but will also help commuters to stop aside for a while and buy a book, a magazine or some dry food on the way,” said an official. Hidco is also planning to engage agencies for painting of mural art works on the walls of other pedestrian subways in New Town. The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA), on their end is setting up vending kiosks inside three pedestrian subways in the township. Hidco officials said that work to set up subways on the other three corners of the Biswa Bangla gate crossing is going on and Hidco have also initiated the process to engage an agency to construct a pedestrian subway at City Centre II mall crossing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-rabindra-tirtha-subway-22-08-21/articleshow/85544842.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Lockdown and the closure of schools forced many students including girls in rural areas to work in fields and do other work. The education department launched several awareness programmes on Kasturba Gandhi Balika Scheme to bring dropped out girl students back to schools. Officials found such students and told them about the facilities provided by the union and state governments. According to sources from Dharwad District Education department, KGBVS has received good response as nearly 300 girl students have enrolled for it in the district. Deputy director of public instruction, Dharwad, Mohan Hanchate told TOI that around 295 girls took admission in two residential schools at Ganjigatti in Kalghatagi taluk and in Alnavar taluk. A special residential school is being run in Gantikeri, Hubballi taluk, where 95 students including boys and girls are studying. “The government introduced KGBV programme for the benefit of schoolgirls who are deprived of education and those who are in financial distress in rural areas. We conducted meetings and awareness programmes in villages. As a result, 295 girl students got admission under this scheme,” he added. Kalghatagi block resource coordinator Kumar KF said, “We have taken all steps to ensure the comfort and safety of girl students to protect them from Covid-19.” Deepa Lad, the headmistress of the Alnavar residential school said, “The government is providing residential education for girl students from class six to 8. From class nine to 12, students need to go to another school but, hostel facilities are given here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/kasturba-scheme-helps-girls-get-back-to-school/articleshow/85542467.cms||---

The two projects are construction of a road overbridge to connect Bailey Road with AIIMS-Digha elevated road with an expenditure of around Rs 94.52 crore and construction of foot overbridges to connect Western Canal Road in Rupaspur with the junction with an estimated expenditure of Rs 10.86 crore. The state road construction department also submitted a supplementary counter affidavit in the court on Saturday which it had failed to do on two earlier occasions. The Patna high court division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing a PIL filed by one Bharat Prasad Singh, directed the state government to file a counter affidavit within four weeks detailing the two proposed projects. The court also directed Indian Railways to reply within four weeks on its decision to share 50% cost with the state government for construction of road overbridge. In the affidavit, the court was apprised about RCD additional chief secretary Amrit Lal Meena’s suggestion that 50% cost should be borne by railways as per existing MoU with it. On behalf of railways, the court was also apprised about Danapur DRM Prabhat Kumar’s view that cost sharing could be decided by higher authorities as ROB construction was not taking place on a level crossing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-to-hc-will-improve-patliputra-jn-connectivity/articleshow/85522405.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The victim, Mahendra Kumar Sharma, in his FIR at Sindhi Camp police station alleged that he had come to Jaipur from Manoharpur in a private bus on Saturday. He arrived at the bus stand around 5 am and went to a nearby public urinal when an unidentified suspect armed with an iron road hit him. Even before Sharma could react, two other suspects barged in. One man jabbed him with a firearm, while a third robber threatened him with a knife and asked him to give them money. They took out his wallet which had about Rs 1,800 and fled from the spot. Sharma claimed that he was bleeding profusely after the attack. A cab driver spotted Sharma and took him to a hospital in Bani Park. After initial treatment, Sharma went to the police station and sought help. Police filed an FIR under Section 384 (extortion), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 323 (causing hurt) of the IPC. Investigation officer Rajendra Singh told TOI that police were making efforts to track down the accused involved in the crime. An official claimed that they were examining the CCTV cameras of nearby areas to find the movements of suspects. “The area around Sindhi Camp is usually buzzing with activities round-the-clock, but the public washroom may have been deserted at the time when the crime took place. We are speaking to shopkeepers and hawkers who regularly visit the area to get some leads on suspects,” an official said, adding that Sharma’s condition is stable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/teacher-beaten-robbed-in-public-toilet-at-gunpoint-near-sindhi-camp/articleshow/85547166.cms||---
---||Goa||Cortalim, Vasco together have most dengue cases in Goa||PANAJI: The most number of dengue cases in the state have been reported from the urban health centre at Vasco and the primary health centre at Cortalim combined. Where, in July, 102 dengue cases were reported from across Goa, these two centres accounted for 65 cases. Health sources attributed this to unsafe water storage practices by slum dwellers in these areas. The Vasco centre reported 41 cases and Cortalim 24 cases. “The problem is that in the slums of Baina and New Vaddem in Vasco, people follow unhealthy water storage practices. During our recent visit to New Vaddem, we found that every household had two barrels to store water. One was covered with a lid or cloth, but the second, meant for regular use, was uncovered,” medical officer-in-charge of the national vector-borne disease control programme (NVBDCP), Dr Kalpana Mahatme, said. Due to such unhealthy water storage practices, mosquito breeding flourishes, Mahatme said. The Dengue mosquito breeds in clean water and even a small discarded cup will suffice as it will collect water when it rains. She said that even in places where the water supply has been regular people haven’t given up the practice of storing water despite health staff carrying out awareness drives about the vector borne disease. Besides, the port town and Cortalim see labour inflow from other states, which also adds to the caseload, sources said. In Goa, the total dengue cases reported last month were much more than for the corresponding period last year. In July 2020, as many as 102 suspected cases were recorded, but only 26 were confirmed. Whereas, last month, over 400 suspected cases were reported and 102 were confirmed. Mahatme said that more cases have been recorded this time as, unlike last year, people’s activities were not constrained. Last year, many places had been declared containment zones and were off limits to even health workers, other than those involved in Covid management. This time, however, health workers, she said, have been able to expand their outreach programme and detect more cases. During the first wave, Goa’s Covid-19 cases started rising from June and peaked in September. The second wave of the pandemic touched the peak in May, and cases considerably dropped during the last two months. She said they are also able to pick more cases now as all patients that complain of fever, besides Covid, are also tested for dengue and malaria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cortalim-vasco-together-have-most-dengue-cases-in-state/articleshow/85547192.cms||---

She was able to send across 17.5 tonnes of relief material which landed in Mumbai on August 17. “After my father showed me photos and videos recorded by his friend stuck in Chiplun, I was determined to do what I could to help,” Riva told TOI. Along with four friends, Riva launched a campaign to collect clothes and blankets for flood victims. She got in touch with her friend from Pune Shruti Chorge, who was visiting Dubai to meet her parents, and they decided to work together on the campaign. “I created a handle on Facebook and Instagram called ‘WeCareDXB’ through which I connected with schoolchildren, adults and corporates. When we put up messages on the floods, several people responded immediately. In five days, six collection points were set up in Dubai and Sharjah, and we got three truckloads of clothes and blankets for the victims,” she said. Riva and other volunteers sorted the material into 110 boxes containing 13,000 clothes for men, women and children, and blankets. A logistics company stepped in with support while a Dubai-based airline offered to fly the cargo for free after the consul general of India in Dubai Aman Puri endorsed the relief efforts of the girls. The team coordinated with the Red Cross Society of India which helped receiving the shipment in India with Customs exemption. The clothes as well as blankets are being distributed to those in need in Mahad and Chiplun through district administration channels under guidance of NCP leader Aditi Tatkare. “I have been living in Dubai for long, but my roots are in Pune. Though we helped Riva and her friends, the main idea was theirs,” said Riva’s father Rahul Tulpule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dubai-teen-friends-send-relief-material-for-flood-hit/articleshow/85547171.cms||---

The businessman, Hemant Bankar, and his friend Anand Shetty (48) had taken the help of gangster Vijay Shetty, said officials of the Anti-Extortion Cell (AEC) of Mumbai Police. Bankar’s son, Rupin, who is based in Dubai has been shown as an ‘absconding accused’. Vijay Shetty, a former member of Chhota Rajan gang, along with deported gangster Santosh Shetty had helped Rajan escape from a hospital in Bangkok after he was shot at by the Dawood gang in 2000. Police inspector Yogesh Chavan said that Shetty and Bankar who were charged with extortion and issuing threats have been remanded in police custody. According to the police, builder Kailash Agarwal, who is the complainant in the case, had approached the crime branch, alleging that he had been receiving threats from fugitive gangster Vijay Shetty. Agarwal and Bankar, who were partners, had some financial dispute in Dubai and Bankar was to pay a huge amount to Agarwal. Agarwal who had been asking for the money and Bankar allegedly avoided him. “In a bid to delay the payment, Bankars took help from his friend, Anand Shetty, who in turn approached gangster Vijay Shetty,” an officer claimed. “Vijay Shetty then called up Agarwal and threatened him not to harass the Bankars and said that the payments would be delayed. Shetty also told that he would take the responsibilities of the payment.” That is when the builder approached the police and lodged a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-worli-bizman-asks-gangster-to-threaten-partner-held/articleshow/85547184.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation to divert Rs 12 crore for Ambil Odha project||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has planned to divert Rs12 crore funds from the various projects that are unlikely to be completed by the end of the ongoing financial year to complete the Ambil Odha development project. The civic administration had initiated the Rs20 crore project to deal with the problem of flooding in areas close to the stream. A budgetary provision of Rs8 crore was made for the project and the PMC has been looking for ways to secure the remainder of the Rs12 crore for completing the project on priority. According to civic officials, a development plan for the Ambil Odha areas has been made. It included construction of 21 culverts. Removal of encroachments was among the key tasks as part of this project. The PMC has also undertaken works of deepening the nullah to increase the water carrying capacity. Issues of water gushing into houses in these areas and the severity of the floods has came to light in 2019. Settlements along Ambil Odha and Satara Road areas had faced heavy flooding due to the heavy showers on September 25, that year. The choked Ambil Odha had inundated Tangewala Society near Aranyeshwar during the deluge. It also flooded the parking lot of Treasure Park Society, damaging over 600 vehicles besides causing extensive damage to Gururaj Society. “Around Rs 8 crore is available in the budgetary provisions. More funds will be needed to complete the project. So a diversion of funds will be needed. The proposal will soon be tabled,” civic officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-divert-rs-12cr-for-ambil-odha-project/articleshow/85547231.cms||---

BMC chief Iqbal Chahal last week directed the enquiry department to conduct a preliminary probe against top fire officials. “The municipal commissioner has approved the inquiry against fire officials,” said a senior civic official. “The enquiry officer has been asked to conduct a preliminary inquiry. Based on the report, a decision will be taken on whether or not to conduct a full-fledged departmental enquiry against the then chief fire officer and his deputies.” TimesViewIt’s intriguing why the fire brigade did not collect the Fire Service Fee and Annual Fee regularly since 2014. At a time when people are battling the pandemic and economic slowdown, collecting it retrospectively will put a huge burden on housing societies and residents. Now that the BMC has ordered a probe after a nudge from the EOW, the civic body must fix responsibility on officers who caused the delay and loss of hundreds of crores to the BMC.Following a complaint by BJP corporator Vinod Mishra, the EOW, last month, had in a letter to Chahal asked him to take necessary action in the failure to recover fire service and annual fees. “Joint municipal commissioner Ramesh Pawar had himself, in an internal note in October 2020, said that there must be an inquiry and responsibility should be fixed for the revenue loss to the BMC to the tune of hundreds of crores.,” said Mishra. “We welcome the probe, but want it to be conducted by an additional municipal commissioner rank officer since the officials involved have already been promoted and can’t be investigated by enquiry officers,” he said. He also threatened to move the Bombay high court and Lokayukta if his demand for a high-level probe is not met. Additional municipal commissioner (eastern suburbs) Ashwini Bhide did not reply to a query from TOI on the issue. In May, Chahal had sancti-oned the recovery of fire service fees, which is calculated at Rs 10-15 per sq m for all buildings. The annual charge is 1% per year of the total fire se-rvice fee amount. On June 7, the fire brigade had issued a circular to recover around Rs 1,400 crore as one-time fire se-rvice fees from builders and annual fees from housing societies retrospectively since 2014. But the proposal for fee recovery was stayed by the civic standing committee following protests by corporators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-chief-orders-probe-into-revenue-loss-owing-to-non-recovery-of-fire-service-fees/articleshow/85547401.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Since chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had appointed ministers to tackle the Covid-19 crisis in specific districts, and others were assigned the task of hoisting the tricolour on August 15, it is being assumed that they shall continue as district in-charge ministers. However, there is growing demand among the public and BJP workers to name local legislators district in-charge ministers.President of Belgaum District Kannada Organisations’ Action Committee Ashok Chandargi pointed out that it was former CM Veerendra Patil who had started the practice of appointing district in-charge ministers in 1989. “Patil appointed legislators from other districts to ensure that administration was carried out in a bipartisan manner. These appointments were aimed at bridging the gap between the requirements of the district, and the expectations from the government. The district in-charge minister has to chair the review meeting for the Karnataka Development Programme, among others. The absence of a district in-charge minister will affect the administration, should it last longer. Since the CM is facing trouble within the party, it is possible that he may defer to the BJP central leadership on the issue,” Chandargi said.An official in the Haveri district administration admitted to confusion prevailing in the ranks since they were uncertain as to whether they were to approach CM Bommai, who is also from Haveri, or district in-charge minister BC Patil.Activist Vikas Soppin pointed out that many of the ministers were yet to take the reins of the departments they had been allotted. “The executive is functioning by itself, ignorant of people’s expectations. The absence of a district in-charge minister will stall infrastructure development. It is an indication that the government is not serious about administration,” he said.Making a strong case for appointing a local legislator to the post, Soppin said, “If a legislator from another district is appointed, he or she will not be able to understand the nitty-gritty of the local issues, and could be misguided by the officials. Moreover, it could burden the exchequer since the minister may have to travel to attend meetings and other key events.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/delay-in-appointment-of-district-ministers-creates-confusion/articleshow/85542566.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

These colonies are more than 35 years old and thousands of residents living and civic bodies have developed roads, streetlights and other facilities using its funds. However, in the absence of lease deeds, residents are facing several problems including availing of loan for construction, land conversion, house expansion and others. In the past, many have submitted memorandums to the chief minister’s office, but this too has failed to move the JDA officials. As Prashasan Sehro Ke Sang -2021 camps are approaching nearer, the residents have once raised demand to regularise the colony. A resident said, “These colonies were developed in 1985 by the housing cooperative society. All the owners have constructed houses on the plots and there is 100 per cent occupancy. In 2002, the record of data was submitted in the civic body. Following this, a survey was conducted in 2009, but even 11 years, the process to issue lease deeds have not inched forward.” The authority plans to earn Rs 46 crore revenue after issuing 15,819 lease deeds to owners whose houses are situated in 142 unapproved colonies. Yadvendra Singh, a resident of Madhav Nagar said, “The residents are already willing to pay lease deed amount to the JDA. The infrastructure has already been developed and resolving just simple technical issues, the government can earn much more than estimated.” During the Prashasan Shehron Ke Sang Abhiyan 2021 (Urban Area Services), the (JDA) targets to issue approximately 3 lakh lease deeds to plot owners living in regularised and unauthorised colonies in its jurisdiction. This will comprise 30% of the overall target as the state government plans to issue 10 lakh lease deeds across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/colonies-developed-35-yrs-ago-in-the-city-yet-to-be-regularised/articleshow/85547207.cms||---

The bureau conducted a search on Tuesday and seized a firm in Hubballi for misusing the BIS hallmark on gold without obtaining recognition from the BIS. Meanwhile, the bureau has also found that many water plants in North Karnataka are selling packaged drinking water without a valid licence.DP Kumar, scientist and head, BIS Hubballi branch, told TOI, “We have been carrying out searches on the firms which are not following the guidelines of BIS and misusing BIS Hallmark. BIS is the national standards body mandated under the BIS Act, 2016, to formulate Indian standards for products, processes and services covering different sectors of the economy and is also responsible for devising and implementing conformity assessment schemes, which involve certification and factory and market surveillance, hallmarking scheme to monitor the implementation of the standards.

The small gathering of veterans of SSC-11 and Technical-3 course was organised at Defence Services Officers Institute (DSOI), Chandigarh. The event was attended by nine retired officers and some of their family members. Colonel Rajeev Rastaugi (Retd), one of the members of the this batch, said 148 officers passed out in August 1971 from the Officers’ Training Academy (OTA), Chennai, earlier known as Officers’ Training School (OTS), among whom 33 are no more now. According to Col Rastaugi (Retd), this batch was special because immediately after getting commissioned into the Army, they got an opportunity to participate in the war. “What better reception will a soldier ever get or even dream than to be battle inoculated in the war zone. That was a proud moment in the lives of officers of this batch, reporting directly from the young officers course to their platoons in the war zone and asked to lead the men under command in the chilly winters of 1971 on the banks of rivers, snow bound mountains and deserts of Rajasthan. These young officers, full of Josh, exhibited tremendous courage and bravery in the war with Pakistan from December 3 to 17, 1971,” he said. The veteran also said that three of them made supreme sacrifice, several others were glorified with gallantry awards both in the western and eastern fronts.

Nearly 3,000 residents of Kurdi village in UP's Saharanpur had assembled on Saturday to attend Babuji's terahvi. Unlike what the name suggests, Babuji wasn't a village senior - though he was accorded the same respect that is reserved for the elderly. The term was used by Kurdi residents for a 20-year-old bull that spent his life among them before passing away on August 15, sending the entire hamlet into mourning. In the days that followed, religious ceremonies,including cremation, rasam pagdi and terahvi (death feast), were conducted for the bull. "Babuji died of natural causes. He was like a family member to us," said Manish Tyagi, a resident. The village had pooled in money to cover costs of the rituals, including the grand feast for 3,000 attendees on Saturday. Some youngsters had photoshopped a picture of Babuji to crop out locals standing alongside. The photo, bedecked with flowers and currency notes, took centre stage at the havan. Priest Naresh Pandit said the puja was meant to bring peace and a sense of closure for locals. "He never hurt anybody. Children loved to play with him," said Bhola Tyagi, another resident. Locals said the bull was considered a "gift from the divine". "Some people found him roaming in a holy site in the village when he was very young. Many called him Nandi (Shiva's bull)," said a resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/village-mourns-babuji-the-bull-holds-shraddh-feast-for-3k/articleshow/85550297.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The organisation’s general body meeting has not been called in four years. The organisation’s building is in a dilapidated condition, and has no electricity, drinking water connection, compound wall, and other facilities.According to sources, the Red Cross building was constructed in the city’s outskirts at a cost of Rs 15 lakh, under the CMC’s 13th finance grant. The building has become a den for illegal activities, but no action has been taken.“The committee of Red Cross in Haveri was formed illegally and without consultation with the members. Normally, members are supposed to elect Red Cross office-bearers every three years, but the committee has not called a general body meeting for the last four years, and has not submitted an annual report. The members are unaware of the activities of the organisation, because the sitting committee has not informed its members,” said Ravi Menasinakai, one of its members and an advocate.He alleged that the committee had not changed its members, even after their tenure was over. Following this, the Red Cross Haveri unit has become idle for the last four to five years. “We have appealed to the deputy commissioner to call a general body meeting as early as possible, but the DC is yet to respond to our demand. The DC, who is the unit’s president, should call a general body meeting and form a new committee,” said Ravi Menasinakai.“The Red Cross building here is surrounded by empty liquor bottles, and waste, because it has been turned into a bar. Many people have been gathering here to consume alcohol. There is no proper road to reach the building. The authorities need to pay attention to the situation immediately,” appealed Prabhu Hitnalli, a member.Sanjeev Neeralagi, chairman of Red Cross Haveri, said that the organisation was not inactive in Haveri. “We provided oxygen concentrators and pulse oximeters to the district administration to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic recently. However, I requested the DC to call a general body meeting, and we are waiting for the same,” he added.Quote Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we are unable to call general body meetings. We need to increase membership for the Red Cross in Haveri. I will call a general body meeting after Covid-19 guidelines are relaxed.”-Sanjay Shettannavar, deputy commissioner, Haveri||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/red-cross-inactive-in-haveri-for-many-years/articleshow/85542596.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

Most of them are working without protective gears and not getting enough incentives. The report by Delhi-based advocacy group Accountability Initiative says that since lockdown, the anganwadi workers have been working four more hours in addition to their eight-hour job. They along with Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) have been assigned more tasks like contact tracing, distribution of food to taking care of the migrant population made them overworked. Their primary job is to serve primary health and nutrition services. The advent of Covid-19 has put them at the forefront of combating the pandemic. “Their revised responsibilities have included screening for Covid-19, contact tracing, communication of preventative measures, adapting nutrition-related programmes, and doorstep delivery of maternal and child health services. Eighty percent of them said that they faced pressure from their supervisors,” said the report. The important highlight of the report says that 5% of them admitted that they faced verbal and physical abuse while performing their duties. “Many confessed that gender-based misbehaviour or looking at them unpleasantly. They were subjected to rude behaviour like beneficiaries not allowed them to enter their houses, families refused them to cooperate with Covid-19 protocol,” reads the report. The findings say that 90% of them have reported an increase in the number of people in their work area which was largely due to an increase in the number of people in their work area. 92% of them have received at least one protective equipment making them vulnerable to infection. “Around 37% respondents in the survey say that were not able to assist citizens with Covid-19 related issues, largely due to a shortage of resources followed by lack of money,” reads the report. Notably, these workers in the sparsely populated districts like Jaisalmer, Barmer, Sirohi and Pali have to cover a distance of 100 kilometres to cover the daily target along with additional work. “Thirty five percent of them says that they have not been able to meet their families for long due to increased work,” reads the report. K B Kothari, former policy and planner, UNICEF New York, said that the report is an outcome of the composite treatment that has been meted out to the frontline workers. “The absence of recognition as a force behind carrying health services has reduced them to mere any government servants before the public. Their role in reducing the distance between life and death has to be acknowledged in order to provide them due respect,” said Kothari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/60k-anganwadi-members-who-worked-during-covid-stressed/articleshow/85547252.cms||---

He was 89. The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Sunday. “All government offices, public sector undertaking and institutions will remain closed on Monday. The tricolour will fly at half-mast at all government buildings and no government programmes will be held,” says an official statement. Singh served as the governor from 2014-19 and became only the second governor to complete his full five-year term. He had surprised everyone by announcing to drop the prefix ‘Excellency’ from the name of the governor along with dropping guard of honour during his official visits. As a chancellor of state universities, he took keen interest in bringing transparency in the system. He introduced biometric attendance in higher education institutes and batted for standardised eligibility criteria for the post of vice-chancellors. His five-point charter for smart villages adopted by the varsities included free from tobacco, illiteracy, crime, legal cases and uncleanliness. It was later adopted by several universities in other states. Some of his decisions didn’t go well in state polity. He directed the state varsities to do away with the robe and gown on convocation ceremonies by terming it a reflection of the imperial mindset. Also, installing a statue of Swami Vivekananda and unfurling the tricolour in every varsity was seen as move to inject a sense of hyper nationalism in educational institutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kalyan-singhs-death-raj-announces-2-day-state-mourning/articleshow/85547265.cms||---
---||Mumbai||FYJC admissions: Minority quota cut-offs drop, remain unchanged in some colleges||MUMBAI: The cut-offs for FYJC Arts at the city’s sought-after St Xavier’s College in the first minority quota list has seen a 1.6% drop from last year —from 85% to 83.4%. Cut-offs at St Andrew’s College, another Christian minority college, too, have seen a 3% drop in their arts and over 6% drop in the science programmes in the first list. The drop in cut-offs in the minority quota, in a year when the board exams were not held, has taken some by surprise. At Xavier’s, over 50% of the total 176 students allotted seats in the first minority list have scored above 90%, but the numbers are usually higher. Hasnain Naqvi, vice-principal of the junior college, said they were initially surprised, but after an analysis, found that most stude-nts were from convent or Christian-run schools. “These schools are frugal in giving away marks in internal assessment as they focus on holistic education and ensure that students do not get complacent for their final exams. They seem to have followed the same policy even this time,” said Naqvi, adding that the drop in scores may not be true for the open category list. “Several schools seem to have gone liberal in awarding ma-rks as the second class has disappeared this year and that cannot be an overnight miracle.” Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, said the drop in cut-offs was shocking. “Schools may not have been all that liberal in marking students on expected lines,” she said, adding that it is difficult to predict the cut-offs in the open category based on the minority list. The college saw a drop in the cut-offs for arts and science, but a 1.8% jump in commerce cut-offs. At HR College, the cut-off in the first minority list for commerce, remained unchanged at around 60%. Principal Dr Uma Shankar at SIES College of Arts, Science and Commerce, said the internal assessment methodology adopted to prepare the SSC results could be responsible for too many students not scoring 90% and above. “Our in-house minority students may have been assessed strictly in class IX. Their SSC results are a reflection of that. So, class XI cut-off has also remained low (in minority list),” she said. The cut-off at the college remained unchanged, around 70% for minority students. The general merit list for FYJC is set to release on August 27. At some minority colleges, the first list is expected this week, while a few will be putting out their second one. Students applying in minority quota hope to get seats in colleges of their choice. “If with 75%, I don’t get a commerce seat in a minor-ity college, then getting it in the open category will be even more tough,” said Alisha Fernandes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fyjc-admissions-minority-quota-cut-offs-drop-remain-unchanged-in-some-colleges/articleshow/85547373.cms||Yogita Rao

Spread over the 17,000 sqm of land near Deep Nagar Curti, an outskirt of Ponda town, the complex has a crematorium for Hindus and burial ground for Catholics, Muslims and other communities who wish to conduct final rites. Since the crematorium has no shed for cremation of Hindu bodies, such final rites are conducted at Ponda ‘Muktidham’ crematorium, while Catholics have their own cemetery at Ponda. The Curti complex is being mostly used by migrants to bury their dead. “When we visited the complex, we found over 300 graves there, but the panchayat has records of hardly 65 rites. The complex is being used for the past 15 years and it is difficult to calculate how many bodies have been buried in the graveyard over the period,” said sarpanch Gurudas Khedekar. He said such uncontrolled use of the site has also created a loss to panchayat revenue and hence they have displayed the panchayat secretary’s mobile number so that people can contact him to obtain a receipt after making necessary payments to the panchayat to perform final rites. The panchayat has erected a compound wall and gate around the complex. The gate has been locked and the civic body is mulling to appoint a person at the complex to man the site, the sarpanch added. He said that they had even found that people living in the vicinity have been using the road leading to the complex to park their vehicles. Such attempts will be discontinued henceforth, Khedekar said. The complex lacks certain basic facilities such as a shed with seating arrangements for those attending the final rites, and water connection. The panchayat would try to put these in place soon, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curti-panchayat-finds-unknown-graves-locks-site-for-last-rites/articleshow/85547319.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||On Rakhi, focus on gender disparity in kidney transplants||JAIPUR: A 30-year-old woman, who got admitted to SMS Hospital with her five-year elder sister, will soon gift one of her kidneys to her sister. In majority of kidney donations, women give their organs as a sister, wife and mother. In most of the cases, sisters come forward to donate a kidney to save the lives of their brothers. However, the gender disparity in transplantation has now become a major issue. “Since 75-80% living donors are females and only 30-35% females receive transplants, we have seen a major gender disparity in transplantation. We are now committed to reduce this disparity and taken pledge to work in this direction,” said Dr Dhananjai Agarwal, senior professor and head of nephrology department, SMS Hospital. The issue of gender disparity in transplantation was discussed at a meeting of Asian Society of Transplantation (AST) in partnership with the women in transplantation (WIT). “It is not an issue of Jaipur or Rajasthan, but in most part of the world,” said Dr Agarwal, who is part of the AST. While gender gaps in education,jobs and in other sectors have prompted the governments to take corrective steps, there is inequality in organ donation. City-based nephrologists encourage men to donate one of their kidneys to their ailing relatives or persons who are allowed under the laws for a kidney transplant. Doctors claimed that due to diabetes and hypertension, cases of kidney disorders have gone up. Kidney patients are reaching for dialysis in hospitals are also increasing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/on-rakhi-focus-on-gender-disparity-in-kidney-transplants/articleshow/85547302.cms||---

For a change, people celebrated the festival with sweets, chocolates and homemade delicacies, after almost a year of being tied up at homes because of the pandemic. Sisters tied rakhis on the wrists of their brothers and prayed for their wellbeing. In the evening, markets were choc-a-bloc with people and vehicles. “Since I am mother of an infant boy, I hardly get time. So, I purchased Rakhi on Sunday only. I took some packets of chocolates for my brother and nephew. I have got one brother and 12 cousins, thus, my day will be hectic. Last year, because of Covid I could not visit any of my brothers despite being married in a family in Jaipur," said Shimona Sharma, a homemaker, who lives in Pratap Nagar. People enjoyed the festival as Covid-19 cases have dipped drastically. "Last year, we were only making phone calls asking each other to wear mask, wash hands and maintain social distancing. It was a very scary period. But, now things have changed. I have got both my vaccines so has my sister and brother-in-law, that’s why I visited them,” said Neeraj Bhatt, who came from Alwar to celebrate the festival with his sister who stays in Jaipur. Sweet shops, bakeries or grocery stores selling chocolates gift packs saw good festive business. “It is good to see the same zeal. I hope this continues till Diwali and that would be possible if people continue to get vaccines,” said Narayan Gupta, who owns a grocery store at Vaishali Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/people-beat-corona-fears-to-celebrate-rakshabandhan/articleshow/85547291.cms||---

---||Pune||Spice Money sees huge growth in pandemic yr||Pune: A combination of a vast and untapped market, as well as a lack of access to conventional banking channels, helped semi-urban and rural-focused fintech firm Spice Money grow exponentially over the past year, its chief executive officer Sanjeev Kumar has said. “The first wave of the pandemic was a catalyst to our business. Since March 2020, our growth in terms of gross transactions per month has been up to three times what it was pre-pandemic. We were catering to a sector that needed basic banking services, such as deposits and withdrawals,” Kumar told TOI. Spice Money’s network largely consists of around 7 lakh partners, much of which are small grocery or other outlets in the rural and semi-urban areas, and banks on the Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS) and approximately 42 crore Jan Dhan accounts that have been opened in the past few years. Essentially, Kumar said, the partners acted as ATMs using their cellphone devices, where their customers could deposit or withdraw money to and from their accounts across banks, through a biometrics-based KYC process linked to the Aadhaar. “We launched just about three years ago. but we have dug deep in the rural market and are present across 18,000 post-codes. Rural India is a huge and untapped segment, and there have been no serious players in the basic banking space in that segment. Besides, there is demand for such easy access to banking, as banking infrastructure is often difficult to reach in many parts of India,” he said. Having started out extensively in north India, the company said it was looking further east and south. “There are some areas of interrupted internet connectivity, but that has been improving year on year. The backbone for this business is the smartphone and its penetration in the rural market is extremely high,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/spice-money-sees-huge-growth-in-pandemic-yr/articleshow/85545037.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Kolkata||Monotosh Afghan puja||Monotosh Chakraborty Kolkata A Durga puja organiser of Joramandir, Baguihati, the neighbourhood of Susmita Banerjee, better known as Kabuliwalar Bangali Bou, on Sunday celebrated the khuti puja by remembering her, who was brutally killed by Talibanis in 2013 in Afghanistan. The organiser tied rakhi on the wrists of Afghan youths in presence of the family members of Susmita Banerjee. Banerjee’s first book Kabuliwalar Bangali Bou after its release became an instant hit and later made into a film inn 2003: An escape from Taliban.: “Susmitadi chhilo amader parar meye (a neighbourhood girl). She also acted as an Indo-Afghan bridge after her marriage with Jaanbaz Khan, a Kabuliwala, who used to come to the city to sell dry fruits. But her brutal murder startled us. She was highly energetic and could not tolerate injustice. She paid the price of being intolerant to injustice with her life in September 2013. When Kabul is under siege by Talibans and gross injustice is meted out to Afghans, we found her relevance in the current context. This is why we fondly remember her as a brave soul,” said Avijit Ganguly, a member of Shastribagan Sporting club. As the khuti puja coincided with the Rakshabanadhan, the club members chose to tie rakhi on the wrists of Afghan youths. “I am personally overwhelmed to be invited by the organisers of Durga puja, the biggest festival of the city. We immensely enjoy hopping pandals. But this is the first time we are invited by the organisers of a puja. You all know what an anarchic period we are undergoing back in our country. We are always haunted by the safety of our near and dear ones there. I will pray to the almighty that peace prevails all across the world,” said Yasmin Khan, secretary of an Afghan organisation in the city. Susmita Banerjee’s sister-in-law Debolina Banerjee could not suppress her tears when asked about Susmita: “I was the first one to receive the news of her death from Jaanbaz Khan. I was shattered. She was a trained nurse and dedicated her life to facilitating tortured women to come out from the clutch of their tormenting inlaws. Her death shattered me completely.” The programme was also attended by Susmita’s youngest brother Gopal Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/monotosh-afghan-puja/articleshow/85545054.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Agra||UP BJP slams those condemning flag hoisting inside mosque; clerics say polls are near||AGRA: The row surrounding hoisting of national flag inside Agra’s Jama Masjid refuses to die down as BJP on Sunday said that those slamming the Independence Day celebration inside the place of worship are actually inspired by the Talibani mindset. A 75-second video, posted from the official twitter handle of UP BJP, says, “Like Talibani terrorists pull down the national flag of Afghanistan, people with similar mindset tried to repeat it in Agra. But these people should remember that there is Yogi government in UP”. The video which features a picture of chief minister Yogi Adityanath says, “Actually, people with Talibani mindset have a problem with the tricolor. They forget this mindset will not work under the Yogi government.” The video also features flag hoisting inside the mosque premises and an audio background condemning it in the background. A prominent cleric who oversees the city’s 17th century Jama Masjid was on Wednesday booked for allegedly dubbing recitation of national anthem inside the mosque as “un-Islamic”, just two days after a group led by a local BJP leader entered the place of worship, hoisted the tricolor and sung the anthem to mark the Independence Day. The FIR against city Mufti Mazidul Kudhush Khubaeb Roomi, 75, was registered by local police on the basis of a complaint filed by a mosque management committee member and local leader Haji Aslam Qureshi. The event was headed by Ashfaq Saifi, a BJP leader who was recently appointed chairperson of the UP’s minority commission. Vice-president of All India Jamaitul Quresh Jamiluddin Qureshi said, “The Shahar Mufti has been framed in a false case. Ahead of the assembly elections, BJP is indulging in politics by targeting the Muslim community. We will continue to protest against the injustice.” Meanwhile, UP police on Saturday arrested one of the accused, former district president of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) in connection with three FIRs registered following a protest organized by Muslim leaders in support of the city Mufti. However, the arrested accused was granted bail by the court. Superintendent of police Shivram Yadav said, “The cases against the city mufti and his son and those who protested in their support are being investigated in detail. Names of people who circulated content of social media calling for the protest and in support of the procession will be added in the FIRs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bjp-slams-those-condemning-flag-hoisting-inside-mosque-clerics-say-polls-are-near/articleshow/85542658.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Kochi||Charging e-vehicles at Kerala State Electricity Board stations to cost Rs 15/unit||KOCHI: The free charging enjoyed by electric vehicles (EV) owners at Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) charging stations will come to an end in two weeks. It will cost the EV owners Rs 15 per unit. Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission has given directions to KSEB in this regard. Officials said that customers could charge EVs free of cost on a pilot basis for three months and it was planned to collect payments after that. But it got delayed due to glitches in the app ‘Electrify’ which allows the customer to identify the place of charging station, book slot and charge the vehicle and pay the amount digitally. “The inauguration of the charging stations was held in December last year and we planned to start payment mode after three months. But it got delayed for eight months due to glitches. Now they have rectified it. We have to execute an agreement with a digital payment firm for the transaction of payments to KSEB’s account. Once it’s done, we will move to the payment mode,” said a senior board official. Charging stations in Thrissur and Kozhikode reported more energy consumption and the one in Thiruvananthapuram reported less consumption. The regulatory commission has created LT10, a tariff category applicable only for energy consumption at EV stations. As per the current rate fixed by the commission, energy charge per unit is Rs 5, besides fixed charge, service charge and GST adding up to around Rs 15 per unit. “We are collecting only the minimum amount, though it is nothing compared to the expenses by the board for setting up stations and other allied expenses. The board aims to promote the EV sector,” said another official. When new charging stations become operational, new mobile apps will be developed with more features and KSEB will create a common platform. The construction of 25 EV charging stations under the board is going on in various districts. Agency for Non-conventional and Rural Technology (ANERT) also operates five EV charging stations in the state and they charge around Rs 15 per unit from customers. The state has witnessed a jump in registration of EVs following the pandemic. As many as 3,313 EVs were registered in the state till August 16 this year as against 1,324 registrations last year. The highest number of EV registrations were recorded in April and July this year with 631 and 668, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/charging-e-vehicles-at-kseb-stations-to-cost-rs-15/unit/articleshow/85542684.cms||T C Sreemol

It is alleged that the university vice-chancellor, succumbing to pressure of some Left union leaders, has taken steps for the third-round valuation of answer papers of three students who had failed in the first and third semester examinations. During the term of first Pinarayi Vijayan government, former higher education minister K T Jaleel had created a controversy by directing APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University to conduct a third-round valuation of answer papers of a student based on a complaint he received during a university adalat. However, the varsity authorities denied the allegations as baseless. “Three students who had obtained impressive grades in all papers except three have submitted a written complaint to the university. They have complained of having subjected to personal vendetta by purposefully failing them in one subject. Since the revalued marks were not shown to the students as mandated, the grievance redressal cell set up as per the credit and semester system (CSS) regulation recommended that the complaint and the related documents should be subjected to the scrutiny of the subject expert. Based on the cell’s recommendation, management dean and a subject expert have been entrusted with the task prescribed by the redressal cell. The university has not taken any decision against the rules,” said a statement by university authorities. Meanwhile, Save University Campaign committee has said that the university authorities were making room for the third-round valuation, a year after the examination in question was over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/move-to-conduct-third-round-valuation-of-papers-draws-flak/articleshow/85542755.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Agra||Thousands pay tribute to Kalyan Singh in Aligarh, cremation in Bulandshahr today||ALIGARH/BULANDSHAHR: Thousands were already there, waiting, when the mortal remains of former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stalwart Kalyan Singh were brought to a stadium in Aligarh, a city which went into mourning on an otherwise joyous occasion of Raksha Bandhan. Slogans of ‘Jai Shree Ram’ and ‘Babu ji Amar Rahen’ rent the air of city’s Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar Stadium on Sunday evening as soon as the vehicle carrying Singh's body reached from the airport. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath was also with the hearse, as was BJP’s state chief Swatantra Dev Singh. A few hours earlier, in Lucknow, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP chief JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah led the mourners in paying tribute to the Hindutva icon, who once spearheaded the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and quit as UP’s chief minister on December 6, 1992 -- the day the disputed structure in Ayodhya was brought down. Hundreds of people from Aligarh’s Atrauli, where Singh was born and grew up, stormed the all decked-up stadium to see their leader one last time. Popular as ‘Babu ji’ among followers, Singh was a teacher in Atrauli before taking a plunge into politics. The region elected him as MLA for the first time in 1967. Singh’s popularity grew in leaps and bounds and he won ten of the 11 assembly polls he contested from Atrauli. The two-time UP chief minister will be cremated in Bulandshahr’s Dibai area, about 35km from Atrauli, on Monday afternoon. Singh considered Dibai his ‘karambhoomi’. He was elected to Lok Sabha from Bulandshahr once and twice to the state assembly from Dibai constituency. Dibai is also the nearest Ganga ghat. “Singh’s funeral procession will begin from the stadium at 9am on Monday. After a brief halt at Atrauli, it will reach Dibai where the last rites will take place at 3pm,” said Aligarh MP Satish Gautam. “The death of Kalyan Singh is a huge and an irreplaceable loss for the party. I started my political career under his guidance and today I feel like an orphan,” he said. “He always chose Atrauli over Dibai, but maintained that Aligarh is his ‘janambhoomi’ and Bulandshahr his ‘karambhoomi’. Therefore, he is being cremated in Dibai,” said Chandrapal Singh, a close aide of the BJP leader. BJP’s top brass is likely to be present during the last rites, with workers claiming that over 5 lakh people are expected to attend the cremation. Ram Singh, a former MLA from Dibai who represented the assembly seat in 1991 and 1993, couldn’t hold his tears. “He was like a brother. A leader, and a father-figure. He was the face of the Lodhi community. No one could say ‘no’ to Babuji,” Ram told TOI. Abhishek Pandey, chief development officer (CDO) of Bulandshahr, said that the irrigation department’s land is being cleaned for the cremation of Kalyan Singh. The ground has a capacity to accommodate over 3,000 people but the nearby areas can accommodate a large crowd.  “The body of Kalyan Singh will be bathed in Ganga before cremation,” Pandey added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/thousands-pay-tribute-to-kalyan-singh-in-aligarh-cremation-in-bulandshahr-today/articleshow/85542752.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Though there is a corner for on-demand printed journals and books for those who want to feel the print while reading, most of the section will be virtual. “We have stopped buying new journals and books in print version,” said Neelima Chadha, former librarian, PGI. She retired recently. The concept is to have more space for reading. “It turned out to be a blessing in disguise during the pandemic as we had already started digitalisation,” said Neelima. The library is a 60-year-old building renovated recently. “There is a plan to make a room for the professor emeritus and senior professors after retirement where they can discuss their thesis with students,” said Neelima, who has worked in PGI for last 30 years. She said, “We have procured software which gives access to the research thesis. Many things have been added online to make research work easier for scientists and clinicians.” PGI is a part of the “National Medical Library’s Electronic Resources in Medicine” consortium that provides electronic information resources in medicine for delivering effective health care throughout the country. There are 25 terminals in the library which have been upgraded from five. “During the pandemic the library was opened as those who had to take examinations wanted to read here,” said Neelima. After her 30-year tenure, the librarian feels there is still a scope to add more. “I had proposed a soundproof room for those who want to read without disturbance amidst the discussions on certain topics,” said Neelima.

The subject-matter of the grievances to be filed through the website of J&K relief commissioner for migrants, may range from correction of property records to demarcation and removal of encroachments, trespassing and alienation by way of fraud or distress, etc. A source said the grievance mechanism will consider complaints relating to distress sales forced on Kashmiri Hindus after they had migrated, as well as encroachment beyond the area covered by the sale. All district magistrates will be required to dispose of the property-related grievances received via the online forum in a fixed timeframe under the Public Services Guarantee Act, 2011. A J&K government official told on Sunday that within 24 hours of launch of the online service on Saturday evening, 15 grievances had been received.

---||Ranchi||Multi-drug therapy against filaria in 12 dists from today||Ranchi: For complete eradication of lymphatic filaria in Jharkhand, the state health department is starting yet another round of mass drug administration (MDA) in 12 of 17 filaria endemic districts from Monday. The MDA will be held for six days with a combination of two anti-filaria drugs, albandozole and DEC, in 11 districts of Giridih, Chatra, Dumka, East Singhbhum, Garhwa, Godda, Hazaribag, Khunti, Lohardaga, Ranchi and East Singhbhum. The twelfth district, Simdega, was chosen for a pilot project to experiment with a triple-drug therapy with ivermectin as the third tablet. Across the country, 256 districts in 16 states and five Union territories are considered filaria endemic zones and India being a signatory of the World Health Association had resolved to take steps for complete eradication of filaria by 2020. Though the MDA campaigns were adversely impacted last year due to the Covid pandemic, the health authorities have decided to take forward the mission through several rounds of MDA. Director of National Health Mission, Dr Uma Shankar Singh, said no government campaign in the field of health will be successful without the participation of the public. He said, “We, therefore, appeal to the people to come forward and take the free medicines from health representatives, who will be on door-to-door campaigns during the MDA.” State programme officer of vector-borne diseases, Dr S N Jha said the medicines would be distributed from booths and also delivered at the doorsteps by the health workers. “Anyone above the age of one year, not suffering from any critical illness, or women who are not pregnant are eligible to take the oral medicines provided,” he said, stressing that the children in the age group 1-2 years would be provided with only one pill — albendazole. Jha also asked people to be aware that anti-filaria drugs sometimes cause minor adverse effects like fever, headache and vomiting. “But such effects are noticed only when the parasite is present in the body of the person who consumed the drug. Instead of panicking, they should understand that vomiting or fever is an indication that the person is safe from the parasite,” he said. State convener of WHO for the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD), Abhishek Paul, said filaria is caused by a parasite and transmitted through mosquitoes. “Filaria, which often results in abnormal swelling of the limbs and other organs of the body, is one of the leading causes of physical disability but with timely intervention, it can be prevented and even eradicated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/multi-drug-therapy-against-filaria-in-12-dists-from-today/articleshow/85544620.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||Ranchi||Chorus grows to come up with Puja guidelines||Ranchi: Lalpur-based idolmaker Ajoy Pal nearly lost his life to Covid-19 when the second wave of the pandemic reached Jharkhand in April this year. Medical treatment drained Pal of lakhs of rupees, but he is still hopeful of a turnaround in fortunes as the second wave subsided. “Last year, we could not sell 28 idols of Goddess Durga owing to the restrictions imposed by the Jharkhand government in its Puja guidelines. This year, we have built 20 small idols (below five feet) of the goddess. But as the government is yet to issue guidelines for this year, none of the Puja committees have placed their orders. Now, I have nearly 50 idols and a bank loan close to Rs 18 lakh and I do not know what to do,” Pal told TOI in his Peace Road-based workshop on Sunday. Puja committees, idolmakers, pandal-makers and florists are eagerly waiting for the Jharkhand government to come clean on the Durga Puja, which is a little over 45 days away. “We have not been able to plan anything related to the Durga Puja. A meeting of the committee members was scheduled on August 15, but then we got word that the guidelines will be issued soon. But there has been nothing from the government so far,” Ashok Choudhary, president of Bakri Bazar Puja Committee, told TOI. Suresh Agarwal, the president of Satya Amar Lok Puja Committee in Harmu Road, said: “Building pandals and idols take time. It cannot happen in a matter of days. If a guideline is not issued at the earliest, how will we make the arrangements?” In 2020, prominent Puja committees of the city had unanimously agreed to prune the grandeur of their respective Pujas and make the arrangements by raising money within their members. However, the state government had banned entry of visitors into the pandals and ordered that committees could not have idols above five feet. “There is no third wave. But the government should make its stand clear without any delay. Else, thousands of craftsmen will lose out on their income. And the committees will be forced to organise Pujas by the roadside as Pujas will have to take place at all costs,” president of a city-based Durga Puja committee said. State disaster management secretary Amitabh Kaushal did not respond to TOI’s calls when contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/chorus-grows-to-come-up-with-puja-guidelines/articleshow/85545045.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Seema reached Ranchi’s Firayalal Chowk on Sunday forenoon and tied rakhis to on-duty jawans of Jharkhand Police and India Reserve Battalion and also offered them sweets. Priti Tiwary, a 28-year-old housewife from Harmu Housing colony, flew down from Bengaluru to celebrate Rakhi with her brother. “I got married two years ago and could not come home last year due to Covid-19 lockdown. Since cases are fewer this time, I decided to come,” Priti told TOI. Ipshita Mazumdar, a hotel management trainee at a five-star hotel in New Delhi, could not make it home. “Last year, I was at home due to the lockdown and tied rakhi to my brothers. But I got a job this year and could not make it. However, it was virtual Raksha Bandhan for me this time,” Ipshita told TOI over phone. Restaurants across the city opened for diners but the crowd was not like the previous years. “There were over 100 active cases in Ranchi last week. After the horrors which unfolded before our eyes during the second wave, we thought it was best to celebrate at home with our siblings,” Piyush Verma, a Doranda resident, said. It was a quiet family celebration for many politicians as well. Chief minister Hemant Soren drove down to his father Shibu Soren’s Morhabadi residence, where he celebrated Rakhi with his sisters. Former chief minister Raghubar Das flung open his Agrico residents for visitors and accepted Rakhi from several women from the neighbourhood. The functionaries of BJP Mahila Morcha tied rakhis to the CRPF jawans who are stationed at their camp in Tiril just outside the city. A group of students tied rakhis to a Kalpataru tree in Hinoo in order to spread the message of environment conservation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/after-horrors-of-second-wave-ranchi-treads-cautiously-on-raksha-bandhan/articleshow/85544873.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to the health department sources, the five passengers tested positive on RAT on Friday afternoon but they were not informed on time about their status and were let off from the airport. One of the passengers, who is from Ranchi, told TOI that she was informed about her positive status late on Friday evening after which she went for an RT-PCR test on Saturday, the result of which returned negative. “I was told that my report of the rest on RAT kit at the airport was positive. Out of fear and for precaution, I got myself tested at a private lab on Saturday and my report is negative,” the 29-year-old passenger said. Reacting to the development, Ranchi SDM Deepak Kumar Dubey said, “Five samples on Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) kits returning positive sequentially (in a series) is rare and the fault must lie in the testing kits. When we contacted the passengers, one of them had taken an RT-PCR test which returned negative.” Dubey said they have now contacted all remaining four passengers and advised them to undergo RT-PCR tests at their respective districts for confirmation. The four passengers also told TOI that were not informed by the authorities in the last two days about their status. They blamed the authorities if they had infected others. Of the four, one is from Ranchi and one each from Gumla, Hazaribag and Bhagalpur in Bihar. The 39-year-old passenger from Gumla said, “I isolated myself as a precaution upon my arrival from New Delhi. However, I wasn’t informed about my test report. This is a complete failure on the part of the administration. If they cannot manage the testing protocols even at the airport, then why are they doing it in the first place?” The passenger from Bihar said, “I have reached Bhagalpur and I have the least concern about it, but will take precautions so that I don’t infect others till my confirmation report comes.” Meanwhile, department sources said the confusion happened as the authorities concerned have not made proper arrangements at the airport. “People submit their samples and leave the area as we do not have adequate forces and the authorities aren’t always present. We get the reports only after the passengers have left,” a healthcare worker with the airport testing team said. Dubey, however, said they have deployed ambulances and buses for shifting passengers who tested positive to Covid care centres. He said, “I will have to inquire with the senior officers who are in charge why they had not traced those patients who had tested positive. A clarification will be sought .” On being asked whether the RAT kits are faulty, Dubey said he isn’t an expert and would not be able to comment on the issue but said five results coming out positive in a series point to faulty kits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-admin-blames-faulty-rat-kits-for-5-cov-ve-results/articleshow/85545031.cms||Gaurav Pandey

It was to be a signature project. depicting cultural significance of the town with two small multiplexes, a cafeteria or food park and ample parking space at basement stilt. A council meeting held on June 15 had resolved to change the contractor in a bid to get the project completed at the earliest. The project was sanctioned by then Congress government in 2011 to commemorate 50 years of Goa’s Liberation, but it could not take off despite having two foundation stone laying ceremonies. In 2011, the government had sanctioned Rs 2 crore to PMC to construct the project, but the work could not begin. Later, on October 30, 2015, the municipality redesigned the project drawings by including some add-on amenities, escalating the cost estimation to Rs 4.3 crore. The project even witnessed two foundation stone laying ceremonies. Being home minister in the Congress government, Ravi Naik laid a foundation stone on December 19, 2011. He lost the election in 2012, and subsequently another foundation stone was laid on May 19, 2014 by then PWD minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar. The construction work of the project was allotted to Sameer Vachasundar, a civil contractor, who completed a portion of the structure. “The contractor said that he can’t afford the work with old Goa schedule of rates (GSR) and sought a revision as per the new GSR. The contractor has so far paid been around Rs 2 crore, and is seeking an additional Rs 80 lakh to complete the project,” PMC chairperson Shantaram Kolvenkar said. He said that PMC will relieve the contractor from the project and float a new tender to get the remaining work completed at the earliest. Kolvenkar also said that it has been decided that the shops on the ground floor should be allotted for people who want to run businesses. It may be recalled that on September 3, 2018, then director of municipal administration R Menaka inspected the project and assured that she would follow up the issue of pending amount with the directorate of art and culture. However, the project could not proceed and the council is now hopeful to complete it by using the unutilised funds sanctioned to PMC under the 14th financial plan of the Union government which amounts to Rs 3.3 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ponda-municipality-to-retender-incomplete-golden-jubilee-work/articleshow/85548761.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

The decision was taken after a discussion with the chief minister of Goa on August 12, 2021, the high court was told, and a note dated August 13 pertaining to the work was submitted to the court. “Having regard to the decision taken by the respondents to proceed for retender, we do not see any reason to examine the merits of the challenge laid by the petitioner to rejection of his bid, as well as selection of others on this writ petition,” the court held. The division bench comprising chief justice of the Bombay high court Dipankar Datta and Justice Mahesh Sonak found that the department “was not quite confident of the reason for rejection of the petitioner’s bid”. “… and he having approached this court with the present writ petition challenging rejection of bid upon application of the government circular, and also that there are certain ambiguities in the tender, it was thought advisable to proceed for a retender,” the court stated. A notice for retender dated July 8 was issued by the office of the executive engineer, Works Div I (Bldgs), Public Works Department, for the arrangement of housekeeping, catering and maintenance of the Circuit House containing 39 rooms including seven suites and state guest house containing two VVIP deluxe rooms at Altinho, Panaji. The petitioner Sohan Juwarkar challenged the rejection of his bid and the selection of Soham Transport and Earthmovers. The estimated cost of the work put to tender was Rs 9.88 crore and while three other bidders quoted 20 per cent below the estimated cost, Juwarkar’s bid was 30 per cent below the cost, senior advocate representing him S S Kantak with counsel Abhijeet Kamat submitted to the high court. Juwarkar’s bid was rejected in view of the circular dated November 12, 2007, issued by the principal chief engineer. At the hearing, advocate general Devidas Pangam stated that a decision has since been taken to cancel the subject-tender and proceed for a retender “upon removing any ambiguity for competitive bidding process as well as for insertion of such conditions in the fresh tender notice to be issued upon receiving inputs from the Works Division.” He also submitted that the minister in charge of the public works department has approved the suggestion of the departmental office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/retender-for-upkeep-of-circuit-house-soon/articleshow/85547618.cms||---
---||India||Granny crosses all hurdles to pursue doctorate||Clad in pristine white shalwar-kurta with a matching hijab covering her head, she sits on a sofa against decorative Arabic inscriptions on the wall featuring 99 names of Allah. One of the names is Rahman the merciful. It is divine mercy, says 75-year-old Zubeida Yacoob Khandwani, which propels her to seek knowledge regardless of hurdles she has faced. It is this joie de verve, this positive energy that makes her stand out. When most septuagenarians hang up their boots and the prosperous ones amongst them either bask in past glory or pen memoirs, this gutsy grandmother has opened yet another chapter in her life. She is researching for a doctorate on Sufism. "I would have finished it a decade ago but for a few setbacks. My guide, renowned Urdu, Persian and Islamic Studies scholar Prof Nizamuddin Gorekar (he taught at many institutions, including St Xavier's College in South Mumbai) died, followed by the death of my husband (businessman Yacoob Khandwani and younger brother of former MLA, Haj Committee of India chairman Amin Khandwani)," she says. Then she fell and fractured an arm. Someone else might have given up. But she didn't. Tomes on Sufism, many volumes of the Quran and its commentaries, journals, history books jostle for space at the Khandwani House, a heritage bungalow (built in 1882) in Mahim. "I shifted many of the books into my office and even at the godown as we ran short of space here," says son Sohail Khandwani, businessman, managing trustee of Mahim Dargah and a trustee of Haji Ali Dargah. A family with a legacy of over 200 years, it is the fifth generation of the Khandwanis living in the same house. Zubeida was barely 17 when her mother died and she was married. She dropped out of college. Later she graduated in Arts through a correspondence course and subsequently completed LLB too. "There was a time when my mother, my elder sister and I were at the same educational complex run by the Sindhis in Bandra. Then it felt a bit embarrassing that my mother and I were students though we went to different classrooms," recalls Sohail Khandwani. The real surprise, recalls Sohail, came when his father decided to do a Masters in Economics as his mother joined an MA course in Islamic Studies. Zubeida, also general secretary at the All India Memon Jamat Federation, got attracted to Sufism as she began visiting mausoleums of Sufi saints like Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (Ajmer), Nizamuddin Aulia (Dehi), Makhdoom Mahimi and Haji Ali. "Sufism is not a new religion. It is a way of life that makes you tolerant and modest," she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/granny-crosses-all-hurdles-to-pursue-doctorate/articleshow/85550365.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Goa||Twist in the tail: When Goa snatched a win from the jaws of defeat||What are the odds of winning when you need eight runs from three overs? Pretty good, you would say. What about three runs from the final two balls and your last man is batting? The batsman is yet to open his account. Worse still, he has to face Bharat Arun, the burly right arm medium pace bowler who picked up three wickets on his India debut. It’s February 5, 1990, Goa vs Chemplast in the Arlem Trophy, a popular cricket tournament that attracted big names like Ravi Shastri, Dilip Vengsarkar, Roger Binny, Vinod Kambli and Sandeep Patil on a regular basis. In the 15th edition of this invitational tournament, Goa lost three games in a row. Next, they were drawn to play Chemplast, the Chennai-based champions who had three India players – Bharat Arun, Bharath Reddy and Arshad Ayub – and two junior internationals, Myluahanan Senthilnathan and R Shyamsunder. Who did Goa have? “We had a talented bunch of young players with only a couple of us having Ranji Trophy experience,” said captain Hemant Angle. Except for Angle himself and Dayanand Bangera – unbeaten 120 against Air India in the previous game – the others were between the ages of 18 and 21. It was the captain who impressed upon the team management to give the juniors a try. So after two narrow misses against Air India and State Bank of India, captained by Binny, Goa were up against the might of Chemplast. It wasn’t such an encouraging start for Goa as Abdul Jabbar and Divakar Vasu put on 60 runs for the first wicket. This looked like another addition to the mounting losses, until Ferdinand Coelho provided the breakthrough. Ferdi, as he was popularly called, picked up three crucial top-order wickets with a disciplined line and length. Then, leg spinner Dinesh Rao worked his magic with three wickets for seven runs (4-0-7-3) as Goa did well to get the Chennai-based champions all out for 193. “I was delighted with the performance against Chemplast, a top side in those days. It was my first big performance,” said Rao, then just 20. Word had spread that Goan youngsters were measuring up to the challenges in the Arlem Trophy, so a sizeable crowd gathered at the Rajendra Prasad stadium in Margao. When it was Goa’s turn to go out and bat, there was no space for more spectators to join. The fans, though, were disappointed. Goa lost their first wicket with just 16 runs on the board. When they reached 50, three wickets had fallen; four runs later, it was five. With the hosts reeling at 118-8, young wicket-keeper Jude Cardozo went out to bat. “It looked like it was all over. I was the number 10 batsman and joined Sandeep Dhuri in the middle. He was in brilliant form, playing like someone who had potential to represent India,” said Cardozo. Dhuri never gave up, telling his teammate to not worry too much, take a single and let him do the rest. “I always played with passion, always to win,” said Dhuri, now based in UAE. “There was this belief within me that I could win matches, regardless of what happens at the other end. When we lost wickets at regular intervals, my belief was intact.” It was this belief that helped Dhuri turn the match on its head. The allrounder hit eight boundaries and took the score to 181. But as the tenth wicket partnership reached 63 and Dhuri was batting on 76, he was run out, trying to take a risky second. Shoulders drooped again. Now it was left to the last pair of Cardozo and Sandesh Desai to score the remaining 13 runs. Exposing the last man to some quality bowling from the opponents was risky, so Cardozo preferred twos, wherever possible, or a single from the last ball of the over. In the final over, Desai couldn’t avoid strike. He was yet to score. Three runs were needed from the last two balls as the experienced Arun took charge. He bowled quick, but an overpitched delivery saw Desai guide the ball to the boundary, much to the delight of the home crowd. “All of them ran on to the ground and mobbed us. I couldn’t believe my eyes. We were used to playing matches with 50-100 people watching us. On that day, there were 3,000 to 4,000 of them,” said Cardozo, who was unbeaten on 23. Dhuri soon left for the gulf as cricket wasn’t profitable enough in Goa. He played several good knocks, won plenty of trophies, but that win more than 30 years ago remains etched in memory. “I played a lot of cricket and have had so many unbelievable victories. This one though is special,” said Dhuri. TEAM Dayanand Bangera, Balkrishna Misquin, Sandeep Naik, Ferdinand Coelho, Sandeep Dhuri, Sanjay Dhuri, Hemant Angle (captain), Nitin Vernekar, Dinesh Rao, Jude Cardozo and Sandesh Desai BRIEF SCORES Chemplast, 193 in 38.5 overs (PS Moses 50, A Jabbar 35, Ayub 32; Dinesh Rao 3-7, Ferdinand Coelho 3-23, Nitin Vernekar 2-28) lost to Goa 195-9 in 44.5 overs (Sandeep Dhuri 76, Jude Cardozo 23*; Ayub 4-21)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/twist-in-the-tail-when-goa-snatched-a-win-from-the-jaws-of-defeat/articleshow/85547812.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Barringtonia acutangula, a freshwater mangrove, was observed to be very prominent at all locations except at location 6,” the report said. “A few water bodies have been observed which most probably are used for irrigation of the adjoining agricultural land. There is also the presence of freshwater mangroves along the proposed Western Bypass at the inspected sites,” the report observed. The joint site inspection was conducted by GSWA and Goa State Biodiversity Board personnel on water bodies around the site of the bypass, which will go through the villages of Seraulim, Benaulim and Varca. After the visit, the data was cross-referred with a CSIR-NIO study on wetlands in Goa. The team also observed prominent biodiversity in and around the inspected areas. The team was accompanied by representatives of the technical support group who are preparing the people's biodiversity register in the village panchayat of Cana-Benaulim. The prominent floral species observed include barringtonia acutangula, samanea saman, sida acuta, sedge grass, reed grass, needle grass, hydrilla sp, cayratia trifolia, cucurbit asp, salvinia sp, colocasia sp, pennisetum sp grass, cassia tora, brachiaria spp grass, ricinus cummunis, polygonum sp, oryza sp, Cyperus sp, lymnohila sp, scirpus sp grass and cocos nucifera. In accordance with NGT directives, the state has constituted a 10-member committee to prepare and execute a plan of action for the construction of the remainder of the bypass through Benaulim and Seraulim, and the report has been placed before the committee.

---||Goa||Group of senior citizens write to Nitin Gadkari over ‘illegal’ highway work at Bambolim, furnish RTI details||PANAJI: A group of senior citizens from a colony at Bambolim have written to Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari complaining about irregularities in the ongoing highway expansion work at Bambolim. The elderly residents of Palmar Colony have alleged that the present work is a deviation from the original highway expansion plan on the stretch. The altered plan is illegal and has been causing severe inconvenience to the colony residents, most of whom are elderly, the senior citizens have told the Union minister. The colony is located near the Goa Medical College Complex, Bambolim. “In constructing 4-lane highway; EPC contractor and consultant have encroached the existing St Cruz-Bambolim MDR road reducing the width of this road from 8 to 4.5m. Hence the traffic from St Cruz-Bambolim Goa Medical College, particularly ambulance traffic, is passing through our private residential colony road which creates nuisance and unsafe condition to the residents,” the senior citizens have said in the representation. The residents said that the ill-planned highway work and changes were made with the ulterior motive to safeguard the interest of one person who owns a structure on this road stretch. The senior citizens have also submitted documents procured under RTI to prove their claims. The original approved plan involved providing a vehicular overpass, but was changed to vehicular underpass by the consultant and contractor to safeguard the interest of a private commercial building, which has made this junction a death trap zone, they stated. The contractor and consultant have gone ahead with the construction of the vehicular underpass by changing the scope of work without approval of the appropriate authority, the residents alleged. “The contractor and consultant started the work on January 4, 2021, even before the preliminary approval and as per the admission given in writing by the consultant. The final approval with financial implication, if any, is still awaited by PWD, who have not yet submitted the file to the ministry of road transport and highway, and no procedure pertaining to scope of change of work as per the contract agreement is followed (as per information collected under RTI),” they stated. The contractor has also excavated side of the present highway road to a depth of nearly 12-15m to extract earth to use for filling of the highway road project and has left this excavated stretch in a dangerous condition, locals said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/group-of-senior-citizens-write-to-gadkari-over-illegal-highway-work-at-bambolim-furnish-rti-details/articleshow/85548039.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

When Kuddi panch Guru Velip visited the secluded spot he found some workers at the construction site where material was dumped. After the workers were not ready to disclose the name of the owner, nor the type of project, Velip ordered them to stop the work and demanded to see the licence for the work which they couldn't produce. Velip said that a few coconut trees have been felled which were obstructing the structure being built. He said that the work was carried out at a faster pace to take advantage of the weekend. Velip informed the Khola village panchayat sarpanch Purna Nayak of the issue who said she was not aware of any illegal construction but said that she had been intimated of the issue by the area panch Guru Velip. She also said that no no-objection certificate (NOC) has been issued to such a project and that she will stop the work if there are no legal documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/work-at-cabo-de-rama-stopped-as-workers-fail-to-produce-licence/articleshow/85548089.cms||---
---||India||60 Afghans, including 23 Hindus and Sikhs, among 400 airlifted||While India’s evacuation efforts in Afghanistan continued to focus on its own nationals, among the close to 400 people flown to India on Sunday were also about 60 Afghans, including 23 Sikhs and Hindus. With many people, including foreigners, now seeking help from India in their bid to exit Afghanistan, the Centre has deployed a team of diplomats and defence ministry officials at the Kabul airport to coordinate evacuation efforts with the US and other countries facilitating the exercise. The 60 Afghans, including two lawmakers Anarkali Honaryar and Narender Singh Khalsa, were brought out amid reports that the Taliban were not allowing locals to leave the country. India had earlier assured Afghan nationals, including members of minority communities, with ties to it that it would prioritise visas for them and set up an emergency e-visa service for them. Afghanistan crisis: Live updatesAn Afghan woman evacuee, who touched down in India with her daughter and two grandchildren, told ANI, “The Taliban burnt down my house. I thank India for helping us.” “India is our second home. Even if we are Afghans and live in that country, people often call us Hindustanis. I thank India for extending its helping hand,” Khalsa told reporters at the Hindon airbase, according to PTI. “I feel like crying. Everything is finished. It is a very difficult and painful decision to leave the country. Everything has been snatched away,” a visibly despondent Khalsa said. “They (Taliban) separated us from others while going to Kabul airport yesterday (Saturday) as we were Afghan nationals. We fled from there because small children were with us,” he said. Honaryar said, “I thank India, PM Modi, the ministry of external affairs and the Indian Air Force for lifting us from Kabul and saving my life.” Evacuees from Kabul (left) wait for their documents to be verified after landing at the Indian Air Force base at Hindon in Ghaziabad on Sunday. Alladad Qureshi, an Afghan national whose wife hails from Kashmir, expressed a sense of relief as he interacted with media at Hindon. Manik Mandal, a jeweller who had gone to Afghanistan six months ago in search of livelihood, smiled as he said, “We faced a lot of problems in Kabul, but our government saved us.” After the chaotic scenes witnessed at the US-controlled airport, Reuters reported from Kabul on Sunday that the Taliban had managed to restore some order outside the airport by making sure people formed queues outside the main gates and by not allowing crowds to gather at the perimeter. A Taliban spokesperson was quoted as saying the group was working to provide “smooth exit” to people. The return of Indian diplomats and other officials to Kabul in a military aircraft comes barely a week after India withdrew all diplomatic personnel from Afghanistan. The withdrawal of all 192 diplomatic staff members from Afghanistan saw some criticism as the Taliban repeatedly assured all diplomats in Kabul that they were not going to face any security threat. The Taliban spokesperson in Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, had told TOI that it didn’t want India to recall its diplomats. According to media reports from Kabul, the Taliban even escorted Indian diplomats and others to the airport last week to facilitate their evacuation. Junior foreign minister V Muraleedharan was quoted as saying on Sunday that there were around 500 people stranded in Afghanistan “as per the preliminary estimation” and that evacuation was taking place in a “flawless manner”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/60-afghans-including-23-hindus-and-sikhs-among-400-airlifted/articleshow/85550394.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu theatres reopen today after 4 months, but fans may have to wait for big picture||CHENNAI: Patrons get ready to flock cinema houses from Monday following the government’s nod to reopen them, but only a few of the 1,000-odd theatres in Tamil Nadu may be ready to welcome them as most producers want to wait for a week to gauge audiences’ response before they go the whole hog. Though several Tamil films are waiting to hit the screens, producers are not sure about viewers behavioúr due to Covid-19 fears. Most theatres wanted to play it safe with low investment bets like Akshay Kumar’s ‘Bell Bottom’ and the Tamil dubbed version of Hollywood’s ‘Conjuring 3’, but after several multiplex chains decided to restart operations from Friday (August 27) instead of Monday, the Tamil Nadu theatrical release of those two films too have been postponed. “Theatre owners and distributors are happy that the government has finally permitted them to resume business after four months. There are enough films available for release and there is no problem with content,” Tirupur M Subramaniam, president, Tamil Nadu Theatre and Multiplex Owner’s Association, told TOI. But theatre owners and distributors wanted time to finalize the line up of films for release. As the state government’s announcement came on Saturday, the industry hardly had two days to prepare and plan and there was confusion till Sunday evening. Multiplexes in city to reopen on FridayBy late on Sunday afternoon, multiplexes decided to postpone the reopening to Friday, citing lack of time for cleaning the premises and preparing for implementing the SOPs stipulated by the state government. The SOPs include all staff to be vaccinated, 50% occupancy, maintaining social distance, and temperature checks for audience and staff. “The first big week of Tamil film releases could be September 10 weekend for Vinayaka Chathurthi,” said a source in the industry. “Releases normally happen during Thursdays/Fridays to attract the weekend crowd. Hence most theatres across Tamil Nadu have preferred to wait for August 27,” says distributor G Srinivasan of S Picture. “For more than 110 days, we have been asking government to permit us to reopen theatres. Now that the government has done its research and due diligence to open, it will be naive not to reopen,” said C T Valliappan, director, Kamala Cinemas. “We are opening tomorrow (Monday). Yes, it will be a struggle for the initial 15-20 days. But that is the reality of this business and we have to face it,” Valliappan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-theatres-reopen-today-after-4-months-but-fans-may-have-to-wait-for-big-picture/articleshow/85550416.cms||D Govardan
---||Nagpur||Turf war intensifies at Ganga Jamuna with rival camps nearly close to clash||Nagpur: Two groups of social and political activists nearly came to blows on Sunday over the closure of the red-light area (Ganga Jamuna) and the police barricading the place. Cops had to act as a buffer on the Ganga Jamuna Cement Road to avoid a clash, a situation somewhat like the one in 2015, to stop prostitution. Traffic of one side of the road remained affected for more than a couple of hours with police tackling the rival groups. NCP’s urban cell president Jwala Dhote residents, sex workers of Ganga Jamuna and Abha Pande, state general secretary of the party, raised slogans against each other’s campaigns divided by their objectives over operations of the brothels. Dhote, representing sex workers and residents of Ganga Jamuna, had gone to the red-light area to observe rakshabandhan, following in the footsteps of her late father Jambuwantrao Dhote, a firebrand activist who supported the rights of sex workers. This was Dhote’s second visit at the locality after August 15 when she forcibly removed the barricades put up by the police on August 11 to stop visitors from entering the lanes lined up with brothels. Pande, an independent corporator from the adjacent locality, too, reached the spot with her supporters. She claimed to have reached the locality to tie rakhis to cops deployed at Ganga Jamuna. The drama unfolded when Dhote, along with residents and sex workers from Ganga Jamuna, set foot on Cement road where her group was nearly confronted by Pande and her supporters. While Ganga Jamuna residents rallied behind Dhote, Pande’s supporters raised slogans in support of police action to close down the place. Dhote said the economically weak sex workers cannot approach the court every time to seek justice against the police highhandedness. “Ganga Jamuna’s red light area is thriving here since the last 300 years, much before the adjoining residential areas came into being. Police are only seeing the inconvenience of the wealthy class,” said Dhote, adding, “sex workers too are citizens of India, tax payers and are constitutionally free in a democratic society.” Pande stressed on the removal of Ganga Jamuna’s red light area but vowed to extend all possible help to the sex workers if they seek rehabilitation. “Residents of the adjoining localities are hassled due to anti-social activities and criminal elements apart from societal embarrassment every day,” said Pande. Social activist and NCP’s city spokesperson Nutan Rewatkar, who was part of the 2015 agitation for the rights of sex workers and even rescued several minors from brothels with the help of the police, said rehabilitation must be done as per their needs and not by force. Zonal DCP Lohit Matani said police would take legal actions against both the rival parties for violating government orders. “Some barricades were removed but put back after the agitation,” he said. “We will start a one-window scheme for helping red-light area residents and sex workers,” he added.

---||Nagpur||‘If Ganga Jamuna is shut down, sex workers will disperse across Nagpur’||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) city urban cell president Jwala Dhote, daughter of former Member of Parliament late Jambuwantrao Dhote, has come forward to champion the cause of female sex workers residing in the three-century old red-light area of Ganga Jamuna. Dhote, who is also president of Vidarbha Anyay Nivaran Samiti, explains why she took up the fight on behalf of the sex workers after the city police decided to shut down the red-light area. Excerpts...Q. What motivated you to take up the agitation to protest closure of the red-light area of Ganga Jamuna?A. There is no dearth of support for the white-collar section of society and the upper class but no one likes to talk about the oppressed and deprived lot which did not choose prostitution for fun but due to some unavoidable circumstances. In our country, prostitution is not legalized but the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 372 and 373 do not categorize it as a ‘crime’ too. Sex workers are citizens of India, they pay taxes and exercise their franchise to choose the government. The Supreme Court too has directed governments to provide dry ration and monetary benefits to sex workers but the police are robbing them of their livelihoods. Q. Illegal activities are allegedly going on inside the red-light area. A. I am opposed to pushing minors into prostitution, illegal activities like bootlegging, gambling and other criminal activities. It’s the duty of police to stop the illegal activities but they cannot cordon off the entire area and starve the poor families staying inside. Around 80% of the prostitutes are on medications and they cannot be pushed to death. Q. Why do you think police took this drastic decision to close the area?A. My friends in media have told me that a builders’ lobby backed by BJP is behind the move. They are eyeing this land in the central part of the city. Also, police abruptly started closing down the area maybe to divert people’s attention from the crime rate in the city, especially the increase in the number of murders. If Ganga Jamuna is shut down, then sex workers will disperse across the city. This might aggravate the problem. Q. Police are also acting as facilitator and trying to help rehabilitate the sex workers.A. Rehabilitation is not a police subject and outside their jurisdiction. They are simply encroaching upon a domain basically of the collector and guardian minister. Whether local bodies or the governments, everyone is experiencing budgetary constraints. Educated and skilled youths are jobless and you are talking about rehabilitating sex workers for which you have a budget? Q. You and your party colleague Abha Pande are now in the opposite camps over the issue?A. The politicians, activists and local residents must know and understand that it was Ganga Jamuna which came first and then the surrounding localities were set up later. Politicians who had no qualms in approaching these sex workers for vote are now opposing them. Rajya Sabha member Vandana Chavan of my party has appreciated my work but my NCP colleague is agitating along with the BJP leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/if-ganga-jamuna-is-shut-down-sex-workers-will-disperse-across-city/articleshow/85546298.cms||Soumitra Bose

Not sure? Tune in to the local FM radio when you are there and bask in unadulterated music and masti along with chaste Sanskrit greeting by the radio jockey (RJ). In a first-of-its-kind initiative, RJs at Radio 90 FM have been given training to speak in Sanskrit. These RJs fluently dish out Sanskrit words to entertain the listeners. Dr Rajiv Gupta, managing director of Sardar Sarovar Nigam Ltd (SSNL), celebrating World Sanskrit Day on Sunday said, ‘World’s oldest language and India’s pride, Sanskrit, is a copious treasure of knowledge and gained worldwide respect.” He tweeted that under the inspiration of PM Narendra Modi at the Statue of Unity, 15 men and women guides and radio jockeys speak impeccable Sanskrit after diligent training. The RJs including three from tribal community have been trained in speaking Sanskrit language over last few months. “We had trained the tour guides in speaking Sanskrit earlier. Out of them, we picked up four of them including three women and gave them further training on how to talk like a RJ in Sanskrit and entertain the audiences while giving out information about SoU and other tourist attractions here,” said a SoU spokesperson. As of now, RJ Neelam Tadvi, RJ Ganga Tadvi, RJ Guru Tadvi and RJ Hetal Patel, all residents of Kevadia, are radio jockeying in Sanskrit and they are enjoying it too. PM Narendra Modi had also last week spoken about these RJ tribal women and said, ‘The talent and abilities of tribal women in our villages is impressive. I congratulate my tribal daughters as they acquired expertise in such less time and gave a professional touch.’ SoU spokesperson said that the Sanskrit speaking RJs were given special training in handling the radio equipment, using the software as well as hardware in the studio. They were also taught voice modulation and how to keep their audiences hooked to the radio.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/at-sou-fm-radio-belts-out-music-and-masti-in-sanskrit/articleshow/85544308.cms||---

The victim finally escaped by leaping off the window of her employer’s house and seeking asylum at the Indian embassy. On Friday, the woman reached Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), the relief of returning back to homeland writ large on her face. Nimisha (name changed) was born and raised in Bagalur, Bengaluru Urban, and supported her family, including elderly parents and three young siblings, by working as a domestic help in the locality. But the Covid crisis left her unemployed and she struggled to support her family and buy medicines for her parents. Then she came across someone she thought was a godsend: Aisha from Goripalya, an illegal agent, who promised to place her as a domestic help in Abu Dhabi for a monthly pay of Rs 30,000. “For someone who was struggling to make ends meet in Bengaluru, the offer was enticing. So, she accepted it and flew to UAE,” said PN Nagendra Babu, an officer attached to the Office of Protector of Emigrants, Bengaluru, who received Nimisha at the KIA. On landing in Abu Dhabi, Nimisha was received by a Sri Lankan agent, identified as Ajmal, who drove her to her employer, an Emirati family. But what awaited the Bengaluru woman was non-stop work, including cleaning, washing, and gardening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/toiling-sans-pay-in-uae-woman-flees-embassy-helps-her-return/articleshow/85550447.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Goa||Creating constituency-centric manifesto for 2022 polls: Goa Forward Party||PANAJI: Goa Forward Party is visiting constituencies to understand the aspirations of locals, which in turn will be used to prepare a constituency-centric manifesto for the 2022 state assembly elections, its president Vijai Sardesai said on Sunday. Sardesai, who visited St Andre on Sunday, said that open defecation continues to occur in the constituency. “We are meeting people so that we can prepare a constituency-centric manifesto. We will take a review of what has to be done, and where the constituency is lagging behind,” Sardesai said. GFP functionaries said that St Andre locals want basic facilities, employment opportunities, a proper village market, panchayat office and a good football ground. “There are many problems in this constituency, be it electricity or others. Hence, we are meeting them to know their problems and draft our manifesto as per the people’s wish,” said Jagdish Bhobe, who is being projected by GFP as the candidate for the constituency. Sardesai spent the day in St Andre with working president Kiran Kandolkar, general secretary Durgadas Kamat, joint secretary John Nazareth, and Bhobe. The former deputy chief minister said that St Andre MLA Francis Silveira has failed to improve the lives of the people. “People elect us so we can provide facilities to people,” Sardesai said. “But here in St Andre, people don’t possess toilets, and hence are forced to go in the open. This proves that development has not taken place here, and the MLA switched parties for personal benefits and personal development. It also proves that the open-defecation free status declared by CM Pramod Sawant is a fraud,” Sardesai said. He said that BJP will be reduced to single digits in the assembly elections, but if opposition parties do not unite, BJP could win more than 10 constituencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/creating-constituency-centric-manifesto-for-2022-polls-gfp/articleshow/85548496.cms||---

---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha sculptor’s grandson building a ‘second Konark’||The sound of chisels chipping away at stones has dimmed but not faded away. In this workshop in Lingipur, on the outskirts of Bhubaneshwar, 68-year-old Antaryami Mangaraj is carving out a giant wheel at a brisk pace. He has a dream to chase. He wants to make up for the lost time during the lockdown and complete his guruji’s mission. Smitesh Mohapatra too is chasing the same dream. He has taken it upon himself to complete a mission that his grandfather, eminent sculptor and Rajya Sabha MP Raghunath Mohapatra, had embarked upon before Covid snuffed his life out in May this year —to build a replica of the Sun Temple in Konark. He named it the Aditya Narayan (another name of the sun) Temple. Smitesh at his workshop Mohapatra, who passed away at the age of 78, had conceived the idea in 2013, pained by the damage to the 13th century temple over the centuries. Since then, till he succumbed to the virus, he acquired 100-acre land near Puri, laid the foundation stone and set up the Raghunath Mohapatra Arts and Crafts Foundation that oversees sculpting work and the Aditya Narayan Trust to carry out construction and other necessary work. The replica will be built 30 km from the original Sun Temple in Konark, between Sakhigopal and Puri, a site chosen by Mohapatra, a Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan awardee whose creations include the six-feet-tall graystone statue of sun god at Central Hall of Parliament and Rajiv Lochan, lotus sculpted on black granite at Rajiv Gandhi samadhi, Vir Bhumi, in Delhi. “The Konark Sun Temple is an architectural marvel but unfortunately, more than 70% of it has been damaged. My grandfather visualised the majestic structure and attempted to recreate it. I will try to complete it,” said Smitesh, a 23-year-old management graduate and a sculptor. While work on the project slowed down considerably after the pandemic broke, sculptors have already created two wheels and a sidewall. The replica is being built with sandstone and black granite, stones used in the original Sun Temple. Smitesh, who learnt the skill from Raghunath Mohapatra, is still under the shock of losing his grandfather, his father Josabanto and uncle Prashant within a span of just 12 days. He says while they were the three pillars of the institution working on the project, he now has a big responsibility on his shoulder. “The second Konark project is an enormous task. As legend goes, 800 years ago, 1,200 sculptors worked for 12 years to complete the temple. Despite advanced technology, we will require a large number of skilled sculptors,” said Smitesh. While Mohapatra had estimated the cost of building the replica at Rs 300 crore in 2017, Smitesh said the cost would escalate with time. “There are people across the globe who would come forward to donate. The temple would require no help from either Centre or state governments,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/odisha-sculptors-grandson-building-a-second-konark/articleshow/85550477.cms||Minati Singha

The bypoll was necessitated by the death of AIADMK Rajya Sabha member A Mohammedjan in March this year. A former DMK youth wing functionary, Abdullah is a young and upcoming DMK leader from Tirumayam in Pudukottai district. He was made the joint secretary of the party’s NRI welfare wing in January. By nominating Abdullah to fill the vacancy created by the death of Mohammedjan, the DMK has opted to nominate a Muslim candidate to retain minority support. Mohammedjan was elected to RS in July 2019 and his term was to end in 2025. With the DMK having a majority on its own, Abdullah will likely be elected unopposed to the Upper House and will be in term for the next four years. “Abdullah is active on social media and is close to the young family members of our party president (Stalin). He is Udhayanidhi’s choice,” said a source in the DMK.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-m-m-abdullah-is-dmks-candidate-for-rs-bypoll/articleshow/85550503.cms||---

They said a recent probe into the granting of MBBS seats to Kashmiri students by institutions in Pakistan indicates that the money collected from aspirants by some organisations which were part of the Hurriyat Conference conglomerate was being used for funding terror organisations in the union territory. The officials said both the factions of the Hurriyat are likely to be banned under Section 3(1) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), under which “if the Central government is of opinion that any association is, or has become, an unlawful association, it may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare such association to be unlawful.” They said the proposal was mooted in accordance with the Centre's policy of zero tolerance against terrorism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/both-hurriyat-factions-may-be-banned-under-uapa-officials/articleshow/85550518.cms||---
---||Goa||Coordination body fails to overhaul Cong organisation||Panaji: Seven months after a coordination committee was appointed to steer Congress back on track, the party remains adrift like a rudderless ship in Goa. The twin objectives of overhauling the local leadership and launching a digital membership drive have run aground as the party rank and file prepare for the 2022 electoral battle. The coordination committee was tasked with strengthening the party through a membership drive but those attempts yielded no result, (one official reason being the pandemic). Last week, AICC appointed a new ‘membership facilitator’ Rajesh Griglani to take charge of the grounded membership drive. On February 5, Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao had announced that the coordination committee would outline the strategy to reconstitute Congress’ Goa unit including some “hard decisions” but party MLAs and workers now point out that Rao’s role as the desk in -harge has itself come under a cloud. In Mid-January, AICC appointed a 16-member state coordination committee to improve the party’s membership and to reconstitute the party. Headed by chairman Ramakant Khalap and co-chairman Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, the coordination committee formed eight sub committees to oversee the membership drive in five constituencies each. “We had worked out a plan with meetings in all 40 constituencies. Way back in July we had chalked out the schedule and given it to Rao. The roadmap was prepared to strengthen the party,” Khalap said. Party functionaries said the strategy included workshops to hear out the party workers, but they were never held due to uncertainty over the restructuring process. The plan was also not shared with the state Congress’ executive committee. “Nothing has happened, there is no outcome of the coordination committee. We have not even held meetings recently,” said vice president Sankalp Amonkar who is a part of one of the eight sub committees. Party office bearers and supporters are now looking forward to former union minister and AICC election observer P Chidambaram’s arrival. “The hope is that Chidambaram will be able to come and pull some sort of rabbit out of a hat and create some enthusiasm in the people,” said one of the party’s chief spokespersons in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coordination-body-fails-to-overhaul-cong-organisation/articleshow/85548577.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

EDITED Times News Network Vasco: The ‘Church Square Project’ a dream project of Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida is ready to be tendered. The project is aimed at easing heavy traffic at the St Andrew’s church junction. Speaking to Vasco residents at a briefing held at Ravindra Bhavan, Almeida said, “The junction is an entry point to the city. And with traffic coming in from all four sides, it often results in traffic jams. The Church Square Project has been designed in a way that will ease the movement of traffic. School buses will have a separate for entry and exit to St Andrew’s school. The road will be widened within the available area without acquisition.” This will be phase one of the project. The second phase will focus on easing pedestrian movement. In this phase, a circle will be built on top, attached with elevators which will be used for crossing. The project is slated to be undertaken at a cost of Rs 7-8 crore. Almeida also spoke about obtaining blue flag certification for Baina beach. “I have approached the district Collector and I am hopeful that he will soon appoint committees to monitor and work for the certification,” he said. Confederation of Indian Industry - Goa Council chairman Atul Jadhav said that this certification will make the city a tourist hotspot, thus boosting business. Clearing misunderstanding on toll fees, Almeida said, “People are under the misconception that they will have to pay toll fee on the National Highway at Baina, but these fees will have to be paid only by vehicles going to the Port area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vascos-church-square-project-ready-to-be-tendered/articleshow/85548597.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Sikhs wake up late to the loss of religious heritage||JALANDHAR/AMRITSAR: Who replaces historical frescoes with bathroom tiles? A whole lot more has happened as Sikh heritage has been destroyed in the name of modernisation. Once again, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee has come under fire for entrusting the preservation of Sikh heritage and art to the kar sewa (volunteer service) groups, who have mostly turned out to be its expert destroyers. The fight to save Guru Ramdas Sarai and the ‘bungas’ of Darbar Sahib from demolition sums up the obliteration of Sikh heritage by the Sikhs themselves in the last few decades. It also reflects the desperation of common Sikhs to save whatever little is left, even if not very old or linked to the Gurus. The sarai (inn) is 90 years old and the underground bunga (a general term for tunnel-like dwelling place built around centres of Sikh pilgrimage by the conquering chiefs or other prominent Sikhs) was the house of Giani Sant Singh, the head granthi of Darbar Sahib in the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Gianiji supervised gold plating of the sanctum sanctorum and his descendants lived in the ‘bunga’ until the plaza project acquired it. The offline and online outrage against the proposed demolition of Sikh historical structures is a new trend on this side of the Radcliffe Line. Nature and time razed many heritage pillars without much resistance, even as some noted Sikh intellectuals raised their voice. If those razing history were callous, the masses were indifferent. As antiquity was replaced with marble and glazed tiles, little difference remained between historical and other gurdwaras. In west Punjab, the old Sikh shrines might be neglected but haven’t disappeared altogether. In east Punjab, these came under the hammer in the name of ‘sewa’, under the SGPC’s watch since its opponents have been unorganised. SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur faced criticism for agreeing to demolish Guru Ramdas Sarai but much of this destruction of heritage has gone on long before she took the office. “The community has woken up late,” explains history professor Gurdarshan Singh Dhillon, formerly of Panjab University. “Already, important structures and signs of our history have been destroyed on the pretext of kar sewa. Only the British, when they annexed Punjab used to erase symbols of the Sikh empire like this,” he adds. The professor claims that even after the Independence, the Sikh heritage lay ignored. “No other community has treated its heritage like this. Any new construction should be kept off the historical sites. Not money or ignorance but design is behind demolition, else it isn’t possible to ignore public sentiment. The bullet marks of Operation Bluestar are gone in just 37 years but, just a few yards away, those of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre remain even after 100.” The artful destroyers The chance discovery of an old jora ghar near the Golden Temple by the diggers of Baba Kashmir Singh Bhuriwale’s kar sewa group has brought unskilful handling of Sikh heritage back into question. Baldev Singh Wadala’s Sikh Sadbhavana Dal confronted the SGPC and the kar sewa group, accusing them of “erasing the last bits of Sikh heritage”, and called for the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to investigate. The ASI reported to the district administration that the remains were of a heritage structure and recommended preservation. The SGPC was reluctant, so the Sadbhavana Dal launched a movement to build pressure in favour of preservation. The Dal also took on the SGPC for its proposal to demolishing the oldest existing Sikh sarai, Guru Ram Das Niwas, founded in 1931. Hailing the concept of kar sewa in Sikhism, former head of Guru Nanak Dev University’s Guru Ram Das School of Planning, Balwinder Singh, says: “It should be supervised by conservation specialists instead of regular architects.” When asked whether the SGPC had preserved the Sikh heritage properly, he replied in calculated words: “It depends on the head of the organisation. The previous SGPCs had preserved the frescos and other art.” The Sikh heritage is being destroyed in the name of modernisation. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, as then Punjab minister for archives and museums, had expressed concern over building concrete structures at Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur and Pakistan’s Naorwal for the Kartarpur Corridor. He had even sent a missive to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, suggesting that the sites associated with Sikhism’s founder, Guru Nanak Dev, be declared heritage villages and the antiquity of Dera Baba Nanak and Kartarpur Sahib be preserved. The earlier SGPCs had resisted the local pressure to hand over the Dera Baba Nanak gurdwara to Kar Sewa Wale Baba, while Sangat Langah Kartarpur had resisted the demolition of a 1744 gurdwara. The then SGPC chief secretary, Roop Singh, had denied those plans but accepted that surveyors had taken some photographs. The local sangat claimed it wanted to preserve the heritage structure of the building with a mix of modernism. The sangat in Tarn Taran had also objected to how centuries-old ‘Darshani Deodi’ was demolished partly. A major portion of the 200-year-old hand paintings of the life history of Guru Nanak Dev had vanished from a 40-metre-high, nine-storey, octagonal structure at Gurdwara Atal Rai Sahib due to weathering and neglect. Realising the significance of expert handling of frescoes, tukri, and gatch work quite late, the SGPC hired experts when much of the damage was already done. Sikh heritage panel soughtIn April 2019, senior advocate H S Phoolka requested Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh to form a Sikh heritage commission of experts for the restoration and repair of the historical buildings. The jathedar promised to consult the SGPC and the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC). A few other Sikh groups also pushed for preserving the marks of Operation Bluestar and the riots of 1984. Architectural marvelNear Anandpur Sahib at Kiratpur Sahib, Baba Gurdita Ji Da Dehra, stood on a hillock like an architectural marvel. This old structure built using Nanakshahi bricks had beautiful brickwork patterns even on its floor. The Dehra has minarets which had rare jaali made using these small bricks. However all this craftsmanship of yesteryears was covered with marble and cement close even as around two decades back for once then SGPC secretary Dr Gurbachan SIngh Bachan had got the work stopped after he came to know about it. Now the brick work is hardly visible at this Dehra. Bathroom tiles replace frescoesA 1992 kar sewa had replaced the priceless historic frescoes of Gurdwara Atal Rai Sahib with bathroom tiles. American Sikh Council (ASC) advised the SGPC to have its own team of archaeologists to avoid blunders of this sort. An ASC spokesperson, who didn’t wish to give his name because of policy matters, said: “The SGPC should have a permanent, highly educated, professional staff of heritage conservationists, who are vigilant about saving the structures where Sikh blood was spilt.” Alleging that the SGPC seems to operate more like “a typical corrupt enterprise run by incompetent men”, the spokesperson said: “Even the common Sikhs of Punjab have lost their moral compass and the courage to speak up.” ASC looks after 74 gurdwaras. Protests started only in 2018Resentment among the Sikhs over self-obliteration of their heritage didn’t show much till September 14, 2018, when for the first time they dared to stop the SGPC and Baba Jagtar Singh Kar Sewa Wale from demolishing the 16th-century Darshani Deodhi at Tarn Taran. Founded by Guru Arjan Dev and completed during the Sikh empire three centuries later, it was a rare living example of the old engineering, architectural aesthetics, craftsmanship, and frescoes (wall paintings). Ten days later, DSGMC was also forbidden to break Gurdwara Rakabganj with the help of the Bhuriwale kar sewa group that had been told to keep off Guru Ram Das Sarai in Amritsar. On September 23, Sikhs gathered there and threatened to start a morcha. In that case and now in the matter of bungas, social media helped build public opinion.

---||Ludhiana||Sikhs wake up late to the loss of religious heritage||JALANDHAR/AMRITSAR: Who replaces historical frescoes with bathroom tiles? A whole lot more has happened as Sikh heritage has been destroyed in the name of modernisation. Once again, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee has come under fire for entrusting the preservation of Sikh heritage and art to the kar sewa (volunteer service) groups, who have mostly turned out to be its expert destroyers. The fight to save Guru Ramdas Sarai and the ‘bungas’ of Darbar Sahib from demolition sums up the obliteration of Sikh heritage by the Sikhs themselves in the last few decades. It also reflects the desperation of common Sikhs to save whatever little is left, even if not very old or linked to the Gurus. The sarai (inn) is 90 years old and the underground bunga (a general term for tunnel-like dwelling place built around centres of Sikh pilgrimage by the conquering chiefs or other prominent Sikhs) was the house of Giani Sant Singh, the head granthi of Darbar Sahib in the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Gianiji supervised gold plating of the sanctum sanctorum and his descendants lived in the ‘bunga’ until the plaza project acquired it. The offline and online outrage against the proposed demolition of Sikh historical structures is a new trend on this side of the Radcliffe Line. Nature and time razed many heritage pillars without much resistance, even as some noted Sikh intellectuals raised their voice. If those razing history were callous, the masses were indifferent. As antiquity was replaced with marble and glazed tiles, little difference remained between historical and other gurdwaras. In west Punjab, the old Sikh shrines might be neglected but haven’t disappeared altogether. In east Punjab, these came under the hammer in the name of ‘sewa’, under the SGPC’s watch since its opponents have been unorganised. SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur faced criticism for agreeing to demolish Guru Ramdas Sarai but much of this destruction of heritage has gone on long before she took the office. “The community has woken up late,” explains history professor Gurdarshan Singh Dhillon, formerly of Panjab University. “Already, important structures and signs of our history have been destroyed on the pretext of kar sewa. Only the British, when they annexed Punjab used to erase symbols of the Sikh empire like this,” he adds. The professor claims that even after the Independence, the Sikh heritage lay ignored. “No other community has treated its heritage like this. Any new construction should be kept off the historical sites. Not money or ignorance but design is behind demolition, else it isn’t possible to ignore public sentiment. The bullet marks of Operation Bluestar are gone in just 37 years but, just a few yards away, those of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre remain even after 100.” The artful destroyers The chance discovery of an old jora ghar near the Golden Temple by the diggers of Baba Kashmir Singh Bhuriwale’s kar sewa group has brought unskilful handling of Sikh heritage back into question.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu BJP ex-chief L Ganesan named Manipur governor||CHENNAI: Veteran BJP leader and the party’s former Rajya Sabha MP L Ganesan has been appointed as the governor of Manipur. Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit congratulated Ganesan and extended his best wishes for “a glorious service to the people of Manipur”. Chief minister M K Stalin greeted Ganesan over phone, said an official press release. “A principled leader with a long experience, Ganesan had the affection of Kalaignar (M Karunanidhi),” chief minister Stalin said in a social media post. Ganesan, 76, becomes the second BJP leader from Tamil Nadu to be made the governor of a state in recent years. Former BJP TN president Tamilisai Soundararajan, who was appointed Telangana governor, now holds additional charge as lieutenant governor of Puducherry. With deep roots in the RSS, of which he was a part from 1967-91, Ganesan joined the BJP in Tamil Nadu in 1991 as general secretary (organization). He held the post until 2003, when he was elevated as BJP national vicepresident. Ganesan returned to Tamil Nadu as president of the party’s state unit. He served in that post for three years. He was later nominated to the Rajya Sabha by the BJP to serve the residual period after Najma Heptullah, who was elected to the Upper House from Madhya Pradesh, was made governor of Manipur. Ganesan served the Upper House for 18 months. It is interesting to note that Najma Heptullah’s term as governor of Manipur ended early this month and now Ganesan has been appointed to the post. Congress Lok Sabha MP from Trichy S Thirunavukkarasar, who was also nominated to the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh earlier when he was in the BJP, recalled Ganesan as a hardworking and dedicated politician. “He will come to Pudukottai with just a small travel bag and go about his work for the party, without worrying about facilities. His dedication has been finally rewarded,” Thirunavukkarasar told TOI. AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and TMC-M president G K Vasan too greeted Ganesan on his new role.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-bjp-ex-chief-l-ganesan-named-manipur-governor/articleshow/85550463.cms||---

But for the high taxes, pump rates would have dropped further as global oil prices have slid from a high of $75 per barrel a month ago to $66 this week, marking the sharpest fall since May amid fears of rising Covid cases in the US. No wonder petrol still costs over Rs 100 in almost all parts of the country and diesel is hovering around Rs 90 except in a few states with lower VAT or those who had reduced the levy in May. Tamil Nadu recently cut state taxes by Rs 3 a litre. Fuel retailers did not revise pump prices for more than a month though oil prices have been sliding and the rupee-dollar exchange rate also held more or less steady. Industry insiders say the retailers held the price line to partly cover inventory losses during the period. The retailers resumed price cuts with a 20-paise reduction for diesel on August 18 but left petrol prices untouched. Each of the three subsequent cuts have been of 20 paise each as has been the first cut in petrol rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fuel-prices-cut-by-20p/litre-but-fail-to-keep-pace-with-crudes-fall/articleshow/85550552.cms||---

A bill related to this is all set to be tabled in the Monday’s sitting of the ongoing monsoon session of Haryana assembly. A bill related to penalty for those involved in cheating in recruitment tests too is likely to be tabled during the day, reliable sources said. “Our officials are on the job to see legal clearances (needed) for both the bills. With this, PPP will have the legal sanctions behind it; in the case of the second bill, punishment could be harsher,” a source in CMO said. PPP is among the flagship projects of Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar’s government. So far, 2.2 crore persons belonging to 54.7 lakh families in the state have given signed consent by registering themselves for PPP till August 18. The CM said the motive behind PPP was to financially uplift families having annual income of less than Rs 1.8 lakh. He said under the survey of Parivar Pehchan Patra Yojana, 30,000 families with annual income up to Rs 50,000 and families declaring annual income up to Rs 1 lakh have been identified. Teams of six departments are making plans to increase their sources of income by contacting the families. According to data, 9.2 lakh families comprising 29.8 lakh persons have updated their data in registration and PPP till August 18, but their signed consent is yet to be provided. He said income data in PPP has been collected on the basis of self-declared information by the family along with the number of its members. Data has been separately verified with available database maintained by the central government or by the state government through digital medium and also on physical basis by specially constituted committees in the field.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bill-for-more-usable-parivar-pehchan-patra-likely-to-be-tabled-in-haryana-assembly-today/articleshow/85548612.cms||Manvir Saini

With 1,630 testing positive, the state’s case tally went beyond the 26 lakh-mark. Of them, 98% recovered from the infection following treatment. This included another 1,827 people, who were discharged from the covid registry on Sunday. The health recovery rate has resulted in a continuous drop in the number of active cases. TN at present has 19,171 patients undergoing treatment. However, 19,171 infected people have succumbed to the disease. This is the third highest in the country next to Maharashtra (1,35,962) and Kar nataka (37,145). On Sunday, 23 people died of Covid-19. Most of them had comorbidities such as diabetes or hypertension. TN’s case fatality ratio has come down to 1.3 %. This meant that for every 100 confirmed cases, at least one passed away from the virus. It was close to 2 during the peak of the second wave. Coimbatore once again topped the state's daily covid infection chart with 198 new cases. However, within the district, cases have dropped. After nearly 25 days, the daily infection count fell below the 200 mark. Similarly, even in Chennai (177 new cases), infection rate has decreased. The district's test positivity rate (TPR) is 0.8 -- less compared to the state's figure of 1.0. Nagapattinam (45) and Thanjavur (108) were the only two districts in TN to have a TPR of above 2.

Finding sufficient material on record for further proceedings under Section 166 (when public servant defies law to injure anyone), 167 (public servant’s framing an incorrect document to cause injury) and 415 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the court ordered the trial court to pass fresh orders on the complaint, based on the aforesaid observations. On October 18, 2018, advocate Vinod Kumar filed an application under Section 156 (3) (judicial magistrate’s power to investigate cognizable case) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for sending the same to the station house officer (SHO) concerned for registration of a case under Sections 166, 167, 415, 418, 463, 464, 466 and 468 of the IPC against Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj. The accused was civil surgeon in Fatehabad in the year 2013-14 when the Haryana NRHM had issued guidelines to all the civil surgeons of the state to fill the health department vacancies in their respective districts. The candidates from the PHC (primary health centre) areas were to be given 20 marks as local-area weightage but Dr Kamboj allegedly changed the marking pattern. An unsuccessful candidate, Sushil Kumar (who later died of Covid-19), received 10-mark weightage in the interview for data manager, while another candidate, Sachin Munjal of Fatehabad, received 20 despite being from outsider the PHC area. Sushil filed a civil suit, which was decreed partly vide the judgment of October 6, 2015. Sachin Munjal filed a civil appeal, which was dismissed on January 8, 2016. The Punjab and Haryana high court also dismissed his second civil appeal on March 3, 2017, observing that the accused had committed a fraud by changing the recruitment criteria all by himself to prescribe those 20 marks for ‘residents in local area’ instead of ‘residents in PHC area’. The complainant approached the Fatehabad superintendent of police (SP) but no further action was taken, so an application under Section 156 (3) of the CrPC was filed. The court of Fatehabad CJM Ramawatar Pareek dismissed this complaint on October 29, 2020, and a revision was filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2014-job-scam-setback-in-court-for-former-haryana-health-director/articleshow/85548655.cms||---

Qasimi was among 15 people picked up from the state since Friday after CM Himanta Biswa Sarma asked the police to start a crackdown on alleged Taliban supporters “without fear and favour”. “If Congress loves democracy and India, it should immediately snap ties with AIUDF, whose Talibani mentality got reflected in Qasimi’s comments,” BJP’s chief spokesperson Rupam Goswami said. Bypolls are due in five constituencies where Congress is banking on Ajmal to pull votes, especially in the Muslim-inhabited areas of lower and south Assam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aiudf-suspends-general-secretary-for-taliban-posts/articleshow/85550610.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Chennai||Chennai: Accused threatens magistrate, tries to flee, caught||CHENNAI: A man being taken to remand created a commotion at the house of a magistrate in Ambattur on Saturday, issuing life threats to the latter and trying to run away. The team of police personnel accompanying the accused, 45-year-old Mujeebur Rehman of Alwarthirumnagar, were taken aback before they managed to nab him and complete the process. He was later taken to prison and remanded in judicial custody. Police said that Rehman reportedly had an issue with a woman advocate over a financial deal and that both parties had lodged complaints against each other. With regard to the complaint lodged by the woman, Rehman failed to appear before police for inquiry. On Saturday, another fight broke out and Rehman is believed to have hurled abuses at the woman who again approached the Nazarathpet police. He was picked up and taken to the police station where he created a ruckus, but a case was registered on charges of criminal intimidation. Then, a sub-inspector and a constable took him to the house of magistrate Dhananjayan at Ambattur to complete the process of remand. Even as the magistrate was inquiring about the case, Rehman began to hurl abuses at him and even issued life threats. The team of accompanying police personnel stopped him from proceeding further, but Rehman grew restless, pushed them away and ran. Ravichandran, the SI, and the constable chased and caught him before handing him over to the personnel at the Ambattur police station. Based on a complaint from sub-inspector Ravichandran, he was booked under six sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was produced before the same magistrate who remanded him to judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-accused-threatens-magistrate-tries-to-flee-caught/articleshow/85550602.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Ex-TMC minister Shyama Prasad Mukherjee who crossed over to BJP held in Rs 10 crore ‘scam’||BANKURA: Former Trinamool Congress minister and ex-chairman of Bishnupur municipality Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was arrested on Sunday for allegedly being involved in financial irregularities to the tune of nearly Rs 10 crore. Mukherjee had joined the BJP in November 2020, but didn’t get a ticket to contest the assembly polls. He was earlier MoS textiles and housing departments. He lost the 2016 state polls on a Trinamool ticket. Mukherjee, who was the Bishnupur municipality chairman for five terms since 1990, was found to be involved in corrupt practices in tender processing that involved defalcation of Rs 9.9 crore, Bankura SP Dhritiman Sarkar said. Bihsnupur SDO Anup Kumar Nanda had filed a complaint with police for irregularities in the tender process during Mukherjee’s tenure as chairman. “We came to know about defalcation of Rs 9.9 cr. He was arrested as he failed to answer us properly. He was sent to court praying for police custody,” Sarkar said. A local court remanded him in police custody for four days. The SP said Mukherjee has been charged under Sec 404 (dishonest misappropriation), 409 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of IPC. Defence counsel Gouri Prasad Biswas, pleading for bail, said Mukherjee had been falsely implicated. He also stated that Mukherjee was sick and a senior citizen. District Trinamool chairman Shyamal Santra said Mukherjee had passed bills without doing any work. “He submitted utilization certificates but no work was done. The law will take its own course,” he said. BJP district president Sujit Agasty said: “What Shyama Prasad Mukherjee did was while he was in Trinamool. So why were the administration and police so late in acting?” The CBI had earlier questioned Mukherjee for his alleged role in a deal with Sarada while selling a cement factory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/former-bengal-minister-arrested-on-graft-charge/articleshow/85546354.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Locket, Rahul oppose separate statehood call||Kolkata: A day after Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh supported the separate statehood call for north Bengal claiming it was not an illegal demand, BJP leaders Locket Chatterjee and Rahul Sinha on Sunday spoke against bifurcation of the state. Chatterjee, who was in Hooghly to celebrate Raksha Bandhan, said: “We never want a bifurcation of the state. The culture of Bengal is different. We live in harmony and Bengal is very dear to each one of us. Bengal will remain Bengal from north to south and east to west.” The Hooghly MP took part in drawing portraits of Rabindranath Tagore and sang his songs. “Rabindranath celebrated ‘rakhi bandhan’. Those who have Rabindranath in their hearts and minds can never divide Bengal,” she said. On Saturday, Ghosh said that people in North Bengal were deprived of development like those in Jangalmahal. If they demanded a different state under such a situation, that will not be illegal, he added. Ghosh had earlier spoken against the separate statehood demand after Union minister John Barla gave a call for that. Sinha, who did not name any leader, said a section of people wanted to bifurcate the state. “Those who want to change the name of the state and divide the state geographically are insulting Rabindranath Tagore. There is still a section of people in the state who want to divide Bengal,” he said. Sinha narrated how Rabindranath started Rakhi Bandhan in October 1905 to protest against the bifurcation of Bengal. “This is the time we should remind ourselves of the thoughts of Rabindranath. We should take the message at the state and national level and make people aware of the significance of rakhi,” he said. Immediately after Ghosh’s comments on Saturday, TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh sought to know why the demand for a separate Union Territory was not raised during the assembly polls. “Why Dilipbabu or the other leaders of the party, including heavyweights from Delhi, not speak on the same lines during their campaign for state assembly polls? Why this hypocrisy?” he asked. TMC Rajya Sabha chief whip Sukhendu Sekhar Ray said, “BJP has encouraged fissiparous elements to divide Bengal after suffering a humiliating defeat in the recent elections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/locket-rahul-oppose-separate-statehood-call/articleshow/85546252.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Ex-MLA Sikha roped in by TMC women’s wing||Kolkata: Former Trinamool Congress MLA Sikha Mitra, wife of late Somen Mitra, has no immediate plan to join politics, but she will start working for Banga Janani, Trinamool’s women’s wing. Mitra, who is still in mourning after the death of her husband, said she was touched by chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s call before the veteran Congress leader’s death anniversary in July. “It was a very personal conversation and we spoke about Somen Mitra for long on the first day… some time in June. I was touched by the way she admired and respected him. She called me up again on the day of his anniversary,” Mitra said. “She told me… ‘Boudi you cannot stay like this and have to start working’. I have known her for many years and she has always showed a lot of respect. I have no immediate plan to join politics, but I am looking forward to engage myself in some more social work. A few days after that, Mala Roy (Kolkata South MP) visited our house,” Mitra said. According to Mitra, she was busy doing work for Bidhan Memorial Trust after her husband passed away last year. During the year, Mitra’s family had a lukewarm relationship with Pradesh Congress. Her son Rohan sent his resignation letter to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. On July 17, after Mitra was through with the annual rituals of her husband’s death anniversary, she received a call from Banerjee, who asked her to join social work. The Trinamool chief offered a post in a committee if Mitra was willing to return to active work life and said Mala Roy would get in touch with her accordingly. “Mala Roy came to our house a few days back and we spoke for a few hours. She explained how they want me to work with them. I might start working with them from next week,” Mitra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ex-mla-sikha-roped-in-by-tmc-womens-wing/articleshow/85546463.cms||Rohit Khanna

The group were part of a football team headed for Bishnupur in Bankura for a tournament. The three who died have been identified as Kurban Ali Khan (60), Julfikar Mondal (48) and Jasiruddin Choudhury (17). The mini-truck, which was carrying 30 people, overturned around 1pm as the driver lost control and hit a roadside divider in Bansda. Six of the injured were admitted to Bishnupur hospital and nine taken to Midnapore Medical College Hospital. One of them was later shifted to Kolkata as his condition was critical. Most of the players are from Garbeta’s Sandhipur area. Local MLA Uttara Singh Hazra said the driver may have been speeding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/17-yr-old-among-3-dead-in-garbeta-accident/articleshow/85546391.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||India||‘Kalyan stood by ideals, never let down officers who acted in public interest’||I never met Kalyan Singh except at official gatherings. During most of his first term as chief minister of UP that began in 1991, I was district magistrate (DM) at Sitapur. This meant there were few opportunities for face-to-face interactions with the CM. My first direct experience of his style of functioning came early in my tenure. The new government’s pro-farmer agenda was running aground due to mounting cane dues to farmers as sugar mills were lax in paying them. Consequently, the government authorised coercive means and, acting with alacrity, I attached two private sugar mills and impounded their assets. All hell broke loose as this had not happened before and powerful interests were involved. Some mandarins in Lucknow ticked me off for my ‘immaturity’. But the CM, I learnt later, was firm in his support for action taken in public interest. Weeks later, the CM spoke to me and said, “ Aapne jo bhi kiya bahut achha kiya.” (Whatever you did was fine). Imagine how it boosted my morale for the rest of my tenure in the district and beyond. Kalyan Singh’s fairness and sense of justice and the extent to which he supported sincere officers was evident on another occasion. In one tehsil, there was a huge racket of land belonging to marginalised sections being appropriated through forged documents in collusion with revenue officers. Criminal cases were filed, scores of Pradhans and Lekhpals (Patwaris) terminated, and efforts initiated to restore the land. As expected, there was a strong pushback from vested interests. In an unprecedented move, the local MLA, who belonged to the ruling party, threatened a fast to death till the DM was sacked. But the CM stood firm. Rajendra Gupta, finance minister, who hailed from Sitapur, and was also state BJP chief, later told me that the CM had told a delegation that the MLA was free to resort to a hunger strike, but “yadi koi anhonee ho jai to main zimmedar nahin hoon.” (if there is a mishap I would not be responsible). Such was the mettle of the man. Kalyan Singh was a big picture person who was willing to take the toughest decisions and go to great lengths to do what he believed was good for the state. His anti-mafia operation was one such initiative and reforming education was another. He, along with education minister Rajnath Singh, ran a statewide campaign to curb mass copying which was rampant in UP. It had an immediate salutary impact on quality of graduating classes even though average marks obtained and pass percentages fell. Many years later, as district magistrate Varanasi, when recruiting clerks on the basis of graduation marks, some candidates said : “Main Kalyan Singh ke zamane ka graduate hoon”, (I am a graduate of the Kalyan Singh era) — protesting being compared with scores of those who had passed when cheating was rampant. Many have not forgiven Kalyan Singh for the demolition of the Babri Masjid on 6 December 1992 on his watch. The jury is still out on whether he could have done more to prevent the demolition. But there can be no doubt that he was one of the tallest CMs UP has had. A man of iron integrity with a strong sense of fair play and justice who did not hesitate in taking the flak. In 1993, I was posted as staff officer to the adviser to the governor, during President’s Rule, imposed after his government was dismissed. Records related to decision making on the fateful day the mosque fell clearly showed how he had completely and unequivocally owned up entire responsibility for all that had happened while a lesser person may have been tempted to pass the buck to the local administration and the police. Today, Kalyan Singh is no more. UP and India have lost an icon of good governance. But his legacy as an administrator and statesmen live on and many will cherish his leadership. RIP Sir.

Modi, who arrived in Lucknow around 10.35 am on Sunday and went straight to Singh’s residence, said: “This a moment of great grief for all of us. Kalyan Singh ji’s parents named him Kalyan and he lived up to this name in the way he lived his life. All his life he worked towards jan kalyan or public welfare. He made jan kalyan his mantra for life. He dedicated his life to BJP and Jan Sangh for an ideology and a bright future of the country.” Several BJP leaders visited Singh’s home to pay respects to him. Additional chief secretary Navneet Sehgal said that Singh’s body was taken from the party office to the airport, from where a special air ambulance flew him to Aligarh at 3.45 pm. He was accompanied by CM Yogi, who will also be present for the funeral on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-pays-last-respects-says-kalyan-singh-lived-up-to-his-name/articleshow/85550656.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Business||Government against merging ailing Vodafone Idea with BSNL-MTNL||NEW DELHI: The government is against the merger of beleaguered Vodafone Idea with state-owned BSNL and MTNL, multiple sources have told TOI. The stand comes weeks after industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla had said that he is “willing to hand over” his 27% stake in the crippled telco to “any entity — public sector/government /domestic financial entity” in the name of “national interest”. Government sources said “multiple and strong logical reasons” suggest “outright rejection” of any proposal that gets the debt-laden and loss-making private entity within the fold of the state-owned companies, which themselves have a poor track record of managing their business and are operational mainly on the back of recurrent government bailouts. “How can we even allow this. It’s almost like having privatisation of profits, and nationalisation of losses?” a senior officer said. Birla’s call appeared to be in line with a suggestion made in a report of Deutsche Bank. “…the only viable solution is for the government to recapitalise Vodafone Idea by converting its debt into equity, preferably, while merging it with BSNL, and then providing it a clear commercial mandate based on profitability targets and incentives,” it had said in a recent note. Deutsche Bank added that “should this happen, Vodafone Idea’s shareholders would be heavily diluted as government debt is roughly six times the (telco’s) current market-cap, and such a solution might be an acceptable outcome to shareholders.” The numbers are, however, stacked against such suggestions. Vodafone Idea, the third-largest telecom operator with around 27 crore subscribers, is under heavy debt, owing Rs 96,300 crore to the government in deferred spectrum payments, while being liable for another Rs 61,000 crore towards AGR liabilities. The liabilities come with interest burden of thousands of crores, with the company having another Rs 23,000-crore bank debt. Its losses in the previous two quarters have been in excess of Rs 7,000 crore. On the other hand, BSNL and MTNL had to be handed out a Rs 69,000-crore revival package around 2019 to keep them afloat, and are still struggling to attain profitability. According to a reply of minister of state (communications) Devusinh Chauhan in Rajya Sabha on August 5, total liabilities of BSNL stood at Rs 81,156 crore at the end of FY21 while MTNL’s at Rs 29,391 crore. “It will be a financial mess if all the struggling entities are brought together and merged. What purpose does it serve? In fact, if their operations are brought together, it may turn into an even-bigger financial drain on the exchequer in the coming years if the operations do not turn around,” an officer said. “In any case, instead of being so considerate for an inefficient private entity, the government may simply focus more on the BSNL/MTNL combine and give them more funds to make them competitive and turn them around.” NITI Aayog, which has been roped into the issue by the telecom department, is also against the proposal. The government think-tank feels that any such measure may also see an “erosion in value” of Vodafone Idea, and thus not much may be left in the deal for BSNLMTNL to gain from. Some of the officers said cultural differences between the two entities are also reasons that may make a merger “a sure failure”. “BSNLMTNL lacks an aggressive private sector stance, and their employees are aging and saddled with labour and union issues. On the other hand, Vodafone and Idea couldn’t even manage their own merger properly, which was among the reasons behind the joint company’s collapse.” Another officer said there are “numerous legal issues” that make it a difficult deal. “MTNL is listed, and so is Vodafone Idea,” the officer said.

SCPL has announced its collaboration with the Carnoustie Management (India), a luxury hospitality and wellness brand, to set up the Carnoustie Centre of Excellence in the retreat. The retreat is a residential cum hospitality project 16 kilometres from the city. Sushil Mohta, director of South City Projects, said that it is investing Rs 100 crore for the hospitality project while the total investment in the retreat would be to the tune of Rs 600 crore. “We are looking at the wellness market for the hospitality venture for which there is a good demand worldwide,” he added. The entire project is likely to be completed by the end of 2023. The Carnoustie group said a lot of tourists from south east Asia are coming to its centre in Kerala and looking for a nearby location in eastern India. South City Retreat houses 30 luxurious rooms along with the Carnoustie Centre of Excellence and residential villas. “It is on the way to Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve, which makes it a more attractive tourist destination for both domestic and international travellers,” said Mohta, director, SCPL. The hospitality part and some real estate parts of the project will be operational in December this year. “We have so far sold as many as 27 villas, which are already built.

The rate has been showing a steady rise from 14.03% on August 16 while it is feared that relaxations in movement during the festival season could take the rate even higher. As many as 27,260 people are admitted to various hospitals in the state now as against 1.78 lakh active cases. In three districts, the occupancy rate in government hospitals is above 70% — Kasaragod 79%, Thrissur 73% and Malappuram 72%. The occupancy rate in government hospitals in two districts is above 60% — Palakkad 65% and Kozhikode 60%. CM Pinarayi Vijayan has convened a review meeting on Monday. It is expected to take a decision on whether to impose more restrictions given the surge in cases. Healthcare experts had warned of a huge spike in cases in state in the event of a third wave of pandemic and speculations are rife that authorities will bring in restrictions in place of relaxations given ahead of Onam. ‘After Onam, test numbers will increase’Experts, however, said more cases and an increasing TPR need not be a concern if hospital admissions are not increasing. “We will have to be really worried if there is any increase in the number of hospitalizations... The TPR will increase for a few more days as the testing has come down; the testing will be purely on symptomatic people now. After Onam holidays, the test numbers will increase,’’ Dr Arun N M, internal medicine expert, said. Dr N Sulphi of the Indian Medical Association also said there was no need of any concern even if the daily cases went up to 40,000. “There is nothing to worry about if there are fewer hospital admissions despite the increase in cases. There are multiple factors now to determine the severity. More cases and increasing TPR are not the foremost ones,” he said. In August alone, the state reported 4,13,142 Covid cases and 2,647 deaths. Malappuram topped the chart with 63,949 cases in 21 days, followed by Thrissur 51,649, Kozhikode 48,778 and Ernakulam 47,614. The surge was rapid in four districts — Ernakulam, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Thrissur. The financial crisis being faced by traders and those without a steady income had forced authorities to ease restrictions during the festival season. Experts pointed out that Kerala had a large uninfected population and the infection rate is bound to increase. On top of that, the Delta strain of the virus, which is active in the state, is more virulent, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/post-onam-surge-review-meet-today-fresh-curbs-likely-in-kerala/articleshow/85550719.cms||---

Healthcare experts had warned of a huge spike in cases in state in the event of a third wave of pandemic and speculations are rife that authorities will bring in restrictions in place of relaxations given ahead of Onam. ‘After Onam, test numbers will increase’Experts, however, said more cases and an increasing TPR need not be a concern if hospital admissions are not increasing. “We will have to be really worried if there is any increase in the number of hospitalizations... The TPR will increase for a few more days as the testing has come down; the testing will be purely on symptomatic people now. After Onam holidays, the test numbers will increase,’’ Dr Arun N M, internal medicine expert, said. Dr N Sulphi of the Indian Medical Association also said there was no need of any concern even if the daily cases went up to 40,000. “There is nothing to worry about if there are fewer hospital admissions despite the increase in cases. There are multiple factors now to determine the severity. More cases and increasing TPR are not the foremost ones,” he said. In August alone, the state reported 4,13,142 Covid cases and 2,647 deaths. Malappuram topped the chart with 63,949 cases in 21 days, followed by Thrissur 51,649, Kozhikode 48,778 and Ernakulam 47,614. The surge was rapid in four districts — Ernakulam, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Thrissur. The financial crisis being faced by traders and those without a steady income had forced authorities to ease restrictions during the festival season. Experts pointed out that Kerala had a large uninfected population and the infection rate is bound to increase. On top of that, the Delta strain of the virus, which is active in the state, is more virulent, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/post-onam-surge-review-meet-today-fresh-curbs-likely-in-kerala/articleshow/85550751.cms||---

The last Sunday operation was on May 9, as services were halted from May 16, for the second Covid wave. Even as the city’s transport lifeline resumed on July 16, the state government only allowed five-day runs. Metro Railway has been offering special trains for essential workers across sectors on Saturdays. Now, the same facility is available on the seventh day of the week. But this Sunday’s services were opened especially for the WBCS (prelims) aspirants and their parents, who were allowed to ride after showing admit cards. Allowances were also made for essential workers with ID cards. Next Sunday (August 29) onwards, essential workers can continue to board the trains. Ever since Metro restarted after the second Covid-induced suspension, it has become the backbone of transport. Many bus routes are still off roads. Taxi and app-cab tariffs are too high for daily commute, thanks to the skyrocketing fuel prices. Several car-owners, too, are taking the Metro. “Thank God, it’s available on Sundays as well,” said hotel executive and shopper Aritra Das, who boarded the train from Baranagar. “I travelled till Rabindra Sarobar for just Rs 25 and took an auto to South City Mall for another Rs 7,” he said. Metro ran 112 trains from Kavi Subhas to Dakshineswar between 10am and 10pm. From next Sunday, the same number of trains will ply but services will run at 8-minute intervals during morning and evening peak hours. Even as state guidelines allow Metro to run from Monday to Friday, the carrier had decided to allow people from essential services to avail it on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-runs-sunday-n-s-services-after-104-days/articleshow/85544528.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||WBCS prelims: Bengal records 1.8 lakh turnout, 43,000 write on-site test in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Around 1.8 lakh applicants turned up in 657 centres in Bengal on Sunday to appear for the West Bengal Civil Service (WBCS) preliminary examination. In Kolkata, around 43,000 applicants turned up in 100 centres. Over 2.5 lakh persons had applied to take the examinations. After the Covid second wave, the first offline examinations were conducted by the West Bengal JEE in July that was followed by the CLAT examinations. However, with 2.5 lakh applicants, the WBCS prelims turned out to be a challenge amid the pandemic. The pandemic and restrictions had some impact on the examinations conducted on Sunday. Some of the candidates who had turned up late at the venue were not allowed entry. At least three candidates in Kolkata missed it this time as they were late to reach the PSC. The PSC had issued directives that all candidates should reach the venue by 11.30 am while the examination was scheduled from 12 pm to 2.30 pm. PSC chairperson Debashis Bose said the turnout was around 70%. Usually, WBCS prelims examination is held in end-January or in February, but this time it was deferred due to the pandemic. Bose said that they had initially planned to hold the examination in March, but as the second Covid wave was there so the examination was held in August. Bose said that inside all the centres, proper safety norms were followed. PSC will try to hold the WBCS (mains) examination as early as possible. Two candidates TOI spotted could not reach their examination centre at the PSC office on time. Nekvas Sheikh, who came from Murshidabad, was unable to take Metro to reach PSC office as he had no smart card and took a bus of a wrong route. “I had taken a train from Murshidabad in the wee hours of Sunday to reach the PSC office, but unfortunately, I took a wrong bus and was late,” he said. A PSC official said that on Sunday Metro was running special service for WBCS examinees, but they had to show admit and smart cards for entering the station. Sk Abul Kalam Azad, an examinee who came all the way from Bagnan in Howrah, said that he had reached around 12.02 pm and pleaded for allowing him and some other candidates who were late. “But they did not allow. They should have been lenient amid the pandemic as there were very few buses and the train was also late.” PSC officials said that rules cannot be changed for some candidates who were late. But, for IT sector employee Suranjana Pal, who stays in Dakshineswar, reaching the venue at PSC office was easy due to the Metro. She said the commute was hassle-free. Similarly, Samsad Ali, who came from Birbhum, said he reached Howrah early in the morning after starting on Saturday night and was happy with sanitization arrangements at the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wbcs-prelims-bengal-records-1-8-lakh-turnout-43k-write-on-site-test-in-kolkata/articleshow/85544494.cms||Debasish Konar
---||Business||ITAT upholds tax treaty relief on delayed TRC||MUMBAI: A recent decision of the Mumbai bench of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) will be of immense help to nonresidents, such as globally mobile employees, who owing to genuine causes are unable to file an overseas tax residency certificate (TRC) along their income tax (I-T) return in India, but furnish it after the assessment stage. The ITAT has held denial of the lower rate of tax according to the India-US treaty, in the hands of a US tax resident, on his India source income was “absolutely misconceived and misplaced,” merely because a TRC from the US authorities was not furnished to the I-T officer during the course of assessment, but was produced at a later stage before the Commissioner (Appeals). Non-residents are generally subject to tax in India, only in respect of their India source income — say bank interest, interest on fixed deposits, rent from property in India, dividends from investments in India. The taxpayer can opt to be governed by the Indian Income-tax Act or the tax treaty, whichever is more beneficial. In this case, which was heard by the ITAT, in FY14, Haresh C Seth, a non-resident, had earned bank interest and interest on fixed deposits aggregating to Rs17.9 lakh. However, the I-T officer declined to apply the lower rate of tax of 10% and 15% available under the India-US tax treaty. The commissioner (Appeals) also upheld this course of action, as he concluded that Seth had failed to file the TRC and Form10F (which provides overseas tax residency details) with the I-T officer during the course of assessment. The ITAT took into consideration the genuine challenges such as the very short time period that was provided for furnishing the TRC to the I-T officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/itat-upholds-tax-treaty-relief-on-delayed-trc/articleshow/85550767.cms||---

According to tourism stakeholders, the tourist inflow shows that the sector is getting back to normalcy. But at many tourist centres, most of the visitors are Malayalis, and fewer north Indian and Tamil tourists are arriving at the destinations. District tourism promotion council (DTPC) secretary Gireesh P S said that all 12 tourist destinations under DTPC witnessed normal tourist arrival on Saturday and Sunday. Eravikulam National Park Assistant wildlife warden Job J Neriamparambil told TOI that 2,728 tourists visited the park on Sunday. “The park's total capacity is 2,880 per day, and Eravikulam witnessed nearly 97% occupancy on Sunday. On Thiruvonam, 1,760 tourists visited the park. We hope the trend will continue in the coming days,” said the official. Idukki and Cheruthoni dams, one of the major tourist attractions in the district, under the hydel tourism department of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), witnessed heavy tourist inflow on Sunday. Sreenivasan, an official with the ticket counter, said that 3,197 tourists enjoyed the scenic beauty of the dams on Sunday. “On Saturday, 1,300 tourists visited the dams,” said the official. A tourism department official said that the mandatory vaccine certificates for entry to the centres have affected the entry of youth tourists. “Most of the visitors in the tourism centres are between 18 and 25 years. But many youths are yet to receive their first vaccine dose. To enter these destinations, youths need to undergo an RT-PCR test. But as per government order, we can't allow tourists without a vaccine certificate or RT-PCR test result,” said the official. Jubina, a tourist from Kannur, said that after the pandemic, her family visited Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Thekkady and witnessed that officials followed all Covid-19 guidelines. “After the pandemic, the trip provided a new life to us,” she said, adding the strict adherence to Covid protocols will give confidence to tourists to visit the tiger reserve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-tourist-centres-witness-heavy-rush-during-onam-in-idukki/articleshow/85550782.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||World||Hope for animal rescuer stuck in Kabul after US businessman pays for cargo plane to ferry animals, staff out||LONDON: Former royal marine commando Pen Farthing, who is stranded in Kabul with over 176 animals, has been thrown a lifeline after a wealthy US businessman provided the funds to lease a cargo plane to fly him, all his animals and Afghan staff and their families to Britain and the British government is in the midst of processing immigration papers for the Afghan staff to fly here. Following the publicity surrounding the case, Spencer Haber, founder and chairman of the H/3 Foundation, emailed Nowzad Dogs Charity founded by Farthing to say he wanted to help. It took Dominic Dyer, who is helping man Nowzad's overflowing inbox, 24 hours , to spot the mail and respond. A video call followed. “He did not need much convincing,” Dyer, Nowzad’s campaign coordinator said. Staff of the shelterThe H/3 Foundation is a USA-based non-profit organisation dedicated to raise awareness of "the special animals with whom humans share the planet." In 2017 following Hurricane Irma it launched an animal rescue and relief initiative in the British Virgin Islands. The cargo plane for the rescue mission has now been leased and is in Cairo. “We are waiting for approval for it to land at Kabul. The UK government is juggling landing slots alongside military slots. It has the capacity to fly all the animals, the 71 Afghan staff and their families and a further 100 Afghan refugees on top,” said Dyer. Thousands of people have thronged Hamid Karzai International Airport desperate to flee the Taliban take-over a week ago. Dyer said he had faced some criticism for bringing animals back when people were desperate to get out too but pointed out the animals would be in the hold and not in the seated part of the aircraft so were not taking up the places of humans. But Farthing, his staff and animals do not yet have a secure access corridor to the airport. “Farthing is working on that”, said Dyer. They hope to get the approvals on the immigration papers for the staff and dependents soon. Once all is finalised, the plane will fly to Heathrow to pick up Dyer and some others from the Nowzad team and then fly them to Kabul airport where Farthing, his staff and the animals will hopefully be waiting. “There are no forklift trucks. We will have to load all the animals onto the plane ourselves and do it in an hour and a half slot. This is not a normal airport with any infrastructure but at least the airspace and area inside the airport are secure,” Dyer said. “The dogs and cats gave got permission to land at Heathrow and we are going there as there is an animal reception centre with vets,” he added. The US$200,00 which Nowzad had raised to fly the animals back, will now be used to care for and rehome the animals in Britain and help the Afghans resettle in the UK, who will need support with housing, employment and accommodation. “Farthing does not want them to be dispersed, he wants to keep them all together, as they are part of the Nowzad family, which is why they are coming to the UK,” said Dyer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/hope-for-animal-rescuer-stuck-in-kabul-after-us-businessman-pays-for-cargo-plane-to-ferry-animals-staff-out/articleshow/85550839.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation syringe stock may last only a day||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has hit a syringe hurdle before it rolls out its usual vaccination schedule this week. The KMC has 27,000 auto-disable syringes which may not last beyond Monday. The civic body needs around 30,000 to 35,000 such syringes daily to run 144 vaccination clinics and 50 mega vaccination centres. The state government, as an emergency measure, has asked KMC to procure auto-disable syringes from the open market which it will reimburse later. Bengal has sought Centre’s help to get 20 lakh such syringes, the first lot of which is expected this week. TOI has already reported that Bengal is facing acute shortage of syringes. The number of syringes the state gets is consistent with the number of doses it receives from Centre. Bengal, however, had registered negative wastage, administering more doses than it has received. This has resulted in the use of more syringes than that have been provided, leading to the shortage. Bengal has managed to extract around 16 lakh extra doses of vaccine in the last three months from its stipulated quota by using the extra dose given in a vial to compensate for wastage. As it waits for the Centre to supply it syringes, the state plans to spend Rs 1 crore to procure these syringes from open market to tide over the crisis. KMC, officials said, has already procured 60,000 syringes from the open market in the past few days and is looking for suppliers who can provide it bulk supplies within a short timeframe. According to state health secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam, the crisis is temporary. He said the state was expecting the arrival of bulk supply of syringes from the Centre soon. “The nature of such a crisis is temporary and we are expecting to mitigate it soon. But for the time being, we have advised the KMC to go for procurement of syringes from the market to run their vaccination clinics and mega centres. We will pay the civic body for such a procurement in due course,” Nigam told TOI. However, according to a KMC health department official, the civic body is facing a problem in the syringe procurement as there was inadequate stock in the market. “We have managed to get 60,000 syringes on two separate days after thoroughly searching for such syringes last week. There is no guarantee that we will be able to find such a bulk quantity of syringes next week as there is inadequate stock of automatic disable syringes in the open market,” the civic official said. “We have a stock which will last for a day only. We need to find new supply either from the state or buy syringes from the private market. Otherwise, we will be compelled to suspend our vaccination for the time being,” said a KMC health department official From Monday onwards, the civic body’s 144 vaccination clinics will administer first and second Covishield and Covaxin doses in two shifts. While the registration counters will open for the recipients of first dose at 10 am, the second dose recipients will be called after 2 pm. The KMC-run mega vaccination centres will also follow the same model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-syringe-stock-may-last-only-a-day/articleshow/85544459.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Business||Women angel investors get push from LetsVenture||BENGALURU: Angel investing platform LetsVenture's Women Investor Network (WIN) has created a structured, cohort-based learning programme to encourage more women to participate in angel investing. Shanti Mohan, founder of LetsVenture, said when they looked at their portfolio early this year, they found the platform had investors from 55 countries, and less than 1% of the investors were women. There were less than 25 women investors. "The idea of our programme is to introduce more women to angel investing, deal sourcing & evaluation, all the way to legal and financial due diligence, and building their personal brand as an angel investor,” she said. Mohan has set a target of signing up 100 women angels, 5 syndicate leads, and 2 women general partners this year. WIN concluded its first cohort in June with 34 women participants, of whom 15 have successfully written their first cheque and are now active angel investors. Ten women wrote two or more cheques. About 5% of women have shown interest in writing cheques for growth-stage startups. The second cohort begins in September. Shalini Nautiyal, senior product manager at Amazon in Berlin, was part of the first cohort. She had started a hyperlocal activity discovery platform in 2013 that was acquired two years later. “The (LetsVenture) masterclass was very helpful, putting the spotlight on the investment thesis, evaluating a deal, understanding how syndicates work, and the role of a lead investor. We also got a lowdown on what is the total available market, serviceable available market, and serviceable obtainable market,” she said. Sangeetha Baburaj, a senior product specialist at SAP Labs India who was part of the cohort, said she still considers herself a novice in angel investing. She is excited about the opportunities in HR tech, AR and VR. "We learnt the fundamentals of investing and it has prepared us to ask the right questions and to evaluate a deal sans the jargon,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/women-angel-investors-get-push-from-letsventure/articleshow/85550909.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

NARCL was incorporated last month in Mumbai following the registration with Registrar of Companies (RoC). According to sources, the company after mobilising an initial capital of Rs 100 crore and fulfilling other legal formalities has approached the RBI seeking licence to undertake asset reconstruction business. The RBI in 2017, raised the capital requirement to Rs 100 crore from the earlier level of Rs 2 crore, keeping in mind the higher amount of cash required to buy bad loans. The RBI has a procedure for granting licence for such businesses, sources said, adding, it could take a few weeks to obtain licence from the regulator. IBA, tasked with setting up a bad bank, has put a preliminary board for NARCL in place. The company has hired P M Nair, a stressed assets expert from SBI as the MD. The other directors on the board are IBA CEO Sunil Mehta, SBI deputy MD S S Nair and Canara Bank’s CGM Ajit Krishnan Nair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/iba-seeks-licence-to-set-up-bad-bank/articleshow/85550915.cms||---

The city can vouch for that. While there is no official figure, police estimate residents lost Rs 4 crore to cyber crime cheats in more than13 months from July 1, 2020, to August 15 this year. Police dealt with roughly 8,000 complaints. As many as 3,408 of them came between January and July 20 alone. Shoppers and buyers and sellers of second-hand goods topped the list of the conned, that is 568, in the more than six months. Most of these people tried to buy goods online or sell them on classifieds website like OLX but ended up losing their some of their hard-earned earnings. Anxieties and fears were exploited too. People who lost their jobs during these uncertain times believed fake job letters sent online in desperation. A total of 116 of them were duped on the pretext of a job or work visa. Another 84 were cheated in exchange of providing a loan. Data showed the cyber cell received 518 complaints of debit or credit card cloning and money being withdrawn fraudulently from ATMs. A total of 371 people were cheated after they read out their bank and OTP details to strangers posing as bank and company executives. As many as 17 people lost money to fraudsters selling LIC policies or handing over insurance claims. Police also received 446 complaints of hacking or creating fake IDs on social media in the more than six months. On the arrest side, 38 cyber criminals were caught in one year from July 2020. Six of them were nabbed from Jamtara, Jharkhand, which is considered to be a safe haven for cyber criminals in the country. Recently, the cyber cell had arrested three Jamtara residents for allegedly duping a a Sector 23 woman of Rs 11.93 lakh by offering to help her receive notifications for withdrawing money on her mobile phone. A few of the accused were from West Bengal, Mumbai and Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cyber-cheats-took-rs-4-crore-in-13-months-reckon-cops/articleshow/85550882.cms||Pawan Tiwari
---||Business||New DFI management to take a call on IIFCL merger||NEW DELHI: The government has decided to leave it on the new management of the development financial institution (DFI) to decide on a merger of India Infrastructure Finance Company (IIFCL) or other entities with itself. Officials told TOI that the government does not want to burden the new entity with legacy issues and wants it to start on a clean slate. “Let the new board decide whether it wants to take over the burden of an existing company and let them decide who they want in their fold,” a source said. The move will come as a major relief for IIFCL management, which has been lobbying against a merger, although it may prove to be detrimental for the NBFC in the long run and comes with the risk of turning it into an organisation like IFCI, India’s first DFI, which has been surviving for over two decades but has little to contribute. FM Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the establishment of the new DFI, called National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development, in her last Budget and is aimed at being a one-stop shop for all infrastructure related services. While the law to set up the institution, which will come with government funding, has been enacted by Parliament, the finance ministry has tasked Sidbi to do the groundwork and appoint a consultant. The DFI is the latest experiment .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-dfi-mgmt-to-take-a-call-on-iifcl-merger/articleshow/85550934.cms||Sidhartha

The incident was reported around 11.30pm from near the Kasba Tribana Club. The incident left at least three persons injured, two of them seriously. Locals alleged that at least seven bombs were hurled on the Kasba connector, close to the main road median. The two critically injured victims — identified as Rabi Chowdhury (26) and Asish Thakur (26) — has been admitted in a private hospital in the Ruby area. While Chowdhury is a resident of Rajdanga, Thakur is a resident of Prantik Pally. Local sources claimed the clash as a result of a turf war to control the area between two sets of promoters and syndicate members owing their allegiance to the same political party. The police though claimed that this was a result of an intra-party clash. “At night, a trouble broke out between two factions of the same party over some old rivalry. The local police was sent and reinforcements in the form of HRFS and RCP response teams from Lalbazar reached the spot soon after. The situation was brought under control and the injured removed to hospital. We have posted our men in the area to ensure peace is maintained,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Anti Rowdy Squad of detective department is helping local police in the probe. “We were scared hearing the bombs blast one after another. There is still blood and shreds of glass lying around,”said a local.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bombs-hurled-on-bypass-connector-in-kasba-3-injured/articleshow/85544472.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Home at last: Bengal teacher recounts final few days of horror||KOLKATA/KALIMPONG: Around 11pm on Sunday, almost two days since he reached the Kabul airport, 34-year-old Tamal Bhattacharya finally afforded himself a smile. The anxiety of the past several days was finally over. He had managed to escape the horror unfolding back in Afghanistan. The resident of Nimta North Dum Dum, a mechanical engineer by training, had left home in March to take up a job teaching physics and chemistry at Kardan International School, an army school in Kabul. He was one of 10 Bengal residents who were flown back on Sunday. He hadn’t reached home yet when TOI caught up with him, likely to reach around midnight. For the past few months, ‘home’ was the school’s staff quarters. Since the Taliban takeover, he had locked himself inside his principal’s house, near the airport, not daring to go out. “I had contacted the Indian embassy in Kabul and tried several times to reach the airport, but I couldn’t,” he said before taking off for Kolkata. “The airport was surrounded by armed Taliban men. Around 11pm on Friday, we managed to reach the airport gate along with other Indians. But the American forces initially refused to allow us inside because no government officials were accompanying us with government documents.” Bhattacharya said: “We had to wait outside the airport for several hours on Friday night. Later, we were accommodated in a wedding hall near the airport. It was then that officers of the Indian Air Force arrived. They helped us board the flight late on Saturday.” It was only after getting news of Tamal’s arrival in Delhi early on Sunday morning that his parents — Shyamal and Minati — breathed easy, after days of tension. “I managed to get in touch with him on chat minutes before he boarded the Ghaziabad-bound flight late on Saturday. Now we are feeling relieved as our only son has managed to return from Afghanistan,” Shyamal, 66, said. Minati said: “From what we saw on TV, I was very scared, especially because he taught in an army school. We had lost contact with him for several days. I just kept on praying.” Over 600km away in Kalimpong, images of the IAF plane landing in India playing out on TV finally brought a smile on Sudeshna Subba. Her husband, S Subba reached India on the same flight after spending three nights at Kabul airport. “I used to wait for his calls, and each time he called, I would hear firing sounds and other scary noises. I could not keep calm,” Sudeshna said. Subba, an ex-Armyman and a Kargil war veteran, had gone to Afghanistan only on August 3, little expecting to have to return so soon. His elderly mother said Subba had fought for his country, but this experience of Afghanistan was more scary as this time, “he was fighting for his life”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/home-at-last-bengal-teacher-recounts-final-few-days-of-horror/articleshow/85547738.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

Although the “emergency maintenance” of the site was completed on Sunday evening, and it went live again, the shutdown had caused considerable embarrassment. Ministry of Finance has summoned Sh Salil Parekh,MD&CEO @Infosys on 23/08/2021 to explain to hon'ble FM as to why e… https://t.co/sRH30ZYmBV— Income Tax India (@IncomeTaxIndia) 1629620705000On Saturday, Infosys had tweeted about a “planned maintenance”, though the tax department had remained silent about it until about 2pm on Sunday, when it tweeted about the Infosys CEO being “summoned”. During this time, users had come across a message, saying the “portal is going through a maintenance”. Last week, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj was regularly monitoring the issue and the glitches would be removed soon. Government functionaries have asked Parekh to meet them again on Monday. This is the second time that the government has publicly named Infosys in the case. Two months ago, the company brass held consultations with the FM and other stakeholders after she had flagged the concerns on social media, hours after the June 7 launch. Sunday’s tweet points to the government’s growing impatience over the quality of service offered by Infosys, with GST Network and MCA-21 (for corporate filings and database) being other assignments where the Indian tech giant’s role has come under the lens. While the government has repeatedly blamed the IT vendor for the problems with the new income tax portal, it has offered no response on how a faulty system was allowed to go live by officials handling the high-profile project.  Some of their colleagues and former tax officials have suggested that sufficient tests were not conducted before the system was launched. A source said the portal was ready for launch last year itself, but rollout was planned to be done in phases, a decision that was changed later. A questionnaire sent to the Central Board of Direct Taxes on Sunday remained unanswered, while Bajaj did not respond to text messages. In the past too, tax authorities have refused to offer any explanation on how the department had failed to spot multiple glitches in the platform. The problems with the portal have already prompted the tax department to offer some concessions. Besides, officials have blamed the snags for a massive slowdown in tax refunds. Between April and August 16, refunds added up to Rs 49,696 crore against close to Rs 96,000 crore between April and August 25 last year. The number of refunds which added up to over 25.5 lakh till August 25, 2020, have dropped to 22.7 lakh so far this year. Also, repeated disruptions have led to demands to defer the deadline for filing returns apart from seeking other relaxations. Although some experts had suggested reverting to the earlier system till the issues in the new portal were sorted out, Sitharaman has ruled out the possibility. “While several of the issues have been resolved, new problems keep coming up,” a leading CA said. “The new e-filing portal was expected to replace the existing e-filing portal. It was viewed to create a strong technology backbone by enabling a host of new functionalities to taxpayers, including enhancement of look, feel and usage experience. We regret to say that after the expiry of more than two months, the portal is still not functioning and is suffering from several serious problems,” the Bombay Chartered Accountants’ Society said in a letter to the FM on August 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-summons-infosys-ceo-after-tax-portal-outage/articleshow/85550955.cms||---

The team members said they were surprised to find the latest seed testing laboratories in mandal centres. The team said the initiatives of the state government should be extended to other states. The team headed by National Oil Fed joint director Dr K Ponnuswamy inspected Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) in Krishna and Guntur districts. The team was impressed after seeing certain facilities in the RBKs. “We thought Tamil Nadu is the leader in terms of seed testing laboratories with 33 centres. We are surprised to see 160 centres in AP. This is going to be a game-changer,” said Dr Ponnuswamy. He praised the state government for initiating RBKs. He said no other state has experimented and extended services to farmers the way AP has done. Yield may fall by 30-60% in states studiedThe farm scientists have also projected a fall in rice yields based on increase in temperature by varying degrees. They warned that the rice yield is expected to decrease in 30 to 60% of the states studied as part of the research. The result of the research was published in the recent issue of the science publication, Journal of Water and Climate Change. According to the projections, the average rainfed gap in yield of paddy will be 1.49 tonnes per hectare in the future. “The trend of seasonal climate variables shows an expected increase in maximum temperature, minimum temperature and rainfall, and a decreasing trend in solar radiation in the future i.e. 2030 and 2040s over the study area. Consequently, average spatial water-limited potential rice yield is expected to reduce from 3.62 tonnes per hectare in the historical period to 3.11 tonnes per hectare and 3.02 tonnes per hectare during the 2030 and 2040s, respectively,” the study predicted. The scientists further said there will be an increase in yield gap of 20.9% and 22.2% by 2030 and 2040s respectively. A stagnated yield gap in 29.7% and 26.5% and decreasing yield gap in 49.4% and 51.3% of the study area during 2030 and 2040s respectively. The researchers said their finding “contributes to understanding the consequences of climate change on rice yield gap and future food security concerns in India”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/food-safety-mission-lauds-aps-efforts-to-make-tech-available-for-farmers/articleshow/85544294.cms||Samdani MN

This is the second such accident in two days. On Saturday, a speeding apple-laden truck had hit over a dozen vehicles from the back along the same stretch at Kandaghat in Solan district. According to sources, Sunday’s accident occurred around noon near Jabli. Both vehicles overturned in the accident. A police team then reached the spot and launched a rescue operation and shifted the injured to hospital. Bus driver Ajay Kumar said that he was driving his bus to Kalka from Solan. When he reached near Jabli, he saw in the rearview mirror that a truck coming from Dharampur side was approaching fast towards the bus, so he also increased the speed to avoid the collision. However, the truck hit the bus from behind. He said the impact of collision was such that the bus overturned on the road and the truck also. He said 20 passengers, including 11 men and 9 women, were injured. He said after the accident, the truck driver fled from the spot.

Biden made these remarks during a White House address amid the country's large-scale evacuation efforts in the war-ravaged country. "Discussions are going on among us and the military about extending (Aug 31 evacuation deadline), our hope is, we don't have to extend. But there going to be a discussion, I suspect on how far along we're in the process," said US President Joe Biden said during an address from White House "We know that terrorists may seek to exploit the situation and target innocent Afghans or American troops. We're maintaining constant vigilance to monitor and disrupt threats from any source, including ISIS and the Afghan affiliate known as ISIS-K," Biden added. Following the Taliban's swift takeover of Kabul last week, the US has been scrambling to evacuate Americans and its Afghan partners from the country. Biden informed that the US has extended the safe zone around the Kabul international airport. "We have made a number of changes, including extending the access around the airport and the safe zone," Biden said during the presser. Earlier on Friday, Biden had termed the evacuation from Afghanistan the 'most difficult and largest airlift' ever in the history. Biden also raised concerns on Sunday over the Islamic State posing a threat as American troops seek to evacuate thousands of U.S. citizens and Afghan allies from Afghanistan. Biden noted that the terror group is a ``sworn enemy of the Taliban'' and said that the longer U.S. troops are on the ground increases the chance that the group will attempt to strike innocent civilians and American personnel near the Hamid Karzai International Airport. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has been warning Americans to avoid traveling to the airport in part because of concerns about Islamic State fighters. The extremist group has long declared a desire to attack America and U.S. interests abroad and it has been active in Afghanistan for a number of years, carrying out waves of horrific attacks, mostly on the Shiite minority. The group has been repeatedly targeted by U.S. airstrikes in recent years, and faced Taliban attacks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-says-us-mulling-to-extend-afghanistan-evacuation-mission-warns-of-is-threat/articleshow/85551006.cms||---

The farmer from Jind district has been making fruitless rounds of the office of the state revenue department to return Rs 52,920 that was credited wrongly to his and his brother’s bank accounts on August 18, 2016. Surajmal Nain of Kharainti has “gone everywhere” — from block offices to the chief minister’s house in Chandigarh — but his “desperate struggle” continues. Surajmal’s family runs the farm jointly and the revenue department in August 2016 deposited Rs 34,735 into his State Bank of India account and credited a similar amount to his brother’s account as well. The money totalled Rs 69,470. The brothers had sought compensation for pest attack on their cotton crop but were eligible for only Rs 16,550, the farmer told TOI. After realising that they were paid an extra Rs 52,920, the two brothers wrote to the tehsildar on August 2 the same year to know the process for repayment as they were clear they would only accept the rightful amount due to them. Surajmal sent the letter to the tehsildar by Speed Post. In 2016, the family’s cotton crop covered a little over two acres out of a total of 12 acres. and the Haryana government at the time had approved compensation of Rs 8,000 per acre. So, the payment should not have exceeded Rs 16,550. After no response from the tehsildar, Surajmal approached the CM’s window in 2016 and got a complaint number (000452) but there still was no progress. He then went to the CM’s residence in Chandigarh to lodge another complaint., where he handed yet another complaint to an official and sought a solution to his problem. However, no one in the Haryana government could tell him the correct way out of the issue. Surajmal even complained against the then Julana tehsildar, claiming that the revenue officer had deliberately transferred an extra amount of compensation to the family’s accounts to harass him, yet the same tehsildar was appointed every time to investigate the issue. “Whoever returns a misplaced purse is appreciated, but the Haryana government made me run from pillar to post for five years. So much for the claims of transparency,” an exasperated Surajmal told TOI. The farmer traced the source of his woes to an RTI he had filed in 2015 seeking details of the compensation awarded to cotton farmers whose crop was damaged in heavy rain and subsequent water logging in 2014. The RTI details, Surajmal claims, revealed that the revenue officials had distributed compensation wrongly. “Thereafter, I lodged a complaint with deputy commissioner and the Haryana government seeking action against those involved but nothing has happened so far, and struggle is on,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/farmer-runs-from-pillar-to-post-for-5-yrs-to-return-53k-to-govt/articleshow/85547632.cms||Vijender Kumar
---||Chandigarh||Afghan Sikhs, Hindus angry as MPs ‘sneak out’ to India||Ambala: The 260-odd Afghan Hindus and Sikhs left behind in Taliban-seized Kabul are angry with two of their MPs, Anarkali Kaur Honaryar and Narinder Singh Khalsa, who "sneaked out to India" from Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha, Karta-e-Parwan, on Saturday night. Indian official sources said 24 Afghans, including the two MPs, had boarded an Indian Air Force (IAF) C-17 to escape Kabul on Saturday night. The special repatriation flight with 168 Indians as well reached the Hindon airbase at Ghaziabad on Sunday morning. Out of the 285 Hindus and Sikhs who took shelter at the gurdwara, a mixed group of 70 and some Indians had made two attempts to enter the Kabul airport on Friday and Saturday. They waited for 43 hours as directed from India before the Taliban sent them back from the gates on Sunday morning, saying Afghans could not leave the country. The 70 Afghans, including MPs Honaryar and Narinder Singh had returned to either their homes in Kabul or the gurdwara. The remaining members gathered at the gurdwara on Sunday for reciting Sukhmani Sahib to pray for their safety. They cursed their leaders for ditching them. Sources in Kabul said that on Saturday evening, Honaryar had talked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a call about the safety of those stuck in Afghanistan. A Jalalabad Sikh who was part of the first group that tried to escape said: "The entire sangat of 260 is distressed and sitting at the Guru's house in Kabul. Our MPs’ chose to save themselves before evacuating us. We are unaware how they managed it when we were sent back. Reportedly, they received some calls and got their families out secretly. How could they? We sat with them near the airport for two days amid firing." He said: "We are being told that we will also be evacuated. Gurdwara president Gurnam Singh, brother-in-law of MP Narinder Singh, is in contact with some relief organisations. I sit her after shutting my medicine shop. All the Jalalabad Sikhs have come to Kabul, carrying their faith in Waheguru." Another Sikh out of those 70 said: "The sangat is cross with the MPs the way they left and now Gurnam Singh says there will be daily evacuation." Upon arrival at Hindon, Afghan MP Narinder Singh broke down before the media and said: "We have lived in Afghanistan for generations but never saw anything like this. Everything we built un the last 20 years is finished." External affairs ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi tweeted on Sunday: "Evacuation continues! IAF special repatriation flight with 168 passengers onboard, including 107 Indian nationals, is on its way to Delhi from Kabul." Global Sikh Council member Paramjeet Singh Bedi of New York was angry with the Afghan MPs for a different reason, saying: "We told them to reach India quietly and not go to the media. Yet they uploaded their photos from Kabul. Now they have escaped and we have Sikh families to save. India asked for 23 name and we sent the MPs out first." World Punjabi Organisation president Vikramjit Singh Sahney tweeted "Evacuation flight… incl 24 #afghansikhs landing at Hindon… at 10 am. US agrees… 2 flights daily to India to evacuate 1,000 Indians and 260 Afghan Sikhs. Efforts by @MEAIndia @DrSJaishankar @M_Lekhi @wpoindia @sunfoundationIn #rehablitation." Sahney said "We set up a war room with the MEA. These Sikhs and Hindus didn’t want to leave behind their sources of livelihood in Afghanistan, and we didn’t want a repeat of 1947. It was hard convincing them to save their lives and let go of their legacy, business, and way of life. Being a refugee is stigma to them. They were once very prosperous." Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh also tweeted on Sunday: "Happy to note that 209 Indian nationals were safely evacuated to Delhi with 24 Afghan Sikhs …#MEA is working on evacuating another 222 Afghan Sikhs & Hindus." Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa said: "I thank the PM, foreign minister, and the home minister, since coordinating the airlift was a marathon exercise."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/afghan-sikhs-hindus-angry-as-mps-sneak-out-to-india/articleshow/85547665.cms||JK Singh

A village comprising just 334 families has adopted whole-heartedly smart farming practices with focus on water resource conservation and management along with improving sanitation, health and cleanliness. Termed as WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) activities rolled out by ITC Mission Sunehra Kal (MSK) in partnership with FINISH Society and NGO Manav Vikas Sansthan, the programme basically supports schools with construction and repair of toilet units with hand-washing stations, mid-day meal shed and open air classrooms. To ensure assets created are well maintained at Nurpur Lubana, FINISH team has sensitized the school management committee and families of children to contribute towards the maintenance. As a result, around Rs 17 lakh was contributed by the communities towards building and maintenance of school infrastructure. All infrastructure design ensures that the special needs of different genders and differently-abled children are met. Another important component of the programme has been solid waste management. It facilitates collection and management 2.6 MT of solid waste per day. Local mohalla committees have been formed to ensure source segregation, no littering and promoting decentralised waste composting at home as well as ward level. A centralised material recovery facility (MRF) has been set up by the gram panchayat under MNREGA scheme and is operated under the technical supervision of FINISH. “Mission Sunehra Kal aims at developing rural economy through improving sustainable agriculture practices, natural resources conservation and their comprehensive management along with creating awareness on health and hygiene issues to improve quality of lives,” senior programme manager Binoy Menon said. Jarnail Singh, sarpanch of Nurpur Lubana, said the village was grappling with problems of solid and liquid waste management, poor school infrastructure and low agricultural output. But with support from MSK and its partners, these problems have been addressed. In Kapurthala district, MSK’s intervention starts with the promotion of improved agriculture practices, soil moisture conservation. MSK team, in partnership with the NGO, has divided agriculture practices on the basis of climate smartness parameters like seed smart, nutrient smart, weather smart, water smart, energy smart & knowledge smart. Their main focus is on complete village development and transfer it into climate smart village, build resilience and improve farm income through enhancing the crop productivity. A holistic approach has been adopted to reach out to farmers in managing the paddy straw and since the project inception in 2018, the village has seen no case of stubble burning. The programme is also piloting a waste water stabilization and management solution with support from the gram panchayat and technical guidance from Punjab Pollution Control Board through MVS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/school-programme-helps-kapurthala-village-take-a-smart-leap/articleshow/85547805.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||5 months on, classes 9-12 in Karnataka to resume today||BENGALURU: After a gap of five months, schools are set to reopen on Monday for grades 9-12 in districts that have a test positivity rate of less than 2%. While schools will reopen with protocols in place, several of them are unlikely to operate buses and vans to pick up and drop students. “It is not viable to run the vans. In many state board schools, high school children do not use school vans. While we can maintain Covid protocols in schools, we are worried about the children’s commute from home to school,” said D Shashi Kumar, secretary, Association of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka. Many private schools where online classes are being held in full swing have said parents are unwilling to send students to the campus. Private schools have said it is impractical for them to conduct classes online and offline simultaneously. Manoj Padikkal, chairman, school transport wing south zone, Bus and Car Operators’ Confederation of India, said most schools would wait and watch the situation, and added that most parents would drop and pick up children on their own in the initial days. According to Padikkal, many factors must be taken into consideration. “The cost of diesel has gone up by Rs 32 since the pre-Covid times. While the Covid protocol demands buses to be filled only up to 50%, the price of the diesel and the salary of driver remain the same. We have to increase the transport fees. While we have a fixed monthly fee system in some schools, we deal with the parents directly in the other system,” he said. Many parents to wait and watch for a weekWe teachers will run but four the buses manage for ment has decided not to run them for students. Cost is a big factor. We are not sure whether students will turn up daily. It is difficult to coordinate. What if we get our drivers back on rolls and there’s another lockdown?” said a principal from a prominent chain of schools. The fear of the virus is also a major factor, say school managements. “None of our parents has booked the van. They are still concerned about the virus. Only 20% of parents have so far sent consent forms. Others want to watch for a week,” said Suprit BR, secretary of Oxford Institutions, Ullal. "I urge cabinet colleagues to visit campuses in their districts, encourage students, teachers and review the precautionary measures... We decided to reopen schools and colleges considering the future of our children. All safety measures have been taken... I appeal to parents to encourage their children to attend physical classes and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour," chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/5-months-on-classes-9-12-in-karnataka-to-resume-today/articleshow/85551101.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Both, Rubina Francis (shooting) and Prachi Yadav (canoeing), hail from humble background and have toiled hard to reach this far. Their struggle, hard work and success have inspired several other athletes in the state. After Vivek Sagar (hockey) and Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar (shooting), MP Shooting Academy prodigy Rubina Francis, a para shooter, is raring to set the Paralympic shooting range on fire. She had won the quota for India to represent in the Tokyo Paralympic, earlier this year. Daughter of a mechanic, Rubina, also has the credit of setting a new world record in 10m Air Pistol Para Women event at the Para World Cup shooting held in Lima, Peru in June. Rubina, 21, had won the gold medal for the country by setting a junior world record in the 10m Air Pistol Women Team Event of the World Shooting Para Sports Championship held in Bangkok in the year 2017 and bronze medal in the World Shooting Para Sports World Cup held in Croatia in the year 2019. Athletes are bringing laurels, says sports minister ScindiaRubina’s father, Simon Francis, is a mechanic based in Jabalpur. Simon said, “I have heard from people that the Olympic is the final dream for any athlete. What to say after this that my daughter will represent the country in the mega event from among the 1.3 billion people of the country.” Rubina, who has been learning the nuances of the sport at the Madhya Pradesh State Shooting Academy since 2017, has made MP proud by winning 12 medals including 10 gold, 2 silver medals in the national para shooting competitions so far. Same is the story of canoer Prachi Yadav. Former national coach Mayank Thakur who is also from Bhopal will accompany her in Tokyo. Gwalior’s Prachi will be the only entry from India in this category at the mega event. Yadav was a champion para-swimmer for India, but switched to paracanoe at the behest of her coach, Thakur who realised she had a better chance of getting to Paralympics. Coach Thakur said, “She will be India’s one of the biggest medal hopes in the Tokyo Paralympic. She has been working hard to prove her mettle at the mega event.” Incidentally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had even called her a role model for the country. Prachi said, “I have no words to express my happiness at this moment. I had never thought of representing India for the Olympics. I will not let down the hopes of the country.” Prachi has a disability below her waist. “For a game like kayaking and canoeing, legs play an important role. As I can’t use my legs, I use the upper part of the body to move the boat. It becomes even more difficult when you are competing at the international level. However, with the help of coach Mayank Thakur sir and executive member of IOA BS Kushwaha, I could manage to reach this level in my career,” said Prachi. Hailing from a middleclass family, Prachi had lost her mother to cancer in 2003. “I have two siblings among whom I am the second. My father, Jagdish Yadav, is a retired government employee. It was not easy to take up canoeing as our financial condition was a big challenge,” said Prachi. Even for participating in the World Championship from which she has secured the qualification, she had to run sfrom pillar to post. “Coaches and other people helped me financially and sent me for the qualification event. I can’t repay the support they have given to me,” said Prachi. Sports minister Yashodhara Raje Scindia said, “Our athletes are bringing laurels. I have high hopes from both the athletes and wish them the best.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/from-humble-background-to-indias-medal-hopes-in-paralympics-rubina-prachi/articleshow/85551143.cms||Ramendra Singh

---||Gurgaon||In a first, Gurugram to get 4 stations to monitor noise||GURUGRAM: The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has decided to set up noise monitoring stations for the first time in the city. The move comes amid growing concern over noise levels breaching the permissible limits near hospitals and schools, officials said. Until now, Gurugram only recorded noise levels in the run-up to Diwali and for a few days after the festival. Each of these stations, which will come up at four places, will have a real-time monitoring system and a display board. The centralised system will monitor noise levels round-the-clock. “Yes, we are planning to set up noise monitoring stations in Gurugram,” HSPCB member secretary S Narayan confirmed. HSPCB already has a network of stations for real-time monitoring of air quality in the city. The noise monitoring stations will also come up in the same locations — Sector 51, Teri Gram, Vikas Sadan and Gwalpahari. Just like the ambient air quality index, the values of various parameters measured in the noise monitoring station will be transferred automatically through an online data network and stored in the central server system for analysis later. “This project will help our department prepare a database, identify the sources of noise pollution and take adequate action against them,” said an HSPCB official. Officials agreed that noise mapping, though essential for the city, was never done earlier. “We did not have the capacity to conduct such surveys,” he added. According to noise standards for automobiles, domestic appliances and construction equipment, which were notified in the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, noise level shouldn’t be over 55 dB in residential sectors, 65 dB in commercial areas and 75 dB in industrial zones. Near sensitive areas such as hospitals, the level of noise shouldn’t exceed 45 dB. At night, the limit is 45 dB in residential areas, 55dB in commercial zones and 70 dB in industrial hubs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/in-a-first-city-to-get-4-stns-to-monitor-noise/articleshow/85546170.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Businessman, son duped of Rs 20 lakh online||BHOPAL: An Arera Colony based factory owner/businessman and his son were allegedly duped to the tune of Rs 20 lakh by six fraudsters including two foreign nationals, who introduced themselves citizen of Ghana in West Africa on the pretext of procuring and supplying ‘Szanza oil’ to a Ghana-based commercial agriculture project. The accused lured the victims in their net through social media platforms and told him that the oil was used in making Ebola virus vaccine and horse food supplement. They asked the victims to procure two gallons of the oil from a Tamil Nadu-based company at the rate of Rs 10 lakh per gallon. However, the oil supplied to the victims was common edible oil. The bank account used by the accused to take money from the victims was found to be registered in the name of a firm in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. SHO Habibganj B S Prajapati said that complainant Jaibhagwan Sangwan, a resident of E-3/Arera Colony, runs a fabrication industry in Govindpura. Police suspect the involvement of a Nigerian cyber fraud gang in the case. The victim’s son met one of the accused, an African national, who introduced himself as an employee of Ghana based commercial agriculture company, in Mumbai but he was unaware of the conspiracy then. Habibganj police on Friday registered a case on charges of fraud, breach of trust and hatching criminal conspiracy against the six accused and launched a manhunt to nab them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-businessman-son-duped-of-rs-20-lakh-online/articleshow/85551267.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||‘Festive travel’ shoes on: Industry hit by Covid hopes for promising season||Nearly a year and a half after a Covid-induced lockdown threw it off course, the travel industry seems to have weathered the worst, at least for now. The sector has witnessed a revival since the second wave ebbed, and with the long Janmashtami weekend coming up, hotel bookings in both popular and offbeat destinations are set to see an uptick during the festive season. From hills in the north to beaches in the south, most places are already witnessing a return of tourists. Religious destinations and ones that are a short drive away from major cities are also seeing steady footfalls. With domestic tourism being the flavour of the season, even the newly-opened ITC WelcomHotel in Chail and Katra and Postcard Hotel’s Gir property are almost sold out. Properties like The Grand Dragon in Ladakh have received a huge boost, with hotel director Danish Din saying he is inundated with guests from across the country. Vishal Lonkar, GM (brand development), Renest Hotels & Resorts, said domestic tourism had salvaged the battered Indian hospitality sector in the post-Covid era. “People are now keen to travel for a change of space to enjoy and work. We are witnessing a steady spike in bookings for weekend getaways and staycations. Leisure destinations like Manali are picking pace faster than the business centres, so we are focussing on expansion in tourist hotspots such as Goa and Jim Corbett,” he said. Syed Junaid Altaf, MD, Empyrean Skyview Projects, said with Covid curbs easing, they are expecting a boom for local tourism. Katra has seen a 10% weekly growth rate in tourism and is now receiving over 5,000 pilgrims on a daily basis, he added. “Patnitop has seen the highest hotel occupancy, of about 70%, in the month of July in the past decade,” Altaf said, adding that the group expects good festive business at Skyview by Empyrean as well as its popular Skyview Gondola that transports tourists between Patnitop and Sanget. Anil Chadha, COO, ITC Hotels said the chain is seeing an overall upswing in occupancy across the country. “Motorable holidays and hill destinations are seeing tremendous demand. Welcomhotel Shimla, Tavleen Chail and The Savoy in Mussoorie have clocked high occupancies and continue to draw guests. Welcomhotel Coimbatore and Welcomhotel Amritsar are witnessing a similar trend,” he said. Ritu Mehrotra, regional manager (South Asia), Booking.com, said drivable destinations and road trips remain popular. Amanpreet Bajaj, GM, Airbnb India, Southeast Asia, also told TOI people are eager to book weekend getaways, from Delhi to the hills and Jaipur or from Mumbai to Lonavala, Mahabaleshwar and Alibag. A recent Airbnb survey found 69% of Indians were particularly interested in unique accommodations, such as heritage homes, farm stays, villas and havelis. Rajeev Kale, president & country head, Thomas Cook (India) Ltd, said whether it is zip-lining in Ladakh, a special photo shoot and lunch at an apple orchard in Manali, or a sea cart ride in the Andamans, new experiences are finding favour with tourists. Value add-ons are also being offered, like a special festive menu or a unique Diwali celebration night on tour. The upcoming festive season, especially the period of Durga Puja and Diwali, is already looking promising, said Daniel D’souza, president & country head, SOTC Travel. “Demand is primarily from family and extended family who prefer our group escorted tours or ad-hoc group products,” he said, listing Kashmir, Ladakh, Andamans and Goa as the most preferred domestic destinations. Sabina Chopra, co-founder and COO, Yatra.com, said the festive season usually sees people looking for a quick and short respite or travelling to meet their friends and family. This time around, several customised packages are on offer. “We have witnessed a hike in booking inquiries by 15-20%. Travellers want to explore accommodations that are secluded and less commercial, such as homestays, cottages, tents and heritage properties. Destinations like Jaipur, Lonavala, Leh, Puducherry, Kamshet and Uttarakhand have seen an increase in queries,” she said. Rahul Joshi, GM, Taj Hotel & Convention Centre, Agra, said queries are pouring in for September and October. “That is also the time when weather gets better and we move towards the high season for Agra. The growing demand for staycations, workcations and dining out in a safe and trusted ambience is clearly visible in the booking trends,” he told TOI. Kush Kapoor, CEO, Roseate Hotels & Resorts, also revealed The Roseate Ganges is sold out for most of the weekends in September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/festive-travel-shoes-on-industry-hit-by-covid-hopes-for-promising-season/articleshow/85546294.cms||Amin Ali

Among attractions to reopen are the Government Botanical Garden (GBG), Government Rose Garden (GRG) in Ooty, Sim’s Park in Coonoor, the Kattery Government Park, the Ooty boat house and the Pykhara boat house of the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation. Visitors should follow the standard operating procedure, a release from Nilgiris collector J Innocent Divya said. Hoteliers in the district welcomed the decision of the state government to reopen tourist spots. “Gardens and boat houses would attract more tourists to the hill retreat. The SOPs prescribed by the government will be followed strictly while accommodating tourists,” said a hotelier. Tourist cab operators and drivers, who had lost their business, said they hope to get more business in the coming days. Tourist spots in the Nilgiris were closed for visitors on April 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-tourist-attractions-in-nilgiris-ready-to-welcome-visitors/articleshow/85551272.cms||Shantha Thyagarajan
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Engineering campus placements see hike in offer; ML, AI trending||BENGALURU: With final placements starting in several top engineering colleges in Bengaluru, the institutions are expecting good response from companies and an increase in salary compensation for graduating students. On day one of the placement drive in RV College of Engineering last week, US-based start-up Clumio made a Rs 45.7-lakh annual compensation offer — the highest yet — to two candidates. California-based data software company Fivetran selected six candidates at Rs 40 lakh per annum CTC. “There is a 20-30% rise in the CTC (cost to company, or all-inclusive pay package) offered to our students compared to the previous batch. Twenty-three companies have extended 161 offers in which 119 are in the category of Rs 10 lakh and above; 36 in the category of Rs 20 lakh and above; and 12 in the bracket of Rs 30 lakh and above,” said RVCE principal KN Subramanya. Girl students bagged 30% of the offers. He added that all branches of engineering have opened their account in the very first week, which is “unusual”. Students are getting more offers, better pay packagesPES University said the highest annual compensation yet is Rs 40 lakh. Registrar KS Shridhar said they expect to see companies hiring a larger number of students this year. “At least 73 of the 120 pre-placement offers got converted into final placements,” he said. Savitha Rani M, head, training and placement department, Ramaiah Institute of Technology (RIT), agreed that the trending areas are ML, AI and data science. “The companies are asking for students who have completed projects in these areas,” she said. RIT started the 2022 placements in June. “The virtualisation has opened opportunities for students from companies of all parts of the world,” Savitha pointed out. SY Kulkarni, additional director, BNMIT, said students are getting more than one offer and better pay packages due to an increase in competition in the job market. For example, there is a big demand for AI & ML, full stack developer, data science and cybersecurity roles. “Students who have done certain certifications are being picked up fast. There is increase in internship offers too,” he added. ‘Response may get better than last year’University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering started its final placements three weeks ago. “Computer science, information science and electronics and communication continue to trend. Companies are hiring 10% more on campuses. Thus, the response is likely to get better than last year. Companies are lined up every week till September,” said BM Rajprakash, placement officer at UVCE. "The demand for niche areas like coding, artificial intelligence, machine learning and the internet of things has gone up. We expect companies to take more students and increase the average salary." KS Shridhar PES university registrar Savitha Rani M, head of training and placement department, Ramaiah Institute of Technology (RIT), said the trending areas were ML, AI and data science.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/engineering-campus-placements-see-hike-in-offer-ml-ai-trending/articleshow/85551337.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: A five-year plan to restore about 1,400 acres of Aravalis||GURUGRAM: The forest department is planning a conservation programme to restore the natural habitat of the Gurugram Aravalis. Around 1,400 acres of forest land between Naurangpur and Gairatpur Bas will be restored over five years. Under the programme, the department will first carry out an assessment of the local vegetation and wildlife. Saplings of native species will be planted accordingly and the area will be fenced. Teams will carry out regular maintenance and inspections to protect and reinstate the forest cover, officials said. Water bodies will also be restored or developed for wildlife, which will also give a boost to groundwater recharge. The project is in the planning stage at present, officials said. “The proposal has been sent to the Haryana principal chief conservator of forests for approval. After it is approved, we will invite expressions of interest for the preparation of a detailed project report,” Gurugram divisional forest officer Rajeev Tajyan told TOI. This project is vital for Delhi-NCR because since the 1990s, the Aravalis have been shrinking due to their proximity to the densely populated urban clusters of Gurugram and neighbouring areas, which has led to rampant illegal construction, deforestation and mining. Due to the fragmentation of the natural habitat by roads and an increase in traffic, the number of wildlife roadkills has gone up during the past decade, as well as leopard-human conflict incidents. Moreover, the forest area is declining due to pressure from fuelwood collection and cattle grazing. Forest officials said the habitat restoration plan will provide safety to the wealth of wildlife found in the Aravalis. A survey carried out over 2019 and 2020 by wildlife researchers supported by Centre for Ecology, Development and Research and WWF-India had found that the unprotected forest tracts in the Gurugram and Faridabad Aravalis harbour a rich variety of mammals, more than Asola Bhatti, the contiguous tract in Delhi that enjoys the status of a wildlife sanctuary. During the survey, striped hyenas, leopards, black-naped hares, Indian crested porcupines, small Indian mongooses and golden jackals were found to have healthy populations in Gurugram. The encounter rate of leopards is 2.7 per km in the Gurugram Aravalis compared to 1.4 in the Asola sanctuary, it had revealed. The area also includes numerous hills and cliffs covered by large-scale forests, apart from several patches of natural dry deciduous and scrub forests. “It is a habitat for numerous endangered mammal and bird species typical of the dry forests. The plan for its restoration is an ideal step towards maintaining ecological balance,” an official said. Apart from wildlife, this area protects critical water aquifers (underground layers of water-bearing rock) for Delhi-NCR and also helps moderate climatic extremes in this semi-arid zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/plan-to-restore-1400-acres-of-aravalis/articleshow/85544304.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||World||22 dead, many missing after 17 inches of rain in Tennessee||WAVERLY: At least 22 people were killed and rescue crews searched desperately Sunday amid shattered homes and tangled debris for dozens of people still missing after record-breaking rain sent floodwaters surging through Middle Tennessee. Saturday's flooding in rural areas took out roads, cellphone towers and telephone lines, leaving families uncertain about whether their loved ones survived the unprecedented deluge. Emergency workers were searching door to door, said Kristi Brown, a coordinator for health and safety supervisor with Humphreys County Schools. Many of the missing live in the neighborhoods where the water rose the fastest, said Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis, who confirmed the 22 fatalities in his county. The names of the missing were on a board in the county's emergency center and listed on a city department's Facebook page. ``I would expect, given the number of fatalities, that we're going to see mostly recovery efforts at this point rather than rescue efforts,'' Tennessee Emergency Management Director Patrick Sheehan said. The dead included twin babies who were swept from their father's arms, according to surviving family members, and a foreman at county music star Loretta Lynn's ranch. The sheriff of the county of about 18,000 people some 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Nashville said he lost one of his best friends. Up to 17 inches (43 centimeters) of rain fell in Humphreys County in less than 24 hours Saturday, shattering the Tennessee record for one-day rainfall by more than 3 inches (8 centimeters), the National Weather Service said. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee toured the area, calling it a ``devastating picture of loss and heartache.`` He stopped on Main Street in Waverly where some homes were washed off their foundations and people were sifting though their water-logged possessions. All around the county were debris from wrecked cars, demolished businesses and homes and a chaotic, tangled mix of the things inside. Shirley Foster cried as the governor walked up. She said she just learned a friend from her church was dead. ``I thought I was over the shock of all this. I'm just tore up over my friend. My house is nothing, but my friend is gone,'' Foster told the governor. The hardest-hit areas saw double the rain that area of Middle Tennessee had in the previous worst-case scenario for flooding, meteorologists said. Lines of storms moved over the area for hours, wringing out a record amount of moisture _ a scenario scientists have warned may be more common because of global warming. The downpours rapidly turned the creeks that run behind backyards and through downtown Waverly into raging rapids. Business owner Kansas Klein stood on a bridge Saturday in the town of 4,500 people and saw two girls who were holding on to a puppy and clinging to a wooden board sweep past, the current too fast for anyone to grab them. He hadn't found out what happened to them. Not far from the bridge, Klein told The Associated Press by phone that dozens of buildings in a low-income housing area known as Brookside appeared to have borne the brunt of the flash flood from Trent Creek. ``It was devastating: buildings were knocked down, half of them were destroyed,'' Klein said. ``People were pulling out bodies of people who had drowned and didn't make it out.'' The Humphreys County Sheriff Office Facebook page filled with people looking fo r missing friends and family. GoFundMe pages were made asking for help for funeral expenses for the dead, including 7-month-old twins yanked from their father's arms as they tried to escape. The foreman at Lynn's ranch, Wayne Spears, also was killed. ``He's out at his barn and next thing you know, he goes from checking animals in the barn to hanging on in the barn to people seeing him floating down the creek. And that's how fast it had come up,'' the sheriff said. A photo taken by someone at the ranch showed Spears in a cowboy hat clinging to a pillar in brown, churning water up to his chest. ``Wayne's just one of those guys, he just does everything for everybody, if there's a job to do,'' said his friend Michael Pate, who met Spears at the ranch 15 years ago. At the Cash Saver grocery in in Waverly, employees stood on desks, registers and a flower rack as the waters from the creek that's usually 400 feet (120 meters) from the store rushed in after devastating the low income housing next door. At one point, they tried to break through the celling into the attic and couldn't, store co-owner David Hensley said. The flood waters stopped rising as fast just as the situation was getting dire and a rescue boat came by. ``We told him that if there's somebody else out there you can get, go get them, we think we're OK,'' Hensley said. At the beginning of a news conference on Tropical Storm Henri's impact on New England, President Joe Biden offered condolences to the people of Tennessee and directed federal disaster officials to talk with the governor and offer assistance. Just to the east of Waverly, the town of McEwen was pummeled Saturday with 17.02 inches (43.2 centimeters) of rain, smashing the state's 24-hour record of 13.6 inches (34.5 centimeters) from 1982, according to the National Weather Service in Nashville, though Saturday's numbers would have to be confirmed. A flash flood watch was issued for the area before the rain started, with forecasters saying 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) of rain was possible. The worst storm recorded in this area of Middle Tennessee only dropped 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain, said Krissy Hurley, a weather service meteorologist in Nashville. ``Forecasting almost a record is something we don't do very often,'' Hurley said. ``Double the amount we've ever seen was almost unfathomable.'' Recent scientific research has determined that extreme rain events will become more frequent because of man-made climate change. Hurley said it is impossible to know its exact role in Saturday's flood, but noted in the past year her office dealt with floods that used to be expected maybe once every 100 years in September south of Nashville and in March closer to the city. ``We had an incredible amount of water in the atmosphere,'' Hurley said of Saturday's flooding. ``Thunderstorms developed and moved across the same area over and over and over.'' The problem isn't limited to Tennessee. A federal study found man-made climate change doubles the chances of the types of heavy downpours that in August 2016 dumped 26 inches (66 centimeters) of rain around Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Those floods killed at least 13 people and damaged 150,000 homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/22-dead-many-missing-after-17-inches-of-rain-in-tennessee/articleshow/85551382.cms||---

This test, the officials said, can be used to determine the sex of a foetus through further genetic testing. While NIPT is legal in India, the test is allowed to be used only to detect genetic disorders in the embryo, such as cystic fibrosis, thalassemia, sickle cell anaemia, phenylketonuria, among others. This test analyses small fragments of DNA circulating in a pregnant woman’s blood. “Blood samples of pregnant women were taken to conduct NIPT at labs. This procedure can only be carried out at registered genetic clinics and by qualified and registered persons under the Pre-Conception and Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques Act & Rules 1994 /1996 (PCPNDT Act/Rules). However, this collection centre at the private lab is not registered under PCPNDT Act/Rules. A sample was taken by unqualified persons at the lab in gross violation of Section 3 of PNDT Act,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon. The raid was carried out by the health department on a tip-off that the centre had not maintained a mandatory record of pregnant women and the lab had not taken mandatory consent of pregnant women before carrying out the genetic study. Following this tip-off, a health department team sent a pregnant woman to the lab for NIPT. The decoy’s blood sample was taken at the lab and it was sent to two labs in Sector 14 and in Delhi’s Rohini for processing. The team observed that the labs, which processed the samples did not follow the protocol for sample collection, testing procedure and mandatory documentation as required under PNDT Act. The team found that the lab used to charge Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000 per test. A case was filed at Sector 65 police station on Saturday against the three labs under sections 3, 4, 5, 29 read with rules 9, 10, 14, 18 PCPNDT Act/Rules punishable under Section 23 and under sections 34, 120 B, 420 and 406 of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/3-labs-booked-for-prenatal-testing-without-permission/articleshow/85544350.cms||Ipsita Pati

The residents said the MCG had allotted a tender in March 2020 and sanctioned Rs 2.3 crore for the construction of a stormwater drain in the colony which was supposed to be completed within a year. The contract was given to a private company, but the contractor had illegally sublet the work to a relative of a senior MCG official, they alleged. Zorawar Singh Sahu, a resident, said, “Infrastructure development executed by the contractor is of poor quality and was done without following the basic layout and technical specification for laying the drainage line in the colony. Such substandard work is a waste of public money.” The residents have submitted a complaint to the MCG chief and sought a vigilance probe against the contractor and MCG officials involved. They have also demanded the payment of the contractor to be withheld. RK Yadav, RWA president said, “The construction of drainage network was supposed to be completed before the monsoon but till date it is only half done. When we asked about it, we found out that the work was sublet. We have made several complaints to MCG officials about the substandard work, but all our pleas have fallen on deaf ears.” Residents said they are upset with the MCG’s “apathetic attitude” towards civic issues. Balbir Singh, RWA vice-president, said, “The contractor has left the pits open. We keep seeing cars getting stuck in the pits. A resident also fell into one of them and suffered injuries.” Sumit Kumar, joint commissioner of MCG, said, “I am not aware of the issue. However, I will look into it. If there is any negligence on part of any official, action will be taken accordingly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/residents-allege-substandard-work-in-laying-stormwater-drain-seek-probe/articleshow/85544380.cms||Akanksha Gupta

In a response to a question tabled by Congress MLA Varun Chaudhary, the state education department has noted that over 13,000 posts of PGTs, who teach classes 11 and 12, and 11,000 posts of TGTs, who teach students up to class X, are currently vacant. The Congress MLA has also sought details of the total vacancies from the state government. The education department has noted that against the requirement of over 39,000 PGT lectures in the state, only 26,000 are currently appointed. Similarly, total sanctioned posts for TGTs are 37,000, but the state government has employed only 26,000. Responding to the query on the status of the Mewat cadre, the department said that of the sanctioned posts of over 3,500 only 2,500 posts are currently filled. The department further noted that it has initiated the process of filling up these posts and sent a letter to the Haryana Staff Selection Committee for the same. Meanwhile, the teachers’ unions said that the state government has failed to deliver on its election promise of filling the vacancies. “There’s a tremendous workload on teachers and the government, instead of filling up the sanctioned posts, are closing the schools,” said Dushyant Thakran, district head of Haryana Prathmik Shikshak Sangh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/33-of-posts-for-pg-teachers-lying-vacant-in-haryana/articleshow/85544404.cms||---
---||Noida||Give jobs back to ambulance workers, health dept will write to private firm||Ghaziabad: The health department has decided to write to the private company operating ambulances on behalf of the state government to reinstate drivers and emergency medical technicians who were removed recently. Officials said they would highlight in their letter the work these ambulance workers did when the pandemic raged a few months ago. As many as 27 workers from Ghaziabad have been removed by the company. Most of them have been finding it difficult to run their houses in the absence of any income. “We have received letters from the sacked employees who were working with the emergency service for several years. We are concerned about their situation. We will write a letter this week itself, urging the company to take them back. We will suggest they take an undertaking from the employees that they won’t violate the service rules,” said GK Mishra, the district malaria officer. Trouble started after the state government gave the contract of operating ambulances to a new agency. The company allegedly sought to remove the old drivers and recruit its own staff, which became the bone of contention. The employees alleged that the new firm had even asked for a security deposit of Rs 20,000 to hire them again. These workers have also been demanding that they be employed under the national health mission (NHM) and given a pay hike. A few weeks earlier, ambulance workers across the state struck work over these demands. Keys to ambulances were taken away and the drivers were warned against continuing with the strike. But after they joined work, 27 employees were removed in Ghaziabad alone. Across the state, more than 3,300 old ambulance employees are believed to have been removed. “We have been pursuing the matter with the district administration and the health department for some time now. So far, no action has been taken,” said Brij Mohan, president of the drivers’ union in Ghaziabad. “A meeting of the company representatives, the drivers’ union and the labour department is scheduled to take place in Lucknow this week. We are hopeful of positive results,” he added. Ambulance workers are battling tough times. “We have been facing a huge financial crisis because of this decision by the company. We worked in tandem with the district administration during the pandemic and never shied away from duties. Even during the strike called by the union last month, we carried on with our emergency duties,” said Manoj Kumar, an emergency technician.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/give-jobs-back-to-ambulance-workers-health-dept-will-write-to-private-firm/articleshow/85544508.cms||Aditya Dev
---||World||Joe Biden says US unwavering in Afghanistan evacuations; Taliban beat back crowd at airport||KABUL/WASHINGTON: The United States has an unwavering commitment to getting US citizens and at-risk Afghans out of Afghanistan, President Joe Biden said, as Taliban fighters beat back thousands desperate to flee outside Kabul airport on Sunday. Biden said the security situation in Afghanistan was changing rapidly and his administration was under no illusions about the threat from Islamic State militants in Afghanistan known as ISIS-K (for Khorasan). The Taliban, which seized power in Afghanistan last week as the United States and its allies withdrew troops after a 20-year war, fired in the air and used batons to force people to form queues outside the airport, witnesses said. On Saturday, seven Afghans were killed in a crush at the gates. A Nato official said at least 20 people had died in the past seven days in and around the airport. Some were shot and others died in stampedes, witnesses have said. "Let me be clear, the evacuation of thousands from Kabul is going to be hard and painful" and would have been "no matter when it began," Biden said in a briefing at the White House. "We have a long way to go and a lot could still go wrong." Biden said he had directed the State Department to contact Americans stranded in Afghanistan by phone, email and other means, and the United States had a plan to move them to the airport. "We're executing a plan to move groups of these Americans to safety and to safely and effectively move them to the airport compound. For security reasons, I'm not going to go into detail ... but I will say again today what I've said before: Any American who wants to get home will get home." Afghan allies of the West and vulnerable Afghans such as women activists and journalists would be helped too, he said. On Sunday, there were no major injuries as gunmen beat back the crowds, according to witnesses. The Taliban had been "cooperative" about extending the airport perimeter, Biden said. Asked by a reporter whether the United States would extend an Aug. 31 deadline for evacuations, Biden replied: "Our hope is we will not have to extend but there are going to be discussions I suspect on how far along we are in the process." CIVILIAN AIRCRAFTThe United States on Sunday sought the help of six commercial airlines to transport people after their evacuation from Afghanistan. Biden said people were being assisted by more than two dozen countries in four continents. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called a virtual meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy nations for Tuesday to "ensure safe evacuations, prevent a humanitarian crisis and support the Afghan people". Britain plans to push world leaders to consider new sanctions on the Taliban when the G7 meets, sources told Reuters. Biden said he would support that effort, depending on the conduct of the Taliban. Panicked Afghans have tried to board flights out of Kabul since last weekend, fearing reprisals and a return to a harsh version of Islamic law the Sunni Muslim group exercised while in power two decades ago. Leaders of the Taliban, who have sought to show a more moderate face since capturing Kabul, have begun talks on forming a government. OPPOSITIONThey face opposition from forces in northern Afghanistan, which said this weekend they had taken three districts close to the Panjshir valley. Anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Massoud said on Sunday he hoped to hold peaceful talks with the Islamist movement but that his forces in the Panjshir - remnants of army units, special forces and militiamen - were ready to fight. "We want to make the Taliban realise that the only way forward is through negotiation," he said. "We do not want a war to break out." The Taliban said hundreds of their fighters were heading towards Panjshir, showing a video on Twitter of a column of captured trucks with the white Taliban flag but still bearing their government markings moving along a highway. The United States and other countries including Britain have brought in several thousand troops to help evacuate foreign citizens and at-risk Afghans from Kabul, but have been careful to avoid clashes with the Taliban. A Taliban official said: "We are seeking complete clarity on foreign forces' exit plan". Taliban political office spokesman Mohammed Naeem told Saudi-owned Al Hadath TV that talks are ongoing with the United States and other countries. He said al Qaeda is not present in Afghanistan and the Taliban has no relationship with it. Afghans who fled in the past week have spoken about their despair at leaving loved ones behind. "It was very difficult to leave," a veiled woman told Reuters in Qatar. "I love my country." The World Health Organization and U.N. children's agency UNICEF called for a humanitarian air bridge to deliver aid to Afghanistan to help more than 18 million people in need. U.S. Army Major General William Taylor said on Saturday that the United States in the past week had evacuated 17,000 people, including 2,500 Americans, from Kabul. On one of the flights, an Afghan woman gave birth on board moments after landing at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Saturday, the U.S. Air Force said on Twitter. The woman delivered a baby girl in the cargo bay of a C-17 aircraft. The mother and baby were in good condition, the tweet said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-says-us-unwavering-in-afghanistan-evacuations-taliban-beat-back-crowd-at-airport/articleshow/85551446.cms||---
---||Ghaziabad||Why Indirapuram needs an overhaul of its drains||GHAZIABAD: Indirapuram’s three decades-old drainage system is unable to keep pace with unplanned construction in the township. Most of Indirapuram’s drains are either choked or disappeared due to encroachments and for want of upkeep on the part of the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA). The drain running parallel to the CISF road towards Ahimsa Khand 2, the one flowing parallel to Aditya Mall and the one that runs between Shipra Sun City and Jaipuria Mall are all choked and encroached upon. Resident groups have long been complaining to the GDA about the choked sewer lines, but their complaints seem to have so far fallen on deaf ears. Alok Kumar of Fed AOA, an umbrella RWA body, said, “Indirapuram is spread over an area of 1,222 acres and the existing water pipes, sewer lines and drainage network were laid way back in 1990. The GDA then planned the township to be a low population density area, but over the years the authority has increased the floor area ratio (FAR) due to which more societies have come up and the population has risen too.” “The Fed AOA, in 2016, moved the Allahabad high court and subsequently the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to get the township’s drainage problems resolved, but except for a few work here and there, GDA has not done anything concrete,” he added. The GDA, on the direction of courts, had reviewed the drainage problems in Indirapuram and even hired a private consultant to prepare a detailed report on the issues. According to officials, the overhaul of the entire sewer and drainage infrastructure would cost the GDA a whopping Rs 800 crore but will help sustain the township for another 30 years. But barring the laying of sewer lines on the CISF road, where work has been going on for about two years now, nothing has been done. Ashish Kumar, a resident of Supertech Icon, said, “Along the CISF road, the drain space has been covered completely by commercial establishments with concrete. As a result, drain water finds its way into people’s toilets on the ground floor of societies on a low gradient, especially in Ahimsa Khand 2.” DK Pandey, a resident of Arihant Harmony, echoed similar sentiments. “The drain space along Aditya Mall has been encroached upon, which serves as the parking space. At many places, the concrete slab has been damaged and vendors dump civic waste right into the drain leading to its clogging.” AK Choudhary, a GDA official in-charge of the township, said, “To deal with the problem, we carry out anti-encroachment drives in the township from time to time. Apart from this, a new sewer line is being laid on the CISF road, which is connected to the township’s STP. Once in operation, it will take care of the township's drainage problem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/why-indirapuram-needs-an-overhaul-of-its-drains/articleshow/85544580.cms||---

Officials said almost half the land had already been procured. An online review meeting was held on Sunday among officials of the land records, industries and other departments, when the GNIDA CEO directed officials to set up camps in the villages so that the process of acquiring land could be expedited. The eight industrial sectors will come up in Ecotech 7, 8, 9, 12A, 16, 19, 19A and 21 sectors. Some of the villages where land is being procured include Pauvari, Imalyaka, Atai Muradpur, Luksar, Ladpura and Sirsa. “Over the past few years, industries have shown ample interest in investing in Greater Noida. This can be gauged from the fact that 46 plots, ranging between 1,000 sqmt and 20 acres, were allotted this year despite the pandemic. This will generate an income of about Rs 268 crore for the authority. Investments worth Rs 2,000 crore and job opportunities for about 8,200 people will be generated from these allotments,” said Narendra Bhooshan, the GNIDA CEO. According to Bhooshan, companies based in foreign countries were also eager to get land in the region. “We are making provisions for land to companies according to their demand. Keeping this in mind, eight new industrial sectors will come up on 900 hectares that will be purchased from farmers at the rate of Rs 3,500 per sqmt,” said Bhooshan, who has directed officials to ensure quick payments to villagers from whom land was taken. Of late, several electronic companies based in South Korea and China have shown interest in setting up industry in Greater Noida. After LG and Samsung, two more Korean companies — Dreamtech India Pvt Ltd and Starion India Pvt Ltd — have bought 40 acres between them in Ecotech 10 for setting up plants. They are likely to invest around Rs 433 crore and generate jobs for over 3,500 youths. Earlier, five Korean companies, mostly manufacturers of mobile phones and accessories, had bought 87 acres in Greater Noida, promising to invest over Rs 1,150 crore and create job opportunities for over 8,700 people. One of the reasons industries are showing interest in the region is GNIDA’s policy of allotting land within 30 days of applications, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gnida-plans-to-set-up-eight-new-industrial-sectors-on-900-hectares/articleshow/85544642.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||World||Rare tropical storm lashes northeastern United States||NEW YORK: Tropical Storm Henri slammed into Rhode Island on the US east coast Sunday, knocking out power to thousands of Americans, uprooting trees and bringing record rainfall before weakening as it moved across New England. The storm -- earlier downgraded from a Category 1 Hurricane -- hit land near the town of Westerly at approximately 12:15 PM (1615 GMT), the National Weather Service said. Henri is a rare tropical storm to strike America's northeastern seaboard and comes as the surface layer of oceans warms due to climate change. The warming is causing cyclones to become more powerful and carry more water, posing an increasing threat to the world's coastal communities, scientists say. Millions of residents in New England and New York's Long Island had been told to prepare for violent winds, days without electricity and storm surges of up to five feet. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Henri brought maximum sustained gusts of 60 mph, lower than the 75 mph gusts predicted earlier. Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee said there was "significant flooding" in areas. There were no immediate reports of any casualties. By mid-afternoon the NHC had lifted all surge warnings and initial reports from residents indicated the storm was not as bad as projections feared although in Groton, Connecticut fallen trees threatened some homes. "We dodged a bullet," James Kiker, of Newport, Rhode Island, told AFP, saying he saw only "minimal damage" in his area, including a few broken branches. Residents on Long Island, home to the plush Hamptons villages where wealthy New Yorkers retreat in summer, expressed relief that the storm's path had skirted east of them. "I will continue to stay alert as still plenty of wind, rain and surging seas await us but I am breathing a little easier," Amy Pedatella, a 46-year-old property manager who spent Saturday securing seaside homes in the Hamptons, told AFP. In Newark, New Jersey, flash flooding caused havoc with emergency services rescuing 86 people, including 16 children, from submerged vehicles. In Helmetta, 30 miles south, volunteer firefighters waded through water waist deep to help evacuate residents from waterlines rising dangerously close to their homes. Some 79,000 people lost power in Rhode Island and another 33,000 suffered blackouts in Connecticut, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us. More than 200 flights were canceled at Newark airport while New York's LaGuardia and JFK airports canceled almost 200 between them, they said. President Joe Biden ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate disaster relief efforts in Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York, where Governor Andrew Cuomo deployed 500 National Guard soldiers. "We're doing everything we can now to help those states prepare, respond and recover," he told reporters. The NHC said in its 5:00 pm advisory that winds had reduced to 40 mph and "additional weakening" of the storm was expected as it scales down to a tropical depression during the evening. Henri missed New York City by several miles but still caused tropical storm conditions overnight and throughout Sunday, where a flash flood warning was in effect until 5:45 pm. Rain late Saturday forced New York to halt a star-studded Central Park concert billed as a "homecoming" for a metropolis hard hit by the pandemic. An announcer cut off pop legend Barry Manilow mid-song to urge revelers to proceed swiftly but calmly to the nearest exit. The National Weather Service said 1.94 inches of rain fell in the park between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm Saturday, the wettest hour on record in the city of eight million people. By the time it blows out, Henri is expected to have produced three to six inches of rain (7.5 to 15 centimeters) across the region, with isolated maximum totals near 12 inches, the NHC said. Before the downgrade, Henri was set to be the first hurricane to hit New England in 30 years. Hurricane Bob in 1991 killed at least 17 people. The warnings also reignited memories of Hurricane Sandy, a more powerful storm that knocked out power for much of Manhattan and flooded subways in 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/rare-tropical-storm-lashes-northeastern-united-states/articleshow/85551467.cms||---
---||Noida||Parking tussle over licence fee leaves Noida residents in lurch||NOIDA: The tussle between the Noida Authority and parking contractors over the payment of licence fees for the lockdown period has left residents confused over the status of bonafide parking lots in the city. While the Authority earlier used to operate 90 surface parking lots, only 54 are currently operational in the city. Vehicle owners say the so-called attendants often take money from them even at undesignated parking lots. And with no immediate solution to streamline the operations of the surface parking lots in the offing, the contractors have moved the Allahabad high court against the Noida Authority’s demand for licence fees during the lockdown period last month. Hearing in the case is slated for next week, sources have said. “We were given exemption last year for the lockdown period. However, this time the Authority is demanding the licence fees for the lockdown period. We have sought exemption for the curfew period that was imposed by the UP government,” said a parking contractor, who did not wish to be named. “Also, the Noida Authority does not fulfil its own obligations mentioned in the licence agreement, and hence we moved the court.” The genesis of this problem dates back to June 20, 2018. In order to monitor the day-to-day operations of the 90 surface parking lots in an efficient manner, the Authority officials came up with a plan to demarcate the city into five clusters. Subsequently, the Authority clubbed multiple surface parking lots together and offered it to a single contractor who was willing to pay the licence fees for operating multiple lots. Senior manager of Noida’s traffic cell, AS Sharma said, “Three clusters are operational at present, out of the five ones. Also multi-level parking complexes in the Sector 18 market and Botanical Garden metro station are being run under our direct supervision.” Confusion, however, prevails among the motorists about the status of the operational lots. “Clarity on the status of parking lots is highly essential for daily commuters and families staying in Noida. If the Authority can do so much beautification work and painting on the streets, how difficult it is to clearly demarcate the designated parking lots across the city,” said Brajesh Sharma, a resident of Sector 78. General secretary of the Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA), Rajesh Sahay added, “Boards can be put up with the cell phone numbers of the nodal officials of the Noida Authority and parking supervisors to avoid confrontation between the residents and attendants. Even though the amount in question is trivial, Noida needs to set up protocols that are emulated by other cities.” Though the Authority has provisions to impose penalties on the contractors, action is rarely initiated against the offenders. Officials, on the contrary, said that the list of the operational parking lots in the city is already there on the Authority’s website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/parking-tussle-over-licence-fee-leaves-residents-in-lurch/articleshow/85544781.cms||Shalabh

Sources said Pakistan’s National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) held a meeting on Saturday and decided that only individuals having valid vaccination certificate would be allowed to enter Pakistan through the corridor or the Attari-Wagah international border. Other conditions include having a negative RT-PCR report less than 72 hours old. The pilgrims will also have to undergo a rapid test on arrival in Pakistan and will be sent back if they test positive. On March 16, 2020, both India and Pakistan had temporarily suspended the day long pilgrimage in wake of Covid 19. On October 2, 2020, Pakistan announced to unilaterally open the pilgrimage, but India is yet to reciprocate. Sources said it had also been decided that as per non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), an outdoor gathering of a maximum of 300 individuals was allowed in Pakistan with adherence to stringent Covid19 protocols including mask wearing and social distancing. Evacuee Trust Property Board and Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee are to ensure the presence of only 300 at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/corridor-not-open-pak-sets-vaccine-condition/articleshow/85551513.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The accommodations will come up in Sector Ecotech 3 and for the shramik hostel, a nominal bed fee would be charged. It will have two blocks for men and women, along with a dining area, kitchen, caretaker’s office, toilets, a record room, a check post and a common space. There will be 48 beds for men and 36 for women. The charges are yet to be fixed. The night shelter will have 48 beds for men and 48 for women. It will have toilet blocks and storerooms as well. While the designs have been prepared by the planning department of the development authority, estimates are being readied by the project department to float tenders for construction. “Many young men and women from across the state and also from other states come to the city looking for work and most of them are from economically weaker sections of the society. It is a challenge for them to find a place to stay, especially with limited resources. To address these issues, we have decided to build a shramik hostel in Sector Ecotech 3,” said Narendra Bhooshan, the chief executive officer (CEO), GNIDA. At a time, 84 people can stay in the hostel, he added. GNIDA also plans to set up a permanent night shelter near the hostel. Usually in winters, temporary night shelters are readied near Pari Chowk and some other areas of Greater Noida. “The new night shelter will be a single-storey building that can accommodate 96 people at a time,” said a senior official from the authority. The night shelters are usually free facilities.  “The designs have been prepared by the planning department of the authority and the estimates are being worked out. Once these are approved, we will float tenders to select companies that can take up the construction work. We intend to have both the facilities ready soon,” Bhooshan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gr-noida-to-set-up-hostel-for-migrant-workers-permanent-night-shelter/articleshow/85544836.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
