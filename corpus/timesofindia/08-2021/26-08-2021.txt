Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has decided to operate 42 such buses on 10 routes from three places — RR Gate (Rajarajeshwari Nagar), Bengaluru University Gate and Kengeri TTMC. The route length varies between 5km-18km and covers places like RR Gate, Poornaprajna Layout, Ganakal, Ramasandra, Ullal Satellite Town, Tavarekere, Raghuvanahalli, Bidadi and Talaghattapura. Of the 10 routes, only two will have buses running at a frequency of more than 15 minutes: RR Gate-Ganakal (25 minutes) and Kengeri TTMC-Thalaghattapura (20 minutes). “In addition to these feeder buses, we are also operating normal ones to Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Bengaluru University, Kengeri, Uttarahalli, Banashankari, Kengeri Satellite Town, Sumanahalli and Bidadi. This will ensure better frequency of services mainly for Metro passengers,” said a senior BMTC official. “We are also planning to operate buses to places like Vishweshwaraiah Layout. But Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout is still being developed, so we will run buses there only after a few months,” he added. “The idea of feeder buses is to ensure Metro passengers use them for first- and last-mile connectivity and avoid private vehicles. We have sought parking at Kengeri bus terminal Metro station, where BMRCL has enough space,” he added. Many passengers said timings of feeder buses should be displayed at Metro stations. “BMTC’s mobile app is not functional now, so there is no way to track buses on a real-time basis. At least, bus timings should be displayed at all Metro stations for the benefit of passengers. Both BMTC and BMRCL should also come up with a common mobility card,” said Praveen Kumar, a resident of Kengeri, adding: “BMTC should run buses in sync with Metro timings and more vehicles should be deployed during peak hours. BMTC should also consult residents to tweak timings and routes of these feeder buses.” BMRCL officilas said they are planning to set up parking facilities at stations like Nayandahalli (three spots), Rajarajeshwari Nagar (three), Jnanabharathi (one), Pattanagere (three), Kengeri bus terminal (two), Kengeri (one). However, BMTC fears parking at Metro stations might discourage people from taking feeder buses. On the route: Feeder buses will cover areas like Halagevaderahalli, Channasandra, BEML Layout, RR Temple, Double Road, Shanmuga Temple, Concorde Layout, Mariyappanapalya, Sonnenahalli, Doddabasti, BUC quarters, Kommaghatta, Sulikere Cross, Yelachaguppe, Kariyannapalya, KSIT, Kumbalgodu, Hejjala Cross, Kodipalya, Konasandra Cross, Gattigerepalya and Ganigarapalya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bmtc-to-operate-feeder-bus-every-15-minutes-for-kengeri-metro-users/articleshow/85637117.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Colleges will have to later log in student details on the portal. The government had insisted all colleges make admissions through UUCMS, which was officially launched on Monday. While several colleges had started collecting application forms offline after II PU results were announced, the department had asked them to stop and wait for UUCMS. As per plans, students could search for options on the website, choose colleges, apply online and pay fees through the PayGov system. However, on Monday evening, several colleges were orally informed to collect application forms and draw up merit lists offline. “With the new system, students need guidance. They only know to select the course, but this time they need to select subjects too, for which they require guidance. To make it simpler for them, we decided to keep the process offline. Other parts of the admission module under UUCMS will start this year itself. Colleges will have to submit the list on the website for approval from the university,” said Pradeep P, commissioner for collegiate education. Students can continue to look at the various college options available to them on the website. “Only the part where applications were to be issued online won’t be implemented this year. Remaining activities of UUCMS will continue,” Pradeep added. The new format for degree courses — two majors and electives — will also come into effect from the 2021-22 academic year, as planned earlier. The move brings relief to private colleges, many of which had completed admissions well before announcement of the schedule by the government under the new format. “Different colleges follow different admission processes — some have merit list, some do it on first-comefirst-serve basis, some have a mix of both. Colleges can complete the process like they usually do it and submit online,” he said. Website faces glitch:On Tuesday, there was confusion over the UUCMS website not opening. “For two hours, there was a technical issue with the website. It has been rectified. However, the technical glitch has nothing to do with the admission process going offline,” said an official. “While initially it was decided to receive applications online, with NEP being launched at the same time, we feared students would be confused with the new format. So, only the admission process on the students’ part has been kept in in the same format as last year,” he added. University vice-chancellors had a meeting on Wednesday and were asked to inform their affiliate colleges to continue admissions manually and later upload the list on the portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-does-u-turn-tells-students-to-apply-offline/articleshow/85637125.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

He and his family members, including five children, were always a target as his brother was a soldier in the Afghan army, but they managed to escape the war-torn nation in the nick of time and reached Bengaluru in July. Life was good for Pashtoon Achakzai, 32, and his family in Spin Boldak, a town in southern Kandahar, where his kin had lived for generations. A banker with New Kabul Bank since 2013, Achakzai and wife Kochi Achakzai, a nurse, with their four boys and a girl, just wanted a peaceful life in the town bordering Pakistan. But things started to take an ominous turn in early June 2021, when Taliban fighters captured Spin Boldak from the Afghan army. “The threat became imminent as the Taliban are known to target people working for the Afghan government, especially the army,” Achakzai said in a broken voice, recalling the days when he feared for his loved ones’ lives. The worst began to unfold in front of the family and they couldn’t do anything. “Taliban threatened my family, including mother Sabiqua, and took over our ancestral home. Some fighters drove off with our car. It was painful,” lamented the Afghan national. While Achakzai’s brother and soldier Hayatullah fled to India with family fearing vengeance from the advancing Taliban, Achakzai clung to his homeland hoping for the best. But in early July, three of his banking colleagues were gunned down by Taliban fighters for being staffers of a government bank. “Their deaths came as a warning and I immediately fled with my mother, wife and children,” he added. The Afghan family reached Delhi and arrived in Bengaluru in mid-July, while the rest of his relatives followed suit in early August before the violent takeover of Afghanistan . Achakzai chose to come to Bengaluru as Hayatullah had already moved in and had several friends in the city. With the help of some friends, Achakzai and his family have settled down in MS Palya for now. They are glad they managed to flee to safety with their children, despite the sorrow of losing their beloved home and belongings, which they may never be able to retrieve. 100 stay scholarships for students:Colive, a proptech platform for rental accommodation, launched 100 stay scholarships for Afghan students stranded in India. It received 15 applications so far and five students have already moved in to Bengaluru property. The students need to fill an online application form, submit a 30-second video, KYC documents, including Foreigners’ Regional Registration Office (FRRO) registration and a bona fide college certificate, to apply for this scholarship. Students can stay without paying rent in any of the Colive properties in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Pune for the current semester or until December 31, 2021. Suresh Rangarajan, founder & CEO, said, Atithi Devo Bhava is a true Indian tradition and they wanted to offer comfort to Afghan students who have come here to pursue higher education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/afghan-family-flees-after-taliban-seize-house-finds-refuge-in-bluru/articleshow/85637171.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Social worker says stray dogs caught, taken away in truck||BENGALURU: A 35-year-old social worker filed a complaint accusing six unidentified men of catching stray dogs and bundling them into a truck at Doddagubbi village in Kothanur, off Ballari Road, on August 20. When the social worker, Rekha (name changed), questioned them, they claimed to have been appointed by the local panchayat to catch stray dogs for sterilisation. An inquiry with the panchayat revealedthe men were not appointed by them. Sensing foul play, she filed a complaint at Kothanur police station. Cops were reportedly reluctant to register an FIR. However, they later booked a case under Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. Rekha said she panicked on seeing the men chasing and catching the dogs in an unscientific manner. “Their method was cruel and dogs were injured in the process. None of them was in uniform and when asked, they claimed they were appointed by the panchayat. They caught at least half-a-dozen dogs and bundled them inside a mini goods truck before driving away,” she said. An animal activist said they suspect the hands of illegal contractors who once were working on behalf of BBMP behind the incident. “In 2019, we had approached the high court saying the contractors hired by BBMP to treat stray dogs for sterilisation under Animal Birth Control (ABC) were illegal since most of them were not cleared by the Animal Welfare Board. One such contractor, a woman, who was given the tender to handle dogs under Mahadevapura BBMP zone, was forced to stop her work,” he recalled. Dogs not yet traced: CopsPolice said they have not traced the dogs or identified the men yet. “We were told that the truck belongs to the same woman whose contract was terminated following a petition in the high court. We have to investigate more,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/social-worker-says-stray-dogs-caught-taken-away-in-truck/articleshow/85637174.cms||---
---||World||Vijay Mallya files for permission to appeal against bankruptcy in UK high court||LONDON: Fugitive Indian businessman Vijay Mallya has filed papers in the UK high court seeking permission to appeal against his bankruptcy order. Mallya (65) was declared bankrupt by the insolvency and companies court (ICC) of the high court on July 26 this year. His name is now listed in the individual insolvency register. A spokesman for the chancery division of the high court told TOI that Mallya had on August 16 filed a notice seeking permission to appeal the decision of Chief ICC judge Briggs, who had declared him bankrupt. "He has until September 21 to file his appeal bundle and then it will be referred to another judge to consider whether to grant permission to appeal." If permission is granted, he will have a full appeal hearing, which could lead to the bankruptcy being overturned. Mallya was denied permission to appeal against the order at the hearing on July 26. The State Bank of India-led consortium had filed the bankruptcy petition against Mallya for failing to clear a judgment debt of £1.05 billion (Rs 10,695 crore) determined by the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), Karnataka, in January 2017, which was subsequently registered in the English courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/vijay-mallya-files-for-permission-to-appeal-against-bankruptcy-in-uk-high-court/articleshow/85637517.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The Department of Libraries & Research, and Raja Ram Mohan Roy Library Foundation (RRRLF), Kolkata, will be part of the novel initiative — Library-on-Wheels — in J&K. Prof Singh said the bus libraries would be launched in all districts to make quality reading material accessible to everyone, especially in areas sans public libraries. Prof Singh said the resources to purchase the buses would be arranged from corporate houses and philanthropic organizations under their corporate social responsibility initiative. The recurring cost for these vehicles — including fuel, maintenance and other charges — would be borne by RRRLF. The books and other reading material, meanwhile, would be provided by J&K’s Libraries Department, with the district libraries serving as the base libraries for the initiative, Prof Singh added. On the recommendation of the UT-Level Library Advisory-cum-Purchase Committee, two public libraries from J&K — including Srinagar’s Gani Memorial Central Library and Samba District Library — would be upgraded under the centrally-sponsored scheme National Mission on Libraries. District libraries would be digitized and digital libraries established at the gram panchayat level across J&K under Mission Youth. Besides, the Tribal Affairs department would arrange online/offline coaching for competitive exams including IAS/JKAS, NEET, JEE, AIPMT, CET, UPSC/JKPSC, NET/SLET, NDA/CDS, SSB, GMAT, CLAT, CAT etc. through public libraries in Srinagar city as well as remote areas of J&K. The committee also approved setting up IT hubs at Jammu’s SRS Library and Srinagar’s SPS Library in convergence with the Smart City Mission project in the respective cities. The committee was informed that the Jammu Smart City Ltd has already formulated Rs 4.3 crore DPR for upgrading SRS Library and setting up an IT hub while a similar proposal is under consideration for Srinagar Smart City as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-to-get-libraries-on-wheels-soon/articleshow/85637721.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||G7 foreign affairs committee chairs jointly call for India to be included in G7 talks on Afghanistan||LONDON: The chair of the UK parliament foreign affairs committee, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, is calling for India to be included in all future G7 meetings on Afghanistan "to prepare for the regional and global impact" of the Taliban. "I now look forward to India, and other regional partners being included in future discussions. They have a greater stake than some other G7 members," Tugendhat tweeted after Tuesday’s G7 emergency virtual summit at which India was not present. "I also hope that work with Kenya, Nigeria and Mali, as well as the African Union, will be increased as groups like Al Shabab and Boko Haram are drawing inspiration from the Taliban’s success in Afghanistan." The chairs of the foreign affairs committees of the G7 member states issued a joint statement on Afghanistan ahead of Tuesday’s G7 emergency virtual summit calling for India to be included in that summit. "With the spillover of terrorism possible, we would like to see India invited to attend this G7 meeting," the statement said. The chairs also said that the African Union should be invited to attend individual G7 meetings when appropriate "as other terror groups are beginning to muster in the Horn of Africa." "This would … ensure that the spillover effects of Afghanistan which could destabilise neighbouring countries are consistently monitored by those closest to the likely areas of threat," their statement said. Writing in the Daily Telegraph ahead of Tuesday's summit, Tugendhat, said: "Few nations are more affected than India by the inland tsunami in Asia, or more likely to be important to what happens next. With Delhi holding the presidency of the UN Security Council, its presence at the meeting would show a commitment not just to bringing others in, but also to leveraging the institutions we have built to defend peace", he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/g7-foreign-affairs-committee-chairs-jointly-call-for-india-to-be-included-in-g7-talks-on-afghanistan/articleshow/85637905.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Whether she did it of her own will or was coerced into it is open to debate, but days before the 34th anniversary of her act that is now the stuff of folklore in Rajasthan’s Deorala village, a 70-year-old man in a remote tribal-dominated Kalahandi village ended his life by jumping on to the funeral pyre of his wife. The incident, which took place between 7pm and 9 pm on Tuesday at Sialjudi village, has created a flutter given that there has been no known instance of a man committing a equivalent of Sati. Those who knew Nilamani Sabar and his wife Raibari (65) said the step taken by him was nothing short of an extreme manifestation of love. Nilamani was a panchayat representative (samiti member) from 2002 to 2007 while Raibari was serving as a village ward member. They have four sons and a daughter. While the daughter is married and stays in another village, the sons have moved into separate houses in the same village. Narrating the sequence of events, Kalahandi SP Sharvana Vivek said Raibari died in her sleep. Her body was taken for cremation close to the village. “After the pyre was lit, some of the villagers along with Nilamani’s sons, went to a pond to take a bath. A few villagers remained with Nilamani, who was sitting alone, close to the pyre. Suddenly, he got up and jumped into the pyre. By the time the villagers could realise what had happened, he was badly burnt. They tried to get him ou, but the raging fire made it difficult and he was reduced to ashes,” the SP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/in-grief-kalahandi-man-burns-himself-to-death-on-wifes-pyre/articleshow/85638410.cms||Riyan Ramanath V

On Wednesday, as the centenarian got her second jab at her residence in the remote Gar Katiyas village in Udhampur district, the thickly forested hills around her village echoed her determination. Already an inspiration for generations of younger people due to the good health she maintains, Dholi Devi is now leading the war against the pandemic in her area. She has single-handedly inspired an entire village to make the Covid vaccination drive a huge success, said health officials. In recognition of her contribution, Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Y K Joshi had visited her house on May 21 after Dholi Devi received her first jab on May 17. “In an environment wherein even educated people in urban areas are often hesitant to take the vaccine, the 121-year-old woman, by taking the lead in motivating an entire village, has been able to transform the mindset of the local population,” he said. “Dholi Devi represents the voice of hope amid the pandemic gloom. Encouraged by her, the entire village has now voluntarily come forward for inoculation,” Lt Gen Joshi added. The centenarian faced no health issues — not even a fever — after getting vaccinated, said her kin. Lauding Dholi Devi’s courage and health consciousness, Union minister Jatinder Singh uploaded a video showing health staffers visiting her to administer the second dose. “121-year-old Dholi Devi from Dudu panchayat testifies that age is just a number,” he wrote. Besides Dholi Devi, 90-year-old Thakri Devi from Udhampur’s Kashira panchayat has also been spreading awareness among people and encouraging them to get inoculated. Thakri Devi had tested positive for Covid-19 during the first wave and survived. After recovering, she got herself vaccinated on May 2 and now inspires others to follow suit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/121yr-old-leads-fight-against-covid-in-jk-village/articleshow/85638616.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Mumbai||Eateries turn into office spaces in Mumbai, bored of WFH, Mumbaikars work from cafes||It is not uncommon these days to walk into cafes and see individuals sitting with laptops. With the pandemic forcing work from home as an option and most offices still remaining shut, people are choosing to step out to a cafe or even a restaurant to work and break the monotony. Bombay Times explores the trend... Breaking the monotony“After one point, it became very boring to work from home (WFH), so I have been going to my favourite cafe. I would visit this particular cafe often before the pandemic, so the staff there knows me very well. Usually, I go there on alternate days for a change of scene. Since the place is quiet during the the day, it is an ideal environment to work without any disturbance. I have observed many people doing the same. I carry my laptop and santiser with me, and always wear a mask when I am at the cafe,” says Trisha Khaitan, an entrepreneur. Mayank Bhatt, Business Head of Social, agrees that cafe spaces in Mumbai are becoming more work-friendly than ever before in the new normal. He says, “The pandemic has irrevocably changed the way we’ve worked. Over the past year, WFH has become monotonous for many, and now as the world is opening up while adapting to the new normal, people are seeking for new avenues of working which are flexible and cost-effective.” Ravi Iyer, 30, who runs a tech start-up, says, “I have been working from home for more than a year now, and working at a cafe gives my partners and me a chance to work together. We ensure that we maintain social distancing. The pandemic has altered the way we looked at our work space and we are trying to make the best of it.” ‘Working from a cafe brings back a sense of normalcy’Many people are opting to work from cafes and other such establishments because they have a comfort factor attached to them. Priyanka Shah, a 29-year-old PR consultant, says, “I would often work from a cafe near my home before the pandemic struck. Working from a cafe after a long break brings back a sense of normalcy for me. It makes me feel that things are now back on track. At first, I was a bit skeptical about stepping out, but after a few days, I felt absolutely comfortable working from there. It’s also a place where I can have my work meetings. Now, I visit the cafe near my home at least twice a week and plan to do so until we return to the office.” Dhaval Udeshi from the Khar-based eatery, Silly, says, “We constantly try to build a community culture and promote activities like co-working where people from different backgrounds network with like minded individuals. So, we have created a co-working space and chalked out a section for people who want to work from our cafe.” A good way to escape the chaos at home for someFor some, like 40-year-old Sukesh Bhojwani, an HR professional, working from a cafe is a great way to escape the chaos at home. He says, “My wife is working from home, and my two children have their school online. Besides that, they also have online classes that they attend during the day. My parents live with us, too. It can get chaotic, so I prefer to step out on certain days so that I can focus on my work better.” Fun activities for patronsSome cafes stock up board games and even books, which patrons can browse through when they want to take a break from work. Shriya Patel, a 25-year-old advertising professional, says, “I need to take frequent breaks while workings. So, I often go to two cafes, which provide books to read and they even have some fun games.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/eateries-turn-into-office-spaces-in-mumbai-bored-of-wfh-mumbaikars-work-from-cafes/articleshow/85628287.cms||Debarati S Sen
---||World||Over 1,000 Americans still await evacuation from Afghanistan: Blinken||WASHINGTON: US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Wednesday said of the 6,000 American citizens identified in Afghanistan, at least 4,500 of them and their families have been evacuated since mid-August. Asserting that over 1,o00 Americans still awaited evacuation from Afghanistan, he added that the state department was “aggressively” reaching out to the remaining contacts. "When the US evacuation effort began, there were as many as 6,000 American citizens in Afghanistan who wanted to leave, based on an analysis. The remaining contacts now number around 1,000, whom we're aggressively reaching out multiple times a day, through multiple channels of communication," Blinken said during a news conference in Washington. "From this list of approximately 1,000, we believe the number of Americans actively seeking assistance to leave Afghanistan is lower, likely significantly lower. There are Americans still evaluating their decision to leave Afghanistan based on the situation on the ground," he said, cautioning repeatedly that the numbers could be changing every hour. Blinken told the news conference there was no deadline on the effort to help people who want to leave Afghanistan, both Americans and others, and that that effort would continue "as long as it takes." “Over 82,300 people have been safely flown out of Kabul since August 14,” he said, adding 45-46% of them were women and children. Asked about keeping Kabul embassy after the US troops leave Afghanistan, Blinken said they were “looking for a series of options”. Although the airlift is due to last until Tuesday, the United States military said it will shift its focus in the final two days from assisting fleeing civilians to evacuating its own troops.

---||Delhi||Reopen Delhi schools from next month, says panel||NEW DELHI: A committee of experts constituted by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has suggested reopening of schools in Delhi for all classes in a phased manner from next month in the wake of significant improvement in the Covid-19 situation. The committee has suggested that the process be staggered. In the first phase, higher classes should be reopened, followed by the middle level classes and finally primary classes. The students of Class IXth to XIIth are likely to be called first, probably in the first week of September, with a 50% cap on numbers. The panel has proposed that parents should have the option of choosing online classes, rather than the physical ones, for their children, sources said. This would mean a hybrid form of imparting lessons which the schools will need to adjust to. A final decision on reopening of schools will be taken at a DDMA meeting next week when it considers this report. If the suggestions are accepted, the likely dates may be announced. Read AlsoDelhi schools give go-ahead to phased reopening, consent of parents remains tricky questionNEW DELHI: Concurring with the recommendations of the panel constituted by the Delhi government, heads of schools are of the view that schools can be reopened in phases starting with students of higher classes as the response to practical and project classes has been good. From August 9, DelhiThe reopening will, obviously, happen with strict Covid protocols like wearing of masks, social distancing, hand washing, etc. for children so that they remain safe from Covid. The schools will need to follow some standard operating procedures which will be prescribed, said sources. The committee had been formed on August 6 with officials from the education and health department as its members. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia had told a DDMA meeting that a majority of parents who turned up for the parents-teachers meetings at the Delhi government schools wanted them to be reopened. The DDMA, subsequently, allowed reopening of schools for students of classes X to XII for practicals and project work with parental consent. The response so far has been mixed. The main worry is that the school students are yet to be vaccinated which leaves them vulnerable to being infected by Covid-19. Meanwhile, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday that the government wants to reopen schools at the earliest but assured that no risk will be taken when it comes to the health of the students. “There has been a mixed experience in other states and we are currently monitoring the situation. We do not want to take any risks where the children are involved. We want to reopen the schools at the earliest and whenever a decision on it is taken, we will let you know,” he told reporters on the sidelines of an event. While almost all economic activities have been allowed to resume in the capital, the Delhi government has been moving very cautiously on reopening of schools. It had sought feedback from students, teachers, parents and other stakeholders on reopening of schools and other educational institutions. The move had elicited an encouraging response with the government receiving more than 35,000 suggestions. Around 68% wanted the schools to reopen. Schools and other educational institutions in the city have remained closed since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 and online classes have become the norm. A committee of experts constituted under the National Institute of Disaster Management recently submitted its report to the PMO warning of an imminent third Covid wave that could peak around October and sought better preparedness for children who might be at similar risk as adults. The vulnerability of kids as they have not been vaccinated has been discussed with most experts of the view they are not prone to severe infections though they can pass the virus to others. Several states recently reopened schools and educational institutions, mostly for the higher classes, as the overall Covid-19 situation is under control in most parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/reopen-city-schools-from-next-month-says-panel/articleshow/85639249.cms||Alok KN Mishra
---||World||1,500 Americans may still await evacuation in Afghanistan: Blinken||WASHINGTON: Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that around 1,500 Americans may be awaiting evacuation from Afghanistan, a figure that suggests this part of the United States-led airlift could be completed before President Joe Biden's Tuesday deadline. Untold thousands of at-risk Afghans, however, are struggling to get into the Kabul airport.  Blinken said the state department estimates there were about 6,000 Americans who wanted to leave Afghanistan when the airlift began August 14, and that about 4,500 of them have been evacuated so far. The 6,000 figure is the first public estimate by the state department of how many Americans were seeking to get out when the Taliban completed its takeover of Afghanistan. Blinken told a state department news conference about 500 Americans have been contacted with instructions on when and how to get to the chaotic Kabul airport to catch evacuation flights.  In addition, 1,000 or perhaps fewer are being contacted to determine whether they still want to leave. Blinken said some of these may already have left the country, some may want to remain and some may not actually be American citizens.  Of the 1,000, the number who are "actively seeking assistance" to leave Afghanistan "is lower - likely significantly lower," Blinken said.  The Biden administration has stressed that American evacuees are its first priority, even as it attempts also to airlift Afghans who worked for the US government or military or to build Afghan civil society during the 20-year war as well as what it calls "vulnerable Afghans" - those who believe they face retribution from the Taliban for their role in opposing the insurgency.  The Tuesday deadline aside, Blinken said, "There is no deadline on our work to help any remaining American citizens who decide they want to leave to do so, along with the many Afghans who have stood by us over these many years, and want to leave, and have been unable to do so. That effort will continue, every day, past August 31."  Biden said Tuesday he has asked his national security team for contingency plans in case he decides to extend the deadline. Meanwhile, the US Embassy in Kabul has been evacuated; staff are operating from the city airport and are to leave by August 31.  However, refugee groups are describing a different picture when it comes to many Afghans: a disorganised, barely-there US evacuation effort for Afghan allies that leaves the most desperate to risk beatings and death at Taliban checkpoints  Some Afghans are reported being turned away from the Kabul airport by American forces controlling the gates, despite having approval for flights.  "It's 100% up to the Afghans to take these risks and try to fight their way out," said Sunil Varghese, policy director with the International Refugee Assistance Project. "Those with young children and pregnant are willing to take those beatings to get out."  His group is one of several working with the US government, and communicating with clients and colleagues on the ground, to get out those Afghans most in danger from the Taliban. Those include Afghans who formerly worked with Americans, as well as journalists, women's rights advocates and others.  Just days are left before the US military is to start shutting down its anchoring role in a massive operation that the White House says has evacuated 82,300 Afghans, Americans and other foreigners on a mix of US, international and private flights. The withdrawal comes under a 2020 deal negotiated by President Donald Trump with the Taliban.  Taliban leaders who took control of Afghanistan this month say they will not tolerate any extensions to the Tuesday deadline. But Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted that "people with legal documents" will still be able to fly out via commercial flights after Tuesday. The US-based organisations, speaking on background to discuss sensitive matters, cite accounts from witnesses on the ground as saying some American citizens, and family members of Afghans with green cards, still are having trouble pushing and talking their way into the Kabul airport for flights.  Kirby said the US military will preserve as much airlift capacity at the airport as possible in the coming days, ahead of Tuesday's deadline. The military will "continue to evacuate needed populations all the way to the end," he said. He added that in the final days and hours there will have to be a balance in getting out evacuees as well as US troops and their equipment.  Maj. Gen. Hank Taylor, the deputy director of regional operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the US forces had conducted another helicopter mission beyond the perimeter of the airport to pick up people seeking to evacuate.  He said the operation happened in Kabul during the night and that the people were now safely at the airport awaiting an evacuation flight.  Taylor provided no other details, but Germany's top military commander, Gen. Eberhard Zorn, said separately that 21 German citizens had been extracted by the US helicopter. He said the helicopter crew was American and that German troops picked up the evacuees.  In White House news conferences and remarks during the airlift, Biden has offered varying degrees of commitment to getting former Afghan translators and others most at risk from the Taliban included in the airlift. The US military and diplomatic officials appear to still be compiling a list of eligible Afghans, but have yet to disclose how - and how many - they may be getting out, private Americans and American organisations said.  "We still have 1,200 Afghans with visas that are outside the airport and haven't got in," said James Miervaldis with No One Left Behind, one of dozens of veterans groups working to get out Afghans who worked with the US military during America's nearly 20 years of combat there. "We're waiting to hear from the US government and haven't heard yet."  Marina LeGree of Ascend, a US-based nonprofit that worked to develop fitness and leadership in Afghan girls and young women, described getting calls from U.S. officials telling the group's interns and staffers to go to the airport for evacuation flights, only to be turned away by American forces keeping gates closed against the throngs outside.  One Afghan intern who went to the airport with her family saw a person killed in front of them, and a female colleague was burned by a caustic agent fired at the crowd, LeGree said.  "It's heartbreaking to see my government fail so badly," said LeGree, the group's American director, who is in Italy but in close contact with those in Kabul.  The number of US troops at the airport has dropped by about 400, to 5,400, but the final withdrawal has not begun, Kirby said Wednesday.  He said defense secretary Lloyd Austin will consult directly with Gen. Frank McKenzie, the head of Central Command and overseer of the evacuation operation, before McKenzie moves ahead with the final withdrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/1500-americans-may-still-await-evacuation-in-afghanistan-blinken/articleshow/85641451.cms||---
---||Business||Government gives hefty pension boost to bank employees||MUMBAI: The government has announced changes to the pension scheme of public sector banks. For family members of employees, the ceiling on family pension has been lifted and, for current employees, the banks’ contribution to the scheme has been increased by 4 percentage points to 14% from earlier 10%. “Earlier, the scheme had slabs of 15%, 20% and 30% of the pay that a pensioner drew at that point of time. It was capped subject to a maximum of Rs 9,284. That was a very paltry sum and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman was concerned and wanted that to be revised so that family members of bank employees get a decent amount to survive and sustain,” said Debashish Panda, secretary in the department of financial services, at a press conference held by Sitharaman. The second change is that the employer contribution to the New Pension Scheme (NPS) corpus has been enhanced to 14% of the pay from 10% earlier. The changes are in continuation of the 11th bipartite settlement signed by banks with unions on wage revision last year. In addition to the wage revision, there was a proposal for enhancement in family pension and also the employer’s contribution under the NPS. A statement issued by the government said that thousands of families of public sector banks will be benefited by the enhanced family pension scheme, while increase in employer contribution will provide increased financial security to the bank employees under the NPS. Those employees who have been with banks before 2004 are eligible to a defined benefit pension scheme where the monthly payout is determined by a formula based on their last drawn wage. These employees will benefit from the increase in pension limits. Employees who have joined after 2004 are part of the NPS where the employees and the banks contribute toward a retirement corpus. After retirement, the corpus must be used to buy an annuity from an insurance company that will provide monthly income. The extent of monthly income depends upon the size of the corpus and cost of annuity. With the fall in interest rate, the returns through annuity schemes have been shrinking, resulting in a call for higher contribution. The insurance regulator is also working with the industry to develop an inflation-linked annuity scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-revises-bank-pension-plan-limits-corpus-to-rise/articleshow/85641183.cms||---

---||India||India needs to jab 1 crore/day to inoculate all by year end||Starting Thursday, India needs to average almost one crore doses per day till the end of the year to reach the target of fully vaccinating the entire adult population. To do this, it will have to nearly double the daily average it achieved in the best week so far — just under 59 lakh per day from June 19 to 25. The burden will be heavier on states such as West Bengal, Bihar, UP, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, where the average needed for the rest of the year is about double what was achieved in the best week or even more. Worryingly, that’s a list that includes the four most populous states in the country As of 8pm on Wednesday, a little over 60 crore doses had been administered since the beginning of the vaccination drive in January. That leaves about 127.6 crore doses to be administered over the 128 days remaining in the year to provide everybody in an estimated adult population of 93.9 crore with two doses each. States like Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Uttarakhand would be able to meet the target even by doing significantly less than their best daily average. These states could finish adult vaccination well before December 31 if they can keep up the highest pace they’ve achieved. With a third wave predicted towards the end of October, states are racing to administer as many doses as possible before that. Himachal Pradesh could finish vaccinating before the first week of October if it continues to vaccinate over one lakh per day, its best daily average over a week. Uttarakhand and Kerala, if they were to administer their best daily average of about one lakh doses and 3.3 lakh doses respectively, could finish vaccinating in about 83 days or before November-end. The best daily average is the average number of daily doses in the week that registered the highest number of doses administered. The highest doses delivered in a single day would be much higher than this. Nationally, for instance, the 90 lakh figure has been crossed twice, on June 21 and on August 16. This, according to experts, shows that with adequate vaccine supply, India has the capacity to do over one crore doses per day. However, with some states lagging in vaccine administration, the very states which have failed to demonstrate the capability to deliver enough doses might be the ones that will need to double their daily vaccinations, such as West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Eight states, including Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Assam, can finish vaccinating the entire adult population of the state by year-end even if the daily average of doses administered is less than their highest daily average. But the rest will have to match their best performance or better it every single day from now on, Sundays included, to be able to reach the target.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-needs-to-jab-1-crore/day-to-inoculate-all-by-year-end/articleshow/85641605.cms||Rema Nagarajan
---||Business||Government and auto industry czars spar over taxes, emission norms||NEW DELHI: The government and the auto industry openly clashed over the issue of affordability of vehicles and taxation on automobiles at an industry event. Industry stalwarts such as Maruti chairman RC Bhargava and TVS Motors promoter Venu Srinivasan complained that the industry was being ignored and high taxation and stricter safety and emission norms have made their products expensive and out of bounds for the common man. Revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj, however, defended the government and said that direct tax collections had been going up, and thus people were earning more and buying relatively-expensive SUVs — so, not much should be blamed only on the affordability factor. “So, all these are contradictions in economic terms,” he said. Bajaj said the economy seems to be doing good as direct tax collections “are a robust figure” and have been going up by 40 to 50%. “… in a class of people which would be your buyers, the income levels are going up. If the income levels of these people are going up, why is it that the car sales are not happening?... Siam should actually go a little deeper into it, (and) do a deeper analysis,” he said. Bajaj said in a tight fiscal situation, incentives would “come back to haunt us at a later stage”. Last year, car sales fell 9%, while two-wheelers were 11% lower. Also countering the industry’s reservations over a perceived-hurried introduction of electrics, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant was categorical that “the writing is on the wall”, and those who are not ready for change will perish. But, speaking after Kant, it was Bhargava who first set the tone of discord and trust deficit between the government and industry. He complained that the government has done little to help the industry tide over a “declining trend” in sales, despite making promises to intervene. “I am afraid words don’t get us very much in terms of (realising) extra sales… I am sorry to say that there is very little in the form of any steps taken which would reverse this trend. That is what worries me,” the Maruti chairman said, before Bajaj’s address. He said the government’s concerns “generally remains confined to words, (and) doesn’t get translated into action.” Bhargava said apart from the mandate of transition to cleaner BS6 vehicles, cost pressures on vehicles came through new rules on safety and modern features, much in alignment with standards in Europe and the developed western world. “If we follow all those European standards with the cost, which are involved, how do we make these vehicles affordable to the much, much lower levels of incomes that exist in India?” Bhargava said, adding the same question of high costs haunts the industry when it comes to development of electrics. “Are we sure that we have enough customers in India who have the means to buy these millions of cars every year. Is income going up that fast, are jobs going up that fast? I think these aspects are often ignored when we make our plans… We tend to forget customers. We’ve always forgotten customers in the centralised planning system because the customer didn't matter,” he said, adding that “high taxes” are further compounded by the state taxes. “I don't think the car industry is going to revive… unless we tackle the question of affordability for the customers.” Joining Bhargava on the affordability front was TVS’s Srinivasan, who also asked whether the automotive industry is being recognised “for what it has contributed to employment, revenues and earning foreign exchange.” Srinivasan said that mopeds, an entry-level two-wheeler, has seen prices go up by between 45% and 50% over the past few years due to various safety and emission mandates, and the 28% GST rate. “… it’s actually horror,” he said, also hinting that the euphoria around electrics should be tempered down by looking at the “lifecycle carbon footprint” of a vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-and-auto-industry-czars-spar-over-taxes-emission-norms/articleshow/85641957.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||India||Prime Minister's Office clears 9 names for appointment as SC judges||NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister's Office is learnt to have cleared the nine names recommended by the Supreme Court collegium headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana for appointment as judges of the apex court and have been advised by the law ministry to undergo customary medical tests prior to issuance of warrants of appointment by the President. Law ministry sources told TOI that the PMO cleared the appointments of Karnataka HC Chief Justice A S Oka, Gujarat HC CJ Vikram Nath, Sikkim CJ J K Maheshwari, Telangana HC CJ Hima Kohli, Karnataka HC judge B V Nagarathna, Kerala HC judge C T Ravikumar, Madras HC judge M M Sundresh, Gujarat HC judge Bela M Trivedi and senior advocate P S Narasimha. This is the largest number of names recommended by the collegium at one go for appointment as judges of the SC and the quickest, within a week, clearance by the PMO. Importantly, the names include three woman judges — Justices Hima Kohli, B V Nagarathna and Bela Trivedi — and one among whom, Justice Nagarathna, will go on to become the first woman CJI in the year 2027, albeit for a little over a month. These appointments will also create another milestone in the country's judicial history as Narasimha would be the first appointee directly from the bar to become CJI. Earlier, eight had been directly appointed from the bar directly to the SC as judges — S M Sikri, S C Roy, Kuldip Singh, N Santosh Hegde, R F Nariman, U U Lalit, L N Rao and Indu Malhotra. With the warrants of appointment to be issued soon after the recommended persons successfully complete their medical tests, the SC will function almost at full strength. When the nine take oath, the working strength will increase to 33, leaving just one vacancy. The SC at present is functioning with 24 judges, mainly because CJI N V Ramana's predecessor S A Bobde could not recommend a single name for appointment as SC judge due to a lack of consensus among the collegium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/prime-ministers-office-clears-9-names-for-appointment-as-sc-judges/articleshow/85642082.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The summit comes during a relentless stretch of ransomware attacks that have targeted critical infrastructure, in some cases extorting multi-million-dollar payments from major corporations, as well as other illicit cyber operations that the US authorities have linked to foreign hackers.  Though ransomware is one focus of Wednesday's gathering, the purpose of the meeting is broader and centered on identifying the "root causes of malicious cyber activities" and ways in which the private sector can help bolster cybersecurity, said a senior administration official who briefed reporters about the gathering on the condition of anonymity.  Among the expected guests at Wednesday's meeting are Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy and Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company. The tech industry is also expected to be represented by the leaders of IBM, Microsoft and Automatic Data Processing. Besides Biden, multiple cabinet secretaries and national security officials will represent the administration.  The meeting is taking place as Biden's national security team has been consumed by the troop withdrawal in Afghanistan and the chaotic evacuation of Americans and Afghan citizens. The fact the meeting remained on the calendar underscores how the administration regards cybersecurity as a major agenda item, with a senior administration official describing Wednesday's event as a "call to action."  Financial industry executives are also expected, including the chief executives of Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase, as well as representatives from the energy, education and insurance sectors.  The broad cross section of participants underscores how cyber attacks have cut across virtually all sectors of commerce. In May, for instance, hackers associated with a Russia-based cyber gang launched a ransomware attack on a major fuel pipeline in the US, causing the company to temporarily halt operations. Weeks later, the world's largest meat processor, JBS SA, was hit with an attack by a different hacking group.  In both instances, the companies made multi-million-dollar ransom payments in an effort to get back online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-to-tackle-cybersecurity-with-tech-finance-leaders/articleshow/85642104.cms||---

Bengaluru Urban district comprises BBMP areas and adjoining villages. While 65 lakh (or 69%) of the 94.4 lakh people above 18 years of its age have been vaccinated with at least one dose in the BBMP’s jurisdiction, rest of the district has achieved a stupendous 97% coverage inoculating 10.3 lakh of the 10.6 lakh targeted people. Bengaluru’s vaccination coverage is much higher than the state’s 58% achievement. In Bengaluru Urban district, vaccine supplies to private hospitals have played a major role in scaling up the coverage. J Manjunath, deputy commissioner, Bengaluru Urban district, told TOI that 3% of the people who are not yet vaccinated could be Covid infectees waiting for their turn to take the vaccine. “We will shortly achieve more than 100% coverage as the district sees people coming in from other states as well. The number of eligible people is an estimation,” he explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/75-of-bluru-jabbed-with-at-least-one-dose/articleshow/85642059.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Noting that investigations are still going on and chargesheets yet to be filed in a few cases even after a decade, a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant asked the Centre for its response on a suggestion to set up a monitoring committee to ensure that probe is completed within a reasonable time. The bench, which is hearing a petition protesting against the delay in the failure of the agencies to prosecute MPs and MLAs in cases registered against them years ago, also pointed out that in a Tada case dating back to 1995, charges have not been framed yet. The hearing saw solicitor general Tushar Mehta remarking that the court should pass an order directing the agencies to complete the probe in all cases involving lawmakers within six months and also direct that trial be completed within a reasonable time. The bench, however, was sceptical about the effectiveness of such a directive because of the depleted benches. "It is easy for us to say expedite trial and all... but where are the judges?" the bench observed and said that it will pass detailed order in the chamber. The court, however, emphasised speedy prosecution of cases involving lawmakers. "If there is something in the case then you should file a chargesheet but if you do not find anything, the case should be closed. Do not keep the sword hanging," the CJI observed after going through the data on pending cases in which investigations have gone on for many years. The bench said it did not want to pass any observation as it would demoralise the investigating agencies but the "figure placed before it speak volumes". "Reports (filed by CBI, ED) are very inconclusive and no reasons given for not filing chargesheet for 10-15 years. Reason for delay is not mentioned in the report," the bench said while referring to the data placed by the agencies on investigation being done by them against MPs and MLAs. The CJI said he has asked his brother judges on the bench to work out some solution as it is for the betterment of everybody and society that the probe and trial be concluded in a time-bound manner. The bench also asked Mehta to have a meeting with the directors of the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate to find out whether they needed additional manpower and expansion of infrastructure to enable the agencies to complete their task in a time-bound manner and brief the court on the next date of hearing. Compiling data on pending cases against MP/MLAs in different states, amicus curiae and senior advocate Vijay Hansaria told the bench that the "figures are disturbing and shocking and needed a surgical strike to deal with the inordinate delay" in probe and trial of such cases. Referring to the CBI report, he said it is shocking that the agency is saying that trial in one of the cases is expected to be over by 2030. But the SG immediately intervened and said it may be a typographical error. As per the report filed by the amicus curiae, 51 MPs and 71 MLAs/MLCs are accused in cases arising out of offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. A total of 121 CBI cases against MPs/MLAs are pending before court. Of these, 58 cases are punishable with death or life imprisonment. The oldest case is from 2000 and 37 cases are still under investigation. Mehta said in many ED cases, responses from foreign countries are often required and letters rogatory have to be sent and a delayed response to such requests for assistance hinders early conclusion of investigation. Hansaria suggested that a committee may be constituted to monitor probe done by the CBI and the ED and comprising (a) former SC judge or former HC chief justice (b) ED director (or his nominee not below the rank of additional director), (c) CBI director (or his nominee not below the rank of additional director), (d) home secretary (or his nominee not below the rank of joint secretary), and (e) a judicial officer not below the rank of district judge to be nominated by SC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-ed-cant-keep-sword-hanging-over-accused-supreme-court/articleshow/85642131.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The toddler had no passport and with just a birth certificate in hand, the parents reached out to Indian authorities who brought them out of Afghanistan as a special case in the ongoing evacuation operation. Those from the Afghan-Sikh community coordinating and supporting families shared that Iknoor’s paper work for travel happened in transit and the child was allowed to enter India with his parents with formalities completed at the Hindon airbase where officials of the Foreigners Regional Registration Office were camped. The child’s father, Kerpal Singh, his wife and three children were part of the group of evacuees, who arrived on Sunday on board the C-17 heavy-lift military transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force. Like Iknoor, among those likely to arrive in the next flight being operated are two more infants — one born on August 11 and another born in May. Afghan crisis: Live updatesMeanwhile, away from the limelight, Iknoor and his parents are trying to recuperate at a relative’s house, having left behind their home and a shop that was the source of their livelihood. Speaking to TOI over phone, Iknoor’s father’s voice gets shaky as he remembers the developments over the last 10 days. He shared that his two older children aged five and three had passports. Had the Indian government not come forward to facilitate Iknoor’s travel they would not have been able to escape to safety. The family had spent three days in the refuge of a gurudwara in Kabul before they were evacuated. Here in Delhi, Kerpal Singh is currently living with his sister who left Afghanistan two years ago due to the escalating violence. It is still early days for him to decide where the future lies for his family. This story is just one of the many that reflects the desperation and fear that made families leave everything behind to seek refuge away from what was till recently home. “So far, 67 Afghan-Sikhs and Hindus have arrived on two evacuation flights and around 165 more are expected on Thursday,” Puneet Singh Chandhok, president, Indian World Forum told TOI. Community members share that around 90 families, including 407 Afghan-Sikhs and Hindus, came to India over the last one year due to the deteriorating situation in the country. In the current air lift, besides the Hindu-Sikh minorities, some 60-odd Afghans have also arrived in India. Community members in Delhi also said that there were once over 2 lakh Afghan Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan but decades of violence and fear of the Taliban led to an exodus that has left just a few, who too are unlikely to stay on once their documents and visa formalities are complete. Human rights activist and Afghan MP Anarkali Honaryar, who along with her parents and brother, was among the evacuees who arrived in Delhi on Sunday, said that she has not only left her home, but also all proofs of an education acquired with great difficulty amid bouts of violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-evacuates-passport-less-afghanistan-infant-paperwork-done-at-hindon/articleshow/85642197.cms||Ambika Pandit

Asked to rank their happiness on a scale of 5, the average score turned out to be 3.6. The survey results were released by the Karnataka Evaluation Authority (KEA) earlier this year and uploaded on its website recently. It covered 6,087 beneficiaries in all — 2,994 of Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS), and 3,093 of Sandhya Suraksha Yojane (SSY). Among IGNOAPS beneficiaries, 57.2% ranked themselves as happy or very happy, while among SSY beneficiaries, the figure was 50.4%. Another 40% said they are “ok” while 6.4% said they are “not happy” or “not at all happy”. The study was carried out by the Mysuru-based Grassroots Research and Advocacy Movement (GRAAM) for the KEA. The study, making use of primary and secondary data, was aimed at analysing the functioning of the schemes and identifying their contribution to the welfare of the poor, besides guaging awareness about pension schemes among beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. It also looked into factors affecting the Aadhaar-linked DBT coverage for pension schemes. The report points to several gaps in scheme implementation and makes several suggestions to implement them more effectively. About 4.6% of SSY and 11.6% of IGNOAPS beneficiaries continue to work despite receiving pensions. About 30% of beneficiaries said they share the pension with their families. About a quarter of the pension goes towards food expenses while another 17% pays for medicines. Chaya K Degaonkar, additional chief evaluation officer of KEA, said since those surveyed are from very poor families, the pension schemes go a long way in improving their lives. “This may be the reason for their feedback. In this study, we found several gaps in scheme implementation which will be addressed,” she said. “NITI Aayog had suggested carrying out of evaluation studies of all schemes. The state budget also proposed an evaluation study of all the projects which cross Rs 100 crore,” she explained. Basavaraju R Shreshta, executive director of GRAAM said the social support system made available to the senior citizens, including care and support from the family, must have influenced the responses. Gopinath R, founder of Sparsha Trust in Bengaluru, said the 50% happiness score is consistent in similar studies carried out among senior citizens in villages and communities. “Another 10-15% say they are disappointed or have challenges. The rest live an average life. It is seen to be common in all communities and neighborhoods,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/54-of-senior-citizens-in-pension-schemes-happy-kea-survey/articleshow/85642253.cms||Shrinivasa M

On Tuesday alone, the state received 11 lakh doses. Current stocks in Karnataka are enough to vaccinate five lakh people a day for the next week, said Arundhati Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka. “Supply is far better and regular now,” Chandrashekar said. “We received more doses in August compared to previous months, and one more consignment is expected before the month ends.” The state received a total of 68.1 lakh doses in July and 50.2 lakh doses in June. “If the supply continues at the same rate as August, we can vaccinate 90% of the eligible population by December,” Chandrashekar said. As on Tuesday, the state had administered the first dose to 2.9 crore of the nearly five crore eligible population. More than 88 lakh people have got both doses. The state began inoculating everyone above the age of 18 free at government vaccination centres only from July 27. Prior to that, the focus was on those above 45 years and priority groups including college students in the 18-44 years group. “We have gone stage by stage,” an official said. “We now have enough stock to inoculate all. The focus is to cover as many people as possible before a possible third wave hits. People must come to government CVCs if they want free vaccines.” Currently, about 3.5 lakh doses are administered every day. On Tuesday, 3.8 lakh doses were administered, and the coverage was 3.7 lakh each on the preceding two days. This includes both first and second doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/enough-stock-to-inoculate-5l-daily-in-ktaka/articleshow/85649832.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Prior to that, the focus was on those above 45 years and priority groups including college students in the 18-44 years group. “We have gone stage by stage,” an official said. “We now have enough stock to inoculate all. The focus is to cover as many people as possible before a possible third wave hits. People must come to government CVCs if they want free vaccines.” Currently, about 3.5 lakh doses are administered every day. On Tuesday, 3.8 lakh doses were administered, and the coverage was 3.7 lakh each on the preceding two days. This includes both first and second doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/enough-stock-to-inoculate-5l-daily-in-ktaka/articleshow/85642561.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The man riding the bike, a local resident, was also thrashed, police said. The woman, from Mumbai, was admitted to hospital with injuries and in a state of shock. She could speak to police only on Wednesday and a case has been filed. One person reportedly working as a mason has been detained for questioning. CM Basavaraj Bommai said he has directed DGP Praveen Sood to ensure that the culprits are arrested at the earliest. Home minister Araga Jnanendra said a special investigation team has been formed to nab the culprits. “No one involved in the crime will be spared,” district minister ST Somashekar said. Police said the woman and her friend were on their way to Chamundi Hills, a popular pilgrim and tourist destination, when a few people who appeared to be drunk waylaid them at Lalithadripura around 7.30pm. The layout in east Mysuru — about 7km from Mysuru Palace — abuts the Chamundi Hills reserve forest and is usually secluded and unlit. A police official inspects the crime scene near Chamundi HillsThe attackers tried to pull her off the bike and when her friend objected, they beat him up. They then dragged her to another place and sexually assaulted her. They threatened the duo against going to police and fled the spot. The survivor and her friend walked to the Outer Ring Road in Alanahalli, about 300m away, and flagged down motorists for help. One of them took them to a private hospital. She has undergone medical examination and given her statement to police. Police commissioner Chandragupta said an FIR has been registered and details of the crime are being looked into. They appeared to be familiar with the area as well and disappeared in the darkness, sources said. The crime comes a day after a man was shot dead by an armed gang of robbers who looted a jewellery shop in Mysuru city during busy evening hours. Calling the attack on the student “most unfortunate”, Jnanendra said officials from Bengaluru have been rushed to Mysuru and are guiding the investigations. He said he would visit Mysuru on Thursday and take stock of the probe.

Overall, more than 60 crore doses have been administered so far, with nearly 50% of the 94 crore adult population receiving at least first dose of the jabs. The latest 10 crore doses have been given in just 19 days. However, only 14% of adults are fully vaccinated with two doses. Coronavirus live updates“In addition to the plan to provide vaccines to every state this month, more than two crore vaccine doses are being made available. We have requested all the states to try to vaccinate all school teachers on priority before Teachers' Day, which is celebrated on 5th September,” health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted in Hindi. इस महीने हर राज्य को वैक्सीन उपलब्ध करवाने की योजना के अतिरिक्त 2 करोड़ से ज़्यादा वैक्सीन की डोज़ उपलब्ध कराई जा र… https://t.co/cG6BFBKb5H— Mansukh Mandaviya (@mansukhmandviya) 1629873880000More than two crore additional vaccine doses will be dispatched to the states from 27th August to 31st August, 2021 to vaccinate school teachers and non-teaching staff on a priority basis. States/UTs may use UDISE (Unified District Information System of Education) data and coordinate with state education departments, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Navodaya Vidyalaya Sangathan etc. providing necessary fillip to this vaccination programme. This assumes significance as schools are closed for almost 18 months now since March last year after the Covid-19 outbreak in the country. This has raised concerns about cognitive as well as physical growth of children. Read AlsoIndia needs to jab 1 crore/day to inoculate all by year endStarting Thursday, India needs to average almost one crore doses per day till the end of the year to reach the target of fully vaccinating the entire adult population. To do this, it will have to nearly double the daily average it achieved in the best week so far — just under 59 lakh per day fromFollowing Mandaviya’s announcement on Twitter, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan also chaired a high level meeting with all states and UTs on Wednesday to review the progress of Covid vaccination. States were advised to focus on enhancing second dose coverage as well as immunisation of school teachers and staff in both government and private schools. Amid rising concerns about a potential spike in cases during the upcoming festival season, the Centre advised states to ensure compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour and other precautionary measures in advance. Bhushan emphasised on having a definite district level plan to increase coverage of second dose. “States were advised to undertake targeted strategies like earmarking specific days/ specific vaccination sites (CVC)s/ specific timings every day/ separate queue to exclusively administer second dose of the vaccines. They were also advised to undertake widespread IEC campaigns for enhanced awareness among the beneficiaries,” the health ministry said. Read AlsoReopen Delhi schools from next month, says panelA committee of experts constituted by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has suggested reopening of schools in Delhi for all classes in a phased manner from next month in the wake of significant improvement in the Covid-19 situation. The committee has suggested that the process be staggered.Besides, states have been asked to identify districts whose vaccine coverage is lower than the state average and monitor as well as enhance progress of vaccination in these districts. With 50% fund of ECRP-II package already disbursed, the Centre asked states and UTs to process procurement and supply orders immediately to procure equipment, machinery, beds, drugs, etc. under the time bound ECRP-II package. “States were requested to make month wise expenditure plan and oversee corresponding physical progress on the ground,” the health ministry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-schools-reopen-government-vows-2-crore-extra-vaccine-doses-for-staff/articleshow/85642437.cms||---
---||India||Airline staff to face random dope tests||NEW DELHI: For the first time, India has proposed to conduct dope tests randomly on pilots, cabin crew and air traffic controllers (ATCOs). Aspiring pilots may be required to undergo tests for psychoactive substances before getting admission to a flying school.  If an aviation personnel tests positive for the second time it could lead to suspension of licence for three years and a third time positive test could mean cancellation of licence. The drugs to be tested for include amphetamine, methamphtamine, cannabis, cocaine, opioids, marbiturates, benzodizipine and MDMA or ecstasy. Flight crew members and other key aviation personnel in operations are mandatorily subjected to breath tests to ensure they are not intoxicated when reporting for work. Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) chief Arun Kumar, on Wednesday, issued a draft rule on ‘procedure for examination of aviation personnel for consumption of psychoactive substances’ that will soon be finalised and made mandatory for airlines and airport operators. At least 5% crew members of airlines and ATCOs will need to be subjected to random tests every year. The regulator has also ‘encouraged’ maintenance and repair organisations and flying training organisations (FTO) to conduct these random tests on trainee pilots. An ATCO or flight crew member refusing to undergo this test shall have to undergo a test within three days. Failing this, his or her licence “shall be suspended for a period of one year and the involved person shall undergo rehabilitation process before return to the active duties.” Testing will be done on urine samples collected from the randomly selected employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/airline-staff-to-face-random-dope-tests/articleshow/85642936.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||India||Kerala records 31,445 new cases, 68% of India’s total||Kerala reported 31,445 fresh cases on Wednesday, the state’s highest tally in nearly three months. The last time Kerala’s numbers had gone past the 30,000 mark was on May 22. The surge that followed Onam and low testing in the festive week pushed India’s daily case count to 46,206, with Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand numbers yet to come. For the first time since July 7, the country’s total tally went past the 45,000 mark. The last time any state had recorded more than 30,000 cases was nearly three months ago when Tamil Nadu’s count had touched 30,016 on May 29. Analysis of cases and testing data for the past few days suggests Onam seems to have acted as a major disruptor of Kerala’s Covid management protocol. The seven-day average of tests in the state was constantly declining since August 5. The average, which had touched 1.68 lakh on August 5, declined to 1.47 lakh on August 10 and went further down to 1.09 lakh by August 24 — the lowest in nearly two months. Despite the decline in testing, lower restrictions during Onam seem to have resulted in a rather steady case count and caused an increase in the state’s case positivity rate. The seven-day average test positivity rate which had dropped below 11% for most of July has also been increasing since July 21. On Wednesday, Kerala’s test positivity rate averaged at 17.3%, indicating that cases might further go up when the testing protocol will return to its normal pace. Apart from Kerala, which reported over 68% of the country’s cases, Maharashtra also saw a minor spike as cases crossed the 5,000 mark after five days. These two states were followed by Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka — the only other states to report over 1000 cases on Wednesday. The daily death numbers also crossed the 600 mark for the first time since August 6 as both Maharashtra and Kerala reported over 200 deaths. Spread may spawn mutants, fears govtThe Centre is worried that the rapidly increasing Covid cases in Kerala could spread to other parts of the country, leading to a potential third wave, reports Sushmi Dey. The government is also concerned that a wider spread could result in a new variant that may also lower vaccine efficacy. Kerala celebrated Onam on August 21 without the level of restrictions suggested and positive cases infected during the exposure are likely to manifest in 7-10 days time. Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan cited Kerala’s example at a meeting on Wednesday to caution other states in view of the upcoming festival season. The Centre has advised all states and UTs to undertake all possible public health measures to curb infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-records-31445-new-cases-68-of-indias-total/articleshow/85643091.cms||---

And this father of two in Amreli dared — and let his dream achieve its pursuit of happiness — even as he counted every penny that he could earn by mending tyre punctures to educate his two sons. Today, with one son in the Indian Navy and another studying to be a doctor, 50-year-old Hasmukh Goswami is the happiest face in Savarkundla town. Along with studies, the father also ingrained the noble trait of humility in his successful boys who continue to help their father in his repair shop whenever they come home for the holidays. “I am illiterate and was doing work as a labourer before I started this puncture shop,” said Goswami, who has been running his shop for over three decades now, and is a popular man in the town. Goswami’s wife Trikona, who had studied up to the fifth standard, took keen interest in her sons’ education and this made her husband firm up his desires to see that their children did not suffer in life the way that he had to. “I did everything in my capacity to give them a good education,” said the man who borrowed money from relatives to pay his sons’ fees when they had to leave town for higher education in bigger cities. Twenty-year-old Keval, Goswami’s elder son who did his engineering from Surat joined the navy as a sailor six months ago. “We brothers also work in our shop to support our studies. I joined the navy six months ago but whenever I come home, you will find me at my father's shop,” said Keval, who is currently posted in Mumbai. The brother duo who studied in government school till class 12 in Savarkundla used the shop both as a means to help their father and also their place to study. Goswami’s younger son, Darshan, is pursuing MBBS in a college in Vadodara. Goswami had taken an education loan to support his son’s medical studies after the family decided to make him a doctor looking at his excellent educational grades. While his dreams are soaring in the desired direction, Goswami does not want to retire from his shop even after his sons start earning. “I am happy with my work and want to continue working till I can,” said the man, who doesn’t want to rest on his laurels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/puncture-man-in-amreli-seals-bright-future-for-both-sons/articleshow/85638692.cms||---

His neighbours caught him and handed him over to police. According to police sources, domestic tiff is stated to be the reason behind the gruesome murders. Lal’s parents, who live with him, were not present in the house at the time of the incident. The SHO of Bhabhua police station, Ramchandra Mandal, told this reporter on Wednesday that the accused tried to destroy evidence by cleaning the blood-stained clothes, floor and weapons. “We recovered two sharp weapons from the spot,” he added. An FIR lodged by Phoolendra Sah, the father-in-law of the accused, stated that Moti and Lal had tied the knot 10 years ago. The two used to fight with each other constantly. The neighbours saw them fighting even on Tuesday evening. “Later, Lal attacked his nine-month pregnant wife and two children with sharp weapons while they were asleep and killed them on the spot. He tried to dispose of the bodies, but one of his neighbours saw him and suspected foul play. He asked the other villagers to assemble there and found the three bodies,” a police source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-murders-pregnant-wife-and-2-kids/articleshow/85636552.cms||Alok Chamaria

BJP national spokesman Guru Prasad Paswan told mediapersons here that the manner in which Tejashwi had presented his demand with regard to the general caste census has hurt the sentiments of the SC and ST people.  “Tejashwi has hurt the sentiments of 20% of the people of the state. Therefore, he should immediately make a public apology. Failing this, these sections will be forced to make public protests against him,” Paswan said. From July this year, the demand for the caste census in the country became strident in the state, after Union minister Nityanand Rai told Parliament that the caste-wise enumeration of population, except of SCs and STs, would not be conducted during the Census 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-demands-apology-from-rjds-tejas/articleshow/85636720.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Opposition flays Centre over privatization move||PATNA: Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, on Wednesday lashed out at the central government for moving towards privatization, saying even basic things like health and education will be out of reach of a common man. State Congress leaders also criticized the NDA government for its national monetization pipeline scheme and alleged it was to give benefit to a select few. “India has a diverse social and economic structure. And if everything is sold to the private players, whose main concern is profit making, who will protect the rights of weaker sections of the society. Education, health, transportation and job will be out of the reach of weaker sections,” Tejashwi said. He alleged that through such a move, the NDA government was trying to curtail job opportunities for the reserved categories of people in the public sector. He criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi and central ministers, calling them as ‘Neem-Hakeem’ who have weakened the economy of the country. “The economy which was running properly before they had come to power, has become weak now. It is not even able to crawl. And to make it alive, its parts are being sold off to private players. What kind of capability is it to sell the courtyard in order to run the household,” Tejashwi said. Even state Congress hit out at the central government over the national monetization pipeline. State Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre said, “I just want the NDA leaders to answer what property they are selling if Congress had done nothing in this country? Can they name one asset which they have made after coming to power? The answer is they are selling what was made in the past seven decades.” However, state BJP spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel said the idea was to provide more profit to people and tap the existing assets in a better way. “It is just about decentralization and the government will have control over everything,” Patel said. Replying to his opponents who had questioned the present economic status of the country, Ranjan said, “Now the economy is in a better position and many development works took place, which had not been done post independence in the country. We are on par with other countries in the world.” He further said the NDA government had been stressing on employment and they were focusing more on making job creators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/opposition-flays-centre-over-privatization-move/articleshow/85634394.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Justice Paresh Upadhyay made this scathing remark while pronouncing a judgment on petitions filed by four persons from Amreli district, who were detained under Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA) after being booked under the Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act with regard to a property dispute. While quashing PASA orders, the judge warned the state government that siding with parties in private property disputes may someday land it in an embarrassing position. He also pointed the dangers of corrupt practices the new land grabbing laws are likely to bring in. The HC order reads, “The enthusiasm on the part of the state authorities to throw the weight of the State in favour of one of the contesting parties, in the matters of private property disputes, may land the State in an embarrassing position one day.” The court further said, “In the property disputes, the financial stakes from both sides may be very high. This may also lead to temptation to one of the parties, for soliciting help from the revenue and the police officers, for the considerations less known to law.” The court further said, “In the property disputes, the financial stakes from both sides may be very high. This may also lead to temptation to one of the parties, for soliciting help from the revenue and the police officers, for the considerations less known to law. These are the dangers which need to be kept in view by the higher authorities of the State.” While reading out the passage from his order, Justice Upadhyay commented, “You (the government) will be put in an embarrassing position, if you really feel embarrassed at all.” He went ahead, “People have now stopped hiring goons. File FIR, invoke PASA and get the possession of land. People are behind bars even for registered sale deeds.” The judge has been criticizing indiscriminate use of land grabbing laws followed by PASA. In this case, which involved two women hutment dwellers also, the court was critical of the district administration’s use of detention powers. The court cited the affidavit of the government official, in which the reason why PASA was resorted to and why a woman was not externed was delineated. He told the court that if the woman was externed, she could have still obtained legal advice from a lawyer and could continue her illegal activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-need-for-goons-anti-land-grab-law-serves-purpose-hc/articleshow/85638743.cms||---

The steps being taken include putting up posters with captions such as ‘dalalon sey savdhan’ (beware of touts), surprise checks at hospitals, close monitoring of the activities of outsiders roaming around on hospital premises besides the healthcare personnel, including nurses, paramedical staff and others by the internal vigilance teams. The district health authorities received complaints against touts who promise better medical facilities at reasonable rates to vulnerable patients, mostly from rural and suburban areas coming to government hospitals for the treatment. Health department sources said touts flourish at government hospitals in connivance with lower level healthcare staff. The touts, both men and women, first criticizes the healthcare system at a government hospital in front of vulnerable patients and then divert them to private clinics/hospitals by promising better medicare at private establishments. For that, the touts get hefty commission from the private clinics/hospitals. Bhagalpur civil surgeon (CS) Dr Umesh Sharma said they have taken steps to check this menace. “We have put up caution posters besides displaying our mobile numbers in case any patient is approached by touts or so,” he said and added that internal vigilance teams have also been formed to secretly monitor the activities of outsiders on the hospital premises besides the healthcare staff. “We have also started counselling of patients and their attendants about the free healthcare services, including delivery, surgery or other medical services being provided at Sadar hospital, primary health centres (PHCs) and other government hospitals,” the CS said. “We advise the patients and their attendants to inform the health authorities (whose mobile and telephone numbers are displayed) if anyone asks for money or tries to divert them away to private clinics or so.” Further steps like registering FIRs against touts found indulging in such nefarious activities will be taken, Sharma said, adding that some unscrupulous employees, medical practitioners and quacks (village doctors with medical degree) were involved in diverting patients from government to private hospitals. “Our efforts are to check this anyhow for safeguarding the innocent patients and in order to save their hardearned money and precious lives,” the CS added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhagalpur-health-officials-launch-drive-against-touts-at-govt-hospitals/articleshow/85634297.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The condition of retired university teachers and staff is worse as most of them, in their 80s and 90s, depend on their monthly pension to meet medical expenses and house rent besides groceries and other items of daily use. They adjust somehow if there is a delay of a month or two in payment of their pension, but it becomes unbearable if the payment is not made for four to five months together. L N Mithila University (LNMU) retired teacher Prabhat Kumar bemoaned that the last time he received his pension was in the month of April. Another retired teacher of the same university, P S Sanyal, also narrated his woes owing to the non-payment of his pension. LNMU pro-VC Dolly Sinha admitted that the salaries and pension had not been paid in the new financial year owing to non-receipt of the government grants. The payments would be made as soon as the grants are made available, she said. Jai Prakash University Retired Teachers’ Association, in a meeting held under the presidentship of D P Sinha, criticized the inordinate delay in payment of the pension for the last three months. The association threatened to resort to direct action if their due pension were not released without any further delay. The teachers and non-teaching staff of Patliputra University are also contemplating indefinite strike if their salaries were not released soon, said leaders of the university teachers’ association. The non-teaching staff of universities and colleges in the state have also threatened statewide agitation soon if the salaries and pension of working and retired staff were not released soon. Expressing serious concern at the non-payment of salaries and pension, Federation of University Teachers’ Assocaition of Bihar working president K B Sinha and general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh pointed said it was not only unethical but illegal also. Citing the 2018 judgment of the Patna high court (in an LPA filed by K K Sinha of BRA Bihar University), they said the court had clearly directed the universities to make the payment of pension latest by the seventh day of every month. But even the court order is being violated by the authorities concerned, they said. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, when contacted, said the release of the budgeted grants to the universities has been delayed owing to the abnormal Covid situation. He, however, said steps have already been initiated to release the grants at the earliest so that teachers and non-teaching staff are not subjected to hardships any further.

The party, through an editorial in mouthpiece Saamna, justified arresting Rane, saying he had made a similar offensive remark earlier. “Maharashtra will not tolerate it beyond a certain limit, and the time has come to show it through action,” it said. Without mentioning the Elgar Parishad case, the editorial said: “The erstwhile Fadnavis government put a few intellectuals behind bars only on suspicion of plotting to assassinate PM Narendra Modi. In this case, it is clear Naroba Rane has taken a ‘supari’ (contract). So, should we have to do ‘pooja aarti’ of these ‘suparibaaz’ in Maharashtra?” The party appealed to Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to take Rane’s statement seriously. “Rane has nothing to do with ‘sanskar’ (culture), so even after being a Union cabinet minister, he is making remarks like a roadside gangster. Use of such language about attacking the chief minister of Maharashtra is like an insult to the 105 martyrs,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/suparibaaz-rane-has-no-sanskar-sena/articleshow/85639594.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

At most centres, the sheer number of people queuing up for the first dose was much more than the number of those who had come for their second shot. With routine immunization for children also carried out on Wednesday, vaccination in many CVCs could start only in the afternoon. Those who had come for the second jab had to wait for a long time. At a CVC administering Covaxin in Hazra, senior citizen Subir Dutta, who had come for the second dose, had to wait for nearly three hours to be jabbed. “The KMC is changing its rules everyday. I didn’t know who had the idea of a single queue for both first and second dose recipients. People like us were visibly outnumbered by the recipients of the first dose. While some left the queue midway, I decided to wait to get the vaccination,” Dutta said. At the KMC mega vaccination centres, the officials of the civic body made separate arrangements for the two categories after they sensed trouble. Some KMC medical officers were themselves bewildered about the order that had been issued late on Monday night and they tweaked it to ensure that it did not lead to any trouble. At a KMC Covishield vaccination centre in Tollygunge, the civic staffers distributed coupons to the recipients of both the doses from 8am and asked them to turn up at noon. At first the recipients of both the doses were asked to stand in a single queue. Later, priority was accorded to the second dose recipients and accordingly, a provision was made for a separate queue. The medical officer of the Tollygunge-based clinic said that as vaccination had started late on Wednesday due to routine immunization programmes, they felt that the recipients of the second dose needed to be given priority over their first dose counterparts. In fact, the medical officers overseeing the CVCs also tweaked the rule of vaccine sharing ratio among the recipients of first and second doses. At a CVC near Garia, the medical officer allotted 100 doses for the recipients of first dose while 80 doses were kept aside for the second dose recipients. According to rules, 70% of the allocation of a civic vaccination clinic should go to the recipients of the first dose. “We have consciously taken a decision to cater to the second dose recipients who are now growing in numbers,” a KMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chaos-at-kmc-run-vaccination-centres/articleshow/85637137.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Patna||People urged to follow Covid protocols at places of worship||PATNA: With the state government announcing more relaxation in Covid-induced curbs and allowing places of worship to reopen from Thursday, several religious heads held meetings on Wednesday to chalk out a plan for checking the spread of the virus at temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras. They also welcomed the government’s decision and promised to follow all the safety protocols. Acharya Kishore Kunal, the secretary of Mahavir Mandir Trust, told this reporter that the temple gates would be opened for devotees from 5am. “With a view to avoiding huge gatherings and overcrowding, we will, however, not allow them to sit and spend time inside the temple for 10 days. They can come here, pray and leave as there will be no ‘paath’,” he added. Besides, people, willing to buy Naivedyam laddoos from the ‘prasad’ counters at Mahavir Temple, will follow social distancing norms by standing inside the yellow markings made on the floor. “We will issue passes to the devotees for performing ‘rudrabhishek’ and they will come back to the temple on the date assigned to them,” Kunal said, adding that 45 ‘rudrabhisheks’ would be performed every day. City mosques were also seen making necessary arrangements before opening their doors to devotees. Curtains, mats and carpets were removed and yellow markings created on floors to ensure social distancing. Maulana Shibli Al Quasmi, the general secretary of Imarat Shariah, hailed the government’s decision and urged devotees to enter mosques in masks, maintain social distancing and stick to Covid safety protocols. The premises of Takhat Sri Harimandir Ji gurdwara, which will reopen after months on Thursday, were sanitised thoroughly on Wednesday. Daljeet Singh, the superintendent of the Takhat Sri Harmandir Ji Prabandhak Committee, said, “We will only permit people with masks to enter the gurdwara and keep telling them to follow social distancing norms strictly.” Since the gurdwara’s langar hall is under construction, the worshippers will eat in another room which can accommodate 400 people at a time. Fr Pius Prashant SJ, the parish priest of Queen of the Apostles’ Church in Kurji, also pointed out that all protocols like sanitisation after each prayer service, use of masks, social distancing, and thermal screening would be followed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/people-urged-to-follow-covid-protocols-at-places-of-worship/articleshow/85633163.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: No polls till September 20 in merged villages||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Wednesday posted the hearing on a batch of petitions challenging merger of villages in urban local bodies by amending the rules of the Municipal Act to September 20. The government told the court it will not hold any elections till then in urban local bodies that are under challenge in the high court. Several petitions have been filed in the high court challenging the amendments made to the Municipal Act, either to merge nearby villages in the abutting urban local body or to create a new urban local body in place of the existing panchayat. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, senior counsel Dammalapati Srinivas said the amendment was challenged as it does not pass the test of law. He sought time to file reply to the counter affidavit filed by the state government. Advocate general S Sriram told the HC bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya that final hearing may be taken up after the petitioners file their replies. Considering the requests from both sides, the court posted the matter for final hearing to September 20. Sriram also told the bench that the state government will not proceed to conduct elections in the urban local bodies that are in challenge before the high court and sought directions from the court that the orders only be limited to those urban local bodies only. The high court agreed to his request and recorded the same in the orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-polls-till-sep-20-in-merged-villages/articleshow/85635707.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath distributes 20 lakh free LPG connections under Ujjwala-2||LUCKNOW: With assembly polls over six months away, the state government distributed free gas connections to 20 lakh beneficiaries under the second phase of the Centre’s flagship Ujjwala scheme. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who interacted with beneficiaries, said the second phase would benefit those left out of the first phase, particularly migrant workers and labourers. The second phase of the scheme was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Mahoba district on August 10. In this phase, beneficiaries have been identified from 10 districts, including Sonbhadra, Banda, Mahoba, Chitrakoot, Rae Bareli, Hardoi, Badayun, Amethi, Fatehpur and Farrukhabad and they need not produce documents for getting a LPG connection. The Ujjwala Yojana was launched on May 1, 2016, with the aim of providing free gas connections to 8 crore families. Of these, 1.37 crore were from UP. The CM said, there was no better example than Ujjwala scheme to prove the government’s commitment to women’s empowerment. “There is always a worry among women about cooking food on time. Till 2014, there were 8 crore families without gas connections. They used wood, coal and dung cakes. These were neither safe nor healthy. The PM wanted to provide healthy cooking gas to ensure better living standards and the petroleum ministry worked to achieve this,” the CM said. He added that he instructed district administrations to ensure that one representative of a company’s gas agency is deputed to visit houses and train women in safe use of LPG cylinders. In a veiled attack on the Opposition, Yogi Adityanath said, schemes are beneficial only if implemented on time and for this, one needs a government with a vision. “Before 2014, one had to wander around for gas cylinders and even after paying money, there was no guarantee of a connection. If they got a connection, there was no guarantee of gas. Earlier, people would stand in queues at midnight and by the time their turn came at dawn, cylinders would be exhausted,” he said, while highlighting hazards of using wood as cooking fuel. He said, those without cylinders had to mobilise fuel from forests, where they could be attacked by animals and even anti-social elements. “If wood got wet, people had to sleep with an empty stomach. Cooking gas is not just safe, but also a clean fuel,” he said. The CM added, the government had taken several measures for women’s empowerment, starting with Swachh Bharat Mission in which toilets were provided to 2.61 crore people in UP, appointment of banking sakhis in each gram panchayat and handing over management of community toilets and under-dispute ration shops to women self-help groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-distributes-20-lakh-free-lpg-connections-under-ujjwala-2/articleshow/85641617.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Business||All devices to get tokenised payment||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has extended the scope of tokenisation of card payments, hitherto limited to mobile phones, to all consumer devices — laptops, desktops, wearables like wristwatches & bands, and all Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Until now, RBI’s approval for tokenisation was limited to mobile phones and tablets. More devices would mean that customers can make contactless payments using their watches or do one-click payments from registered devices. RBI’s push for tokenisation comes at a time when it is cracking down on the storage of payment information by third parties. Allowing tokenisation on computers will enable users to make one-click payments after registration. It will also do away with the need to send card data over networks. “This is a great move by the RBI and will definitely help reduce frauds across e-commerce transactions and improve security standards for the industry as a whole,” said Pine Labs CEO Amrish Rau. Tokenisation is a solution where, once an account is registered with a payment network, the network issues a token, which is associated with a card, to that account. Each time payment has to be made, the account shares the token with the payment network, which processes the transaction on the card linked to the token. Samsung has been one of the early users of tokenisation with its Samsung Pay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/all-devices-to-get-tokenised-payment/articleshow/85639040.cms||---

The CM took stock of the development works on the zoo safari premises on a battery-operated cart. During the visit, Nitish enquired about the food, treatment and maintenance of animals like lion, bear and leopard. The CM said arrangements should also be made for the accommodation of the doctors who will stay inside the zoo safari so that the health of the animals can be taken care. He said there should be no harm to the people from the animals. Nitish said since 10% of the people are troublemakers, security should be tight at the zoo safari to avoid disturbances. “Even a small mistake can cause an accident,” Nitish said, adding many tigers and lions have been brought to zoo safari and few more will be brought in the coming time. “A building is being constructed to enter the zoo safari. When it will be ready, the zoo safari will be opened to the general people. Zoo safari animals will roam in the open and people will be able to enjoy it by sitting in the car here. For this, all kinds of security arrangements are being made in zoo safari. Arrangements for food and emergency treatment are also being made here for the visitors,” the CM said. Principal secretaries to CM Deepak Kumar and Chanchal Kumar, principal secretary (environment, forest and climate change) Deepak Kumar Singh, secretary to CM Anupam Kumar, Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal and other senior officials were present during the CM’s visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-inspects-facilities-at-rajgir-zoo-safari/articleshow/85668986.cms||Faryal Rumi

DM Shirshat Kapil Ashok said that at least 1,450 trees have been identified by the administration and rechristened as ‘Guardian Trees’. The movement helps display the social, historical, local grandeur and association of these trees with the community through signboards. These details are also uploaded on a specially-designed app 'Paryavaran Prahari'. All trees have now been given geo-tags through the app. It also provides complete description of trees including their age, girth, botanical and local names. The DM further said that a banyan tree believed to be 400 years old has been identified at Sonbarsa village under Harsidhi block with the support of villagers which was left in utter neglect for the last several decades. He along with a large numbers of men and women of the village decorated it with flowers and balloons on the eve of Rakshabandhan. Jeevika didis tied rakhi to the 'Guardian Tree' and took a vow to protect it. One of the oldest trees at Mirpur Pokhar in the district has been in existence since the British era. In fact, many village women tied rakhi on 1,450 ‘Guardian trees’ in 27 blocks of the district on Rakshabandhan.  In Rupani village under Patahi block, women tied rakhi on a Pipal tree and took an oath to protect this sacred tree.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/east-champaran-admn-bid-to-protect-over-1k-old-trees/articleshow/85636867.cms||Chandra Bhushan Pandey

Microfinance portfolios, on the other hand, were the most impacted with the second wave adding to the stress. Among other personal loans, credit cards were impacted by the pandemic but the impact of the second wave was lower. According to a report by Nomura, the stress in the core mortgage portfolio for top players is in the range of 0.7% to 2.7%. The two companies that have a divergent trend with higher stress in the core mortgage book in the first wave were LIC Housing Finance and PNB Housing. In the second wave, however, they did better with stressed loans in line with the industry. The report has done a study of stress based on not just bad loans but also those where the borrower has sought more time to repay. Compared to mortgages, credit cards have seen higher stress build-up, particularly during the first wave of the pandemic. “But, with the salaried segment largely unaffected, the stress formation was materially lower than MFIs (micro finance institutions) and the wave-2 impact is meaningfully lower as well,” the Nomura report said. Write-offs in the microfinance segments have been in the 3-6% range and increase in non-performing assets (NPAs) has been 8-14% compared to pre-Covid levels. In addition, unrecognised stress (borrowers not meeting schedules) were high at 4-9%. The segment that is not out of the woods yet is microfinance. “MFIs clearly remained the most impacted, given the customer segment and the unsecured nature of products, with 7-16% stress formation during wave-1 (FY21) and a further 3-16% stress during wave-2 (Q1FY22),” the report said. Compared to credit cards, vehicles are secured loans. However, this segment has also witnessed challenges largely because of the lenders’ exposure to the ‘earn-and-pay’ segment or those who purchase vehicles for hire like bus operators and taxi aggregators. This segment was the worst impacted during the lockdown. “Overall, the stress build-up has been 5-26% (wave 1+2) with NPA increase of 1-17% and unrecognised stress build-up of 3-21%,” Nomura said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mortgages-safest-micro-loans-riskiest-amid-covid-report/articleshow/85637986.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||Nurse gunned down, doctor injured in Sitamarhi firing||PATNA/SITAMARHI: Unidentified criminals killed an auxiliary midwife and shot at a noted doctor in Sitamarhi town late Tuesday night. The deceased was identified as Ankita Pandey, a resident of Sutihara in Sitamarhi district. The injured, Dr Shivshanker Mahto (45), is struggling for his life at a private hospital at Dumra. Mahto’s second wife, Dr Shabnam, and two other employees -- Suresh Kumar and Munna Kumar besides his car driver Prabhash managed to escape unhurt in the firing. The incident took place after Tuesday midnight when Dr Mahto along with Babli Kumari alias Ankita, Dr Shabnam and the two employees returned to his private nursing home located at Shanti Nagar in the town after supervising the ongoing work at his new hospital building. As soon as Ankita stepped out of the car, the assailants waiting on a two-wheeler nearby, opened fire indiscriminately. They pumped three bullets into Dr Mahto’s body and fled the spot in a huff thinking that he was dead. Ankita’s body bore five bullet injury marks. Both the injured were rushed to a nearby hospital. However, Ankita succumbed to her injuries. Dr Pravin, who was attending to the injured Dr Mahto, said the bullets hit his chest, hand and foot. He described his condition as critical. “The next 48 hours are crucial for him,” he said. Sitamarhi SP Harkishore Rai said an FIR was lodged against four people, including Dr Mahto’s first wife and two nephews in connection with the incident. “All the named accused have been arrested,” he told this newspaper over phone. The SP said preliminary investigation revealed that the surgeon had a property dispute. “Another private clinic was likely to be made operational near Shanker Chowk in the town,” he added. Dr Mahto’s second wife, Dr Shabnam, earlier worked in his old hospital. “New properties were purchased in her name, which enraged Dr Mahto’s first wife and other family members,” the SP said. Agitated over the murderous attack on the surgeon, local nursing homes and medical stores kept their shutters down on Wednesday in protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nurse-gunned-down-doctor-injured-in-sitamarhi-firing/articleshow/85634209.cms||Ramashankar
---||Varanasi||Hit by Covid-19, KVT earnings nowget a boost as footfall improves||Varanasi: Though the first wave of Covid-19 substantially hit the income of Kashi Vishwanath Temple (KVT) in 2020, the temple’s coffers are showing improvement through donations and other sources despite the challenges posed by the second wave of the pandemic. Temple authorities said the improvement was possible owing to an increased footfall of pilgrims, especially those from southern states. This has also brought respite for the hospitality industry that faced its worst phase of financial losses in 2019-20. KVT registered a huge footfall in the recently concluded Shrawan month. Collections made through help-desks that sell tickets for performing various rituals, participation in aartis and ‘Sugam Darshan’, donations and other sources saw a hefty increase. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “The temple recorded a collection of Rs 26.65 crores in 2018-19 financial year and Rs 26.47 crores in 2019-20. However, in 2020-21 the temple got only Rs 12.58 crores.” The major reason behind the drop in the temple’s income was KVT’s complete closure for over 100 days during the first wave of Covid-19 in 2020. The temple was closed in March 2020 and reopened on June 8, 2020, and had zero income through help-desk and donation in donation boxes of the temple in this period. Even after reopening in June 2020, the temple had a meagre footfall. Even on Mondays of Shrawan month, the temple was visited by less than 6,000 devotees. If the Banaras Hotel Association president Gokul Sharma is to be believed, some improvement in arrival of pilgrims had been witnessed with the Dev Deepawali celebration in November 2020 and the trend continued till March this year, when the second wave of pandemic hit the tourism and hospitality industry again. However, despite being deadly, the second wave could not stop the income of the temple completely. Instead of closing the temple in April, the district administration decided to keep KVT open by making negative RT-PCR test report of past 72 hours mandatory for entry, although entry in Garbhgriha (sanctum sanctorum) and ‘Sparsh Darshan’ (touching of Jyotirlinga) had been stopped. This provision remained effective for 54 days when footfall of devotees became meagre. According to the commissioner, the temple’s earning was Rs 90.93 lakhs in April, Rs 66.42 lakhs in May and Rs 33.74 lakhs in July. During the Shrawan month, KVTs earning went above Rs 1.11 crore. The major reason was a massive increase in the number of devotees, especially from southern states during the Shrawan month. Police and temple records show that 60,000 to one lakh pilgrims entered KVT, which had an average footfall of over 10,000 devotees per day before the Covid-19 menace started in March 2020, on Mondays of Shrawan this year. This has convinced the officials of an improvement in KVTs income in the current financial year over the previous one despite the jolts given by the second wave of the pandemic. The trend has also increased the expectations of the hoteliers. Sharma said, “The increase in the number of vaccinated people and awareness regarding precautions in pandemic has bolstered the inflow of pilgrims from across the country. Though hotel rooms are sold at less price than normal times, it has given some respite to the industry after the bitter experience of 2020.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/hit-by-covid-19-kvt-earnings-nowget-a-boost-as-footfall-improves/articleshow/85639515.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Singh, in his written compliant lodged with Shastrinagar police station in Patna, alleged that he received five calls on his mobile phone between 11.16am and 12.03pm on Wednesday. The caller allegedly threatened him with dire consequences for making Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras’s visit to Hajipur a grand success on August 23. Singh also provided the sim number, which was allegedly used to make the threat calls. The call detail record and duration of the calls were also handed over to the police. Apart from Chirag, Saurabh Pandey, Krishna Singh Kallu, Chandan Singh and Amar Azad figured in the complaint. Chirag’s supporters, however, said it was nothing but an attempt by the Paras group to gain cheap popularity. Later, Keshav told the media that Krishna and Chandan, both spokespersons of Chirag faction, were heard telling their associates on August 23 that they were plotting to eliminate him (Keshav). The information was shared to him by his elder son Kanishka Rathaur when he returned home after taking part in the programme of Paras, Singh claimed in the police complaint. Singh, along with his supporters, had gone to the Patna airport to receive Paras when the incident happened, the police complaint said. Shastrinagar police station SHO said the allegations against the accused were being verified. “Action will be initiated against the accused only after the allegations were found to be true,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/complaint-lodged-against-chirag-4-others/articleshow/85636796.cms||Ramashankar
---||Visakhapatnam||Pvt managements ponder implications of fee fixation||Visakhapatnam: The AP School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSERMC) has fixed the fee structure for both schools and junior colleges for the block period of 2021-22 to 2023-24. The private school and junior college managements are taking the fee fixation with a pinch of salt as they are not sure how it would impact their prospects down the line. If major schools and colleges charge the maximum prescribed fee, the budget educational institutions may have to go with a lower fee structure to stay in the competition. Private managements claim that the Covid-19 pandemic has already dealt a severe blow to them, both on the planning as well as the finances front. Now, they are in a quandary over the outcomes of the capping of the fee structure as they believe it could go either way, particularly for small educational institutions. Several corporate junior colleges and schools in Andhra Pradesh are currently charging a fee much higher than what the prescribed structure recommends. For instance, some colleges in Vizag and Vijayawada are collecting nearly Rs 1.5 lakh per annum as tuition fee, hostel fee and JEE/NEET coaching fee, combined. But under the new structure, they can collect a maximum of Rs 64,000 (Rs 20,000 as tuition fee, Rs 24,000 hostel fee and Rs 20,000 for coaching). But expressing happiness over the fee capping, parents want the new structure to be strictly implemented and without giving any scope to private institutions to deviate from the orders. B Srinivasa Rao, a resident of Marripalem in Vizag and a parent of a class X student, welcomed the move and said that private managements should implement the government orders in letter and spirit. State chairman, Andhra Pradesh Private Schools Association, KSN Murthy, said; “Though it seems to be an advantage for small budget schools on paper, the outcome may go either way. The pandemic has severely affected the finances of the small schools. It would be better if the government considers the finances and budget of the schools instead of announcing a uniform fee structure for all,” KSN Murthy. State convener of the Child Rights Protection Forum (CRPF) Gondu Sitaram said it was commendable that the government had taken a bold decision to curb the arbitrary collection of fees by the owners of unaided private schools and colleges in the state. “Before the YSRC came to power, representatives of the then party manifesto design committee headed by the current state assembly speaker Tammineni Sitaram had brought the issue to the notice of Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and Ummareddy Venkateswarlu under the CRPF. Students and their parents are overjoyed with the decision,” said Sitaram. Speaking to TOI on conditions of anonymity, a deputy general manager of a corporate college in Vizag said the going may get difficult for private junior colleges, particularly those in cities. “We are paying lakhs on rent, lecturer salaries, lab consumables, advanced classroom technologies, etc. We may not be in a situation to operate at this fee structure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/pvt-managements-ponder-implications-of-fee-fixation/articleshow/85635332.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Business||Sebi okays blockchain tech for NCDs||Mumbai: To make the record-keeping process related to securities traded in the market more secure, Sebi on Wednesday asked depositories to use distributed ledger technology — popularly called blockchain technology — to record and monitor credit ratings of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) and creation of charges on these securities like pledges, among others. The distributed ledger technology has the potential to provide a more resilient system than the traditional centralised databases, the markets regulator said in a statement. It offers better protection against different types of cyberattacks because of its distributed nature, which removes the single point of attack possibility, it said. Sebi said that a platform for security and covenant monitoring systems, hosted by depositories, is being developed. Usage of blockchains for these purposes on the new platform will be effective April 1, 2022. Among others, the new system will help in continuous monitoring of credit rating of the NCDs by agencies. “A system using blockchain technology for non-convertible securities along with the underlying assets would be created and all charges and asset valuation transactions shall be recorded by the respective entities including issuers, debenture trustees and credit rating agencies,” Sebi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-okays-blockchain-tech-for-ncds/articleshow/85639191.cms||---
---||Business||India startup funds top China in July after 8 years||MUMBAI: Global venture capitalists and private equity investors are allocating more funds to India as China steps up regulatory clampdown on its tech companies. India overtook China in July for the first time since 2013 in VC funding, according to a Bloomberg report. Indian startups raised nearly $8 billion in July, while funding to Chinese firms dropped to about $5 billion, the report said. Venture capital (VC) firms said Indian technology companies are seeing a significant uptick in funding as global investors rethink their China strategy and sharpen their focus on India, which has traditionally lagged the dragon in terms of drawing capital. Indian startups have raised a record $17 billion in the January-July 2021 period, a surge from about $12 billion raised in full year 2020 and $14 billion in 2019, according to analytics firm GlobalData. “Till now, India lagged China. As Chinese tech and global investors grapple with the expanding government and regulatory crackdown, India’s tech fundamentals appear strong. A host of B2C (business-to-consumer) and B2B (business-to-business) sectors are coming of age. The pace of scaling and value creation has accelerated. For global investors, India increasingly checks the right boxes for tech investments,” said Sameer Nath, managing partner at the Mumbai-based VC firm TrueScale Capital. Read AlsoAustralia flags democracies' trade swing from China to IndiaAustralian special envoy and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott said a free trade agreement between his nation and India would signal the "democratic world's tilt away from China."Nath added that investors are also observing liquidity. “The environment for IPO and M&A exits has never been this strong, boosting global investor confidence in India tech,” Nath, who is also the co-founder of VC firm Iron Pillar, said. Though Chinese startups raised about $49 billion in the first six months of 2021, funding has slowed since the December quarter of 2020, according to CB Insights data. From a peak of $27.7 billion raised in Q4 2020, Chinese startup funding dropped by 18% to $22.8 billion in Q2 of 2021, while India funding rose by 62% to $6.3 billion from $3.9 billion in the same period. Another reason India stands to benefit is the country’s tech talent, public tech infrastructure and market size, according to startup investors. Read AlsoCountry now comes before profit for companies in Xi’s ChinaPinduoduo Inc, an e-commerce company known for giving big discounts to customers when they buy produce together, said it will donate all of its first net profit since going public to support the country’s farmers and agricultural areas.“The series of sudden crackdowns in China’s internet-first tech economy has taken investors by surprise. A stable and rational regulatory environment is one of the prerequisites for long-term, illiquid investments. It is not surprising then that investors are re-evaluating their China strategy. India could benefit from any capital flows shifting away from China,” said Surya Mantha, senior partner at Bengaluru- and Seattle-based VC fund Unitus Ventures. Under-allocation to India is another factor that might bring in more dollars to the country’s tech startups. “Investors in most key capital markets are materially under-allocated to India, especially compared to the opportunity set. We see an increase in absolute allocations to India over the medium term. In the longer term, the continued investments in India will be driven both by demand (realised investor experience) and supply (investable businesses),” said Harsh Shethia, India head at global alternative asset manager Investcorp, which managed $38 billion at the end of FY21. Read AlsoChina's crackdown on its biggest companiesWith market-trembling new rules and investigations, Beijing's crackdown on its most prominent companies has seeped into nearly every aspect of modern life, wiping billions of dollars from Chinese and Hong Kong-listed stocks and bamboozling investment sages.According to Shethia, capital flowing to tech-enabled businesses is a global phenomenon driven by changing consumption habits and digitisation of businesses. “This thesis has been reinforced with very attractive returns generated from such investments,” Shethia added. Another data set that points to increasing capital flows is that India has seen 25 new unicorns (startups valued at over $1 billion each) in 2021, while China has added about 15, according Tracxn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-startup-funds-top-china-in-july-after-8-years/articleshow/85639529.cms||Aseem Gujar
---||Dehradun||Airport at Pantnagar University: Uttarakhand high court asks aviation secy to appear||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday directed the Union civil aviation secretary to appear before it after the Centre failed to reply to the court’s notice that sought its response on a plea challenging a proposed airport at GB Pant University of Agriculture & Technology. In November last year, the government had acquired 1,072 acres of land belonging to the varsity for expansion of the Pantnagar Airport. Soon after, a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by a US Nagar resident, Keshav Kumar Passi, arguing that the proposed airport would end up splitting the university campus into two. The petition argued that the districts of Nainital and US Nagar have over 76,000 acres of barren land which could be used for airport expansion but the government had chosen land belonging to the university which is a “hotbed of agriculture research”. According to court records, notices were issued to the state government as well as the Centre and the Airports Authority of India in December last year. On Wednesday, the division bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma was informed that the state has furnished its response, but the Centre was yet to file its affidavit. This was despite the case being listed for hearing half a dozen times. In the last hearing on July 28, the Centre’s standing counsel had told the court that he has no instructions from the government on the matter. The court had then asked its registry to inform the Centre about the fact that the counsel had pleaded “no instructions” and gave four weeks to “engage the services of any other counsel of its choice”. The division bench has now asked the civil aviation secretary to be physically present in court during the next hearing on September 15. Passi had also argued that the site of expansion is at least 13km from the existing airport. “The plan has no logic. The proposed site is closer to Bareilly, which already has an airport, than to other towns and cities of Uttarakhand,” he told TOI. “Also, the seeds that the university grows for research feed almost 25% of the country’s population. The varsity is already flanked by a national highway on the east, industries in another direction and now an airport will come up on fertile land and divide the campus into two. How are students supposed to conduct their research amid continuous noise of aircraft?” Passi said. The existing Pantnagar airport is built on an area of 267 hectares and can handle 50 passengers. The airport runs flights to Dehradun and Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/airport-at-pantnagar-uni-hc-asks-aviation-secy-to-appear-as-centre-silent-for-8-mnths/articleshow/85637146.cms||Prashant Jha

In its latest new fund offer (NFO), SBI Mutual Fund, the largest fund house in India in terms of money under management, mobilised over Rs 12,000 crore in its Balanced Advantage Fund. This is the largest ever NFO mobilisation by an equity fund in the mutual fund industry’s history. The previous biggest collection was Rs 9,800 crore by ICICI Prudential MF through its Flexi Cap Fund last month. According to SBI MF executives, Wednesday was the last day of the NFO and it will take a few more days to reconcile and arrive at the final mobilisation figure. Industry sources expect that number to cross Rs 12,500-crore mark. SBI MF executives said that with the stock market at a record high level, a large number of investors who are not very comfortable investing in stocks have put in their money in the fund. Also there are investors who want a return that is higher than fixed deposit rates, which are at a historical low level. Industry figures show in July equity NFOs had mobilised Rs 13,709-crore, while the current month’s figure is expected to cross that figure. Large NFO collection was one of the reasons for the record Rs 22,584-crore net inflows into equity funds, AMFI officials had said earlier this month. Currently another five equity NFOs and one fixed income offer are live, data from fund industry analytics firm Value Research’s website showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-mf-nets-record-rs-12k-cr-in-new-fund/articleshow/85639432.cms||---

While in Surat, the city’s roads to visitors’ good books may be gilded in stones literally, the dazzle, however, crashes in the bone-rattling bumpy ride. While life fights to return to normalcy and businesses too are trying to grow to pre-Covid levels, the city’s roads write their own story of neglect and apathy. Roads in many areas get washed away even amid the scanty spells of rain this monsoon, leaving huge craters for commuters to juggle through. At a few of the locations, people have to hunt for the road in the muddy potholed trail. If anything, the road from where Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) operates in Muglisara is a mirror to the mess elsewhere in the city. Senior officials claimed that they do regular repairs on receiving complaints. However, the question about the quality of road reconstruction remains with every minor spell of rain leaving their tall claims exposed. The road connecting SMC headquarter to Katargam is in such a pathetic condition that no two-wheeler rider can dare to drive over 20 kmph speed. “SMC teams keep repairing damaged roads on a regular interval,” said Gayatri Jariwala, central zone chief. She said that it is SMC’s priority to repair any road within the shortest possible period and particularly the damaged stretches with utmost importance. Elected SMC leaders are working to approve construction of cement concrete road for longer lifespan, but as for the existing damage they only plan to get these roads repaired.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bone-rattling-rides-shake-diamond-citys-suave-posture/articleshow/85634531.cms||---

This is because the process of admissions has begun and a large number of students have already submitted their applications. Universities, however, have not yet announced the introduction of semester mode under the CBCS. In 2019 the chancellor’s secretariat had announced that the CBCS would be introduced at the UG stage in all the colleges from the 2020-2021 session. It had also initiated steps for getting the syllabi of UG courses revised according to the new system. Anil Kumar, the dean of students’ welfare at Patna University, told this newspaper that the CBCS had already been introduced for self-financing courses at the UG level during the 2019-2020 session. “But the BA, BSc and BCom programmes continue to run in the annual mode,” he said, adding, “Now that the process of admissions has already started, we cannot implement the CBCS from the current academic session.” Universities in Bihar had implemented the CBCS at the postgraduate stage from the 2018-2019 session, but they could not do so at the UG level as most degree colleges were not prepared for it. Now, the universities as well as the colleges under their jurisdiction have geared up to accept the challenge and implement the new mode of curricula. According to sources, the Raj Bhavan had initiated steps for revision of the curricula of all UG programmes keeping in mind the CBCS a couple of years ago. It was decided that the syllabus of a subject would be revised by a particular university with the help of all other universities where it is taught. The universities, which were entrusted with the job of revision of syllabi of different subjects, included Patna University (physics, mathematics, geology, geography, personnel management and industrial relations, statistics, biochemistry, English, Urdu, Arabic, music, and home science), Magadh University (economics, history, ancient Indian history, Magahi, chemistry, Buddhist studies, and social work), Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University (botany, Hindi, Persian, and electronics), Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (zoology, anthropology, computer science, sociology, Bengali, and political science), Veer Kunwar Singh University (philosophy and Bhojpuri), Lalit Narayan Mithila University (psychology, commerce, and Maithili), Bhupendra Narayan Mandal University (biotechnology and industrial microbiology), and Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University (Sanskrit). The universities had reportedly revised the syllabi and sent them to the chancellor’s secretariat. Now, the Raj Bhavan has forwarded the same to the Bihar State Higher Education Council (BSHEC). The vice-chairman of the BSHEC, Kameshwar Jha, said necessary action would be taken by the council and new courses like NCC introduced under the CBCS. “The academic reforms committee constituted by the BSHEC has, in its interim report, recommended introduction of the CBCS at the UG level,” he added. The principal of A N College, S P Shahi, pointed out that new academic programmes under the CBCS would provide some flexibility to the students in the choice of subjects. The CBCS was introduced by the University Grants Commission both for UG and PG courses in 2015. It is also one of the key components of the National Education Policy 2020 which provides for the introduction of a criterion-based grading system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/wait-gets-longer-as-universities-fail-to-introduce-cbcs-this-year/articleshow/85632981.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bihar: 4 held for killing budding engineer in Purnia||PATNA: The broad daylight murder of a first year engineering student Harsh Kumar Jha in Purnia on Tuesday was fallout of a fracas with one of his friends over some trivial issue, police said on Thursday. Purnia SP Dayashankar said the deceased's four friends, including the prime accused Sanu, were arrested on the basis of scientific evidence. The illegal weapon, which was used in the crime, was also seized by the police. During investigation, it came to light that Sanu had shot Harsh at the residence of his associate Jyoti Prakash at around 10.30 am on Tuesday following a verbal duel. He and his friends, however, tried to mislead the police by concocting a different story. Sanu, Jyoti Prakash and Divyanshu Raj had earlier told police that Harsh was shot by unidentified armed criminals when they were going towards DAV Chowk from Manjali Chowk under Madhubani police outpost on a motorbike on August 24. Police, however, suspected some foul play as none of the three had blood stains on their clothes. The SP said that Sanu, Jyoti Prakash, his brother Jyoti Deep and Divyanshu cleaned blood stains on the floor to hide the truth. However, they broke down during sustained interrogation and confessed their crime, he added. A day before the incident, Harsh, a first year student of an engineering college in Bhubaneswar, had attended the birthday party hosted by Jyoti Prakash near Chunapur bridge. As they got late at the birthday celebration, Sanu, Divyanshu and Harsh stayed at the residence of Jyoti. Next morning, Sanu had an altercation with Harsh over some trivial issue. Agitated, Sanu whipped out a pistol and fired at Harsh, killing him on the spot. During a search of Jyoti’s house, police recovered the weapon, which will be sent to the forensic laboratory for ballistic examination. The SP said that the case would be listed for speedy trial as all the accused have already been arrested and forwarded to jail. Jyoti Prakash’s brother Jyoti Deep has been charged with abetment of crime. Earlier, the deceased's father Kamlesh Jha told police that Harsh had come to Purnia during lockdown after his college in Bhubaneswar was closed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/4-held-for-killing-budding-engineer-in-purnia/articleshow/85669172.cms||Ramashankar

The DM also discussed about the upcoming panchayat elections, housing schemes for the landless, Covid-19 testing as well as vaccination. “Six blocks of Katihar district have been badly affected by floods caused by the Ganga, Kosi, Kari Kosi and Barandi rivers. The district administration responded quickly and started distribution of dry ration packets and polythene sheets. Rising water-level has forced many families to migrate to higher embankments and pitch their tents. We have started community kitchens to feed the people who were forced to leave their homes,” the DM said adding, “Cattle camps as well as fodder for them were also arranged. Many temporary tubewells and toilets were also built to cater to the needy.” “As on date, more than 225 community kitchens are functioning. With the water-level slowly receding, the focus has now shifted to disinfect the area which was under water and help the people shift to their homes,” the DM, said adding, “The kitchen will continue till all the people go back to their homes. We are hopeful that in a week the situation will improve.” Besides, the district magistrate also directed the officials about financial assistance to flood-hit families, as well as functioning of community kitchens as per the standard operating procedures. He also asked the officials to expedite the process of providing financial assistance to the dependents of those who died of Covid-19. “Out of 230 Covid-related deaths, we have provided financial assistance to 103 dependents,” said Mishra. Apart from this, the circle officers and BDOs were directed to gear up for the upcoming panchayat polls as well as upkeep of EVMs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expedite-relief-measures-in-flood-hit-areas-katihar-dm/articleshow/85607665.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Kalol blast: Wary govt insists on ONGC nod for building plan OK||GANDHINAGAR: A gas pipeline explosion in an upscale residential society in Kalol near Gandhinagar eight months ago has led the state government to become hyper-vigilant over the issue. In fact, Gujarat's chief town planner issued directives to all municipal town planners and those employed with urban development authority to mandatorily seek ONGC NOCs as a prerequisite for passing building plans. Although the provision is not new, the incident at Kalol in which two houses collapsed and killed two persons, has made it obligatory for developers to seek several permissions, which is reportedly having a cascading effect on construction activity in the state. It is learnt that the construction plan clearance of Karnavati Club’s new resort located in Mulsana village in Gandhinagar district has come under a cloud due to this. Sources sources said that the new club’s tentative construction plan is awaiting clearance from the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) as an ONGC pipeline passes from the land parcel. Sources said that despite making provisions for leaving enough space around the pipeline in accordance with the norms, their plan awaits clearances. AUDA CEO A B Gor claimed that AUDA is yet to receive a detailed plan from the club. “The rule is clear. We require a detailed plan to initiate the NOC process with ONGC. Till now our office has not received a detailed plan from Karnavati club,” said Gor. State chief town planner B S Shah said that provision for checking underground oil or gas pipelines and electric lines has been in force for long. “Somehow it was not followed by the developers, so after the Kalol incident, we have categorically directed all the concerned town planning officers not to issue any permissions before necessary NOC is obtained,” Shah said. Industry experts said that gas pipeline clearance issue has put several real estate projects in a fix. Already 11 real estate projects in Vastral as well as two projects in Nikol, from where the ONGC line passes, are on hold, AMC sources said.  A minimum of 12 to 15 meters of buffer space on either side of an underground ONGC line has to be left unconstructed as per existing guidelines. “The delay will be four months for getting an ONGC clearance. Once a citizen approaches a municipal body or an urban development authority for plan approvals, the municipal authority has to independently seek an NOC from ONGC and so does the citizen, if there is an ONGC line nearby. The application is processed at ONGC’s Chandkheda office and later sent ahead to its head office in Mumbai for approval,” says a senior town planning officer at Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). It is worth mentioning here that for the past 9 years, civic bodies like the AMC had begun incorporating ONGC lines in their town planning maps following a site inspection. In December 2020, a gas pipeline explosion at a residential society in Kalol caused the collapse of two houses leaving one dead and four injured. The concerned residential society is located near ONGC field in Kalol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kalol-blast-wary-govt-insists-on-ongc-nod-for-bldg-plan-ok/articleshow/85638621.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Kolkata||Rising air pollution may lead to erratic monsoon, low rain: Study||Kolkata: The greater the air pollution, the more erratic the monsoon. Latest research collated by Climate Trend, a climate watchdog, has indicated the country in general, and the entire Indo-Gangetic plain in specific, is at risk of losing 10%-15% of mean monsoon rainfall in coming years, which may spell doom for agricultural production, recharging of underground aquifer and life of rivers, resulting in an imminent water crisis in cities like Kolkata. Air pollution is the result of aerosols in the atmosphere from human-led emitting sources along with natural dust. On the other hand, monsoon is a seasonal oceanic phenomenon governed by change in wind pattern due to differential heating of tropics. The southwest monsoon is driven by the temperature difference between land and ocean. Now, as the concentration of aerosols increases, it leads to warming of the atmosphere and cooling of land surface. According to meteorologists, any kind of change in differential heating of land and ocean will impact the wind pattern. This change in thermal profile in the atmosphere has an influence on monsoon circulation, eventually leading to impact on precipitation and its performance. “Air pollution is likely to decrease the southwest monsoon rainfall by 10%-15% for the country. It could also delay its onset,” said Dilip Ganguly, associate professor, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi. “Presence of a large amount of aerosols over the Indian landmass would lead to weakening of the dynamics of monsoon,” said S N Tripathi of IIT Kanpur and Steering Committee Member, National Clean Air Programme, MoEFCC. “The delayed monsoon and unusual concentrated rainfall in a shorter span of time is counterproductive as far as recharging the aquifer is concerned. Thus more and more rivers will go dry,” said Kalyan Rudra, a river specialist and chairman of WBPCB. V Vinoj, assistant professor, School of Earth Ocean and Climate Sciences, IIT Bhubaneswar, said, “Air pollution can increase, decrease or redistribute rainfall based on differences in how they interact with radiation and clouds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rising-air-pollution-may-lead-to-erratic-monsoon-low-rain-study/articleshow/85637758.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

He asked district collectors to organise campaign programmes on the last Friday and Saturday of every month. Reviewing the progress of various schemes and projects with the district collectors and SPs through video-conference, the chief minister said that ward secretaries should organise sensitisation programme for the beneficiaries a day ahead of the schedule release of financial assistance. He wanted that the efficiency of the secretariats should be further strengthened to improve the service delivery to the people. ”The verification of eligibility of applicants of rice, Aarogyasri card and pension should be completed within 21 days. All eligible people should get their card within 90 days. The rejected application should reach the secretariat back with valid reason and the staffers should be in a position to explain the reasons for rejection,” said the chief minister. He said that four calendars of 90 days would be available for grant of welfare schemes every year. The chief minister, however, made it clear that no eligible application should be turned down at any cost. He wanted that the secretariat staffers should visit the households in their areas very frequently and help the people to get the benefit of welfare schemes. The chief minister said that applications for house sites, financial assistance under Netanna Hastham, Cheyutha, Matsyakara Bharosa should be verified in 90 days and approvals should be granted in six months. He said that two spells would be available to extend the bracket of such welfare schemes every year. “Strengthening secretariats should help us render justice to each and every eligible beneficiary. It will automatically instill confidence among people in the system,” stressed the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/instill-confidence-in-welfare-progs-among-public-says-cm/articleshow/85635403.cms||Samdani MN

---||Business||Tata Sons FY21 profit up over 2x on TCS buyback||MUMBAI: Tata Sons profit more than doubled in fiscal 2021 on the back of gains made from participating in the share buyback programme of TCS. Profit zoomed 142% to Rs 6,512 crore from Rs 2,680 crore in FY20. Revenue from operations — which mainly comprise dividend income, interest income and brand royalty fees — fell 62% to Rs 9,460 crore. Other income was higher at Rs 10,138 crore as compared to Rs 126 crore in FY20. This, Tata Sons explained in its annual report, was because a substantial part of the other income was profit from buyback of shares by TCS. Including other income, its total revenue declined 21% to Rs 19,598 crore. Either gains made from participating in the TCS share repurchase scheme or its special dividend payout has been boosting the earnings of Tata Sons, which has 269 subsidiaries, in the last four fiscals. Debt and borrowings reduced slightly to Rs 30,064 crore, according to the FY21 report. Cash and bank balances fell 35% to Rs 912 crore. Total expenses decreased 22% to Rs 3,981 crore. On a consolidated basis, the company’s profit increased 78% to Rs 19,397 crore. Tata Sons has called for an annual general meeting mid-September to seek shareholders’ approval on the re-appointment of three directors. There is, however, no mention of chairman N Chandrasekaran’s re-appointment in the annual report. His term as a director of Tata Sons — he was appointed on October 25, 2016 — ends this October. His chairmanship tenure, however, ends in February. The FY21 report said that the nomination and remuneration committee reviewed the performance of Tata Sons board as a whole, and its individual directors. It added that, in a separate meeting of independent directors, the performance of non-independent directors as well as the performance of the chairman was evaluated. The report didn’t elaborate further. Tata Sons board consists of seven directors — independent directors Harish Manwani & Ajay Piramal, non-executive directors Venu Srinivasan, Bhaskar Bhat & Ralf Speth, and executive directors Saurabh Agrawal & Chandrasekaran. The three directors that will seek re-appointment are Manwani (former Unilever COO), Speth (ex-JLR chief, who joined Tata Sons board along with Chandrasekaran) and Agrawal (who was brought in by Chandrasekaran and was appointed on the company’s board on November 16, 2017). The remuneration of Agrawal, who is the CFO of Tata Sons, went up by 35% to Rs 21 crore, according to the FY21 report, making him one of the highest paid Tata executives. The report, however, didn’t mention Chandrasekaran’s FY21 remuneration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-sons-fy21-profit-up-over-2x-on-tcs-buyback/articleshow/85639070.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Patna||Bihar: 3 die, 4 ill after consuming spurious liquor in Vaishali||PATNA: Three people died and four others were taken ill allegedly after consuming suspected spurious liquor in Vaishali district on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday. Liquor is banned in Bihar. The deceased were identified as Shivji Ram (50), Jitendra Ram (30) and Shiv Kumar Ram (35), all residents of Chaksingar Dalit Tola ward numer 6 under Jurawanpur police station area in the flood-affected Raghopur block in Vaishali. While Jitendra and Shiv died at home last night, Shivji breathed his last during treatment at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) in Patna on Wednesday. Ten persons, including the victims, had a feast of mutton and rice. Country liquor was also served. Their relatives said they complained of headache, nausea and loss of eyesight. As the area is inundated with floodwaters, their family members called a local occultist for treatment. Jitendra and Shiv died within a couple of hours. Thereafter, Shivji Ram, Uday Ram, Vijay Ram, Dinesh Ram and one other were rushed to the primary health centre at Raghopur. Later, they were referred to the PMCH and NMCH for better treatment. Shivji died at NMCH. Vaishali SP Maneesh said the postmortem of the three deceased were conducted under the supervision of a three-member medical board. The bodies were later handed over to the families. “The postmortem report is still awaited. It would not be prudent to make any comment till we get the autopsy report,” he said on Wednesday. Hajipur Sadar SDPO Raghav Dayal visited the village on Wednesday and pacified the agitating villagers, who shouted slogans against the police for their failure to check liquor brewing in the area. They demanded stern action against those involved in the illicit trade. The SDPO assured them of launching an intensive drive after the floodwaters receded and the situation turned normal. RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav represents Raghopur assembly constituency. Earlier this month, one Munna Sah had died after consuming suspected spurious liquor at Mukundpur village under Mahua police station in Vaishali district. Suspected hooch deaths were earlier reported from West Champaran, Patna, Vaishali and Nawada districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-die-4-ill-after-consuming-spurious-liquor-in-vaishali/articleshow/85636511.cms||Ramashankar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: IIEST’s lone Afghan student to be awarded MTech degree this week||KOLKATA: When the final semester results of MTech are announced on Friday, Matiullah Hussainzai will be among the candidates who will complete their PG studies at IIEST, Shibpur. From Kabul, Matiullah is the lone Afghan student who took admission for MTech in civil engineering at the institute in July 2019. One of the most popular boys of his class, Matiullah, who went back to Kabul in October 2020 and attended his online classes from there, has left his teachers tense about his well-being considering the current situation. The tall, affable and handsome boy stood out in the crowd, not only because of his looks but also because he was always ready to help his batchmates and teachers even at odd hours. This got him elected as the PG students’ representative to the Society for Civil Engineering at the IIEST. “He was the kind who was always present in class, submitted his assignments on time, did his exams well and still had enough time to participate in social activities. He didn’t understand Bengali but his English was immaculate. We were all extremely happy with him,” said Ambarish Ghosh, head of the civil engineering department. Ever since news of trouble started pouring in from Afghanistan, his teachers have been calling him on his Kabul number to find out how he and his family have been. The rings went unanswered but luckily on Wednesday, he replied to a WhatsApp message saying he was well and hoped that the results would be out on time, leaving his teachers somewhat relieved. Matiullah came under the ICCR exchange programme and adjusted to life on the Shibpur campus like a local. He lived in the hostel and ate the food that other students did. The faculty of his department kept a close watch on his wellbeing and found that he gorged on local fish and Bengali preparations just like other boys and insisted that no special arrangements be made for him. As an MTech student here, he specialised in transportation engineering and submitted his thesis on pavement evaluation. Matiullah worked for his thesis under two civil engineering faculty, Pritam Saha and Sandip Chakraborty. “During the strict lockdown phase, when other students went back home, we kept our international students on campus. Matiullah stayed back and attended classes online from the hostel. But when things eased up a bit, he sought permission to go back to Kabul and join classes from there,” Ghosh added. He would join classes daily from Kabul between 9am and 5pm. Till the third semester, his CGPA remained above 7.5 and the faculty believed that he would maintain his standard this time too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iiests-lone-afghan-student-to-be-awarded-mtech-degree-this-week/articleshow/85637802.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

He said several initiatives had been taken keeping in mind the predicted third wave and its impact on children. Pandey, through a statement to the press, informed that beds in SNCUs will be reserved in eight medical college and hospitals and 35 districts having such units. Apart from SNCUs, paediatric care units (PICUs) are functional in Aurangabad, East Champaran, Gopalganj, Jehanabad, Nalanda, Nawada, Samastipur, Saran, Siwan and Vaishali districts. Apart from these 11 districts, all the medical college and hospitals also have PICU wards. “These PICUs are capable of tackling any emergency-like situation. Also, PICU wards are being created at more places in th state,” he stated. Pandey said for better management of Covid-19 at community level, training was being imparted to Asha, ANMs and health workers associated with Rashtriya Bal Swastha Karyakram and hospital managers by the National Health System Resource System (NHSRC). This ongoing training programmee will be completed on August 27. Apart from these healthcare and frontline workers, paediatricians of all the medical college and hospitals of Bihar had been given special training at New Delhi. Apart from these immediate measures, the health department is also in the process of constructing more paediatric units across the state, with high dependency units and intensive care units. A couple of days back, a committee under the National Institute of Disaster Management had warned of a third wave in October and advised better preparation for children, who may be at similar risk like adults.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/10-sncu-beds-for-covid-19-ve-kids-if-3rd-wave-hits-bihar/articleshow/85633271.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Business||FM to banks: Start credit outreach scheme from Oct||MUMBAI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has asked bankers to begin a credit outreach programme from October. They have also been asked to meet industry associations and exporters, and help to promote one product for export from each district. “To keep up the momentum of stimulus that we are periodically giving, we have also asked banks to go out and give credit,” she said, addressing a press conference after her review meetings with bank chiefs in Mumbai on Wednesday. The finance minister referred to the 2019 ‘loan melas’ undertaken by banks across 400 districts to promote credit in retail, agriculture & MSME (referred to as RAM). “Approximately Rs 4.9 lakh crore was disbursed as part of this outreach between October and March 2019. This year, too, there will be a credit outreach in every district of the country,” said Sitharaman. She pointed out that it was too early to conclude that there is a lack of demand for credit and the festive season would see a natural pickup. “In the context of fintechs, I have highlighted to banks two aspects — the advantages to banks of technology, and also meeting the needs of fintech as a sector,” she said. The public sector banks have also been asked to come up with a plan for credit flow to eastern states with high deposits and low credit offtake. The finance minister was all praise for public sector banks, which she said have done well financially by recording profits and coming out of the Reserve Bank of India’s prompt corrective action framework. They have also managed to raise capital from the market even as they serviced government schemes during the pandemic without going off track in their amalgamation process. Before the pandemic, the government had announced the merger of 10 public sector banks into four, which has since been completed. On the divestment of stake in public sector insurance companies, the finance minister said that the government has decided to have a minimal presence in the insurance sector. This would mean that it will continue to hold a stake in Life Insurance Corporation, the General Insurance Corporation and in the non-life companies. Sitharaman, who earlier held meetings with officials of the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Central Board Of Indirect Taxes & Customs, said that the government has — through the use of technology — been able to identify several methods used to game the system. She said that the new normal for GST collection was Rs 1.1 lakh crore a month. On inflation, the finance minister said that the government has taken several measures to keep prices under check by cutting import duties on pulses and edible oils and, in her estimate, inflation would be within the target range of 6%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fm-to-banks-start-credit-outreach-scheme-from-oct/articleshow/85639112.cms||---

He directed the officials not to lower the guard just because of a low positivity rate. He directed officials to launch vaccination for those above 18 years immediately. The CM said that Covid-19 regulations will continue till 85% of the population is vaccinated. He took stock of the Covid-19 situation with district collectors and SPs during a video-conference on Wednesday. He asked the officials to set their focus on educational institutions as schools and colleges have reopened. He said that tests should be conducted in a focused manner along with household fever surveys. “It is too early to lower the guard. We need to be more careful and track the emerging trends on Covid-19 to take precautions,” said the chief minister. He said statistics on positivity rate and positive cases should not be the lone criterion to handle the situation. The chief minister put district collectors and SPs on high alert about the impending third wave of Covid-19. “We do not know whether there will be a third wave sooner or later. We must be fully geared up to tackle the situation. Get ready with the hospital beds, doctors, nurses and oxygen plants without any delay,” said the chief minister. Although all government hospitals would be shortly equipped with PSA oxygen plants, the health institutions should be ready with oxygen concentrators and cylinders for emergency needs, said the CM. He said that he did not want to take any excuses from any official on the issue of preparedness for the third wave. He asked officials to ensure that all private hospitals with more than 100 beds install PSA plants on a war-footing basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-curbs-will-stay-till-85-people-are-vaccinated-jagan/articleshow/85635491.cms||Samdani MN

According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the second wave had infected more than 6,000 railway employees and 136 of them had succumbed to the virus in April and May this year. The idea behind launching ‘Sparsh’ was to register maximum railway employees on the app to enable them avail timely medical assistance from railway doctors in emergency, he said. According to the CPRO, railway employees and their family members are now seeking medical assistance through this app at railway hospitals located in five divisions of the ECR. Railway emergency control room, which is still functioning in each division, is assigned with the task to coordinate between suffering employees and doctors with the help of ‘Sparsh’, he said, adding that the app has provisions for online registration with any railway hospital in its Danapur, Sonepur, Samastipur, Pt Den Dayal Upadhyaya and Dhanbad divisions. With the help of this app, railways is providing information to employees about availability of Covid-19 vaccines, RT-PCR, HRCT, OPD treatment, routine medical advice and consultation with doctors online, the CPRO said, adding that prior appointment with doctors concerned is also feasible now for the patients. Under the newly developed system, railway employees in need of medicines are in a position to know its availability in the hospital medical stores. Railways’ superspecialty hospital at Karbhigahiya in Patna is listed under the select category of its hospitals to seek medical assistance through ‘Sparsh’, he said. According to medical director (MD) of the railway superspecialty hospital in Patna, Dr R K Verma, employees are availing this facility, particularly for consultation with railway doctors.

---||Vijayawada||Online admission for Inter will bring transparency, govt tells HC||Vijayawada: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Wednesday reserved orders in the petitions filed challenging the online admission system introduced for Intermediate courses. A batch of petitions have been filed by the association of private college managements from across the state contending the new admission system as illegal and violative of their rights and the rights of students. Arguing on behalf of the colleges, senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao said the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) is taking away the rights of students to join the college of their choice. He said the state government did not give any reasons for bringing in the new system. Adinarayana Rao argued that the high court interdicted with the decision of the BIE last year, observing it could not introduce the new system of admissions without notifying the guidelines according to the procedures established. However, the same system is being implemented again in the same manner. There is no rationale behind exercising the power and controlling the admission process through an online system is not like distribution of free ration, said Adinarayana Rao. Arguing on behalf of BIE, senior counsel Dushyant Dave said the new system is being implemented to usher in more transparency to provide equal opportunities to all students. He said because of the pandemic, students cannot go from college to college in search of admission. He said the decision was taken by keeping in view of the observations by the Supreme Court during the hearing on conducting physical examinations amid the pandemic. He argued the petitions are not maintainable as the decision was taken exercising the powers conferred on the government through statute. Dave said though there may be some shortcomings, such as some students not getting their choice of college, they are negligible compared to the greater good the new system will bring. Upon hearing both sides, Justice U Durga Prasad Rao proposed to give judgement on the main writ petitions as elaborate arguments were advanced. He reserved orders as counsels from both sides agreed to his proposal.

---||Patna||120 places identified for new bypass roads in Bihar: CM Nitish Kumar||PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday said the road construction department (RCD) has identified 120 places across the state to construct bypass roads to ensure easy traffic movement. Addressing an RCD’s event after inaugurating four newly-constructed/widened state highways (SHs), Nitish said his government has decided to construct bypass roads in urban areas under the ‘Saat Nischay Part-2’ programme to ensure free movement of traffic. “We have decided to construct flyovers in those urban areas where there would be a problem in availability of land for expansion/widening of the roads,” he said. The four SHs, inaugurated by the CM, were constructed at the cost of Rs1,121 crore. Their total length is 130km. The four state highways are Ghogha-Panwara SH-84, Akbarpur-Amarpur SH-85, Bihia-Jagdishpur-Piro-Danwar Bihta SH-102 and Birpur-Udakishunganj SH-91. The CM further said the inauguration of these four SHs would provide more convenience to people in travelling from one place to another in the state. “Whenever people of other places cross Bihar, they laud the quality of roads in the state. They also hail the overall law and order scenario in the state,” Nitish said. The CM called upon the RCD officials to ensure proper and regular maintenance of state highways and other roads. He asked the officials to ensure maintenance of roads and bridges only through the departmental engineers and not by private agencies and contractors. “Maintenance of roads by the department engineers would not only ensure regular monitoring but also minimize expenditures,” Nitish said while exhorting the RCD engineers to execute the maintenance works with full dedication. “If you execute the road maintenance works in a proper way and visit the construction sites on a regular basis, people living in rural areas will give you more honour than a people’s representative,” Nitish, who himself is an engineer by qualification, told the RCD engineers. Both deputy CMs, Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, RCD minister Nitin Navin and RCD’s additional chief secretary Amrit Lal Meena also addressed the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/120-places-identified-for-new-bypass-roads-in-bihar-nitish/articleshow/85634081.cms||Madan Kumar

Cops said the child, Siddhartha Mondal, a Class-II student of Jagadbandhu Institution and a resident of Kalupara Lane, was at home along with his grandmother when the incident took place. As his mother left for work, his grandmother called him to have his breakfast after he was done with his WhatsApp lessons. The DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan said, “Around 10.45am, he went to the bathroom where several buckets were filled with water. The toothpaste slipped off his hand into an aluminium tub, in which the water was being warmed up with the heater. While trying to lift the toothpaste, he suffered the electric shock and fell on the ground of the bathroom with a thud. He was taken to Sri Aurobindo Seva Kendra at Jodhpur Park, where he was declared brought dead.” The child’s father is handicapped and runs a tea stall in the area. His mother has been separated from him and staying at her paternal house since the birth of Mondal. She was working for extra hours during the pandemic for the education of her child. He was also supported by his maternal uncle and grandfather who are rickshaw pullers. Cops have not found any foul play in the incident and they said no complaint has been lodged in this regard. “However, a post-mortem on the child’s body will ascertain the actual cause behind his death. An unnatural death case has been registered at Kasba police station,” said Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/water-heater-electrocution-kills-8-year-old/articleshow/85637213.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: BJP will approach court on Anil Parab’s role in Union minister Narayan Rane’s arrest||MUMBAI: The BJP will approach the courts against Shiv Sena minister Anil Parab for bringing pressure on the police to arrest Union minister Narayan Rane, said state party chief Chandrakant Patil. Patil said that court verdicts made it clear that political disturbance was created in the state for vengeance. “In the last 20 months, the MVA government has made several attempts to implicate activists or organisations but failed miserably and has been slammed by the courts. The same will happen in this instance as well,” Patil added. BJP MLA Ashish Shelar demanded a CBI probe into Parab’s involvement in Rane’s arrest. “There is a video which shows Parab talking to someone around 1 pm on Tuesday about the sessions court rejecting Rane’s bail…this is suspicious,” said Shelar. Meanwhile in Yavatmal, a BJP leader has submitted an application demanding an FIR against the chief minister for saying his UP counterpart Yogi Adityanath should be beaten with chappals for "insulting" Chhatrapati Shivaji. The complainant, Yavatmal district BJP president Nitin Bhutada, urged police to register a case against Thackeray and take legal action for his "provocative" speech.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-will-approach-court-on-parabs-role-in-ranes-arrest/articleshow/85639656.cms||---
---||Chennai||HC cites 50% cap, nixes 10% EWS quota in medical seats||Chennai: The Madras high court on Tuesday disallowed 10% quota for economically weaker sections (EWS) among forward castes in MBBS admissions under All India Quota (AIQ), saying it would take the total reservation beyond the Supreme Court-mandated cap of 50%. ‘The additional reservation provided for EWS in the notification of July 29 cannot be permitted except with the approval of the Supreme Court,” the court said. It also held that OBC quota for AIQ seats will be 27% as notified by the Union government, and not 50% as demanded by the DMK. “It is inconceivable that all states having government-run medical colleges would give up a percentage of seats to AIQ but would retain the right to enforce reservation in such quota as per the state norms,” it said. The 27% reservation for OBC is in tune with the central legislation which applies to central institutions all over the country and also has empirical backing in how the figure of 27% was arrived at, the court said. The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu, concurring with the submissions of senior counsel P Wilson also closed a contempt proceeding initiated by the DMK against the Union government for failing to implement OBC reservation in AIQ seats from the current academic year. Referring to the Centre’s repeated submissions that reservation cannot exceed 50%, the judges said: “Since it was the Union that set about beating the state with the Indra Sawhney case (50% cap on reservation) stick in its affidavit, by the same yardstick the vertical reservation beyond 50% should also go out…Reservation on the ground of status cannot exceed 50% unless there are exceptional circumstances…Even if a common reasonable yardstick were to be applied, EWS would be found to exist across the board.” As for DMK’s plea to have state-specific OBC quota in AIQ seats, the first bench said: “If a pool of seats is available to candidates from all over the country, irrespective of an individual’s place of residence, the state-wise reservation, which is based on demography of the state, cannot hold good for the entire country as the mix of socially backward classes would differ from region to region even within a state.” The in-principle approval of the Supreme Court for providing reservation for OBC candidates in AIQ seats for admission to the under-graduate, post-graduate and diploma medical and dental courses in the state is apparent from the order dated October 26, 2020. To such extent, the provision made for 27% reservation in such regard appears to be permissible, since the Supreme Court approved the implementation of reservation for OBC candidates beginning academic year 2021-22, said the bench. Therefore, subject to the decision that may be made by the Supreme Court in Saloni Kumari, the 27% reservation for OBC (other than creamy layer) as suggested by the Union would be acceptable, the judges said. Dropping the contempt against the Union government officials, they said: “Since the committee required to be constituted by the order dated July 27, 2020 was constituted and such committee gave its opinion and the Union, or its appropriate agencies, have acted on the basis thereof – albeit not exactly in terms of the recommendations – no case of wilful or deliberate violation of the said order can be said to have been made out.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-cites-50-cap-nixes-10-ews-quota-in-medical-seats/articleshow/85639641.cms||---

Saif finally had in his hand the joining letter for a job that he had to leave in 2017. His mother, Parveen Shahid, had been running from pillar to post for the restoration of her son’s job in the Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) in Varanasi, which he lost after he went on a long medical leave following alleged harassment at the hands of a senior officer. TOI highlighted the issue in its front page report titled ‘Hockey legend Shahid’s son struggles to get back Rlys job’ in the August 9 edition. BLW officials had then told TOI that Saif’s application was being considered sympathetically even as they blamed him for not lodging a complaint of harassment and leaving the job abruptly. Thanking TOI and BLW officials for their support, Saif said, “I am happy to get back my job. Before joining, I am required to undergo a three-year training. As I had joined the training for six months in 2017, that period has been adjusted.” Saif was given a job in BLW on February 3, 2017, on compassionate grounds following the death of Mohd Shahid, who was a sports officer (class 1) with the Railways in Varanasi. During his training, he was allegedly harassed by an official following which he discontinued the training and applied for medical leave. Finally, he was removed from the post on February 19, 2019. Saif later requested for his restoration but his application was pending since then. Mohd Shahid had played a crucial role in the historic Olympic win that fetched India a gold in 1980. Saif himself is a national level shooter and participated in seniors event in Bhopal in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hockey-legends-son-gets-back-rly-job-after-4-years/articleshow/85641663.cms||Fazal Khan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Aaditya Thackeray’s Yuva Sena sheds moderate face in clashes||MUMBAI: With Yuva Sena office bearers and functionaries spearheading protests and violence for the Shiv Sena against Union Minister Narayan Rane’s ‘slap’ comments, the Aaditya Thackeray-led youth wing has finally shed its image of being a moderate face of the organisation. Since its launch in 2010 under Aaditya Thackeray’s leadership, the Yuva Sena has been a counter to the aggressive Bhartiya Vidyarthi Sena (BVS), the original student wing of the party known for its militant street protests. Yuva Sena and BJP supporters clashed near Rane's residence on Juhu Tara Road in Santacruz on Tuesday in the wake of his comments against the CM. Stones were pelted by both sides, resulting in a police lathi-charge. Yuva Sena secretary Varun Sardesai, who is Aaditya’s maternal cousin, and functionary Rahul Kanal were part of the action. And it was Yuva Sena secretary Amey Ghole who put up banners with Rane’s photos dubbing him ‘Kombdi Chor’ (chicken thief), a reference to his origins in the poultry business. The police complaint against Rane at Mahad was also filed by Yuva Sena functionary Siddesh Patekar, a BMC corporator. Two FIRs have been registered by Santacruz police following the violence near the minister’s residence. Police said they will study CCTV footage to ascertain identities of those involved. Another FIR was filed at Borivali (East) where Sena supporters assembled and raised slogans. The FIRs invoke sections of the Indian Penal Code, Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act for unlawful assembly and public nuisance among other offences. Yuva Sena members met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray later in the night, a youth wing leader said. The meeting was at Thackeray's official residence 'Varsha', said Sardesai. Aaditya Thackeray, who is the CM's son, was present. The youth wing under Aaditya first came into prominence following a campaign to get a Rohinton Mistry novel set amidst political turmoil in 1970’s Mumbai (Such A Long Journey) knocked off Mumbai University’s reading list. The varsity’s decision to withdraw the book shocked liberals, but helped launch Aaditya’s political career. Many of Yuva Sena’s functionaries in Mumbai today are second-generation Sainiks from affluent families close to the power matrix. Over the years, Aaditya has projected a cosmopolitan image for Yuva Sena by taking up urban lifestyle issues such as nightlife and rooftop restaurants. With Tuesday’s clashes, Sena insiders said, Yuva Sena has signalled it is shedding this representation to play a combative role against BJP. It has also roped in members of student unions and the Shakhas in a strategy to expand its base. “The Yuva Sena was always seen as an organisation that took up soft issues and morchas but not known to take to the streets in an aggressive fashion. This shows Yuva Sena is now in the role of the BVS of the old days. It seems this tempo will be kept alive in the run-up to the BMC polls,” a Sena insider said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-aadityas-yuva-sena-sheds-moderate-face-in-clashes/articleshow/85639682.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Lady luck smiled on senior BJP corporator Sunanda Palanetra, six months after her unsuccessful bid. Sunanda who was all teary-eyed in February after she lost the mayoral polls, was all smiles after Wednesday’s election. However, the 26th mayor will only have a six-month tenure as her term ends on February 23, 2022. A three-term corporator from Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) ward 59 (Kuvempunagar M Block), Sunanda won the election by securing 26 votes against HM Shantakumari of Congress and Ashwini Ananthu from JD(S). Both her opponents got 22 votes. The election was held following the disqualification of JD(S) corporator Rukmini Madegowda as corporator following a petition filed by her Congress opponent. Following her disqualification as a corporator, Rukmini lost the mayor’s post. Regional commissioner of Mysuru division GC Prakash conducted the elections. MCC commissioner G Lakshmikantha Reddy was present. District minister ST Somashekar, who was in the city, rushed to the MCC after the party’s win. He attributed the success to party leaders and corporators, but did not comment on JD(S). He greeted the newly elected mayor and said it will help in the development of the city. Was close to becoming mayor last time:Sunanda Palanetra, who is a relative of former CM BS Yediyurappa, had suffered defeat during the previous mayoral elections. She was close to becoming the mayor last time, but at the last moment, JD(S) joined hands with Congress to bag the mayor’s post. JD(S) corporator Rukmini Madegowda from ward 36 had became mayor and Congress corporator Anwar Baig was deputy mayor. The disappointed Sunanda even planned to resign as corporator. She has completed Masters in Political Science from the University of Mysore. Her husband Palanetra is a retired engineer and her two daughters are a doctor and engineer each. “I am happy to become the mayor. I will focus on the development of the city jointly with all corporators cutting across partylines,” she said. Political drama for mayor’s post:Both the Congress and JD(S) leaders held discussions till the 11th hour before the election, but it did not yield any results. As JD(S) members refused to vote for their nominee, Congress members shouted slogans against JD(S) members and staged a walkout. Former minister and Congress MLA Tanveer Sait, who was tasked with getting the mayor’s post for the party, said he accepts the responsibility for the defeat of the party even as he stressed that it is this scenario that he tried to stop in February when he agreed for JD(S) mayor while settling for deputy mayor’s post. “I take the responsibility for the setback,” he told reporters adding he had conveyed to JD(S) that the party will give JD(S) the deputy mayor’s post with the incumbent Anwar Baig stepping down from deputy mayor’s post. But JD(S) did not budge,” he stated. Accusing the partner of ditching its secular credentials, Congress members staged a walkout from the meeting without waiting for the voting of JD(S) candidate. Later, the JD(S) corporators too protested outside the MCC building against the Congress accusing it of being power hungry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/bjps-sunanda-palanetra-is-new-mayor-of-mysuru/articleshow/85634462.cms||Lakshmikantha BK

The death comes as an alarm bell over the growing cases of mosquitoborne dengue and chikungunya in the city, which have started turning deadly. The child’s family members told TOI that he developed a high fever on Friday and medical care was started promptly. However, the fever did not relent and the child developed complications. “The family hospitalized the child but complications had set in. Doctors said that he developed shock syndrome and had started bleeding internally,” the child’s grandfather told TOI. “We all did our best to save our child but he succumbed to dengue.” City paediatricians said that there is an outbreak of dengue and chikungunya in the city. The doctors advised people to take advanced antimosquito measures to safeguard themselves against the mosquito-spread diseases. “At least 15-20 children are testing positive for dengue every week at our hospital,” said a Satellite-based paediatrician, Dr Nirav Benani. “We recommend conducting a dengue PCR test if a child has persistent high-grade fever despite being given antifever medicine.” Dr Benani said that maintaining the hydration of a child is of the utmost importance as when the child has persistent high-grade fever and suffers malaise, the intake of fluids goes down. “If dengue is diagnosed in time and hydration is maintained either orally or through IV, there are greater chances of preventing complications,” said Dr Benani. Another paediatrician, Dr Nishchal Bhatt, said that it is important to ensure children wear long sleeved shirts and pants to prevent mosquito bites. “Children get rashes on the face within days of developing persistent high-grade fever,” said Dr Bhatt. “If the child complains of acute abdominal pain or has not passed enough urine in 6-8 hours, the child should be hospitalized for maintaining optimal hydration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/12-year-old-city-boy-killed-by-dengue/articleshow/85639735.cms||---

The slums are being demolished to develop an additional track for freight movement. The demolition was carried out at Mafat Nagar, Angashi Nagar and Milan Nagar out of the total 22 slums that were planned to be demolished between the two railway stations. “Around 10,000 houses are to be demolished in the 22 slums. They simply applied a notice on a wall a few days back and started the demolition on Tuesday morning,” alleged Aadesh Sable, an activist of Human Rights and Land Network. “The Gujarat high court had instructed the railway to coordinate with the state government for rehabilitation for the affected population. But without providing alternate residences, the demolition was started. They destroyed household items of many residents,” added Sable. The plea in Supreme Court, filed by Surat-based 'Utran se Besthan Railway Jhopadpatti Vikas Mandal', has said that “irreparable injury” would be caused to the slum dwellers, who are residing on the Railway land, if they are not provided with alternate arrangement and once they would be evicted and made homeless, their condition would become more miserable especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. About 250 railway staff, 400 police personnel, 10 earthmovers and four excavators were used to raze the houses. “The demolition started at 9 am as planned. The residents were served notices in advance and told to remove their belongings. After the stay order from the Supreme Court the demolition was suspended,” said a railway official. In the recent past, residents of the slums had staged protests at multiple locations in the city. They made representation to union minister of state for railways Darshana Jardosh during her visit to the city last week. The residents are demanding alternative homes similar to the EWS housing schemes offered to residents of other slums in the city. “The residents of these slums have approached various government departments in the recent past but they did not receive any reply,” Sable claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/700-houses-razed-before-sc-stays-demolition-for-day/articleshow/85605966.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida: Film City plan gets govt’s nod||GREATER NOIDA: The state government has given its approval to the Film City project paving way for the global bidding process to start this year. Senior officials of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), including its chief executive officer Arun Vir Singh, had presented the detailed project report (DPR) before government officials in Lucknow on August 12. The approval came on Wednesday. “We have got the go-ahead from the government. Now, our team will start paperwork to prepare the bid documents. We will try to float tenders within the next three months,” Singh said. Of the three models suggested, the government has selected the hybrid model. Under this, YEIDA will part with its land and the concessionaire that will develop and run Film City will pay a fixed annual premium of at least Rs 100 crore and share its revenue with the authority. The annual premium payment will start after 10 years of operations, when the moratorium period mentioned in the agreement between two sides will end. According to officials, a copy of the DPR was presented to the state chief secretary, who is also the head of a committee constituted by the government to execute the project in Sector 21 along Yamuna Expressway. The Fim City project has been planned over 1,000 acre and the government has suggested that it be developed in two phases. “We want to provide all amenities, facilities and infrastructure needed to produce movies, along with an amusement park, in the first phase ,” said a government official. The DPR has been prepared by CBRE, a global commercial real estate services company, and according to its estimates, over Rs 6,500 crore will be required for the first phase.  “We are going to ask CBRE to help us prepare and finalise the bid documents. They have worked on projects of similar scale and size,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/film-city-plan-gets-govts-nod/articleshow/85641685.cms||Shalabh
---||Mumbai||Bombay high court dismisses woman’s plea for probe against Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday dismissed three petitions filed by a 39-year-old Mumbai woman who alleged laxity in police investigation into her allegations of “stalking, harassment, abuse, assault and attack’’ at the behest of Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut and other unknown persons. A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar held, “Prayers like a direction for arrest and custodial interrogation of respondent no.4 (Raut),” search and seizure at his residential and office premises and prohibitory and injunctive reliefs, “simply do not deserve countenance.” The HC said the petitions deserve to be dismissed, but directed the magistrate to decide the closure reports on merit. The petitions argued by the woman’s counsel Abha Singh sought orders to arrest Raut to ascertain “extent of his misdoings and misuse of power and position”, besides orders to Vakola police to investigate her FIR of 2013, a departmental enquiry against a senior police inspector for ‘failure’ to take prompt action. She also sought protection from Raut “to ensure she is not stalked, harassed or molested any further directly or indirectly.” She had claimed that in June 2013, she was in a car when an unknown person smashed the windshield, causing injuries to her eye. She alleged police inaction into her complaint for eight years, which she claimed was a direct outcome of Raut’s political power. Her petitions sought orders in two FIRs of 2013 of alleged extortion calls received by her and assault by a motorist, and a 2018 FIR of stalking by a motorcyclist. On the HC’s order, the Mumbai police commissioner submitted a report on June 30, saying “fair, impartial and unbiased action as per law has already been taken in the grievances raised’’ by her. Public prosecutor Aruna Pai said criticism against the police was unjustified. While the police have filed closure reports in both the cases filed in 2013, an accused was arrested and chargesheet filed in the 2018 FIR. Raut through senior counsel Prasad Dhakephalkar sought dismissal of her petitions on grounds of suppression of truth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/high-court-dismisses-womans-plea-for-probe-against-sena-leader-raut/articleshow/85639708.cms||Swati Deshpande

Meanwhile, the health department claims only 53 dengue cases have been confirmed in the district from July 1 till Wednesday. Taking a serious note of the situation, the district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma has asked the chief medical officer to treat the cases in ‘suspected’ and ‘probable’ categories also as dengue positive. Admitting that dengue menace is on spread, the DM said, “Major problem is being reported from the villages recently included in the VMC limits as they don’t have proper drainage system. The areas inundated during floods have also emerged as hotspots. So far 34 such dengue hotspots have been identified.” The district malaria officer (DMO) Dr SC Pandey claimed, “As per the government’s prescribed guidelines NS-1 Antigen kit test report can’t be considered as sufficient to confirm dengue cases. Test of samples in sentinel surveillance laboratory is a must for confirmation. In view of the same, only the samples which have been tested positive in Elisa test at the Microbiology department laboratory of Banaras Hindu University are considered as positive for dengue. So far, the lab has confirmed 53 dengue cases since July 1.” The DM said that in a meeting convened on Tuesday, the health officials, private hospitals, practitioners and pathology centres have been asked to submit a daily report on dengue cases. The CMO was asked to ensure that even the cases in probable or suspected category, should be treated as dengue, said the DM. Mega cleanliness drive including source reduction exercises like clearing water from solid waste, scraps and coolers, fogging, spray of anti-larval and bio-chemicals has also been ordered, said the DM adding, the additional CMOs and VMC authorities will closely monitor these exercises from Thursday. The CMO has also been asked to ensure that capacity at BHU and SPG divisional hospitals have been increased for admitting dengue cases, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/34-dengue-hotspots-identified-in-dist/articleshow/85639285.cms||---

Deputy commissioner G Jagadeesha said that the administration has discussed the issue with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and minister of health and family welfare and medical education K Sudhakar, that the hospital must be handed over to the government. The district administration had paid the employees salaries during the last two months, and they cannot be terminated. “I have already spoken to the district surgeon to speak to the staff and solve the issues. A government decision is awaited. However, the care of patients has not been affected,” he said. A senior doctor said that 58 patients are being taken care of at the hospital. The administration has provided a team of doctors. Earlier, the staff had protested after BR Life, NRI businessman B R Shetty’s firm, had not paid salaries of those employed at the hospital, due to the financial crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/hospital-staff-protest-after-16-receive-termination-letters/articleshow/85634511.cms||---

Instead of using an official vehicle, the policemen had allowed Tripathi to use a private car to reach Mati Court in Kanpur Dehat district in connection with a hearing a few days ago. After the matter was highlighted by the media, police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun had deputed ADCP Basant Lal to conduct a probe and submit a report in this regard. In the investigation, both the constables were found to be guilty and they have been awarded with corporal punishment. In the corporal punishment, both the policeman have been asked to walk around the Parade ground for two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening carrying guns on their shoulders. Not only this, the entry of punishment will be done in their character register. Tripathi, a resident of Prayagraj, owns a house in a colony in Chakeri. He had rented it to a couple hailing from Maharajpur area of the district. On August 8 night, it is alleged that Tripathi had raped the couple’s 13-year-old daughter. Subsequently, the girl’s parents lodged an FIR and Tripathi was arrested by the Chakeri police and sent to jail. On August 19, Tripathi was to be taken to appear in a case in Kanpur Dehat’s Mati Court. “He was allowed to use a private vehicle from Kanpur jail to Mati court, whereas according to rules, he should have been taken by a government vehicle,” said a police source. After the media highlighted the issue, the police commissioner asked the ADCP to conduct a probe and submit a report. It came to fore that the head constable Prem Pal and constable Dharmendra had taken the accused retired inspector from jail to present him in the court. Under the influence of the retired inspector, both allowed him to use a private car to reach Mati court. The car was arranged by Tripathi. The police commissioner said that both the policemen were found guilty of ignoring the rules. “They have been given a seven-day corporal punishment, in which they will have to make rounds of the Parade ground for two hours in the morning and evening, carrying official guns on their shoulders. Also, adverse entry will be made in their character register,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cops-get-corporal-punishment-forhelping-rape-accused-ex-inspector/articleshow/85639772.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Varanasi||Neurological diseases abound in Ganga riverside: IMS-BHU study||Varanasi: A study conducted by the department of neurology, Institute of Medical Sciences of Banaras Hindu University (IMS-BHU) has claimed that neurological diseases were common in the Ganga riverside owing to high levels of pollution. Stroke, both ischaemic and haemorrhagic, is the most common of the neurological diseases. The study, ‘Spectrum of neurological diseases across Gangetic belt: A hospital-based prospective observational study’, conducted by Prof. Vijaya Nath Mishra and his team members, including Sooraj Patil, Vineeta Singh, Deepika Joshi, Rameshwar Nath Chaurasia and Abhishek Pathak, was published online in the reputed ‘International Journal of Neuroscience’ on August 24. “Our study objective was to determine the prevalence of neurological diseases in the Ganga riverside and further divided into sections just across the riverside within 25 kms and non-riverside as 25 kms away from the Ganga,” said Mishra. He said that the Gangetic belt is one of the heavily populated areas in the world with people depending on the river for daily needs. River Ganga has been polluted over the last several decades with increasing population, urbanization and defective sewage treatment and improper government policies. The present study was aimed at finding the pattern and clinical features of neurological disease around the Ganga. “In the study, we found neurological diseases were more common in the Gangetic belt with most common being stroke, seizure and encephalopathies,” he said. According to him, this is the first study, showing the spectrum of neurological diseases across the Ganga river basin. The demographic profile of diseases is different in the Gangetic riverside belt owing to the river pollution giving rise to an increased proportion of communicable and neurodegenerative diseases (ND). Demographic characteristics of the present study indicates higher prevalence of neurological diseases in 50–70 years of age, previous studies from India showed neurological diseases were more common in the age group of 40–60 years. A study from the WHO also showed that 20% of the population is over 60 years of age. “The three most common neurological diseases in our study are stroke, seizures and septic encephalopathy in descending order,” he said and added that a total of 2,326 patients of various neurological diseases were admitted, out of which 310 were excluded because of the diagnosis of non-neurological conditions by neurologists after admission. Total 2,016 patients were included in the present study. These patients were divided within 25km of the Ganga riverside and 25km away from the Ganga non-riverside. Among them 1,154 patients were residing around 25 km on either side of the Ganga and 862 patients outside of 25 km from the river. According to him, earlier studies showed that the Ganga water contains many heavy metal toxins and chemical toxins which were far above the permissible limits and are harmful to human life. Many of these heavy metals and chemical toxins were neurotoxic and can result in various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). A heavy metal present in the water of the river subsequently enters the food chain through entering into the soil, well water and air. They are the prime cause of mental and cognitive health deterioration in humans. Many of these heavy metals were required in small amounts for cell function and living but when exposed to higher levels over the long period they cause deleterious effects like neurotoxicity. He said that the neurological disease spectrum varies as per developing and developed countries. In developing countries neurological diseases change as per exposure to infectious agents, toxic compounds. As the Ganga basin is heavily populated and shows a significantly high number of metals in its water, neurological diseases in the Gangetic belt need to be studied to know the nature of diseases and their course. “In the present study, we attempted to identify the spectrum of neurological diseases in the Ganga riverside moreover, into the section just across the riverside and 25km away from riverside. No such previous study has been done around the Ganga basin to find out the spectrum of neurological disorders or NDs in the Gangetic belt,” said Mishra. He added, “Our present study gives us insight into the pattern of neurological diseases around the Ganga, its relation to the source of drinking water and the relation of neurological disease to exposure to heavy metals. It will help us in future preventive steps to formulate plans to reduce heavy metal pollution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/neurological-diseases-abound-in-ganga-riverside-ims-bhu-study/articleshow/85639261.cms||---
---||Delhi||Heart risk linked to Covid-19: Study||NEW DELHI: People who have recovered from Covid-19 may require a closer and long-term follow-up for heart-related complications, doctors at GB Pant Hospital have suggested. The Delhi hospital recently conducted a study wherein 134 patients who had fully recovered from Covid-19 underwent imaging test — speckle tracking echocardiography — to assess heart function. It was found that nearly one in every three patients had a subclinical left ventricle dysfunction while 11% had right ventricle dysfunction. The heart has four chambers, out of which the left and right ventricles — the lower chambers — are responsible for pumping oxygenated blood into tissues all over the body and sending oxygen-depleted blood to the lungs, respectively. Dr Mohit Gupta, professor of cardiology at the hospital, told TOI that dysfunction in the left ventricle was seen even in patients who had recovered after asymptomatic (8%) or mild (13%) Covid-19. “The long-term effects of Covid-19 on the cardiovascular system is still not known. However, it is clear that there is a subclinical effect of Covid-19 on heart muscle. It would be pertinent to follow up these patients over three to six months to see how this damage evolves,” Dr Gupta, principal investigator of the study, said. He added that the long-term follow-up might translate into timely prediction of the impact of Covid-19 on the cardiac function and the need for possible therapeutic interventions to prevent cardiovascular complications. Explaining the reason behind conducting the study, Dr Gupta said the hospital’s cardiac OPD witnessed a significant surge in the number of patients who had recovered from Covid-19 and had symptoms such as breathlessness, palpitations and fatigue after the first wave. “All routine cardiac tests were normal, including the baseline echocardiography. We thought it would be good to evaluate the subclinical damage of heart muscle using speckle tracking echocardiography, an improvised echocardiographic imaging technique that analyses the motion of tissues in the heart by using the naturally occurring speckle pattern in the myocardium (muscular tissue of the heart) or blood when imaged by ultrasound,” he said. “To our surprise, they had significant subclinical effects. We then conceptualised this study.” The cardiology department collaborated with the electronics and communication engineering department at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, which helped in interpreting the imaging test reports using artificial intelligence. According to the results, accepted for publication in Echocardiography, a top-rated medical journal, impaired left ventricle function was seen in one (8%) of the patients with history of asymptomatic Covid, eight (13%) patients with history of mild Covid, 22 (44%) patients with history of moderate Covid and nine (90%) patients with history of severe Covid. The doctors say the heart could be damaged during Covid-19 due to multiple factors, such as systemic inflammatory response due to cytokine storm, hypoxia induced by oxygen supply-demand mismatch, and direct injury to heart muscles. Dr Girish MP, a co-author of the study, said while patients recovered from mild Covid-19 with no residual symptoms didn’t need to worry, those having recovered from moderate/severe Covid and having symptoms such as breathlessness and palpitations should be investigated for heart muscle damage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/heart-risk-linked-to-covid-19-study/articleshow/85637304.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

But after their death, the facility had been trying hard to bring back the same attraction.Efforts were made to breed chimps, but to no avail. But still, the authorities are hoping to breed the primate in captivity.It has been nearly eight years since both Wali and Polo passed away — they died in a span of one year during 2013-14. The duo, being star attractions, had exhibited human-like mannerisms. The primates’ open enclosure had been the most sought-after spot for tourists who used to spend more time enjoying the primates in action.Mysuru Zoo is the only facility in Karnataka to have displayed the primates.Ajit Kulkarni, executive director of Mysuru Zoo, said the last time the zoo bred a chimp was in early 1980. Currently, the zoo has six chimpanzees — three each of males and female. Efforts are on to breed apes.Zoo Authority of Karnataka chairman L R Mahadevaswamy said the facility has displayed many exotic animals and birds and also spared them under under animal-exchange programmes. As soon as new animals are added, visitors are informed about the new attractions, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mysuru-zoo-hopes-to-breed-chimp-in-captivity/articleshow/85634528.cms||Lawrence Milton

The BJP has fielded candidates in all 58 wards and Congress in 49. The regional party JD(S) has put 12 candidates and AAP in 24 wards. About 250 backed by the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti have filed nominations. One person from Prajakiya is also trying his luck. A total of 434 aspirants have filed nominations. Shiv Sena, which initially planned to contest elections, is now supporting MES. This is the first time in the history of city corporation elections that it is fought on party symbols.BJP is seeking to win the favour of Marathas and the party has given ticket to the same community members on the basis of winnablity. Congress too more or less resorted to the same tactics. Eranna Kadadi, Rajya Sabha MP and BJP leader told TOI that his party is confident of crossing the majority mark. “As parties are contesting polls this time, people will not vote on linguistic lines like in the earlier polls. People will now cast votes for development and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’ popularity will help galvanise votes,” he said.Congress is banking on the failures of the state government in handling the pandemic as Belagavi city is also badly affected by the Covid. Sarala Satupte, who is contesting from ward 21 on a Congress ticket, said people are upset with the present dispensation and need a change. “We will cash in on this to seek votes from,” she said. For local Congress leaders this election is crucial as their prospects are dependent on the results.MES leader Shubam Shelke expressed confidence of winning a majority, citing recent Kannada-Marathi issues.Although AAP has filed nominations, the party is yet to gain ground in this region. However, some people appear to be showing interest with the party due its promise of corruption-free administration. The JD(S) is also looking to win some seats to play a game changer role.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bcc-polls-cong-mes-bjp-in-for-a-triangular-fight/articleshow/85631712.cms||Shreyas HS
---||Kanpur||Dozens beaten up by goons, take shelterin agricultural fields; 6 accused arrested||Kanpur: Over four dozen members of some two dozen families were forced to leave their homes and take shelter in agricultural fields following alleged molestation and thrashing by local goons in Kanpur Dehat district on Wednesday. After coming to know about the incident, police swung into action and arrested six persons after lodging an FIR against them under relevant sections of IPC in this regard. The incident was reported from a village in Mangalpur area, wherein there was a dispute between the two groups over the installation of a government hand-pump. “One of the groups accused the other of molesting and attacking women members of their families and evicting them from the place. On the other hand, people from the other side claimed that they were severely beaten up for getting a hand pump installed in front of their houses and denied the allegations made by the other group,” said the police. On coming to know about the matter, the police rushed to the spot and tried to pacify the situation by talking to both the groups. “One of the groups has filed a case against 11 for molestation, assault, sabotage and other sections of IPC,” said the police. A youth of a village of Mangalpur police station said that on Monday night, he was sitting outside the house while women members of several families were busy attending household chores. “In the meantime, Naresh, Harpal, Virendra, Gajendra, Rajendra, Amit, Mohit, Ajay Pal, Deepak, Jeevan and Dharampal of the village barged into their houses and molested the women inmates. When they resisted, they were severely beaten up by the attackers who also damaged the household items,” he said while talking to reporters on Wednesday. He added, not only this, they also pulled down thatched roof of their houses. “Later, all of them were threatened of dire consequences and asked to evict the place following which they were forced to live outside the village by putting tarpaulins and tents in the field,” he added. At the same time, the people on the other side said that all the people belong to the same community. As the government had installed a hand-pump in front of their houses, there was a dispute as the other side opposed and wanted that the installation be done in front of their houses. ASP Ghanshyam Chaurasia said, “There was a dispute between two groups over installation of a government hand-pump, on which one side left their houses and went to live in the fields. Now, they all have returned back to their respective homes. Six persons have been arrested in this regard.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/dozens-beaten-up-by-goons-take-shelterin-agricultural-fields-6-accused-arrested/articleshow/85639859.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Dengue spread highest in warm weather, say experts||AHMEDABAD: The fear of an imminent Covid third wave and surging dengue cases have many Amdavadis worried. The dengue vector Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes are now visible almost on an average of 1.5 out of three rooms in city homes, according to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Areas like Gota, Thaltej, Vejalpur, Sabarmati, Paldi and Jodhpur have already been put under dengue radar over the past two weeks. About two and a half years earlier, scientists from University of Liverpool, Hyderabad based Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), and National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) in Guwahati, had propounded why Gujarat cities, along with five other states, may see periodic dengue outbreaks. They had identified changes in a factor called ‘extrinsic incubation period (EIP)’ of the dengue virus by using daily and monthly mean temperatures. For Gujarat cities, the EIP was around 5 days at ambient temperature of 36.8°C. “It meant that at this temperature one would witness the maximum transmission of dengue virus,” says a senior AMC official. EIP was explained as the number of days taken for incubation of the dengue virus within the mosquito. After the mosquito draws a virus-rich-blood meal, the virus escapes the gut, and reaches its salivary glands. Once this happens, the mosquito is capable of transmitting the virus to a human host. Lower temperatures — 17°C to 18°C — result in a longer EIP, and lower virus transmission. With increasing temperatures, Aedes aegypti increases feeding, leading to shorter EIP days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dengue-spread-highest-in-warm-weather/articleshow/85639877.cms||---

VHP leaders protested and claimed that over 90 cows and calves had died within a week at Kanha Gaushala in Shankargarh in the trans-Yamuna area. The VHP said it had also written a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath seeking stringent action against errant PMC and other officials. VHP regional secretary Lal Mani Tiwari told TOI, "Despite spending crores of rupees, the condition of Shankargarh based gaushala was in shambles and over 90 cows and calves had died in a week at the gaushala”. He further alleged that many cows and calves were dying due to starvation as they were not offered fodder and water due to the negligent approach of authorities concerned. Three days back, when VHP conducted a surprise inspection, as many as 12 dead cows\calves were found dumped into a pit filled with water. Tiwari further added that officials of the PMC are least bothered to take care of the cows and calves kept at the gaushala and demanded the chief minister to take stern action against the errant PMC officials. “It was pathetic that the postmortem of dead cows and calves was never conducted and that their carcasses were being dumped,” said Tiwari. “The PMC officials prepare fake post mortem reports with the claim that cows and calves had died due to consumption of polythene," he alleged. He also claimed that the majority of gaushalas being run by gram sabhas are also in shambles. Tiwari, meanwhile, said PMC authorities always come forward with fake and forged documents whenever a cow dies premature death and that whenever the issue is raised they blame it on the cows having consumed polythene bags.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/vhp-blames-pmc-officials-for-death-of-cows-at-kanha-gaushala/articleshow/85639890.cms||---

Addressing the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav, advocate general Kamal Trivedi submitted that Section 5 of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act has been stayed by the high court, but the section has nothing to do with marriage per se. The law officer clarified that the section talks about the permission for conversion only and this arrangement in the law exists since 2003. The bench agreed to hear on the state government’s note for rectification on Thursday and asked the advocate general to inform the counsels from the side of the petitioners to remain present during the hearing. Last week, the HC had stayed Sections 3, 4, 4A to 4C, 5, 6 and 6A of the amended Act and made it clear that these sections shall not operate if interfaith marriage is solemnised without force, allurement or fraudulent means and such marriages cannot be termed as marriages for the purpose of unlawful conversion. The advocate general asserted before the court that the state has never been for prohibition of interfaith marriage and there was no discussion on it in Section 5 of the Act at all. But it finds a mention in the operative part of the order. The section primarily deals with the prior permission to be obtained from the district collector for the purpose of conversion, he submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-moves-hc-to-rectify-stay-order/articleshow/85639875.cms||---

The accused used to commit the crime during the afternoon when most of the housewives are alone at home. Police arrested Vihabhai Parmar, a resident of Vivekanand Nagar of Rajkot city, from Kalavad road on Wednesday morning and seized gold and silver jewellery from him. On August 18, Hetal Lathia, a housewife residing at Bapa Sitaram Chowk in Ramnagar area in Rajkot, lodged a complaint against an unidentified person who robbed her of jewellery worth Rs 6.67 lakh. “A person clad in saffron attire came to my house on the afternoon of August 18 and asked for a glass of water. After drinking it he asked for more water. When I brought another glass of water, he asked me to drink it claiming it to be a ‘prasad’ of a deity that will cure all the diseases I’m suffering from. He also asked for my jewellery to conduct a ‘puja’. I passed out after drinking the water. When I regained consciousness, the man had vanished along with the jewellery I had given him,” Lathia said in her police complaint. Parmar was booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 328 (causing hurt by means of poison). “We appeal to the people who have become victims of such crimes to report it to us,” a police official said. “Though the accused denied it, we suspect that he might have committed more such crimes in the city,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/conman-drugs-dupes-rajkot-woman-of-rs-6-8-lakh-jewellery/articleshow/85634471.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi schools give go-ahead to phased reopening, consent of parents remains tricky question||NEW DELHI: Concurring with the recommendations of the panel constituted by the Delhi government, heads of schools are of the view that schools can be reopened in phases starting with students of higher classes as the response to practical and project classes has been good. From August 9, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had allowed reopening of schools for students of classes X and XII for practical or project work. Schools mostly called in the students of Class XII for completing their practicals. In some schools, even Class X students came for a short duration. Ashok Pandey, director, Ahlcon Schools, said, “Practicals for classes X and XII are ongoing and students are coming in small numbers. The response so far has been good. Now, if the government says that schools can reopen, then we will have to figure out the conditions, like taking parental consent. Earlier, parental consent was 30-40%. Things have changed and children also want to come to school. We are keen on opening schools, but will have to wait for clarity.” AK Jha, principal of Government Co-educational Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8 Rohini, felt that school should start from September 1 for classes X and XII. “If that happens, then we can call students of Class X between 8am and 11am. Students of Class XII can come from 12pm to 2pm. We had done the same thing when the school had opened earlier,” he added. At The Indian School, the number of students coming for practicals was quite good. “It is important to note that for now, students are just coming for the practicals. If we reopen, will it be full-time or hybrid? Hybrid sounds more possible for now. While I was in a webinar, someone from Andhra Pradesh said schools were fully functional there. She shared that they had told parents that when they came to pick children, they would have to do so from different gates to avoid crowding. We will have to wait for instructions from the Directorate of Education to plan the reopening,” said school principal Tania Joshi. However, parents were divided over the issue. All India Parents’ Association has been demanding reopening of schools. But many parents think the government should wait till the children get the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/schools-give-go-ahead-to-phased-reopening-consent-of-parents-remains-tricky-question/articleshow/85637350.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Police to be told not to act arbitrarily in trade, business matters: ACS to HC||Prayagraj: Additional chief secretary (ACS) home Avanish Kumar Awasthi on Wednesday assured the Allahabad high court that proper guidelines will be issued by the state government, directing police authorities not to act arbitrarily in matters related to trade and business after it was pointed out by the court that it is regularly coming across cases in which police have been arbitrarily registering FIRs under section 420 (cheating) of IPC against traders and businessman in commercial matters. Earlier, on Tuesday, the high court had directed the ACS, home and Jalaun’s superintendent of police Ravi Kumar and sub-inspector Kedar Singh of police station Nadi Gaon to remain personally present before the high court to show cause why appropriate orders may not be passed and why exemplary cost may not be imposed on them for filing misleading affidavit in a case. In addition to it, the court had also directed the additional chief secretary, home to produce the policy of ‘ease of doing business’ in the state. A division bench comprising Justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Justice Piyush Agrawal was hearing a petition filed by one Vishal Gupta, who had sought quashing of an FIR lodged against him on February 20, 2021, alleging cheating and disobeying of an order passed by a public servant. In the petition, it was stated that the petitioner was engaged in the supply of goods. As per allegations, the petitioner was carrying eight bundles of betel nuts and tobacco in his vehicle and on being asked by the police sub-inspector, he could not show valid papers relating to transportation of the said items. And for that reason, the impugned FIR was registered under sections 420 and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC. On Wednesday, the ACS home and SP Jalaun appeared before the high court and filed a personal affidavit, stating that action has been taken against erring police officers in the case and final report has been filed after investigation in the said case. The court said that such arbitrary act of police of registering FIRs in cases involving transportation of goods in ordinary course of business is denting the policy of “ease of doing business” of the state. On Wednesday, by filing a fresh affidavit, the ACS home apprised the court that a final report has been filed in the said case lodged against the petitioner. On which, the court dismissed the petition as ‘infructuous’ since the final report was filed and no grievance of the petitioner was left. Earlier, on August 13, the court had observed that the FIR lodged against the petitioner ‘reflects ill intention of the informant (sub-inspector) and obstruction in free flow of trade and commerce’, and directed the respondent authorities to file a counter-affidavit in the case. On August 18, a counter-affidavit was filed by superintendent of police (SP) Jalaun in which neither pleas made by petitioners were replied nor queries of the high court were answered. The high court, on this, directed the additional chief secretary home to file a personal affidavit in the case by August 24 which was filed on August 23, 2021. Subsequently, on August 24, 2021, the court, after perusing the personal affidavit filed by additional chief secretary (ACS), home and superintendent of police, Jalaun had asked the officers to remain present in court for filing misleading affidavits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/police-to-be-told-not-to-act-arbitrarily-in-trade-business-matters-acs-to-hc/articleshow/85639908.cms||---

---||Hubballi||BJP, Cong race to defuse rebellion ahead of HDMC polls||Dharwad: Senior functionaries of the Hubballi-Dharwad unit of both the BJP and Congress are busy dousing the flames of rebellion that have been fanned by the denial of ticket to aspirants for the forthcoming polls to the twin cities’ municipal corporation. Aspirants who were denied the ticket by their respective parties have decided to contest the election as Independents, and in a curious turn of events, they are being approached by senior leaders of their parties to withdraw from the contest. Nearly a dozen rebels each from the BJP and the Congress have thrown their hat in the ring, upsetting the calculations of their party bosses, who fear a division in the vote. Candidates can withdraw their nomination papers no later than Thursday evening, and leaders of both parties need to act post-haste to placate the disgruntled leaders. In Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) ward 11, which is reserved for a candidate from the general category, the BJP has fielded a functionary belonging to the Other Backward Classes (OBC). While Jayaprakash Galagali, son of veteran Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker NG Galagali, was hopeful of the party’s ticket, the BJP fielded Manjunath Battenavar. Miffed, Jayaprakash has decided to contest the election as an Independent. Similarly, the party leadership’s last-minute decision to field Sanjay Kapatkar from ward 23 has not gone down well with party workers in ward 15, who had hoped that he would be the candidate from the ward. There have been rumours of the cadre working against the BJP’s candidate Vishnu Korlahalli in ward 15. In Hubballi, two-time corporator and former deputy mayor Laxmi Uppar is contesting as a rebel in ward 47, while Vijaykumar Appaji and former mayor Manjula Akkur are in the fray as Independents respectively in wards 28 and 26. Kalpana Naik, BJP spokesman Ravi Naik’s wife has thrown her hat in the ring in ward 57 as a rebel, as have Yashoda Gandaglekar (ward 54) and Mahantesh Girimath (ward 68). Congress leaders too are faced with dissension in the party’s ranks. In Dharwad, Shaheen Haveripet, former corporator Yaseen Haveripet’s wife, is contesting as a rebel from ward 6, as is former corporator Balaram Kusugal’s wife in ward 10.Former mayor Venkatesh Mestri’s wife Chandrika, was announced as the Congress candidate for ward 56 but denied ‘B’ form. Consequently, Chandrika decided to contest the election as a rebel. Among other prominent local leaders of the Congress who have raised the banner of revolt and are contesting the election as rebels are Ganesh Tagargunti (ward 71), Mohan Asundi’s wife Akshata (ward 82), former corporator Babajan Mudhol’s wife Tahira (ward 79) and his cousin Mohemmed Ali (ward 53). Sudha Manikuntla, Rabbani Pattewale, Sameer Khan, Sushila Gudihal, Veeresh Undi and Chetan Hirekerur are the other Congress members in the fray contesting as rebels.Former corporator Prakash Ghatage, who was denied the Congress ticket for ward 8 at the eleveth hour, has decided to contest as an Indpendent, while another former Congress corporator Subhas Sindhe, seething after he was refused the ticket to contest from ward 14, joined the BJP. Anand Jadhav, despite being given the Congress ticket to contest the HDMC Council polls from ward 13, was unable to file his nomination, prompting the party to field Hemant Gurlahosur, who had been planning to enter the fray as a rebel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bjp-cong-race-to-defuse-rebellion-ahead-of-hdmc-polls/articleshow/85631781.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Issue warrant against former Mumbai CP Param Bir Singh, Anil Deshmukh's lawyer Anita Castellino tells panel||MUMBAI: Former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s lawyer Anita Castellino on Wednesday urged Justice K U Chandiwal that the presence of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh should be secured under warrant as the commission’s six-month timeframe was coming to an end. Singh has failed to appear before the commission set up to probe his March 20 letter bomb against Deshmukh alleging he had set a target to mobilise Rs 100 crore from restaurant and bar owners. In a related development, businessman Bimal Agarwal, who had lodged a criminal complaint against Singh and suspended API Sachin Waze, submitted an affidavit before the commission on the modus operandi of Singh and Waze to collect the money. Justice Chandiwal on Wednesday also imposed a fresh cost of Rs25,000 on Singh for his failure to deposit the earlier fines. When Singh failed to turn up before the commission on the first occasion, he was imposed a cost of Rs5,000. When he did not attend proceedings for the second time, a cost of Rs25,000 was imposed. On Wednesday, when Singh failed to remain present, Deshmukh’s lawyer brought it to the notice of the commission that the former CP had not deposited the cost on August 18, following which a fresh cost was imposed. If he fails to pay the costs, Singh will have to give evidence from August 30. “There is no justifiable ground for not paying/depositing the earlier costs directed on August 18, as on today, there is no stay from any court to the order of the commission, though under banner of urgency, Param Bir has knocked (on the doors) of the HC,” Justice Chandiwal observed in his brief order. After the commission was set up on March 30, Singh had raised objection to the maintainability and purpose of the probe panel on the ground that the scope entrusted to it had already been adjudicated by the HC and the Supreme Court. Subsequently, Singh did not attend the proceedings, saying he may not be able to do so till his petition challenging the legal validity of the commission was disposed of. On Wednesday, Singh’s lawyer informed the commission that the petition may be heard on August 30 and the proceedings may be adjourned till then. On Agarwal’s affidavit, Deshmukh’s former private secretary Sanjeev Palande, through his lawyer, urged the commission, to issue summons to him as a witness. Agarwal urged the commission to dismiss Singh’s letter on the ground that it was vindictive against Deshmukh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-issue-warrant-against-param-bir-deshmukh-lawyer-tells-panel/articleshow/85639849.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

They arrested 50-year-old Vijay Parmar and seized 218kg of conch shells and 122 pieces of sea fans (a type of coral) that are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act. According to forest officials, Parmar used to sell these marine creatures in Mumbai and Nashik cities of Maharashtra. Parmar’s name cropped up during a raid on traders in Maharashtra. The authorities from the neighbouring state alerted the forest department in Gujarat about the illegal trade network and also tipped them on the supplier Parmar from Mithapur. Based on the tip-off the forest officials raided Parmar’s house on Monday evening and found 218kg conch shells and 122 pieces of sea fans. Assistant conservator of forest Nilesh Joshi said, “Parmar used to sell these creatures to the traders of Mumbai and Nashik for prices ranging between Rs 5 to Rs 400 for one conch shell, based on the size. While sea fan was sold at Rs 700 per kg.” These creatures are found on rocky shores of the Arabian sea in various parts of Devbhumi Dwarka. They get trapped in fishermen’s nets at Rupen and Dalda ports and it’s suspected that Parmar used to buy it from them. He used to supply the sea fans and conches by train or take it himself to Mumbai. Parmar was produced in a local court on Wednesday which sent him to judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/coral-conch-smuggling-racket-busted/articleshow/85634784.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Govt to reconsider grant-in-aid college affiliation to pvt univs||Ahmedabad: Facing stiff protests from professors, college principals and administrative officials for over two months now, the state government has decided to reconsider its decision allowing grant-in-aid colleges to be affiliated to private universities. For this, the state government will initiate amendments in the Gujarat Private Universities (Amendment) Act 2021, said a senior government official. The amendments will be introduced in the state assembly soon, the official further said. The decision was taken after discussions between the state government and the Gujarat State Professors’ Association and a few other groups. “The meeting was successful and the resolution of this issue will be taken up by the government,” said state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama. Members of the Gujarat State Professors’ Association have been protesting at colleges against the new rules implemented by the state government after the passing of the Gujarat Private Universities (Amendment) Act 2021 earlier this year. They have been demanding that the government to go back to the earlier rules, where the grant-in-aid colleges were not allowed to be affiliated with private universities. The new law changed the Gujarat Private Universities Act 2009 where grant-in-aid colleges, which were not allowed to be affiliated with private universities, could do so. The condition was that the universities and grant-in-aid college in question be run by the same management or trustees. So far, about 35 grant-in-aid colleges across the state have been given clearance to be affiliated with private universities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-to-reconsider-grant-in-aid-college-affiliation-to-pvt-univs/articleshow/85639855.cms||---

The skill development department and prison authorities are initially focusing on the women’s section of Nagpur Central Jail, having around 75 inmates, but also plan to expand their vision to include the male sections. The activity will empower inmates with training to earn a livelihood after stepping out. The objective of the project is to ensure the inmates can return to the mainstream of society. Assistant commissioner of skill development, employment and entrepreneurship department, PG Harde, said the inmates would get access to vocational training courses under Pradhan Mantri Kaushalya Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). “We will also give certificates to the inmates who are already into some vocational crafts like carpentry, handloom and others units of work already existing in the prison, under ‘Recognition of prior learning,” said Harde. He added that the certificates issued would be recognized across India. Harde said the prison already has infrastructure for training, which can be expanded to explore more options in the list of around 3,000 courses with the skill development department. “The central prison already has a computer lab. It can be used to train inmates in a plethora of cases like data entry, tally and so on, which are in demand today,” he said. Harde also said that women too can have a number of skill development courses taught to them in the jail. “We will counsel inmates, tell them the importance of learning some income-generating skills and then enrol them in the courses of their choice, which also suit their aptitude and interest,” he said. Jail SP Anup Kumre said inmates have already been receiving training in vocational courses and crafts by an expert, but the involvement of skill development department would make the rehabilitation plan more concrete. “Maharashtra Arthik Vikas Mahamandal will also be roped in to assist and guide women inmates to procure loans to set up their own businesses after being groomed in some particular skills,” said Kumre. He added that the jail has earned more than Rs1.50 lakh from selling Rakhis and it’s paraphernalia. “We are now trying to set up outlets and stalls to showcase and sell items made by the jail inmates,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/central-jail-to-be-developed-as-skill-centre-for-inmates/articleshow/85637607.cms||Soumitra Bose

The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has listed the next hearing of the case after the date. The petition, filed by Dehradun-resident Harjinder Singh, alleges that despite a ban on any construction in the notified forest areas by the Centre and the Supreme Court, rampant construction is ongoing in Mussoorie, turning the hill town into a concrete jungle. The petition alleges that authorities have turned a blind eye to the construction work ongoing for years. This, according to the plea, has put the town’s existence under threat. The petitioner adds that he has approached the Centre and state authorities over the issue but the local administration is neither demolishing the structures nor conducting any reforestation exercise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/illegal-construction-in-mussoorie-hc-directs-mdda-and-forest-department-to-file-its-responses/articleshow/85634787.cms||Prashant Jha

Kalaburagi Airport, for instances, is fast-emerging as a key nodal point on the aviation map of Karnataka, if one is to go by the average number of passengers per flight at the terminal. Between April and July, 36 passengers, on average, are boarding or alighting from each flight at the airport. More importantly, more flights were operated between Kalaburagi and other cities in Karnataka such as Mangaluru, Belagavi, Hubballi, Bengaluru and Mysuru during the same period this year compared to 2020.Data sourced from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) shows that as many as 691 flights were operated at the Kalaburagi Airport between April and July, while 24,839 passengers travelled on board them. Although more passengers used Belagavi Airport during the same period – 73,071 – the average number of passengers per flight was higher in Kalaburagi, at 36, while the number for Belagavi stood at 32, followed by Hubballi (31) and Mysuru (18).Between April and July this year, 9,716 flights operated out of Bengaluru, with nearly 30 lakh passengers passing through its turnstiles, while 1.7 lakh passengers travelled on board 545 flights that operated out of Mangaluru International Airport in this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/steady-surge-in-passenger-and-flight-traffic-at-kalaburagi-airport/articleshow/85631914.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The situation is particularly concerning in the nine hill districts. The study has revealed that Tehri has no surgeon as against 14 sanctioned posts, Uttarkashi has just one surgeon, and Pithoragarh, Chamoli and Bageshwar have just two each. Meanwhile, Pauri and Rudraprayag have three surgeons each. Additionally, there is not even a single eye surgeon in Champawat against three approved positions while in Dehradun, there are 11 eye surgeons against the six approved posts. The RTI response further adds that the state has 493 specialist doctors against the 1,147 approved posts. “The shortage of specialist doctors along with lack of basic health infrastructure has become a major issue for the hill districts of the state. It is time for the political leadership and bureaucrats to address this issue and work on recognising the right to health. People living in hills should have equitable access to public health services,” said Anoop Nautiyal, founder, SDC. The data for the study was compiled on the basis of an RTI response from the health department. The data — till April 30, 2021 — excludes the doctors working in the four government medical colleges, including AIIMS-Rishikesh, of the state. When asked about the steps being taken to fill the gaps in the hills, Dr Tripti Bahuguna, director-general of the health department, told TOI, “Almost two dozen specialist doctors have been recruited and they are being deployed under World Bank project and National Health Mission projects. They will be posted in Chamoli, Pithoragarh, Champawat, Almora and Tehri districts. Every Tuesday, we conduct walk-in interviews to recruit specialist doctors. The remaining posts in the hill districts will be filled very soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/less-than-50-specialist-doctors-in-10-medical-specialties-in-ukhand-hill-districts-worst-hit-study/articleshow/85634757.cms||Shivani Azad

Hawala payments of Rs 16 crore to a few Hyderabad-based hair merchants have been tracked so far leading to searches at eight places in Hyderabad and West Godavari, Andhra Pradesh. A probe has been launched. Though export of human hair is legal, avoidance of legal route saves the hair smuggler 28% in customs duties. The agency said the racket was unearthed while investigating its money laundering case against some Chinese betting apps. As per ED, domestic merchants were selling raw hair to foreign traders who smuggled it out of India. Once it reaches China, the product is labelled as Chinese hair and processed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-links-china-nationals-to-hair-smuggling/articleshow/85643440.cms||---

This was the highest amount of rainfall Dehradun has received in 24 hours this monsoon season, according to the regional meteorological centre. A cloudburst in Khabarwala area near Santala Devi temple brought huge amounts of debris and slush on the roads, while water entered houses. In Loharwala area, a road caved in and several houses were damaged. Massive waterlogging in Sahastradhara led to people being stranded. They had to be rescued by State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) personnel. Waterlogging was also witnessed in road stretches near ISBT, Haridwar Bypass, Buddha Chowk, Darshan-Lal Chowk, Clock tower, Rajpur road, Niranjanpur and Bhel Chowk, resulting in long traffic jams. Nandini Sharma, councilor of ward no 12, said, “The Choti Bindal river and the water source of Anarwala swelled massively after heavy overnight rainfall on Tuesday, inundating the low-lying areas of Loharwala, Krishnanagar and Sayad Mohallaya. Almost 50 families have been affected and their homes damaged.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doon-receives-seasons-highest-rain-in-24-hours-leading-to-waterlogging-landslides/articleshow/85634835.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Glacier near Raunthi peak where Chamoli floods started receded 800m in 25 years, says study||DEHRADUN: A glacier next to the Raunthi peak, from which a rock avalanche set off the devastating Chamoli floods in February, has retreated an alarming 831m in 25 years, a new study by scientists from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS) has found. The processes that led to this, expert glaciologists say, may have contributed to the flash floods as well. The scientists studied climate patterns at the 14.7km2 Mrigthuni Glacier, one of the major glaciers of Uttarakhand’s Pindar river basin which originates from the 22,490-foot Mrigthuni Peak. They found that the air temperature in the region had gone up by 1°C in just 25 years, starting in 1990, and that had a direct impact on the glacier — it retreated 831m, an average of 33m a year. Indian Himalayan glaciers that have been studied retreat at an average 5-20 m a year. “Climate change, in particular, rise in temperature and change in precipitation pattern, has an adverse effect on glaciers leading to changes in glacial boundaries, the formation of glacial lakes and the loss of ice,” said the paper published in the ‘Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing’ in July. “Regular monitoring with either instruments or remote sensing is required for important glaciers in the state.” The study also found that the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), the boundary between accumulation area (where glacier mass is added) and ablation (where glacier mass is lost), of Mrigthuni has moved upwards by 66m. ELA is an important climate change indicator. Another sign of climate change, glacier accumulation area ratio (over how much area a glacier gains mass as a ratio to the total area), also went down by 2.4% in the same period. “The health of Mrigthuni is degrading,” the paper said. The reason, the study said, is a change in rain and snowfall. It is going up in April-September and down in October-March. That “must have resulted in less snowfall and higher melting of snow … leading to less accumulation, thinning and retreat of the glacier,” the paper said. What led to the shifting of this glacier may have catalysed the flash floods in February, expert glaciologists told TOI. “If the temperature in the area increased by 1°C in just 25 years, it would have definitely played a role in the Chamoli rock avalanche. It (Raunthi) was a hanging glacier, already vulnerable to fall and disrupt the rock on which it was hanging,” said Dr DP Dobhal, former senior glaciologist from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology who has studied Himalayan glaciers for decades. “The Himalayas are young mountains. Tectonic activities keep happening internally. That, along with climate change, would have led to the Chamoli floods.” Climate change, in particular, rise in temperature and change in precipitation pattern, has an adverse effect on glaciers leading to changes in glacial boundaries, the formation of glacial lakes and the loss of ice,” said the paper published in the ‘Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing’ in July. “Regular monitoring with either instruments or remote sensing is required for important glaciers in the state.” The study also found that the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), the boundary between accumulation area (where glacier mass is added) and ablation (where glacier mass is lost), of Mrigthuni has moved upwards by 66m.

---||Mumbai||Benami transactions case: I-T department files prosecution complaint against Maharashtra minister Chhagan Bhujbal, kin||MUMBAI: The income-tax (I-T) department’s investigation wing on Tuesday filed a prosecution complaint against state minister and NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal, his son Pankaj, nephew Sameer, a company associated with them—Armstrong Infrastructure Pvt Ltd—and its dummy director before a city civil and sessions court under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions (PBPT)Act. It is alleged that Armstrong Infrastructure was benamidar of several properties worth over Rs 100 crore and Bhujbal, along with Pankaj and Sameer, are its beneficial owners. Officials claimed that Armstrong Infrastructure director, Satyan Kesarkar, was a dummy figure and all decisions were taken by the Bhujbals. The prosecution complaint stated: “It is established that Armstrong Infrastructure is a benamidar and Chhagan Bhujbal, Sameer Bhujbal and Pankaj Bhujbal are the beneficial owners in respect of the benami property.” When contacted, Bhujbal said, “All these cases were initiated in 2017. We have challenged all the proceedings before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the cases are still pending. We have also moved the Bombay high court.” In 2017, I-T department started an investigation into the purchase of Girna Sugar Mills, along with land parcels in Malegaon by Armstrong Infrastructure and provisionally attached the properties under the PBPT Act. It found that Armstrong Infrastructure had received Rs 17.8 crore from two other Bhujbal-controlled companies—Armstrong Energy Pvt Ltd and Parvesh Constructions Pvt Ltd. Further probe revealed that the two companies had received huge amounts from various dubious entities as a share premium. Earlier, the Enforcement Directorate had also probed the two companies and found that over two dozen paper companies had paid a premium of Rs 9,900 for each share worth Rs 100 of the two companies, thus helping them to legitimize Rs 130-crore “tainted” money. The transaction took place between 2009 to 2012. Investigators found that Armstrong Infrastructure had used the money to purchase properties, including Girna Sugar Mills, for Rs 27.8 crore through auction from the Debt Recovery Tribunal. The I-T department’s prosecution report stated that it was tainted funds that belonged to Bhujbal, Pankaj and Sameer which they used indirectly to acquire immovable property in the name of Armstrong Infrastructure. The company had also bought land parcels in Panvel, Thane and Mumbai. The report further alleged that Bhujbal with the help of Pankaj, Sameer and other associates purchased the benami properties by investing ill-gotten money through a web of shell companies in Kolkata, Mumbai and other places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/benami-transactions-case-i-t-dept-files-prosecution-plaint-against-bhujbal-kin/articleshow/85639932.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Ahmedabad||DNA finding: Missing man in Gujarat was murdered||AHMEDABAD: A DNA analysis by the Directorate of Forensic Sciences (DFS), Gandhinagar, solved a case of a missing person — the 30-year-old man was found to be murdered three years back. “Vikramsinh Sarvaiya, 30, a resident of Jesar, had started off from his village on February 11, 2017. He had not returned ever since. Recently the old cases were opened for investigation when the cops again went through the details of the case,” said an investigator. “Vikramsinh was seen with Haresh Parmar, a resident of Katrodi. Upon further probe it was revealed that Vikramsinh had extramarital relationship with Haresh’s wife.” Based on circumstantial evidences, a team reached Bhimnath Mahadev temple and started digging a rivulet near the premises. From the spot, the officials found burnt bones. The bones were sent to DFS for further probe. After extraction of DNA, it was matched with parents of Vikramsinh, indicating that the remains were indeed of the missing person. Police then got hold of the accused in the case and questioned him further when he confessed that he and his wife decided to kill Vikramsinh. He was called to the spot after which he was killed. The duo then burnt the body to destroy the evidence. “The DNA extraction can help establish an unidentified person if there are a few probable matches. In several offences, DNA evidence remained a clincher in terms of establishing the case,” said a senior DFS official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dna-finding-missing-man-was-murdered/articleshow/85639919.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: CPM issues guidelines for keeping a check on govt||Kochi: Amidst complaints that CPM has been losing control over government since Pinarayi Vijayan assumed office as chief minister in 2016, the party has issued guidelines for functioning of the government. The guidelines approved by the state committee a few days ago state that the party should act as a corrective force if the government or ministers err. The party has to bring up issues that affect the life of the public to the government’s notice, the guidelines state. It is quite normal that vested interests may try to influence the government and some may try to become power centres but such tendencies shouldn’t be allowed. Those who have power must not be allowed to use it for taking vengeance or protecting personal interests, the guidelines state. During its first term, Pinarayi Vijayan’s government had faced allegations that it was gaining supremacy over the party. Advisors, including the principal secretary to the chief minister were accused of becoming power centres. It was also alleged that power was being misused for waging personal vendetta. Sources said certain suggestions in the guidelines were prepared against such a background. “During his first stint, Vijayan took only a few minutes to decide on inviting investments from global major Nissan to the state. He did not consult the party and he enjoyed the freedom to make such decisions. It was a good decision but he may not be able to take such crucial decisions single-handedly anymore,” said Jacob George, political analyst. “He will now have to consult the party before taking such policy decisions. Vijayan is a party man and it is sure that he will abide by party diktat,” he said. CPM politburo member M A Baby said the guidelines were made to improve the government’s performance. “During the term of the first Pinarayi government, a lot of pro-people measures were taken. The government took the people into confidence while tiding over various crises like flood and pandemic. It is this extraordinary performance that ensured government continuity despite propaganda by political opponents and a section of the media,” Baby said. “With LDF getting a second consecutive mandate, there is an added responsibility. We will have to put up a better show. Given the fact that the state government’s performance has been very good, though it is difficult to improve the rating, the party will be taking all measures to better the government’s performance. If there are any issues which are to be addressed, the party would point them out,” Baby said. The guidelines also stress the point that those coming to the offices of ministers for various reasons need to be treated well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-issues-guidelines-for-keeping-a-check-on-govt/articleshow/85637710.cms||---

The inspection is part of a preliminary inquiry into three complaints filed by opposition LDF to the vigilance director. They examined files related to the posting of a contingency worker when model code of conduct was in place, distribution of food kits for Covid affected families, and the alleged corruption in cleaning of canals and drains. “We examined the files as part of our preliminary inquiry into the complaints. The registration of cases will be done only after verifying the facts,” said a vigilance official. As the secretary and superintendent were not present at the office, the team met revenue officials and examined the files. However, municipality officials termed the inspection a routine procedure. As per the complaint to the Vigilance DySP, the opposition alleged corruption in works awarded for cleaning drains and canals. They alleged that the chairperson and public works standing committee chairperson opened 15 quotations in the absence of secretary and assistant executive engineer and rejected 11 of it without completing tender procedures, and this led to huge financial loss to the local body. The quotations were given to the contractors at the special interest of the governing council. The LDF further alleged that the local body bought 4,300 food kits without inviting quotations or meeting tender procedures. It also alleged that the chairperson gave prior permission to appoint a daily wage driver as a cleaning staff while the model code of conduct was in place. The opposition will meet higher authorities on Thursday as the vigilance has not started a probe into the latest complaint regarding the ‘gift’ row by Chairperson Ajitha Thankappan. Meanwhile, the UDF termed the complaints as political vendetta on the part of the opposition to snatch power. “The LDF wants to snatch power from the UDF in Thrikkakara and Kalamassery municipalities and that is why they resort to baseless allegations,” said municipality vice-chairman Ibrahim Kutty. The two member team constituted by the Ernakulam District Congress Committee (DCC) to probe into the gift row will submit its report to the DCC president on Thursday. The report is learnt to have given a clean chit to the chairperson terming the current controversy is related to internal conflict in the party. While the indefinite strike of the LDF demanding resignation of the chairperson continues in front of the local body. DYFI staged a protest on Wednesday. The Chief Minister’s office has forwarded the complaint given by the LDF regarding the gift row to the VACB director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vigilance-raids-municipal-office-amid-onam-gift-row/articleshow/85637633.cms||---

Following the cessation of these sections concerning control and limitation of plantation, there will be no bar on expansion of estates and grant of permission to grow tea on a ‘non-tea land’. Ailing industry bodies believe that this order – signed by joint secretary (plantations) D N Misra – will usher in uncontrolled growth of poor and below-average quality tea produce in the market, further impacting the sagging price realisation of the morning cuppa. Arijit Raha, the secretary-general of premier planters’ body Indian Tea Association (ITA), said: “Tea cultivation was meant to be regulated by the Tea Act as oversupply of the brew threatens the sector’s sustainability. The unfettered expansion in tea areas in the last few years has been a cause for the non-maintenance of demand-supply equilibrium adversely impacting prices. De-regulation would encourage market considerations to drive expansion.” However, Raha added that since it is just a suspension of a few sections of the Tea Act, 1953, the Centre could reconsider its decision later. Till 2018-19, tea was planted on 6,36,557 hectares by 2,11,794 big and small growers in India. The Tea Board of India chairman, Prabhat Kamal Bezboruah, told TOI that the particular sections of the Tea Act served as a barrier for entry of new entrepreneurs. Since 1980, it has been reported that lakhs of small tea growers (STG) have planted hectares after hectares of tea in Assam, north Bengal, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram without legal permits. “Even big producers planted tea without the permits except in cases where they applied for subsidies from the Tea Board. Hence, these provisions were observed more in the breach, and represented an anachronism. By repealing them, the government has ensured that STG are no longer in violation of any laws. It has done away with a regulation that no one was obeying anyway,” he said. As land is a state subject, the Central government’s Tea Act could do a little about it. Bijoygopal Chakraborty, the president of the largest STG body, Cista, said, “It is true that these sections of the Act are now irrelevant. The Centre should think on how to manage the tea oversupply situation and pricing woes faced by the industry.” On the Tea Board’s shrinking power, Bezboruah said: “Tea Board will be relevant as a marketing and export promotion body.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tea-act-rejig-to-give-land-leeway-up-oversupply-woes/articleshow/85637783.cms||Sovon Manna

In the first phase, 2.3 lakh square feet area has been developed. Integrated startup complex and biotechnology incubation centre are operating from the first phase of the Innovation Zone. Around 3.40 lakh square feet will be developed as part of the second phase of the project. The construction of the first building as part of the second phase of the project has been completed. Two towers were constructed as part of the first phase of Technology Innovation Zone. The Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) has allotted Rs 215 crore for the second phase. Besides giving guidance for starting industrial units, aspiring entrepreneurs will also be given innovative concepts for starting units. The Technology Innovation Zone will be a “one-stop shop for all the needs of the entrepreneurs”. It is already hosting a few incubators. Besides hosting startups, the zone will provide space for expanding already functioning units as well. A theatre, which can accommodate 500 persons, office, training centres, studio, conference rooms, meeting rooms and parking lots are part of the zone. The government has asked the officials associated with the project to take special attention for ensuring that the work is completed within the scheduled time. Many IT ventures are ready to invest in the state and the timely completion of projects like Technology Innovation Zone will help tap the opportunity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tech-zone-phase-ii-nearing-completion/articleshow/85637695.cms||---

According to the police, the builder, who has been carrying out a redevelopment project in Girgaum, was receiving threats from the gang for the past one year. The complainant told the police that the gang leader, Deepak Walekar, had been calling him and demanding 30% of his profits from the project. When the complainant ignored the gang’s threats, on August 22, they sent him a threat note written in blood. “The builder finally lodged a complaint with the VP Marg police and as it was a sensitive case, the investigation was handed over to the anti-extortion cell of Mumbai Police,” said a police officer. Based on the complaint, a police team, led by inspector Yogesh Chavan, laid a trap and arrested Walekar, Ganesh Suryavanshi, Siddharth Mayekar, Anil Bhuvad, Sanjay Bhange and Jitendra Vaishnavikar. Police said that all the arrested accused are history-sheeters who have been booked under the stringent MCOCA in the past. Officials said that the Pandav Putra gang has been issuing threats to businessmen, jewellers, hoteliers and share brokers in south Mumbai. The police have requested citizens to come forward and lodge a complaint if they have received any threats from gangs members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-six-from-pandav-putra-gang-held-for-extortion-bid/articleshow/85640015.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Kochi||Pokkali farming: Paddy farmers at Chellanam in Ernakulam fighting for survival||KOCHI: For a handful of paddy farmers in Chellanam panchayat, the future of their vocation looks rather bleak. The area is famous for its pokkali farming where the crop alternates between rice and shrimp. However, with the saltwater intrusion into their farmlands, these paddy farmers have to go through an annual fight with the fish farming groups that control the management of the Maruvakkad padashekaram here. Every year, these few farmers led by the pokkali samrakshana samithi run from pillar to post seeking district administration’s help in getting the land released for paddy cultivation. The pokkali paddy cultivation alternates with aquaculture thus having two crops in one farmland. From November to March the land is used for shrimp cultivation, and the farmers are then expected to harvest the fish and drain the water for the pokkali farmers to start land preparation for paddy. In April, the land is dried and the salt content is washed away in the summer rains. It is then prepared for sowing as the monsoon comes in. The paddy will be ready for harvest by September or early October after which the land is again transferred to the fish farmers. “Since Chellanam lies between the sea and the backwaters, the saltwater content is comparatively high against similar farms in Kadamakudy, Varapuzha or Karumalloor. While Pokkali is salt-tolerant when compared to other forms of paddy, it can take in only around three to four ppm salinity in the water. If it exceeds, then the crop will die because sea water salinity is about 35 ppm,” said Francis Kalathinkal, joint coordinator, pokkali samrakshana samithi. Despite a fixed calendar for twin crops, the fish farm lobby often postpones the harvest of the shrimp up until the summer rains. Paddy farmers allege that even though the agriculture department pays the bills for the motor charges used to drain water from the land and gives subsidy for paddy cultivation, the department is not able to retrieve the land for paddy on time. At Chellanam, the fish farms are often not dewatered and handed over by April 1. There are 13 padashekharams with 1,300 hectares of land. “But there is a deliberate attempt to leave the land barren to slowly remove it from farm cultivation. As of now the area under cultivation for paddy is prepared by a handful of farmers in about four acres of land. There is a lot of local support for paddy cultivation, but the officials are not able to impose the law. Even though the agriculture department pays the electricity bill for operating the metre, paddy cultivation is prevented by the fish farmers,” alleges Kalathinkal. While at all other pokkali farms the crop is in flowering stage, but in Maruvakkad padashekaram at Chellanam farmers have just sown the seeds as they received their land after dewatering only recently. Following a petition filed by Chandu Manjadiparambil, the Kerala High Court issued orders asking for dewatering of the farm land by April-end, which was further delayed due to Covid related restrictions. When the court realised that its orders had not been followed regarding dewatering, it issued orders to the district pokkali land development agency to ensure that the orders were implemented. The court also selected an advocate commissioner Renil Anto Kandamkulathy to report the facts. He was asked to report on the availability of motor pumps used for dewatering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pokkali-farming-paddy-farmers-at-chellanam-fighting-for-survival/articleshow/85637666.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The state government has asked Maharashtra State Council Of Education Research and Training Institute (MSCERT) and Maharashtra Council of Agriculture, Education and Research (MCAER) to jointly prepare the curriculum. The decision was taken in a joint meeting of the school education and agriculture department on Wednesday in the presence of ministers Varsha Gaikwad and Dadaji Bhuse, and senior bureaucrats. Bhuse said the inclusion of agriculture in curriculum would not only create interest among students in the sector but also ensure agricultural and social commitments towards the farmer community in rural areas. “We have instructed both the departments to prepare the syllabus keeping in view the age and intelligence of the students,” said Gaikwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-agriculture-to-be-a-subject-in-state-schools/articleshow/85640050.cms||---

A alumni of Symbiosis Institute of Management Studies, Pune, Meena had completed MBA Finance before joining the civil service. Posted earlier as addl commissioner in tribal welfare department in Pune, Meena said that experiences from his previous posting would help him serve better in Gadchiroli. “Employment generation is the prime focus here along with development,” said the new collector who spent the first two days reviewing the progress of the work under various projects taken up so far in the district. Meena has joined the district just when government has sanctioned several crucial bridge and road projects, including one in the Maoist stronghold of Beenagunda which is considered getaway to Abhujmadh. “The perception and image of Gadchiroli needs to change in the coming days. It will be a major task,” said Meena who seemed keen to visit the deep interiors of the remote district. Though this is the first assignment for him in any Maoist-affected district, Meena said that he would like to gain insight into the issues here by reviewing the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-focus-on-employment-generation-gadchiroli-collector-meena/articleshow/85637714.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Thiruvananthapuram||SCTL invites fresh EoI for parking plan at public office||Thiruvananthapuram: Smart city Thiruvananthapuram limited (SCTL) on Wednesday invited fresh expression of interests (EoI) for implementing an electro-mechanical parking project at the public office compound. The move has been facilitated after the national highways and infrastructure development corporation (NHIDCL) backed out of the project. Meanwhile, the SCTL has already kick-started parking projects at Palayam and Thampanoor. The project at public office was the fourth parking scheme to be implemented under the smart city project. The SCTL was initially communicated by NHIDCL about a proposal of having a three storey facility with a capacity of 120 cars. A detailed project report was never submitted, and the NHIDCL later expressed willingness to withdraw from the project forcing the SCTL to go through a fresh round of tender process. While a 120 car facility in the tower model was pitched by the NHIDCL, the SCTL is planning to explore different options before going for a tender. It is considering viable models like puzzle parking, tower parking, shuttle and other robotic systems for the site. Those with proven credentials in development of electro mechanical car parking systems especially at land constrained areas are being considered for the project. The proposed site is in front of Superintendent Engineer’s Office PWD (Roads & Bridges) adjoining Bakery Junction road. Total area available for the project is 540 sq. mt. A major impediment in this area is the need for NoC from airport authorities. The SCTL has mentioned in the EoI that the building height should not exceed the maximum permissible height as prescribed by the Airport Authority of India. Maximum car parking capacity, minimum car retrieval time, maximum life cycle for the parking asset and minimum cost for the operations and maintenance of the system are the other features expected. The SCTL will be able to process the tender only after getting an idea about maximum number of cars that can be accommodated in this site, platform load, and tentative cost for the proposed solution, smart parking management system, estimated revenue and power consumption. The multi-level car parking facility at Thampanoor being built under smart city project will have a capacity to accommodate 450 two-wheelers and 22 cars. Basement of the Palayam market being revamped will have an electro-mechanical car parking system to accommodate around 280 cars. The SCTL has already awarded the work of construction of a puzzle parking system to Pune-based Affordable Robotic and Automation Ltd. This system will house 568 car parking and around 300 bike parking slots. These two parking systems would create a sufficient number of car parking spaces to address needs of the entire Palayam zone, including Saphalyam Complex and other commercial institutions along MG Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sctl-invites-fresh-eoi-for-parking-plan-at-public-office/articleshow/85637742.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Delhi||Eco-friendly rides for cleaner South Delhi||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has initiated the tendering process for setting up 82 e-bike and e-cycle stations in its residential neighbourhoods, parking lots and near Metro stations. Officials of the civic body claimed that the e-cycles will be battery-operated, run at a speed of 15-20 km/per hour and have the option of using pedals for riding. In comparison, e-bikes will run at a maximum speed of 25 km/hour and won’t have an option for pedals. At each station, electricity connection through power discoms will be provided for charging the batteries. The civic body will help in providing land for setting up the stations, getting necessary permissions from the land-owning agencies or Delhi government and the rest of the cost will be incurred by the concessionaire. “Though the cost of the e-bikes and e-cycles will be finalised after the bidding process, we are assuming that the minimum cost of an e-cycle would be Rs 25,000 and e-bike Rs 40, 000,” said an official. After the NGT’s direction to promote facilities for last-mile connectivity, the south corporation had formulated a policy for e-bikes last year. “Besides boosting last-mile connectivity, the facility will be cost-effective and an environment-friendly option for city residents. After passing the policy about seven months back, we had called tenders in June, but due to the pandemic, there were no encouraging responses. Also, the project needs huge investment as the costs of e-bikes and e-cycles are really high compared to that of the normal cycles used in other areas. Setting up stations will also involve huge costs,” said Prem Shankar Jha, SDMC deputy commissioner, remunerative and project cell. To avail of the service, users will have to register on SDMC’s app and then they can hire an e-bike for a maximum of up to 10 hours and use it within the south corporation’s jurisdiction. “The amount will increase at the rate of Rs 10 /hour,” said the official. “The concessionaire can track the movement and position of e-bikes and e-bicycles through a wireless system. The system will also have real-time monitoring of station occupancy rates,” added the official. For each docking station, SDMC will provide space of 25 square metres and 12 bikes can be parked there. “Spaces for 4-5 bikes will be kept free all the time so that people coming from other places in south Delhi can leave/park them there. Based on the response to this facility, we may increase the number of stations in future.” The civic body has, meanwhile, decided to continue with the nine cycling stations constructed on the BRT corridor about two years back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/eco-friendly-rides-for-cleaner-south-delhi/articleshow/85638485.cms||Vibha Sharma

Taking into account the non-payment of the fine by the erring motorists, the city traffic branch has started sending notices to them. Officials said that 1,01,548 erring motorists were given e-challans till June-end and about 11% of them, or 11,843 motorists, have paid the fine. A senior officer of the traffic branch said that motorists are booked for various traffic violations by clicking photos of the violation. This is registered through a device. After the registration number of the vehicle and the type of offence is entered in the device, an e-challan is automatically generated and sent on cellphone of the motorist. The motorist is expected to make online payment of the fine amount. The 11,843 motorists have paid fine of Rs 87.27 lakh, while the recovery of Rs 4.16 crore from the remaining 89,000 motorists is pending. Assistant commissioner of police Seetaram Kolhe of the city traffic branch said that the work of issuing notices to the motorists, who have not paid the fine, is underway. The traffic branch has sent notices to such motorists in the past too. This year from January, the traffic branch has issued 1,903 notices out of which 534 motorists have made payment of fine of Rs 13.88 lakh. The police are also planning to set up CCTV cameras at important junctions of the city. With the help of these cameras, the police would trace erring motorists and issue them e-challans. Officials said that the device used by the traffic cops is linked with the software of the regional transport office. Hence, once the number of the vehicle registration number is entered, all the details of the vehicle owner are available to issue the e-challan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/1l-motorists-e-challaned-in-nashik-only-11-pay-fine/articleshow/85637735.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The man’s family has alleged that the victim was brutally thrashed by police for “sheltering a murder accused” and succumbed to his injuries. Police, however, claimed that there were no injuries on the man’s body and that the reason of death would be made clear in the autopsy report. “The autopsy was conducted by a panel of three doctors with videography to ensure transparency in the investigation,” said Shahjahanpur SSP S Anand. On Tuesday, a 55-year-old farmer, Ved Prakash, was hacked to death allegedly by his relatives over a property dispute in Bhudeli village under the limits of Tilhar police station. His family alleged that he was murdered by his cousin Ramdas and the latter’s sons Kallu, Ramkumar and Pyare. Police said they got a tip-off that the accused were hiding in the neighbouring Dhanela village at Hardwari Lal's house. Lal was a relative of theirs. “We raided the house at night and arrested Ramdas, who was hiding in a storeroom, along with the murder weapon — an axe. His sons were hiding in cane fields and managed to flee,” said police. On Wednesday morning, Lal’s son, Arvind Kumar, filed a complaint that his father had died a few hours after cops left the house. “My father was beaten up and assaulted and I demand action against the cops involved,” he told TOI. Kumar said the family wasn’t aware that the accused was hiding in their house. “Police didn’t believe us and thrashed my entire family, including my elderly parents,” he said. According to the Shahjahanpur SSP, no violence had taken place at Lal’s house on Tuesday night. “We have assured the family that action will be taken after the autopsy report. The family has agreed to cremate his body and wait for our investigation report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/62-yr-old-man-dead-after-police-raids-home-to-look-for-murder-accused-kin-allege-brutality/articleshow/85635025.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The Nashik civic polls are slated to be held early next year . The state election commission (SEC) has directed the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to prepare a draft plan on restructuring of the existing 31 wards and increasing them to 122. An NMC election department official said the draft plan would be sent to the SEC as soon as possible since the latter would need time to fine tune it before giving its nod. “We have appointed a one-member team to take up the task of restructuring the wards. He will prepare the draft plan and place it before municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav for his approval before it is sent to the SEC,” the official said, adding the wards that would be reserved for various categories would be earmarked at a later stage — after the SEC approves the draft plan. During the last civic polls held in February 2017, a voter from all the 31 wards had to press the EVM button four times to cast his/her vote selecting four candidates contesting from each of the wards. “But as per SEC’s instruction a voter will now need to press the EVM button once only to pick the desired candidate,” the official said. Currently, the BJP with 66 elected members and is in power in the 122-member House. Shiv Sena is the main opposition with 35 seats, while Congress and NCP have six seats each and MNS has five. The remaining seats were won by smaller parties and independents. Mayor Satish Kulkarni said multi-member ward system is always better whether it is a four or two-member ward system. “In one-member ward system, the number of independent corporators will increase due to one-member ward system. Hence, it will also become difficult for the political parties to win the election with majority and they will have to seek support of these independents. At least the two-member ward system should have been introduced for the upcoming polls ,” he said. Leader of opposition in NMC Ajay Borate welcomed the SEC’s decision to restructure the wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/one-member-ward-system-for-upcoming-nashik-civic-polls/articleshow/85637769.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Second list: Degree college cut-offs in Mumbai drop marginally, seats running out||MUMBAI: The second merit list for admissions to degree colleges brought little cheer to aspirants vying for seats in top-rung colleges. The cut-offs dropped marginally for sought-after self-financed courses and for arts in these colleges. Pure science courses, which saw higher cut-offs in the first list, saw a massive fall in some colleges. Many colleges are planning to start the academic session by September 1 to avoid any further delay. Last year, colleges could start classes in the second week of August. FYBA admissions at St Xavier’s College closed as it did not put out a second list for arts on Wednesday. The college probably closed admissions for arts at a percentage as high as 99.2% (for other boards) and 98% (for HSC) for the first time. While science cut-offs dropped by 2-3% at the college, principal Rajendra Shinde said they plan to start the academic session by Septe-mber 1. “If a few seats are left for the third round, we can complete the process simultaneously.” Even at Mithibai College, FYBA cut-off dropped by only 0.2%—from 97% to 96.8%. Principal Krutika Desai said the sec-ond list has 15-25 students for various courses. “Sometimes we see cancellations even four mo-nths after the admission process. It is difficult to say whether we will have a third list. Stud-ents from the north do cancel admissions if they secure a seat in Delhi University.” At NM College, too, the cut-offs for all courses dropped by a few decimal points. While students are pinning their hopes on the third list, colleges say there are slim chances. The second list at Ramnarain Ruia College was out on Tuesday, and the cut-offs for arts dropped by 1% as there were very few seats left. The college is not expecting a third list for arts, said principal Anushree Lokur. For science, seats were available in some combinations and therefore, the cut-offs dropped by a few points. Even if there is a third list, the college aims to start the academic session around September 1, said Lokur. Principal of Podar College Shobhana Vasudevan said, “The second list is out for about 20 students in commerce and about 30 for BMS.” Although there is a marginal drop in scores, the college has several applications with the same scores due to the surfeit of high scorers. “...if we do have a third list, it will be slim,” Vasudevan said. At Jai Hind College, science cut-offs dropped to 60%. The college even released a waitlist of 17 students if any candidate from the second list fails to confirm admission. Second lists for unaided programmes were not declared till late night. T A Shiware, education director, Wilson Education Society, said with more high scorers, cut-offs are hovering above 90% only this year. But science cut-offs plunged by over 25% at the college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/second-list-degree-college-cut-offs-drop-marginally-seats-running-out/articleshow/85640082.cms||---

This was after Roji Augustin, key accused in the case, allegedly threatened Kumar in front of SIT officers when he was questioned at Aluva Police Club after the arrest of the three Augustin brothers on July 28. In a letter to Arun RS, chief conservator of forests and member of SIT, Dhanesh said that Roji had threatened him at Aluva Police Club saying that he would also trap him (Dhanesh) for anti-national activities and implicate him in grave criminal offences under NDPS Act, Abkari Act. “Roji and his brothers were repeatedly saying to every investigating officer that they will not let me live. I would like to bring to your kind attention that I’m facing severe threats to my life as a result of unearthing this issue. Hence it is humbly requested that appropriate action may kindly be taken to give adequate protection to my life, while I am in Wayanad as part of my official duties,” he wrote in the letter. He also sought necessary action to ensure the safety of his family. The letter said that on July 28, the Augustin brothers were arrested by SIT and were moved to the Aluva Police Club. Kumar was directed to attend a meeting on the same day and told to be present at the same location that day. “When Roji Augustin saw me he started raising his voice in front of the police officers threatening that he would trap me for anti-national activities, and implicate me in grave criminal offences under NDPS Act, Abkari Act, etc, and that he would go to any extent to create evidence in support of this,” the letter said. Meanwhile, the inquiry conducted by forest department into the complaints against conservator of forests NT Sajan has indicted the IFS officer of serious wrongdoings, including filing a baseless report to the department that amounted to derailing the investigations in Muttil illegal tree felling case. The report had stated that Sajan was involved with the prime accused in Muttil case (Augustin brothers) and their accomplices while filing the baseless report on Feb 15. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Sajan had spoken to the accused over phone 86 times and that a journalist with a Malayalam news channel had also called the accused numerous times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/dfo-seeks-protection-after-threat-from-accused/articleshow/85637811.cms||---

These residents of Ambedkar and Jamrishi Nagar had recently complained of ‘hefty’ electricity bills. “I have taken cognisance of their complaints and have asked Adani officials to replace the common meter (through which they presently get electricity) with individual residential meters or give them slab benefits,” Raut said. Sources in the energy department said this required “forest clearance” as no meter connection can be given in forest zones and also no Low-tension (LT) distribution network can come up inside forest areas without environmental clearances. Raut has asked the utility co to conduct a survey of the area and seek necessary permissions from the forest dept to clear all hurdles. A statement issued by Adani said, “We want to supply electricity to all the consumers in our license area. As per the law, laying of network and supply to consumers in forest area requires an NOC from the forest dept. As soon as the same is granted we shall release the supply immediately.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-new-meters-can-lower-bills-in-malad-forest-zone/articleshow/85640110.cms||Somit Sen

---||Hyderabad||T to attend KRMB meet on Sept 1||Hyderabad: Telangana has decided to attend the 14th meeting of Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) which will be held on September 1. This would be the first meeting that Telangana would be attending after the ministry of Jal Shakti issued a gazette notification on jurisdiction of Krishna and Godavari river boards on July 15. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday directed irrigation department officials to flag the concerns of the state on Krishna water sharing and AP’s irrigation projects at the KRMB meeting. He held a marathon eight-hour long meeting with irrigation officials, legal experts and lawyers on the strategy to be adopted for September 1 meeting. Official sources said KCR expressed his willingness to attend the KRMB meeting, if required, to put forth the government’s arguments. However, the CMO said there was no such proposal on CM attending the meeting. “There is an apex council headed by Union Jal Shakti minister. KRMB is only an official forum to discuss water sharing issues,” a senior CMO official said. At Wednesday’s meeting, the government invited former advocate general K Ramakrishna Reddy and senior counsel in tribunal Ravinder Rao to discuss the strategy. The meeting was attended by chief secretary Somesh Kumar and special chief secretary of irrigation Rajat Kumar along with other officials. KCR is believed to have asked the officials to insist on 50:50 water allocation of Krishna between Telangana and AP at the KRMB meeting till a final allocation is made. Other issues which were discussed include Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme constructed by AP and KRMB panel confirming excess works at the RLIS site. The CM also told the officials to highlight the fact that hydel power generation from Srisailam by Telangana was not wrong since the project was originally conceived as a hydel project. “Drinking water for Hyderabad should be accounted for only 20% of the total drawal of water. Carryover of unutilised water for the next water year would also be raised at the meeting,” a senior irrigation official said.

In 2019 that the university had received sanction from the state government after a couple of decades to fill up as many as 682 permanent teaching posts that were lying vacant. Although the university had started recruitment in 2019, the process got mired in several controversies. First, the university did not get enough response against some vacancies. The interview process itself drew allegations from some quarters. After complaints against the recruitment process reached the state government, the state education department had halted the entire process. Recruitment for about 80 posts was done before the freeze. Sources said that the university has not received a go ahead from the state government to proceed with the interview process. “We will shortly start the recruitment process,” said MSU’s officiating registrar Dr K M Chudasama. The issue was also discussed during the recent syndicate meeting where it was discussed that the interview process should be restarted from September 1. The university will also issue a fresh notification for 50 teaching posts that have fallen vacant in lieu of positions that have fallen vacant because of retirement, voluntary retirement, resignation or death of teachers. “It has also been decided that applications will be invited for posts where we have not received any application or no applicant has been found eligible by the scrutiny committee,” said a syndicate member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/after-two-years-msu-to-resume-recruitment-for-teachers/articleshow/85633058.cms||---
---||Dehradun||In jolt to Punjab revolt, Amarinder gets Rawat vote to lead Cong in polls||Chandigarh/Dehradun: A day after a 30-strong rebel camp of Punjab ministers and MLAs clamoured for a change at the helm, Congress's state in-charge and former Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat on Wednesday unequivocally told them the party would contest the 2022 assembly polls under Capt Amarinder Singh's command. Rawat made the statement after a delegation of dissidents, including four ministers and three MLAs believed to be close to new Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, held a two-hour meeting with him in Dehradun to convey "the feelings and grievances of party members and the people of the state". Rawat acknowledged the concerns expressed by the ministers and MLAs as being "serious in nature and important for the party". He assured them that their grievances would be conveyed to the Congress high command. The delegation included rural development and panchayat minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, jails and cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, technical education and industrial training minister Charanjit Singh Channi, revenue minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, and MLAs Kulbir Singh (Zira), Barindermeet Singh Pahra (Gurdaspur) and Surjit Singh Dhiman (Amargarh). Claiming there was no threat to the government in Punjab or the party, Rawat said he would leave for Delhi in a day or two to discuss the Punjab legislators’ grievances with the senior leadership. On whether the dissidents spoke about wanting Amarinder replaced, he declined to reveal details of whatever was discussed at the meeting. Sources said Rawat made his displeasure known over the disgruntled Congress legislators "washing dirty linen in public" rather than voicing their grievances on a party platform, especially with barely six months to go for polls. The dissenters had said on Tuesday they no longer had faith in Amarinder's ability to deliver on poll promises. They also accused the CM of being "hand in glove with (SAD president) Sukhbir Singh Badal". Rawat claimed the delegation that met him "was not here to oppose any individual". He said the MLAs only sought a clear roadmap to ensure a Congress victory in the 2022 polls. "These MLAs had met Sidhu on Tuesday. Sidhu has been given the responsibility of the party unit in Punjab, but it does not mean there are no other leaders. We have senior leaders like Amarinder Singh, Pratap Singh Bajwa, Ambika Soni, and Sukhwinder Randhawa, and all work together for the party. A situation has arisen and we will find a solution to it," Rawat said. Minister Channi said the delegation was satisfied with the assurances given by AICC's Punjab in-charge and was returning to Chandigarh with hopes of getting a call from the high command soon. While Amarinder has yet to react to the revolt by a section of ministers and other MLAs, his wife and Patiala MP Preneet Kaur blamed PCC chief Sidhu and his advisers for the turmoil in the party. On the clamour for the CM's ouster, she said it was the high command's prerogative to take a call. She said the CM of a state could not be changed just because a few people had demanded it. "The CM showed great maturity once the decision had been taken by the high command that Sidhu was being appointed party president. The CM said it was the Congress president’s decision and he abides by it. So, they (the dissidents) should also fall in line," Preneet said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-jolt-to-punjab-revolt-amarinder-gets-rawat-vote-to-lead-cong-in-polls/articleshow/85635062.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Delhi||Delhi HC orders Rs 20 lakh relief for electrician who fell from pole||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday awarded Rs 20 lakh as compensation to an electrician who was left “barely alive” after falling from an electricity. The court also directed that a provisional store be opened for his benefit from the amount. The high court said the compensation amount had to be paid in equal parts by BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL), which distributed electricity in certain parts of Delhi, and M/s Bryn Construction Company (Bryn) that was carrying out repair and maintenance works for BRPL, holding them liable for the injury that left the person with 100% disability. Justice Anup J Bhambhai said that although the now 28-year-old electrician–Bharat—was living, he was barely alive and directed the Uttar Pradesh government, under whose jurisdiction he lives, to continue to provide him disability pension, free physiotherapy and occupational therapy and other assistance as may be given to him from time-to-time. In 2014, Bharat, who worked as an electrician with Bryn, suffered a fall while rectifying a fault in an pole that was causing fluctuation in the power supply at a farmhouse in Bijwasan. The accident was caused after the electricity pole that he had climbed on, snapped and fell.

---||Pune||Most rise in FYJC seats for science||Pune: The rise in intake for first year junior college courses has been maximum in the science and commerce streams this year, with lesser-known colleges cornering a lion’s share of these seats, leaving the students to fight it out to gain entry to popular institutes. “Many of the parents and students opt for science stream because after 12th, all career options remain open for them. Moreover this time students’ marks have also increased. Hence, there are chances that many students are likely to opt for science stream,” the vice-principal of Ness Wadia College of Commerce, Prakash Chaudhary, said. He said the government would have to be flexible in granting or allotting seats for different streams. “The government must have taken an overview of demand for streams in the applications received via the central admission system. The government will have to provide seats as per demand of colleges and students while trying to seek balance between demand of students and granting of additional divisions to the colleges. Infrastructure for additional seats will also be a challenging task if offline classes start,” Chaudhary said. The high pass percentages scored by students in the secondary school certificate (SSC, std X) examination will change the entire equation this year, with experts finding it difficult to predict how high the cut-offs would go. The former principal of St Mira’s Women’s College, Gulshan Gidwani, said, “I think the percentage of marks that students have got are very misleading. Having got those marks, they perceive themselves to be worthy of applying for the science stream without really knowing what they wish to do in future.” The district vice-president of the association of teaching staff, Prasanna Kotulkar, said, “There were many colleges that asked for additional seats for the science stream, which were approved by the government. However, the government must rethink the approval of additional seats to private colleges as the granted colleges are suffering as a result of it. Students turn towards the private seats and the grantable seats remain vacant and generate surplus teachers, which cannot be accommodated anywhere else.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/most-rise-in-fyjc-seats-for-science/articleshow/85637846.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The images show that filling was done from 96 metres to 129 metres. Dr Sarwath said the artifical island in the lake was a violation of rules. “Telangana government is creating islands inside the FTL of the lake for which no document is available in the public domain nor has the joint committee obtained the same. Islands are being created at the mouth of Kukatpally channel inside the lake from the debris. The photograph evidences show huge land deposits and concretised works under progress inside the Hussainsagar lake,” Dr Sarwath said in the petition. As per the images presented, on May 21 2020 the distance from FTL Pillar 295 to the deposits was 96 metres. On November 1 2020, the images show the distance between the two points had increased to 102.95 metres. On May 30 2021, the images show more deposits and the distance now increased to 129.12 metres. “Comparative extract of satellite imagery indicates an increase of 35m of land expansion inside lake,” said Dr Sarwath. The joint committee appointed by NGT had submitted its report on June 8 with suggestions and objections on the cleaning the lake. The committee’s previous report observed that there was repeated failure of the authorities to repair the sluice gates and surplus weir. In the latest report, the committee had asked the irrigation department to provide requested information about FTL and repair of surplus weir near Viceroy Hotel. “FTL of Hussainsagar has been tampered due to lowering of the weir. The lake bed was exposed and further dumped near the Kukatpally Nalla side and 10 acres had been plotted right inside the FTL,” Dr Sarwath said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/secretariat-debris-filling-up-hussainsagar-plea-in-ngt/articleshow/85640115.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Bank president Alakarswami said the decision was taken after the audit wing found that the official was involved in issuing loans without proper documents. “Once the auditing is completed, we will take further actions,” he said. Sabu has been suspended a day after CPI members released a letter alleging shady deals, including disbursal of loans to fake recipients, by the bank. The banks administrative comprises 11 members — eight belong to CPM and the rest to CPI. In July 2020, CPI members S Chinnaswami, K Paraman and Alphonsa Kalimuth had given a letter to the administrative committee raising several questions and alleged that loans were disbursed to fake recipients. They are yet to get a reply from the committee. CPI Chinnakkanal local secretary A Yesudas said the suspension of the bank secretary showed that the allegations raised by CPI members were true. “In the letter the CPI members asked for details of the dealings of the bank. But the committee refused to provide us a reply. There were no proper title deed lands in the area but the bank disbursed large amounts of loans. Our demand is that the actual details of the land deals must be revealed,” said Yesudas. The government should terminate the administrative committee of the Chinnakkanal service co-operative bank, he said Idukki DCC president Ibrahimkutty Kallar demanded the termination of the bank’s administrative committee. Addressing a Congress protest in front of the bank, Kallar sought a vigilance probe toexpose the malpractices in the bank. “The secretary has been suspended to save the administrative members who led the malpractices. Without the committee’s approval, the secretary cannot take any major decisions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chinnakanal-co-op-bank-secy-suspended-over-loan-fraud/articleshow/85637887.cms||---

Aslam Ismail Lala, 36, was finally caught two days later, on Tuesday night, when he tried to board the return flight to Mumbai using the same documents. Aslam Lala forged his PAN and Aadhaar cards to become Ashfaq Nawab Sheikh, the actual flier. During the search, police in Bareilly found from his possession two Aadhaar cards -- his own and the forged one on the name of Ashfaq Sheikh. Lala was handed over to Bareilly Police. During questioning, he admitted to having forged the documents to use the travel pass of Sheikh. Senior police officers contacted their counterparts in Mumbai to verify Lala’s credentials. The officials in Mumbai were also probing the matter. After an initial investigation, they found that Sheikh, a resident of Andheri in Mumbai, and three other persons had booked flight tickets to attend an Urs of a sufi saint at a famous shrine in Bareilly. “However, a day before their journey, Sheikh fell ill and decided to stay back. Since the tickets were non-refundable, a decision was made to take Aslam Lala, a resident of Navi Mumbai, on Sheikh’s boarding pass. Sheikh shared his PAN and Aadhaar cards which were scanned to prepare a lookalike copy with Lala’s photo,” a senior police officer said. Lala then managed to dodge the security officers at Mumbai airport and boarded the flight to Bareilly on Sunday, said senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Bareilly, Rohit Singh Sajwan. The Urs concluded on Tuesday. Lala, along with other members of the group, reached Bareilly airport at night to board the return flight. But, this time, he wasn’t that lucky. SSP Sajwan told TOI, “We have completed a thorough investigation and found that Lala came on the flight ticket booked in the name of Sheikh to attend an Urs in Bareilly. Since Sheikh had withdrawn his name from the trip owing to medical reasons, the group didn’t want the tickets to go to waste as they were non-refundable. Then Lala forged the documents, which is an offence. He has been booked under the sections of section 420 (cheating), 467 (forging a document), 468 (committing forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (dishonestly using forged documents as genuine) of IPC."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/mumbai-man-36-flies-to-bareilly-on-someone-elses-ticket-caught-during-return-flight/articleshow/85635079.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||Drafting of wards for civic polls to start tomorrow||Pune: The civic bodies in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad would start drafting the wards’ limits (delimitation) from Friday for the municipal corporation polls due next year, following a directive from the state election commission in this regard on Wednesday. “We have got the order for drafting of wards. The Census of 2011 will be considered as the base for it. Each ward will have an elected member,” said Ajit Deshmukh, a senior official of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the coordinator for the civic election process. The state election commission on Wednesday issued the order to begin the ward-drafting process in 18 municipal corporations, including PMC and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), where the polls would be due in February 2022. “The state government introduced one-member ward system instead of multi-member ward system in December 2019 through a notification. So, each ward would have one member,” stated the order. Natural resources such as rivers, mountains and nullahs should be used for defining the boundaries of wards, it stated. Even big roads, lanes and flyovers could be considered as the boundary marks. Precautions should be taken to make sure that one house or society or chawl did not get divided into two different wards, the order stated. The directive stated that a committee would have to be constituted for the delimitation process. It would be responsible for any mistakes “It was seen in many elections that the delimitation was carried out under political pressure. This led to mistakes and writ petitions were filed. The committee would be answerable for such flaws,” stated the directive.  Along with total population, caste-wise bifurcation would be made available before drafting the draft voters’ list. This data would be used for finalising the reservations and other formalities about voters’ registration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drafting-of-wards-for-civic-polls-to-start-tomorrow/articleshow/85637863.cms||---

Being implemented as a conservation and rehabilitation approach to food and farming systems and to enhance resilience to climate change, it focuses on topsoil regeneration, increasing biodiversity and improving the water cycle. The officials said that the demo plots under the names Agro Ecological Farming Systems (AEFS) and Vriksha Ayurvedam are giving promising results. “The yield is pretty good yet the input costs are lower from our documentation in the demo plots. Above all the food is very tasty. It is a scientific fact that when the crop is high in nutrition, the food becomes tasty. Under the 100-day programme, for the first time the department is working on an ambitious target of starting the conversion of 25,000 hectares into such chemical-free healthy farming. The department is planning to promote all of such plots as training plots,” said department of agriculture director K Vasuki. Selected yield from this kind of farming were put up for sale in Onam markets. “Regenerative agriculture is not a specific practice itself. Rather, proponents of regenerative agriculture utilize a variety of other sustainable agriculture techniques. Permaculture, agroecology, agroforestry, restoration ecology, keyline design and holistic management are some of the practices that come under this approach,” adds Vasuki. A team of experts from Andhra Pradesh conducted training for the programme. The department of agriculture has embarked on a lot of such sustainable methods of farming to promote these chemical-free and environment-friendly farming methods across the state under the Project Subhiksham Surakshitham – BPKP (Bharatiya Prakartik Krishi Padhathi). The basic concept of this farming is that commercial farming can be done by using locally available and farm-based resources without any yield penalty. ‘Subhiksham Surakshitham’ project proposes to implement fully eco-friendly cultivation in 84,000 hectares in the state in phases. At the block level, the project is implemented through a total of 168 clusters. A cluster will cover at least 500 hectares. For this up to Rs 26.52 lakh is provided to a cluster. The project aims to form organic villages and to promote eco-friendly farming at low cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/regenerative-farming-yields-positive-results/articleshow/85637851.cms||---

Following Jaipal Singh’s complaint, Tanda police booked Riyaz for kidnapping and shooting and arrested him shortly after. Riyaz, however, turned out to be a physically challenged person that turned the needle of suspicion towards the complainant. “The case looked suspicious since the beginning, yet we booked and arrested Riyaz on Tuesday following the complaint,” said Rampur superintendent of police Ankit Mittal. “During the interrogation, however, Riyaz was found to be 80% physically disabled and could hardly move.” “A police team was then assigned the case. They cracked the case successfully and recovered the boy, who was kept hidden by his father,” said the SP. Elaborating further, Mittal said: “Jaipal had shot himself in his hand to framed Riyaz, who had been repeatedly asking for the money he had given to Jaipal. But, Jailpal was dilly-dallying over returning the money.” Villagers, meanwhile, told police that Jaipal, who would collect money from villagers on the pretext of helping economically weaker eligible women in solemnising their marriage, had also taken money from Riyaz, who wanted his money back. To get rid of Riyaz, Jaipal had concocted a story to frame the former but was caught into his own trap, they told police. The SP added, “Jaipal was booked under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 182 (false information, with intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person), 193 (punishment for false evidence), 211 (false charge of offence made with intent to injure) and 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Apparently, it has been revealed that one of the accused had heard Vairagi’s friend asking him, “What will you do with a cupboard full of money?” Based on this information, the accused along with his friends planned the kidnapping. The accused have been on the run for the last year. Police arrested Dipesh Patel, Rohan Patel, Kalpesh Patel and Lalit Patel. Police said that the accused wanted to make quick money and got the idea of kidnapping from television serials and movies. Police recovered two cars and other valuables from the accused worth Rs 3.53 lakh. “One accused went to buy medicines from Vairagi a few days before the kidnapping. He heard a man telling Vairagi, about the former having cupboard full of money.

---||India||SC remark prompts West Bengal to put brakes on Pegasus panel||NEW DELHI: As the Supreme Court said it would not be fair for a West Bengal government-appointed Commission of Inquiry to continue its probe in the Pegasus snooping controversy while the court is examining the issue, the state government on Wednesday assured the court that the panel headed by ex-SC judge M B Lokur will hold its hand and not proceed. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the state, responded after a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice Surya Kant said it wanted the Commission to "maintain restraint" as the matter is pending before the court. The court was hearing a PIL filed by 'Global Village Foundation Public Charitable Trust' challenging the West Bengal government's decision to appoint the Commission to inquire into the alleged snooping scandal. The bench said the PIL is connected with other petitions seeking court-monitored independent probe into the Pegasus controversy and all be heard together. As the petitions filed by activists, journalists and others are listed for the next week, the bench directed that the PIL be tagged with those petitions and all would be heard together. Justifying its decision to appoint a Commission of Inquiry, the state government contended it was done to ensure that the fundamental right to privacy of constitutional functionaries, including members of the judiciary, police, bureaucrats, journalists, prominent members of civil society and MLAs in West Bengal, has not been compromised. "It is submitted that if revelations arising from ‘Pegasus’ spyware controversy have even a scintilla of truth ,it can have the potential of disrupting the functioning of public institutions which form the bedrock of the state," it said. Questioning the motive behind filing of the PIL, the state government said in its affidavit that the petition has a political motive and "trustee and chairman of the petitioner, one Balram Nandwani, has close associations with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an affiliate of the RSS". "It cannot be disputed that RSS and Swadeshi Jagran Manch and the ruling party at the Centre, Bharatya Janta Party, are affiliates and have often vilified the state government for political gains. Further, given the fact that higher echelons of BJP have either publicly expressed their disapproval over the need for any independent inquiry on the ‘Pegasus’ issue or have been conspicuously silent on the subject matter, despite massive public uproar, the legitimacy of the petitioner’s claim for any inquiry into the matter is cast in serious doubt," said the affidavit, filed by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-remark-prompts-west-bengal-to-put-brakes-on-pegasus-panel/articleshow/85643521.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The suggestion made by the NHAI officials to provide free passes to motorists living within five km radius of the toll booth was also rejected by the protesters. Though the toll collection began on Wednesday morning at 8am, it was soon stopped after protests. DYFI activists too joined the protest on Wednesday by taking out a march to the toll booth. Meanwhile, with the senior leaderships of major political fronts interfering in the matter, the agitation seems to intensify in the coming days. The Congress has launched an indefinite agitation under the leadership of Kovalam MLA M Vincent, and former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala will join the protestors at Thiruvallam on Thursday at 9 am. Education Minister V Sivankutti, who is the legislator from Nemom constituency in which the new toll plaza is located, has also intervened in the issue. He has written to Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari seeking to stop the toll collection until the works of the bypass stretch is completed. Only the first phase of the bypass, from Kazhakootam to Mukkola has been completed now. The works of the second phase, from Mukkola to Karode, are still on. In a statement issued here on Wednesday, Sivankutti also urged Union Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor to intervene in the matter and address the concerns of the public in the proximity of the toll plaza. Speaking to TOI, Kovalam MLA M Vincent said the offer made by the NHAI to grant free passes to the residents within five km of the toll plaza is not acceptable. “Residents of as many as nine villages are directly affected by the toll collection and not all of them come under this 5-km radius,” the MLA said. He added that though the NHAI has widened the bypass road, the unscientific way of works have resulted in traffic snarls at Thiruvallam, something which was never there for the past 35 years. These problems must also be solved, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/toll-collection-at-thiruvallam-stalled-again/articleshow/85637894.cms||---

The Lonikand police identified the deceased as Vinod Kumar (37) from Kathewadi in Wagholi. Assistant inspector Shivshant Khose said on Wednesday that Kumar had collected milk from Navhare and delivered it at Aundh. “He was going home when the driver of a speeding truck coming from the opposite direction lost control over the vehicle and collided head on with the van at 5am,” said Khose. Kumar and the truck driver both sustained serious injuries. The doctor treating Kumar later told a relative that he succumbed to head injuries around 1.10am on Wednesday. “The truck driver has been booked under the IPC and Motor Vehicles Act on charges of causing death due to negligence,” said the police officer. Man dies as 2-wheeler hits stone A 72-year-old security guard, Baban Mohite, who was driving home on his two-wheeler, died after the vehicle hit a stone on Bavdi road in Wagholi late on Monday.

---||Mumbai||Beer regains its fizz, booze consumption picks up too in Mumbai Metropolitan Region||MUMBAI: When banking professionals Vini Mathew and Ujwala Khot recently hosted a party at a SoBo bar to celebrate their job anniversaries, a majority of their guests preferred to drink beer. Khot said since people could not enjoy it during the Covid-19 lockdown, it was the spirit of choice at the party. Another reason beer was trending at the party was because home deliveries were unable to maintain the temperature at which beer is consumed, said Mathew. Beer consumption took a huge beating last year when the pandemic broke out. After the national lockdown came into effect in the last week of March 2020, home delivery of liquor was allowed from May 15-20 onwards. However, consumption in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) remained less than half in June and July as compared to the same period in 2019 as people didn’t want to risk consuming chilled drinks fearing susceptibility to the virus. Surprisingly, this year though beer consumption halved in April and May following the lockdown, it picked up in June and July and is way better than what it was in the same period last year. Overall, liquor consumption in MMR in 2021 has gone up as compared to 2020 (see graphic) with the industry hoping a third Covid wave doesn’t disrupt public life and consumption figures return to pre-pandemic times. Owner of Hariyali restaurant and bar in Wadala, Shivanand Shetty, said delayed permissions to bars for online sales and shutdown of dining services in 2020 resulted in large stocks of beer reaching expiry. “Other than the scare of Covid, this news added fuel to the fire,” he said, pointing out that stocking beer and serving it chilled has been an issue with home deliveries. However, people are now enjoying beer in bars like the pre-Covid period, he added. Owner of Maharaja chain of restaurants, Pradeep Shetty, also attributed the drive in demand for booze to greater clarity about the disease among people, administrators in the government as well as doctors. “Last year people were confused. Since there is more clarity about the disease now obviously there is more consumption,” he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-beer-regains-its-fizz-booze-consumption-picks-up-too/articleshow/85640181.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

---||Aurangabad||Renewed demand for rail underpass at Shivajinagar||Aurangabad: Citizens of Satara and Deolai have renewed the demand for construction of rail underpass at Shivajinagar Level Crossing (LC) gates in the wake of South Central Railway (SCR) targeting completion of 100 Rail over Bridge (RoB) and Rail under Bridge (RuB) during the current fiscal. After eliminating all unmanned LC gates within its jurisdiction, the SCR has now focused on manned LC gates. SCR general manager Gajanan Mallya during a recent review meeting has ordered elimination of 100 LC gates by the end of the current financial year in keeping with the target set by the Railway Board. Stating that their demand for constructing a rail underpass was falling on deaf ears, the affected residents said the SCR top-brass must consider removal of LC gates at Shivajinagar on priority basis. “We daily witness traffic jams as the LC gate at Shivajinagar is closed on multiple occasions for movement of trains. While a similar issue at nearby Sangram Nagar was addressed a few years ago, we have been made to wait for resolving the issue at Shivajinagar for years now,” Vijay Sable, a resident of Deolai area, said. So far, the SCR has constructed 14 RuBs and three RoBs by te end of July. The SCR had removed all unmanned LG gates on the zone by October 2018 itself. Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel, on August 2, had met the chairman of the Railway Board Suneet Sharma to press for constructing of RuB at Shivajinagar. SCR public relations officer for Nanded division Rajesh Shinde said the proposal for RuB at Shivajinagar has already forwarded to the Railway Board. “Once the proposal gets a sanction from the Railway Board, the work of removing LC gates at Shivajinagar will start,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/renewed-demand-for-rail-underpass-at-shivajinagar/articleshow/85637904.cms||Prasad Joshi

The stolen property included Rs9 lakh in cash that the trader, Jetharam Joshi (48), had kept at home for his son’s marriage, police said. Senior inspector Shankar Khatke of the Warje police told TOI on Wednesday, “Based on the statements by some witnesses and the footage of a CCTV camera installed on the road outside the apartment building, we suspect the theft to be the handiwork of a man and two women.

Joshi said he was returning to his garment store on Tuesday but was unable to lock the main entrance door due to some glitch. He locked the security grille from outside and left.

---||Madurai||HC grants bail to couple in child trafficking racket case||Madurai: The Madras high court on Tuesday granted bail to a couple who illegally adopted a child in a case involving child trafficking and illegal adoption by an NGO Idhayam Trust at Madurai district. The court was hearing the bail plea of Sahubar Sathik and Anish Rani, who were arrested by the Tallakulam police on July 1. According to the prosecution, a woman who was unable to maintain her three children handed them over to an orphanage run by Idhayam Trust in March. In June, the trust director G R Shivakumar and his associate Mathershaw made the woman believe that her younger son died due to Covid-19 on June 21. It was also informed that final rites were performed at Thathaneri. When a police complaint was lodged in this regard, it came to light that the NGO had sold the child to Sathik and Rani. The NGO members had also sold a girl child to another couple. Following this, police registered a case against nine people, including the petitioners and arrested them. Police also rescued the children and handed them over to their biological parents. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that the petitioners got married in 2007 and made several applications to hospitals, trusts and orphanages to adopt a child. Similarly, they have approached the Idhayam Trust and expressed their willingness to adopt a child legally. He submitted that the members of the NGO came to the petitioners’ home and entrusted the child, stating that all the formalities for adoption will be done legally within a month, since the courts are not functioning . Believing their words, the petitioners went ahead with the adoption. Taking into account the fact that the petitioners adopted the child by believing that legal procedures were followed, justice B Pugalendhi granted bail to them with certain conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-grants-bail-to-couple-in-child-trafficking-racket-case/articleshow/85640184.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Police give clean chit to forests and wildlife minister A K Saseendran||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The police have given a clean chit to forests and wildlife minister A K Saseendran in the complaint that the minister tried to suppress a molestation case, without informing the police, to save his party’s local leader. In the report by DSP (Sasthamcotta) to SP (Kollam rural), it has been said that the minister did not call or speak directly to the survivor in the case. On examination of call detail records of the survivor’s father and that of the minister, it is clear that the minister spoke to the survivor’s father once on July 4 this year. On examination of the voice clip of this conversation, it cannot be inferred that the minister threatened the survivor or tried to suppress the complaint. The minister can be heard saying that the matter should be “settled amicably” and also that it should be “settled without any difficulty”. There is no mention of the survivor’s name or anything against the survivor in the minister’s conversation, the police report said. “Under these circumstances, no crime as stated in the Indian Penal Code will hold good in this subject and therefore no further action is required in the complaint filed by advocate Sajal,” the police said. Police said that the complainant Sajal had not spoken to the survivor or her father, and his complaint was solely on the basis of whatever he saw on television channels in this regard. Earlier, district government pleader and public prosecutor, Kollam, R Sethunathan Pillai, had given a legal opinion that the connotation in the minister’s conversation that the matter should be “settled amicably” is not illegal. There was no mention of the survivor’s name or anything against the survivor in the minister’s words. Neither was there any pressure from the minister to withdraw the complaint nor was the tone threatening, the legal opinion had said. The complainant, a native of Kundara in Kollam, had petitioned the police on June 28 this year against two persons who had tried to defame her in a group titled “NCP Kollam”. The complainant also alleged that one of the two persons — Padmakaran— had tried to physically assault her. Since both the complainant’s father and the accused are NCP activists, the minister, who is an NCP leader in the state, had spoken to the father over the phone, and asked him to settle the dispute amicably. The minister’s intervention in the matter had become a controversy, and the opposition had raised the matter in the assembly on July 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-give-clean-chit-to-saseendran/articleshow/85638001.cms||---

President of UGDP, Jorson Fernandes charged the government with “fooling” the electorate with tall promises “even when the household water which is being supplied is laced with microplastics” as pointed out in a study undertaken by CSIR-NIO and Toxics Link. “Instead of taking appropriate measures to reduce and even contain the potentially hazardous microplastics in the water being supplied by the PWD to Goan households, the government skirted the need to tackle the problem at its source which is to identify the major source of marine pollution due to their toxic potential threat,” Fernandes said. He said that the government sidelined the main issue and resorted to freebies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/free-water-a-poll-gimmick-says-ugdp/articleshow/85637974.cms||---

The flower festival will be on till October 15 and those planning to visit on the weekends will have to make prior online bookings. All necessary preparations have been completed and a team of over 100 local volunteers has been deployed on the plateau to manage the crowd of visitors.

Currently around 29 different species of flowers have bloomed in the area. A total of 3,000 visitors will be allowed in three batches — from 7am to 11am, 11am to 3pm and 3pm to 6pm. He added, “On weekdays, on the spot tickets can be bought. Entry fee will be Rs 100 for every individual. Children below 5 years won’t be charged. This time, to avoid rush of senior citizens, we will be charging tickets for tthe senior citizens as well. The volunteers have been deployed to carry out parking, security, and ticketing activities and to implement Covid safety norms. Visitors will also have to follow all the rules while visiting the plateau.” Nature lovers are excited with the plateau opening after two years.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Sahithy Vani a smash hit among students||Thiruvananthapuram: An internet radio ‘Sahithy Vani 1.14’, which was launched during Covid imposed lockdown, by the city students has become a hit among the listeners. Aiming to make the students spend their lockdown days in a creative and fruitful way, the radio was launched in November 2020. The radio which started with just 14 members now has nearly 120 members. Recently, it earned a place in the Incredible Book of Records for being the world’s first radio run by children. The idea of an internet radio run by students was first mooted by Binny Sahithy, founder of Sahithy, a voluntary international organisation, who is also a school radio consultant and a teacher at St Mary’s HSS Pattom. “The idea behind the radio was to introduce a revolution among the schoolchildren. Besides helping to develop the creativity of students, they learn how to express matters in a precise manner,” said Binny. Alu Krishna, a class XI student of Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, and station director, says the activities of the radio have helped them to engage themselves during the lockdown period. “Now we have 17 segments. The two-hour long episodes will be aired on Sundays by 11.00 am and the links are sent to nearly 300 schools,” she said. The radio is noted for its wide range of programmes completely prepared, presented and edited by students. Besides news, they also air interesting segments on literature, interviews, music, cookery, travelogue, beauty programmes introducing the state’s 14 districts and environment. Students of classes III to XII from across the state and Malayalam speaking students from foreign countries form the members and presenters of Sahithy Vani. Aalok P Prapanch, a class XII student of St Mary’s HSS, who is the chief programme director, says he enjoys being a part of this radio.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sahithy-vani-a-smash-hit-among-students/articleshow/85637949.cms||---

Non-submission of statutory returns/records is an offence punishable under the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, and provides for imprisonment up to one year and or fine up to Rs 4,000. “Two cases have been filed in the court of judicial magistrate, Aurangabad by the regional office of EPFO. Inquiries are under way against the two industries. Till date, the employers of these establishments concerned have failed to submit the returns/records called as per summon issued in the year 2015 despite being offered various opportunities under the principle of natural justice,” regional provident fund commissioner Ramesh Kumar said. Enforcement officer Mukteshwar Vyas has filed cases against the two employers concerned as per the sanction of prosecution accorded by Kumar. “We have urged the employers of the defaulting establishments to strictly comply with the provisions of the law in order to avoid any unpleasant action and ensure submission of records under the ongoing inquires without further delay,” EPFO authorities have said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/epfo-invokes-action-against-2-industries/articleshow/85637923.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nod sought for hiring 50 firemen on contract basis||Nagpur: Following the state government’s reluctance to fill vacant posts, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s fire and emergency services department has decided to hire firemen on contract basis. The department, in a proposal submitted before the standing committee, stated that at least 285 posts of firemen are vacant. With the current manpower, the department is under pressure to attend emergency calls in the city. Hence, it has sought the panel’s nod to earmark Rs1.20 crore per annum towards payment to fire personnel to be appointed on contract basis. The proposal will be discussed in the panel’s meeting on August 27. According to the proposal, the department has already obtained permission from the fire and electric consultative committee on June 5, 2020 to fill the vacant posts by hiring 50 fire personnel on contractual basis. Subsequently, the department had approached the divisional commissioner’s office for approval, which advised that the request be routed after the standing committee’s nod. If sanctioned, each fireman will get a monthly honorarium of Rs20,000. Other proposals which will come up for discussion include electric department seeking nod to entrust M/s Orient Trade Link, Nagpur, for erecting street light poles and replacing sodium vapor lamps with LED lamps at a cost of Rs3.89 crore. The firm had quoted 67.5% below the project cost. The property tax department has submitted a proposal seeking revision of pay and parking charges in four vegetable markets across the city — Netaji Market (Sitabuldi), Super Market (Sitabuldi), Budhwari Weekly Bazaar (Somwaripeth) and Mahal Badkas Chowk Parking Plaza. Quoting parking policy of 2016, the department expects to earn over Rs28 lakh per annum and has sought the panel’s nod to issue e-tender for appointing firms to operate pay and park in these four market areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nod-sought-for-hiring-50-firemen-on-contract-basis/articleshow/85638044.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Ahmedabad||Garbage war: Babus rubbish each other’s views||Ahmedabad: A man in his late 30s, wearing a mask, arrived at a Sector-5 shopping centre in Gandhinagar in an unmarked hatchback car on Wednesday and sneaked into a citizens’ group meeting. He did not remain incognito for long as some group members recognized him as municipal commissioner Dhaval Patel. For the past fortnight, Gandhinagar’s citizens and the municipal corporation have been locked in a bitter battle over waste segregation. The Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC) had refused to pick waste from homes that did not segregate waste. Citizens, more than half of whom are secretariat employees, remain adamant that unless the GMC provides new bins for individual homes, they won’t segregate the waste. Members of the Gandhinagar Shaher Vasahat Mahasangh had met on Wednesday to chalk out a plan. After a brief welcome for Patel, Kesrisinh Bihola, the president of the group, charged up and appealed for the launch of a ‘Jan Andolan’, a public protest against the GMC diktat. The tussle between the GMC and citizens began on August 15 when the GMC commissioner announced that municipal sanitation workers will not collect garbage from homes unless it is segregated into wet and dry waste. Patel had ordered the solid waste department to avoid homes and societies that provide mixed waste. Sanitation workers strictly implemented his order and this led to a clash between citizens and sanitation workers. TOI’s calls and a text message to the GMC commissioner remained unanswered. “The GMC had distributed garbage bins way back in 2017, most of which are broken now. Our only demand is for new garbage bins for free from the GMC and we will begin waste segregation,” Bihola said. He added that citizens had made several written and oral requests to the GMC, but these were in vain. “Patel gave a small speech on the importance of waste segregation. But as it ended, we requested the commissioner once again for free bins. He categorically rejected the request,” Bihola said. “This is not done. We pay property tax which includes the door-to-door garbage collection service charge. If we pay these charges diligently, how can the civic authority go back on its promise?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/garbage-war-babus-rubbish-each-others-views/articleshow/85638063.cms||---
---||Delhi||The fourth element: Why voice against extra year is so shrill||NEW DELHI: Students seeking admission in Delhi University next year should be prepared to spend one more year in their undergraduate classes. The New Education Policy stipulates a four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP) rather than the three years as of now, and this proposal was cleared by the university’s Academic Council on Tuesday for implementation from the 2022 academic year. Under the four-year structure, students are expected to carry out research in the last year of the course. Students also have the choice of entry and exits at various points in the four-year period This is the second time that DU is opting for FYUP, the first time being in 2013 before it was scrapped a year later. The opposition to the structure then had much to do with the then vice-chancellor, Dinesh Singh, introducing it without wide discussions among teachers and students. Similar concerns are being expressed this time too. Protesting teachers point out that FYUP places an extra burden on the students, which could force them to opt out with a lower degree. Others suggest that dual degrees should be given to students who complete the four years. There are also worries about the first two years being diluted academically. NEP suggests ‘value-addition courses’ such as social and emotional learning, innovation, and entrepreneurship during these years. In 2013, there were similar offerings called foundation courses. S P Agarwal, principal of Ramanujan College and member of the NEP implementation committee, said that this FYUP was differently structured than the 2013 one. “This time, fourth year students will have two choices. They can have two semesters of some minor papers and research culminating in a thesis or have one semester devoted to research and another to discipline-specific electives,” said Agarwal. Debraj Mookerjee, English teacher at Ramjas College, however, argued, “The extra year burdens the students, but does it really add value? If you are adding value at the bottom of the class, you are making up for what you missed in school education level. Make school education span 13 years to cover the basics of all subjects. Why are you pushing the burden of the school education system on higher education?” Mookerjee said the fourth year should be purely a research year. He added, “A student should be able to make the exit with a dual major, based on intersectionality and final year specialisation, say an English honours degree with another one for business. This will prove the real value of the four-year system.” Teachers also feel that discipline-specific study that took three years is now being unnecessarily prolonged to four. “It is absurd,” exclaimed Mithuraaj Dhusia, AC member who raised this concern in Monday’s meeting of DU’s standing committee on academic affairs. “It only means that the student’s knowledge of his chosen honours subject after four years will be exactly the same as that of a current student after three years. Thus, for students who don’t opt for research in the fourth year, it is a total waste from the perspective of the honours subject.” The fear of students exiting with a lower degree permitted by the multiple entry-exit scheme is also a worry. “The government says the students can undertake one-year, two-year degree courses, but don’t they become ineligible for higher studies?” asked Mookerjee. “The only objective of such a system seems to be to create a workforce.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-fourth-element-why-voice-against-extra-year-is-so-shrill/articleshow/85638032.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Kochi||CPM panel records statement of Devikulam former MLA||Idukki: The CPM probe panel into the alleged lapses in election campaigning, collected statements of former Devikulam MLA S Rajendran. Earlier, CPM district secretariat has deputed a commission of CPM district secretariat members V M Mohanan and C V Varghese to probe the allegations. The commission on Wednesday collected the statement from Rajendran. Reacting to the probe, Rajendran said that he was not known to be a leader of a particular caste. “For the last twenty years, I have been a popular face of CPM in Munnar and not on the basis of any caste. A CPM leader can’t work under the label of a caste,” said Rajendran. “The rumors that I joined CPI are baseless. I am known to be a CPM leader and have no plan to move to any other party. I suspect that some groups within the party are working to sideline me,” he said. Earlier, CPM Munnar, Marayoor and Adimali area committees had stated before the inquiry commission that Rajendran tried to defeat party candidates under the banner of caste. The probe commission was appointed over allegations that Rajenderan did not actively participate in election campaigning at Devikulam constituency. Rajendran, a three-time MLA from Devikulam, expected another chance to contest from the constituency. When it was denied, he was unwilling to campaign and CPM district secretary KK Jayachandran had to take over, said party sources.

The court was hearing a petition filed in 2020 by Rathinam, a resident of Andipatti in Theni district who sought for compensation, as his son Chokkar was kept under illegal confinement for over nine months at the Madurai Central Prison despite the fact that the HC while hearing an appeal had acquitted him in 2019. The state public prosecutor Hasan Mohammed Jinnah informed the court that he had a discussion with the home secretary in order to prevent such incidents in the future. He stated that he had suggested appointing prosecutors or legal aid counsels at all the central prisons to go through the court orders and give instructions to the prison officials. He stated that the government is considering the same. The state public prosecutor informed that the petitioner’s son who did not move an appeal was also acquitted by the HC, his name was not mentioned in the order copy but was just mentioned as the second accused. Though the mistake was not intentional, disciplinary action was initiated against the then superintendent and jailor of Madurai Central Prison. Taking cognizance of the submissions, Justice G Ilangovan directed the state to file a report on the action initiated on the officials for the lapse committed in this case and also on the steps to be taken by the government in future to avoid such frequent occurrences in the future. The case was adjourned to September 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/state-may-post-legal-aid-counsels-to-assist-prison-officials/articleshow/85640193.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Goa||Consumer panel at standstill after govt fails to fill up posts||Panaji: Leaving aggrieved consumers in the lurch, the government has failed to fill up the posts of member and president of the Goa State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.The three-member commission was able to continue judicial functioning with two members after the president, Justice U V Bakre retired last year, but since February this year, when a second member retired, all proceedings have come to a standstill. TOI has learnt that the single member doesn’t satisfy the legal requirement of a quorum, and as a result cannot hold hearings or pass interim or final orders. Since the government has neither filled up the two vacant posts nor appointed the single member as acting president, the commission is unable to hear oral arguments, pass interim or final orders, thus denying justice to consumers. “It’s not that the government was unaware the members were retiring. They should have acted well in advance. They have two options before them — to appoint the single member as acting or officiating president or advertise the posts,” a distressed consumer told TOI, adding that with the code of conduct likely to be enforced in a few months, the problem could persist if immediate action is not taken. The commission without a quorum has only been receiving affidavits, written arguments, etc, from parties, but has been unable to proceed further with cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/consumer-panel-at-standstill-after-govt-fails-to-fill-up-posts/articleshow/85638056.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The court was hearing the third bail application filed by Elangamani, who was arrested by the Seevalaperi police in Tirunelveli district on April 22. According to the prosecution, Chidambaram, priest of the Sudalai Madasamy Temple at Seevalaperi near Palayamkottai was murdered on April 18 in a dispute over the temple properties among two communities. Several people, including the petitioner, who was the village headman, were arrested. Justice B Pugalendhi observed that the petitioner’s first bail application was dismissed by this court on June 18. The petitioner had filed his second bail application on June 22. . The sessions court granted bail to the petitioner on July 2. The judge observed that when this court took cognizance of the suppression while hearing his second bail application, it had directed the sessions court to cancel his bail and the same was cancelled on July 9. The petitioner appears to have surrendered and filed this third bail application before this court. The judge observed that the deceased was brutally attacked by the accused as he had sustained 26 injuries all over his body and died on the spot. The offence is of very serious nature and the substantial portion of the investigation is yet to be completed the judge said and dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-rejects-bail-plea-of-murder-accused-for-hiding-fact/articleshow/85640220.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The court also insisted that the officials pave the way for pedestrians to use the footpaths without any hurdles. Warning the commissioners of severe consequences for failing to comply with an earlier order of the court, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy gave two weeks’ time to them to comply with the order now. While rejecting the ‘eyewash’ reports furnished to the court, the bench asked GHMC counsel Pasham Krishna Reddy to stop offering frivolous excuses for gross failure of the officials. The bench also found fault with their submission because the officials had failed to execute what the court had asked them to do in the last seven months. “They are trying to hoodwink the court with ambiguous affidavits. They will have to face repercussions,” the bench warned. The bench, in its last hearing of a PIL filed by advocate Mamidala Thirumal Rao, sought detailed action taken reports from the deputy commissioners of GHMC, who were acting as incharges for these zones. All their reports carried a common line that they were monitoring 58 road stretches in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/what-was-done-to-free-city-footpaths-hc/articleshow/85640230.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Delhi||Delhi University drops stories of dalit writers from English syllabus||NEW DELHI: ‘Draupadi’, a story by Mahashweta Devi, and the writings of Bama Faustina Soosairaj and Sukirtharani, both Tamil dalit feminist writers, were removed from the English syllabus in Delhi University. Despite the resistance of 15 elected members, the Academic Council, which met on Tuesday, approved the chop. Some teachers expressed surprise at this decision of the university’s oversight committee which they allege had no representatives from the English department, the head of the department being only a special invitee. The panel considers syllabus changes that are contentious. TimesViewSyllabi keep changing. But the dropping of these stories reveals a disturbing pattern. These stories provide an alternate way of looking at classics and help us form a varied and more nuanced understanding of them. There’s beauty in diversity, especially in literature. Those framing the syllabus shouldn't overlook that.Mithuraaj Dhusiya, AC member who signed the dissent note on the syllabus change, claimed, “The restructuring of the syllabus has been ongoing and has been democratically done at various levels. A year ago, the AC formed the oversight committee to look at controversial syllabus changes. But the committee does not have a locus standi to alter anything. There were political reasons for removing certain texts. We 15 elected members expressed dissent, but the English changes were still approved.” The dissent note reads, “In a core paper titled Women’s Writing in semester V, the oversight committee has committed the maximum vandalism. It first decided to remove two dalit authors, namely Bama and Sukirtharani, who were replaced by upper-caste writer Ramabai. Second, the committee, as an afterthought, suddenly asked for the deletion of the celebrated short story of Mahasweta Devi, ‘Draupadi’.” M K Pandit, chairman of the oversight committee, asserted, “The oversight committee is appointed by the Executive Council, the highest decision-making body of the university, and is an empowered committee. This panel has been working for over six years now and was specifically created to look at matters of syllabuses particularly when the AC and EC meetings aren’t held." Dhusiya described ‘Draupadi’ as a seminal text discussing the exploitation of tribal women. “It is in the syllabus since 1999 and is a part of the UGC template. We don’t know why DU removed it,” she said. ‘Sultana’s Dreams’, a short story, has replaced it. The dissent note added, “In a discipline-specific elective paper titled ‘Pre-colonial Indian Literatures’, the oversight committee has instructed the department to replace ‘Chandrabati Ramayana’ with Tulsidas, thus removing a feminist reading of the Ramayana. Similarly, in another DSE paper titled ‘Interrogating Queerness’, the committee has arbitrarily deleted sections from the units at the expense of the academic rigour of the paper.” In 2019, there was controversy over the removal and alteration of English texts on the riots in Gujarat and Muzaffarnagar from the reading list. In history too, there was an objection to Naxalism being taught as part of the ‘Democracy at Work’ paper. In sociology, a chapter from Nandini Sundar’s Subalterns and Sovereign: An Anthropological History of Bastar ran into trouble, but was later retained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-drops-stories-of-dalit-writers-from-eng-syllabus/articleshow/85638077.cms||Shradha Chettri

Chairperson of South Goa ZP Suvarna Tendulkar told reporters after the meeting that some 2-3 sites have been identified for setting up a zilla panchayat bhavan through central government funds. The demand for construction of an independent zilla panchayat bhavan first came to the fore in late 2010. The then ZP body led by Maria Rebello had constituted a committee to identify and shortlist suitable sites for the zilla panchayat building. Though some 5,000 sq of land at Ambaji was identified for the purpose, the proposal remained grounded and later forgotten. Members have now expressed their resolve to pursue the proposal afresh with renewed determination, and a resolution in that regard was unanimously passed at the meeting. With the current South Goa ZP body consisting of several new members, the difficulties faced by them in getting ahead with development proposals were discussed at the meeting with a view to resolving them. Various proposals for development works were also put forth at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-zilla-bhavan-plan-back-in-focus/articleshow/85638114.cms||---
---||Goa||Tempers flare at Margao civic meet over Rs 8cr unused funds||Margao: Apathy of successive Margao municipality councils — from 2001 to 2016 — in properly utilising development grants has led to the accumulation of unused funds to the tune of Rs 8 crore. The government has told Margao Municipal Council (MMC) to refund the unutilised amount from the grants while allowing it to send a proposal for utilising a part of the unutilised central government grants for development works. The issue came to the fore at the MMC meeting held on Wednesday with councillors, including from the ruling panel, taking to task the chief officer for failing to take timely decisions over the balance fund. The council, it was informed, had time until 2018 for utilising the funds. However, MMC is now in receipt of central government grants from the 14th Finance Commission for undertaking development works amounting to nearly Rs 30 crore. The council intends to utilise these funds for solid waste management works at Sonsoddo, instead of utilising municipal funds for the purpose. The municipal funds thus saved could be used for other development works was the view that gained ground at the meeting. Councillors urged the chief officer to take immediate steps towards inviting expressions of interest from agencies for handling daily incoming waste as also for setting up the proposed biomethanation plant at Sonsoddo. The failure of the council in taking in its possession three garbage trucks despite paying Rs 37 lakh towards the registration fees of the vehicles in 2019 also came to the fore at the meeting. Councillor Damodar Shirodkar and others demanded that the responsibility for the matter be fixed and that the amount recovered from those found guilty. The council, however, vehemently rejected the idea of engaging a lawyer to move the Supreme Court over the issue. The council also unanimously approved a resolution for reserving parking slots for senior citizens and disabled persons at various locations in Margao and Fatorda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tempers-flare-at-margao-civic-meet-over-rs-8cr-unused-funds/articleshow/85638085.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Bamu declares fee waiver due to Covid||Aurangabad: Almost two months after the State Higher and Technical Education Department asked universities to offer a concession to students in fees, among other reliefs during the current pandemic for the academic year 2020-21, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu) has finally made the necessary announcement on Wednesday. Declaring a slew of such measures, Bamu has said that its departments and affiliated colleges should completely waive off fees charged towards hostel facilities, gymkhana, activity charges, medical help, and youth festival, among entities, that were of no use to students during the pandemic situation. Also, the university has asked for offering 50% discount in charges towards laboratories and libraries, said an official release. A decision to this effect is applicable to granted, partially granted and permanently non-granted colleges. Moreover, the university has clarified that no student should be prevented from taking examination if fees for the academic year 2020-21 is due to him or her. The departments and colleges have been asked to allow such defaulter students to pay the fees in three to four instalments. As regards to some of the examinations that could not take place due to Covid-19 in the academic year 2020-21, Bamu has asked for passing on the fees for the next academic year. Also, Bamu has decided to completely waive off the fees for all students who have lost their parents due to Covid-19. Bamu has around 428 affiliated colleges having a combined student population of 4.44 lakh, who will be benefiting from the waiver and concession in fees. Student activist Tukaram Saraf said Bamu should ensure that all relief measures declared for students in the wake of the pandemic situation should not remain on the paper. “The university should set up a help-desk for students who could face issues in getting different waivers and concessions in fees. A section of affiliated colleges may be reluctant in offering such benefits to students and therefore related complaints must be addressed effectively,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bamu-declares-fee-waiver-due-to-covid/articleshow/85632573.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Ngp-Mum Samruddhi Mahamarg car trip to cost as much as a flight ticket||Nagpur: For a single person travelling by car from Nagpur to Mumbai on the Samruddhi Mahamarg, the costs including fuel and toll Rs1,160 would add up to as much as a one-way flight ticket. Though excited by the prospect of fast road journey, the majority feel the toll will be too high. TOI had reported on August 21 the statement of joint managing director of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) Anilkumar Gaikwad, that toll for one-way journey will be around Rs1,100 on the expressway, which is being built at a cost of Rs55,000 crore. With Rs1.65 per km toll as per central government guidelines, total toll over the 701km expressway would be around Rs1,157. Public works minister Eknath Shinde during his visit to the project a couple of days ago had said speed limit would be 150 km per hour. At an average of 20 km per litre for a diesel car, cost of fuel would be around Rs3,325. Thus, total cost will be Rs4,482 for one-way trip. The cost per head will reduce in case multiple people travel in the car. A car trip is likely to take 6-7 hours. When it comes to airways, one-way fare is around Rs4,500 and travel time is around 1.5 hours. By Duronto train, 3rd AC fare is Rs1,890 and sleeper class fare is Rs685, and it takes 11.30 hours. BJP MLC Pravin Datke said, “Toll Rs1,160 is expensive for most people. It will not be justified if we calculate toll for this project. Apart from state-of-the-art infrastructure, the expressway will benefit the state and adjoining districts in various ways.” Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe said, “I am against toll for any project. Government is recovering road tax when we purchase a vehicle. Therefore, no question of toll should arise. Also, farmers in large numbers gave their property. Undoubtedly, project is good but toll is not justified.” Past president of NGO Janmanch Pramod Pande too agreed. “Government should rethink and exempt toll. It is the basic responsibility of the government to facilitate roads as it is collecting taxes in various manners,” he said. Organizing secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Grahak Panchayat’s Vidarbha unit Gajanan Pande said, “Project is very good and will be beneficial to people. But toll Rs1,160 is very high and should be reduced to around Rs500. Government should not recover entire cost from people and should subsidize it.” MSRDC has announced toll will be for distance travelled only, and not for the entire road. This will help save some money in case one is not travelling directly from Nagpur to Mumbai but going to districts midway. In reaction to TOI’s story on social media, Busshan Vilas Vighne and Sunny said they would prefer going to Mumbai by Duronto as the toll was too high. Koutuk said toll is much more than flight tickets, and it is a bad idea. MSRDC is yet to officially notify the toll. Shinde had claimed 80% of works were completed on the stretch from Nagpur to Mumbai, and revised deadline is December 2021. The entire road upto Thane will be completed by December 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ngp-mum-samruddhi-mahamarg-car-trip-to-cost-as-much-as-a-flight-ticket/articleshow/85638149.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Ahmedabad||Petrol in Gujarat dearer by 27%, diesel by 22%||AHMEDABAD: Even though the petrol price didn’t touch the psychological high of Rs 100 per litre in Gujarat, it went up by a whopping 27% in a year, adding to the commuting costs of people across the state. Data collated by petroleum dealers suggests that petrol costs surged from Rs 77.91 per litre on July 31, 2020, to Rs 98.59 per litre on July 31, 2021. During the same period, the diesel price also spiked from Rs 79.15 per litre to Rs 96.76 per litre. “Fuel prices have been on the rise over the past four months,” said a city-based petroleum dealer. “The demand improved in June and July this year and sales are at least 10% higher against the July 2020 figures, when the recovery in movement was slow especially after the first lockdown.” In April and May 2021, sales of petrol and diesel remained subdued, thanks to the second wave of Covid-19 that struck the state due to which various restrictions were imposed and people were reluctant to travel. Consequently, as the demand and prices both increased, the tax collection also went up. The data of the state commercial tax department suggests that the VAT collection on non-subsumed items including fuel in Gujarat in July 2021 surged 49% against July 2020 numbers, from Rs 1,593 crore to Rs 2,380 crore. VAT collection also grew 12% month-on-month against Rs 2,124 crore in June 2020. Sources in the state commercial tax department said that the overall consumption has gone up with receding cases of Covid-19. “Economic activity has picked up and as a result transportation as well as individual travel picked up causing an increase in fuel consumption,” said a source. “This led to a surge in VAT collection in July over the same month in the previous year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/petrol-dearer-by-27-diesel-by-22/articleshow/85638195.cms||Niyati Parikh

The couple defaulted on the loan and are currently on the run. Police arrested Kuldeep Khadaksingh Kothari from Delhi on Monday for assisting Chitranjan Vaid and his wife Monica. In April 2016, Chitranjan had applied for a loan and claimed to own assets of Rs 15.10 crore in his name and another Rs 8.11 crores in Monica’s name. The couple informed the company that they were taking the loan to invest in shares. According to the agreement between Vaid and the company, the shares would be kept as the collateral and the couple were also required to maintain a certain amount of security margin on the loan, but it was reduced due to the fall in the prices of shares.  Vaid defaulted on the loan, and during the hearing before the arbitrator, he submitted documents declaring assets of only Rs 35 lakh. Police said Vaid forged the net worth certificate with the help of Kothari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-helps-couple-avail-rs-8cr-loan-with-fake-net-worth-cert-arrested/articleshow/85640309.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Scholar, activist, Begumpura-seeker Omvedt passes away at 81||KOLHAPUR: “Rest in Begumpura, Dr Gail,” a Twitter message read, bidding adieu to scholar-activist Gail Omvedt. ‘Seeking Begumpura’ was one of Omvedt’s seminal scholarly work which refers to a poem by the great bhakti sant Ravidas, who imagined a city without sorrow, with no inequality, no taxes, no torture or harassment, but abundance and freedom for all. Always in search of her own Begumpura, the Minneapolis-born Omvedt arrived in India for her PhD and fell in love with the country. She met her future husband, Bharat Patankar, a doctor, and the two settled down in his village, Kasegaon, in Sangli. Early on Wednesday, Omvedt breathed her last at her residence. She was 81 and is survived by her husband, daughter, son-in-law and a granchild. Renowned historian Ramchandra Guha wrote on his Twitter handle, “One of Dr Omvedt’s great contributions was to break down boundary between sociology and history. She was equally at work in the archive and field. Do see her fine essay on the ‘Satara Prati Sarkar’, published in a book edited by Gyanendra Pandey on the 1942 movement.” Omvedt enjoyed worldwide recognition as a sociologist through her writings. She was a motherly figure to many young dalit activists. Vishwas Kharat, a graduate from Satara, said, “Whenever I heard her, read her books, I got to know myself and society better. Whenever she participated in movements alongside her husband, she treated everyone as her children.” Patankar, who belonged to a family of freedom fighters, was involved in agriculture. He and Omvedt settled in India around 1978 and she received her Indian citizenship in 1983. Omvedt’s activism started with founding the ‘Shramik Mukti Dal’ along with Patankar to deal with the issues that the working class faced. She headed the Phule-Ambedkar Chair under the department of sociology at the Savitribai Phule Pune University. Her huge collection of research work and books are referred to by students from across the country and abroad. A close friend of Patankar told TOI, “Gail was ailing since the last one-and-a-half years. Patankar used to take care of her before leaving home and ensured he got back to look after her. They were inseparable.” Condolences pour in: (On Twitter Handles) Ramchandra Guha: Deeply saddened to hear of Gail Omvedt’s passing. Apart from her major works on the great anti-caste social reformers, she also wrote an important book on the women’s movement in India, as well as many insightful essays on peasant and environmental struggles (mostly in EPW). Sitaram Yechury : Deepest condolences. Gail Omvedt was a distinguished scholar activist with an uncompromising commitment. She provided deep insights in understanding our social conditions. Sharad Pawar: Saddened to hear about the demise of well known sociologist & prolific writer, Dr. Gail Omvedt. India has lost a strong voice of the anti-caste, farmers' & womens' rights movement.

---||Rajkot||225 years on, vaccine creator revered here||Rajkot: It’s been 225 years since Edward Jenner invented the smallpox vaccine. But even after the roll of more than two centuries and many advances made by medical science, people, blinded by faith, still believe that smallpox and measles are caused due to the curse of goddess Shitla Mata. The goddess is worshipped and every year people throng to temples on Shitla Satam, which falls on August 29 this year, to worship the goddess. A school in Bhavnagar, on the same day worships Jenner in an attempt to spread awareness about the disease and also pay homage to the legendary physician. The Jenner ‘puja’ has been held at the B M Commerce High School, located at Ghogha circle, since last one decade. Around 500 students participate in the annual event. The officials and students put up a display showcasing Jenner’s work at the entrance of the school which is located on the way to the local Shitla Mata temple. The display stall has, apart from Jenner’s photo, banners in Gujarati highlighting Jenner’s contribution in eradicating smallpox. With hundreds of devotees visiting the temple during the Shitla Satam, the school hopes to catch as many eyeballs as possible in its attempt to bust the superstitions surrounding the disease. An annual fair is also held at the temple on Shitla Satam, which has been cancelled this year due to the Covid pandemic. “We give a message to the people that there is no religious cure to this disease. People should adopt a scientific approach along with faith,” Paresh Trivedi, principal of the B M Commerce High School said. “This is an attempt to educate the people and students in particular about smallpox. However, now we have also started awareness programs about environmental issues like worshipping of trees, land and water,” Trivedi said. In the past, the mortality rate among children was high because of smallpox. So, maybe to seek solace people started worshipping Shitla Mata and also named the disease after her,” said Trivedi, who has made many informative videos about the disease and has posted them on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/225-years-on-vaccine-creator-revered-here/articleshow/85635315.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Two acquaintances of the girl were also called for questioning. According to police sources, they are trying to trace her missing clothes and also examining her movements at Mapusa where she was seen last. The police had initially said the death was due to drowning and there was no foul play. However, they have been conducting further investigation following demands from civil society.

The girl — a Class VII student — was trying to rescue the puppy, which had got stuck between the iron grilles of the balcony, when she slipped and fell along with the pet. The girl’s family declined to get an autopsy done or lodge a police complaint. The police, however, ruled out any foul play and said it was an accident. According to the police, Jyotsna Sharma, the girl, was playing with the puppy in her room when it ran towards the balcony. Her mother, Kiran, was busy in the kitchen while her father, Lalit, was away at work. Lalit is a marketing manager at a private firm. While playing, the puppy — 4-5 months old — got stuck between two iron grilles of the balcony. Jyotsna tried to pull it out from behind, but the head would get stuck every time. “She climbed on to the railing and got to the other side of the parapet, hoping to pull out the puppy by holding its head. With one hand, she held on to a nylon net which had been put up in the balcony to prevent pigeons and other birds from entering the flat. With the other, she was trying to pull out the dog,” said Veerpal Singh Tomar, a family friend. As Jyotsna slipped, the nylon net she was holding on to couldn’t bear her weight and started to come off the hinges. For a few seconds, the girl hung from the balcony, one of her hands holding on to the head of the puppy. As she cried for help, her mother came running from the kitchen. She even held out her hand for her daughter, but couldn’t reach her. As the puppy came out of the railings, both of them fell nine floors onto the road at the base of Tower A1. Devendra Kumar, a guard at the society, was making entries in the register when he heard a loud thud and saw a few residents rushing towards the tower. “I too ran to see what had happened. The girl and her pet lay there, motionless. There was blood all over,” he said. While the puppy had died at the spot itself, the girl was rushed to a private hospital. She was declared dead on arrival. Sanjeev Sharma, the SHO of Kavi Nagar police station, said the family was too disturbed to allow an autopsy. They also did not want to lodge a police complaint. “Preliminary investigation has revealed it was an accident,” he added. The accident in Ghaziabad comes a day after a one-year-old girl died after she slipped through the railing of the staircase and fell 12 floors in a housing society in Greater Noida.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/12-year-old-girl-attempts-to-rescue-dog-falls-9-floors-to-death-with-it/articleshow/85640316.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

The high court adjourned the matter to Monday. The high court on Monday directed the state government to clarify “on paper” the term as stated in the minutes of the last meeting, the state’s Expert Committee on Covid where it was unanimously decided against permitting “liberal tourism” under the present circumstances. At the same meeting, the expert committee chaired by dean of Goa Medical College, Dr S Bandekar, unanimously decided that all fully vaccinated persons should be allowed to enter Goa without a Covid-19 negative certificate. The state is seeking the court’s nod for permitting fully vaccinated persons entry to Goa without a Covid-19 negative test certificate, and the court said there shouldn't be conflict with the expert committee. Stating that there “should not be any ambiguity”, the high court on Monday directed the state government to submit an affidavit filed by either the health secretary or member secretary of the Expert Committee bringing clarity to the term “liberal tourism”. The division bench also asked the government to state whether it wants to permit entry to all fully vaccinated persons without restrictions and asked how it will differentiate between a tourist and liberal tourist. TOI had earlier reported that advocate general Devidas Pangam said that the term “liberal tourism” is used in context of activities, and would mean to return to the situation as it was before the Covid pandemic, when casinos and hotels were open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/liberal-tourism-govt-seeks-time-from-hc/articleshow/85638181.cms||---

---||Delhi||FYUP under NEP 2020 not the same as 2013: Education secy||New Delhi: The four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP) under the National Education Policy 2020 is not the same as that of 2013, claimed Amit Khare, secretary, Union ministry of education, even as a section of Delhi University teachers opposed the approval given to the proposal by Delhi University’s Academic Council on Tuesday. DU introduced FYUP in 2013, only to roll it back a year later amid widespread protest. The dissent note on the clearance by AC on August 24 stated, “The university must remember the experience of the erstwhile FYUP… students had rejected FYUP mainly because of the additional expenditure for the fourth year” and “…the multiple exit and entry system along with the burden of extra expenditure will encourage dropouts and will hit women students and underprivileged sections”. Khare, however, disagreed with these concerns and said, “The FYUP policy is clear. Universities will continue with their three-year courses as well. This was not the case with the 2013 FYUP.” He said, “IITs have four-year integrated courses. Central universities have three-year honours and two-year masters’ courses. Some institutions will continue to offer three-year programmes. So those who want to, say, join a bank or pursue MBA need not pursue a research-oriented course. We are conscious that everybody may not like to opt for four years. Institutions of Excellence can design their own courses. But if some universities think it is just about adding a year, it is not right.” While calling for caution in designing the courses, professor M Jagadesh Kumar, vice-chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University, said that FYUP gives students an opportunity to choose their own study programme and degree. “The final year can also be used to get trained in research methodology and do some advanced courses in emerging areas,” Kumar said. “This will prepare the students to directly join a PhD programme if they are interested in research. The multiple entries and exits combined with the four-year duration of the UG course will also help students who may like to take some specialised training either in industry or other research organisations and then come back to complete their degree course. Students can also include skill-oriented courses in their programme to become job ready immediately after the four-year undergraduate course.” Universities not offering undergraduate courses will be not impacted by this policy. These include Central University of Punjab. However, its vice-chancellor, professor Raghavendra P Tiwari, finds merit in FYUP. “Not all students get an opportunity to pursue postgraduation for various reasons, including nonavailability of seats,” opined Tiwari. “Therefore, the undergrad programme is over four years, it would be equivalent to a PG. After four years, one can complete the PG course in one year. Also, a three-year duration is inadequate for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary learning and to make the curriculum broad based and holistic.” Inder Mohan Kapahy, retired DU professor, who opposed the earlier FYUP, said the 2013 step was “against the then NEP which stipulated 10+2+3 for conventional graduate programmes” and DU was the only central university to introduce it, severely affecting the interconnect with other universities. “Now,” Kapahy said, “FYUP is an integral part of the national policy. The 2013/14 FYUP was burdened with meaningless school-level foundation courses which were a gross wastage of time. Also, the three-years honours programme is being maintained and this was not so in the 2013/14 version. In that version, after three years a student could only get a pass course degree.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fyup-under-nep-2020-not-the-same-as-2013-education-secy/articleshow/85669037.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

Vanrajsinh Devda, a cop who works as jail assistant, said in his FIR that the incident took place on Monday afternoon when he was instructing prisoners to maintain social distance at the jail hospital. Devda claimed that around 100 prisoners had gathered around the hospital, and he was telling them to move in groups of 10 persons. At that time, one of the accused Raeeskhan Pathan, an undertrial prisoner, began arguing aggressively with Devda and later he began beating the cop and also allegedly provoked others to beat him. Devda claimed that another cop blew a whistle and called in other guards to control the situation. He said that as the prisoners continued to create a ruckus and kept fighting with cops a stampede took place, and police personnel used force and overpowered them. The accused persons were detained and Devda was sent to hospital for treatment of his injuries. The FIR stated that some prisoners also suffered injuries in the incident, but did not mention their numbers and type of injuries. The FIR states that Pathan stays with 44 other undertrial prisoners who are very aggressive in nature. Devda mentioned in the FIR that he feared the accused persons may attack him in future. Ranip police filed a complaint of causing hurt, obstruction in duty of a government servant and unlawful assembly against Pathan and nine others and began an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/prisoners-attack-guard-inside-sabarmati-central-jail/articleshow/85638170.cms||---

---||Delhi||Centre said no need form panel to probe oxygen deaths: Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said that Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya had dismissed the need to form a committee to probe deaths caused due to oxygen shortage during the second Covid-19 wave in Delhi as a Supreme Court-appointed task force and subgroup were already investigating it. Delhi government had formed a committee of health experts to investigate deaths due to lack of oxygen and provide a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to each victim’s family, but the proposal wasn’t approved by LG Anil Baijal. Sisodia had also written to Mandaviya reiterating that a committee was necessary to correctly present the number of such deaths. In a digital press conference, Sisodia said Mandaviya had claimed that the national task force was set-up on May 6 on the Supreme Court’s directions. It had 12 pertinent terms of reference, out of which five were for oxygen, so setting up an investigation committee by Delhi government was not required. “The 12-point agenda items are related to supply of oxygen to hospitals and recommendations and management for the future. They don’t mention deaths caused by oxygen shortage,” he added. “This is a huge fraud by the central government. The second reason given by the Union health minister is that since the Supreme Court has directed that a subgroup be made for Delhi under the task force, and that an interim report has already been released, forming a committee is not important,” said Sisodia. He added, “The purpose of conducting audits is to ensure accountability for proper distribution of oxygen supplies made available by the Centre to the states and Union Territories. To facilitate the audits, the task force has been mandated to constitute subgroups and committees for each state or UT.” Sisodia alleged, “The Union health minister is defrauding us by falsely interpreting the work of the national task force. I want to ask him if Supreme Court had to investigate the deaths due to oxygen shortage, then why did the Centre ask the states to declare the number of deaths?” “The reason behind so many deaths is the gross mismanagement of oxygen supply by the central government,” alleged Sisodia, imploring the Centre to let Delhi government investigate the deaths in a proper manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-centre-said-no-need-for-o2-panel/articleshow/85638239.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||No. of students attending offline schools on the rise in rural Maharashtra||MUMBAI: As debate continues over reopening schools in the city, shut for 17 months, classrooms in rural Maharashtra have seen a rise in students’ attendance this month. Rural schools free of Covid reopened on July 15, with 10% of class 8-12 students attending. Data released by the state showed that by August 18, the strength of students in schools improved to 15% while number of schools reopening rose from 35% to 38% in the state. Closer home in Palghar district, 80 additional schools reopened in August taking the total to 188. Student attendance shot up from 2% in July to 6% this month. District officials said more villages that have become Covid-free are reopening schools after nod from parents. In Thane district, 38 schools reopened this month as against 24 in July. Of the 6 lakh higher secondary students, only 3,500 are attending physical school. Though the number has risen from 0.31% to 0.59%, education officials in the district said efforts are on to bring back more students to classrooms. Reopening schools for class 8-12 in Mumbai, however, has been put on the back burner with the state Covid task force warning of an impending third wave targeting children. A few foreign schools in the city have opened their doors to students while several international schools in Mumbai have also written to the BMC to allow classroom learning. Educationists have been urging the state to start school for higher grade students. The state had also issued a GR to reopen classes 5-7 in rural areas. Majority of the 17,701 schools that are open for higher grades had shown willingness to welcome back students of classes 5-7. But the GR has been kept on hold. Nagpur has the maximum number of schools (67%) open, but of the 6 lakh students, only 1.53 lakh are attending. Latur has the best record of classroom learning with 57% students attending in the 63% of schools that have opened. In Nandurbar (Nashik), Nanded (Latur) and Gondia (Nagpur) too, more than half the student population (classes 8-12) are attending physical schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-of-students-attending-offline-schools-on-the-rise-in-rural-maharashtra/articleshow/85640390.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Nagpur||HC allows sale of POP idols with riders||Nagpur: In a jolt to plaster of Paris (PoP) idol makers, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court while dismissing their petition for lifting a ban on sales, directed its registry to file a suo motu PIL on after effects of immersing those idols in water bodies. Though the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) assured HC that it had banned use of PoP idols since September 2012, it miserably failed to implement it over the years. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor on Wednesday, however allowed the makers to sell their products “only as PoP objects and not as idols”. “We find it necessary to protect financial interest of the petitioners who have already manufactured multiple PoP idols. They are permitted to sell the idols on the express condition that while selling those, they would inform the buyers that those are not intended for any kind of worship, nor are they intended to be immersed in any water body, natural or artificial.” The petitioners were told to give an undertaking that they would not sell PoP idols during Ganesh or any other festival this year or in future as well and henceforth, would stop their making for the worship. As the festival season approaches, NMC again prohibited the makers from selling the PoP idols citing ‘revised guidelines for idol immersion’, issued on May 12, 2020, by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The petitioners — Vinodkumar Gupta and others — then moved judiciary through counsel Shreerang Bhandarkar for seeking relief contending that they had already prepared over 4.5 lakh PoP idols for forthcoming Ganesh, Durga and other festivals and a ban on their sale would cause huge financial losses to them. While dismissing their contentions, the judges stated that the petition raises important questions of public interest regarding use of POP for different purposes and necessity for CPCB to regulate their use for preparing different objects not necessarily in the nature of idols. Adjourning the hearing till August 31, the justices appointed Bhandarkar as amicus and asked its registry to submit a detailed draft of PIL. Quoting CPCB guidelines, the bench clarified that prima-facie there appears to be no prohibition on use of PoP for making other objects like statue, its only limited to POP idols. “The rationale behind such prohibition is quite understandable. The POP idols are procured from market generally for their limited use during festivals. Subsequently, those are immersed in water bodies, which is a major cause for pollution of water bodies, increase in toxicity of major food source like fish and other aquatic beings and damage to environment. This would underline need for taking guidelines seriously and implementing them with greater vigour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-allows-sale-of-pop-idols-with-riders/articleshow/85638245.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

AITUC held a protest at Azad Maidan against the government’s policies and demanded that the rights of the daily wage workers and contract employees should be protected. “The government promised good governance. What kind of governance is this that lakhs and lakhs of people are unemployed. More than 25,000 young people have lost their jobs in the last two years in Goa itself,” said AITUC general secretary for Goa Christopher Fonseca. He said that because of the Covid-19 pandemic many workers are in financial difficulty. “During such a time we hear that the government is bringing new policies such as the national monetisation policy which aims to hand over assets worth Rs 6 lakh crore to the private sectors. This government is trying to destroy our national assets,” said Fonseca. He also questioned the state government’s delay in restarting iron ore mining in Goa. “Why does it take more than three months for the government to start mining if there are mining leases which have no problem?” said Fonseca. AITUC has demanded an increase in minimum wages and has also asked the government to regularise the jobs of all contract workers employed by the state government departments and corporations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/centre-out-to-destroy-indias-assets-econ/articleshow/85638229.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kochi||Kerala: HC to examine if weddings can be solemnised online||KOCHI: After allowing registration of marriages solemnized under personal laws through videoconferencing, the Kerala High Court will now consider the question whether marriages under Special Marriage Act (SMA) can also be solemnized through videoconferencing. Taking a contrary view to earlier judgments that marriages under SMA can be solemnized only physically, Justice PB Suresh Kumar on Wednesday suggested that a larger bench should examine the issue in line with the changes in the society. The case has been directed to be placed before the chief justice for this purpose. In the judgment, the court noted that an earlier judgment of the high court (Shitha VK vs The District Registrar – General of 2021) requires physical presence of parties to a marriage under SMA. The court also pointed out that another judgment (Dioncey Augustine vs State of Kerala of 2019) held that permitting marriage under SMA through videoconferencing would trifle the solemnity of the marriage and goes against sections 11 and 12 of SMA. The court is witnessing a large number of cases in which parties leave the country after giving notice for marriage as per SMA and are unable to return due to reasons beyond their control. “A pragmatic interpretation of the provisions of the Act (SMA), according to me, would redress the grievances of many such people,” the judge said while referring the matter for consideration by a larger bench. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-to-examine-if-weddings-can-be-solemnised-online/articleshow/85638231.cms||---

Four persons died on the spot while two others who were rescued from the mangled remains of the auto-rickshaw succumbed during treatment at a community health centre. The lone survivor, Mukesh, is battling for his life at a district hospital in Budaun. The accident occurred near Qasimpur village under the Kunwargaon police limits. The deceased auto-rickshaw driver, identified as Buddi, was a resident of Banei. He had purchased the three-wheeler earlier this month. Among the dead was 32-year-old Sapna from Bareilly. She was on a visit to Kunwargaon to meet her brother during Raksha Bandhan.

---||Delhi||Gautam asks DMs to streamline issuance of caste certificates||New Delhi: Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam has asked district magistrates to make the process of issuing caste certificates hassle-free. At a meeting held on Wednesday, Gautam said, “It has come to my notice that despite the doorstep delivery of government services, applicants of caste certificates still have to report to the district magistrate offices for submission of papers. This defeats the purpose of doorstep delivery of services. The magistrates should prepare guidelines regarding this so that the applicants do not have to visit the DM office to submit documents. The application process should be hassle-free just like all the services under 1076.” Another issue that was raised by the minister was regarding records of the applicant being untraceable, which becomes a ground for rejecting the application for the issuance of caste certificates. “If the record of the applicant is untraceable, it is a shortcoming of the department and not the applicant. We should not reject these applications. In such cases, a proper guideline needs to be in place. We can physically verify such cases through witnesses like their neighbours,” he added. The minister also raised the issue of children whose mothers are separated and are unable to apply for a caste certificate as it demands the documents of the father. “This needs to be amended immediately. The documents of the separated mother should suffice while applying for the caste certificate of the child,” said Gautam. Gautam also discussed the issues faced by people while applying for OBC certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gautam-asks-dms-to-streamline-issuance-of-caste-certificates/articleshow/85638289.cms||---

Parmar on the other hand claimed the complaint was made with political motives and he had nothing to do with the shop which the complainant was claiming. “I had given him furniture work for my office and the complainant defaulted and has hence filed this complaint against me,” said Parmar. Suthar stated that he had rented his shop in Radhe Mall to one Deepak Shastri, who after 11 months would not get the agreement renewed. He stated that a week ago Parmar called him and threatened him, and said that Shastri would not vacate the shop. Suthar alleged that Parmar told him to sell the shop to him and three of Parmar’s men threatened to get the shop sealed, as Parmar is a councillor. He stated that he went to Parmar’s office where Parmar allegedly told him to sell the shop to him. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/shop-owner-alleges-councillor-is-threatening-him/articleshow/85638262.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Karnavati Club’s new premises faces another bottleneck||Ahmedabad: Ahead of the elections for 10 posts in the board of directors at Karnavati Club, the setting up of the new premises is facing yet another bottleneck, with delays likely in clearance of its plan. Since a gas pipeline of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Limited passes through the plot owned by the club, getting the construction plan cleared will require a no-objection certificate from the ONGC. The club management is yet to submit a detailed plan before Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) for its new premises — Karnavati Club Resort — coming up at Mulsana village of Kalol taluka in Gandhinagar district. AUDA CEO, A B Gor claimed that AUDA is yet to receive a detailed plan from the club. “The rule is clear. We require a detailed plan to initiate the NOC process with ONGC. Till now, our office has not received a detailed plan from Karnavati Club,” said Gor. The club management received the final possession of the plot approximately measuring 120 bigha towards the end of 2020, despite land negotiations going on since the 2019. It appears the club has had hard luck getting the work of its new premises in place. “The club had already purchased the land for the new premises before along Sanand-Kalol Road. However, in June 2018, the land deal had been called off as part of the land was owned by a cooperative which could have caused issues in obtaining clearances for further construction,” said a well-placed source. Last year, the club purchased the land for an estimated price of Rs 60 crore. “This land parcel in Mulsana already had a non-agricultural land certificate, which would help expedite clearances and construction. However, the new requirement for obtaining an NOC might delay the process further,” said a source. The club management claims all is well with the plan clearance. Club president, Nagin Patel, said, “We will soon apply for permission and get things moving. So far there have been no hiccups.” The club is soon expected to initiate process to enrol new members for the club. A maximum of 5,000 new members will be part of the new resort. The new premises, as previously announced by Karnavati Club management, would be focused on developing various sports-related amenities. These include a theme park for children, dedicated courts for badminton, squash, tennis, volleyball, basketball, along with a football ground, cricket ground-cum-open air theatre, cycling and jogging track, gymnasium, billiards and pool room, bridge and card room in addition to an infinity pool and a swimming pool, among various others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/karnavati-clubs-new-premises-faces-another-bottleneck/articleshow/85638260.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Hyderabad||Panel did nothing: HC||Agni Agrotech, which has 17 acres in the village, had pointed out that Kokapet was closer to the twin reservoirs but officials allowed construction there and denied them similar benefit. Responding to a query from HC on Tuesday on whether CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had ever told media he wanted to scrap GO 111, additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao said the CM had only commented that he was waiting for the expert panel’s report. When Rao said the state was actively pursuing the matter, the bench shot back: “We know how actively the high-power panel is working. It did nothing in four and half years. It should be disbanded. In fact, non-catchment areas is not even in the terms of reference of your panel. But the same officials gave clearance to Kokapet auctions for revenue and ignored requests from similarly situated neighbours in Vattinagulapalli.” Rao contended that Vattinagulapalli land was part of the catchment area and sought three more months for the panel to submit the report, adding that Agni Agrotech, which has waited for 13 years could wait a little longer. The bench, however, said it would consider the request for more time only if the state too agreed to wait for the auction money and posted to Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/panel-did-nothing-hc/articleshow/85640400.cms||---
---||Goa||Black turtle poaching on the rise in Sattari, Bicholim||Keri: Though the Wildlife Protection Act bans the poaching and killing of turtles, some villagers in Sattari and Bicholim are seen poaching turtles for consumption of the meat of this protected reptile. During the monsoon, turtles are most active in the early part of the morning as well as the evening hours. They spend the day basking in the sun and come out to relish on aquatic vegetation along the edges of water bodies. During these hours villagers poach them and roast them alive on a fire for the meat. In Sattari and Bicholim villagers poach the Indian black turtle, a species of medium-size fresh water turtle found in various parts of Goa. No comprehensive study has been conducted till date to ascertain the population and status of these species of turtles. While in Pernem taluka turtle meat was consumed in the past, it is no longer the case, a resident of Pernem said. But people here say that failure of officials from the forest department to raise awareness about turtle poaching is leading to the practice being followed in other areas. “People from the older generation hunted and consumed turtle meat. Youth are rarely seen poaching. So far no action has been taken by the forest department, both in terms of law enforcement as well as awareness about the ecological role of the turtles,” said Narayan Kalangutkar, a wildlifer from Ibrampur, Pernem. Pandurang Gawasm a villager from Shiroli, Sattari said that in many parts of Sattari turtle meat is considered a monsoon delicacy and locals go to great lengths to poach turtles. “People move out in search of turtles and catch them when they are basking in the sunlight,” he said. “The turtle species have been protected under the Wildlife Protection Act. Hunting, trade or any other form of utilisation of the turtle species for their body parts and derivatives is banned. But turtles are still poached on a large scale during the monsoon season. It is extremely worrisome to see the scale of poaching and turtle meat consumption,” wildlife rescuer Vitthal Shelke said. Turtles play a crucial role as scavengers by keeping the aquatic ecosystem clean. Some species have been known to bring the population of snails and insects under control. Vivek Gaonkar, range forest officer (RFO), Keri said, “Our staff has been involved in discouraging incidents of wildlife poaching. There is a need to create awareness among people to stop this type of poaching. If any such incident is brought to our notice we will take action against violators of the Wildlife Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/black-turtle-poaching-on-the-rise-in-sattari-bicholim/articleshow/85638263.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Delhi||Changes in English syllabus promote inclusiveness, diversity, harmony: DU||New Delhi: After being criticised for dropping certain texts from the English Honours syllabus, Delhi University said on Thursday that the content of the syllabus approved by the university’s Academic Council promotes the idea of “inclusiveness, diversity and harmony”. The syllabus is inclusive and diverse with works of renowned scholars of both national and international fame, without consideration of their “religion, caste and creed”, DU said. In the Academic Council meeting on Tuesday, the fifth semester English (H) syllabus was stripped of works by two Tamil Dalit feminist writers, Bama Faustina Soosairaj and Sukirtharani. The short story ‘Draupadi’ by Mahashweta Devi about the exploitation of tribal women was also dropped from the core courses on the recommendation of the Oversight Committee.The Oversight Committee, which was set up to deal with contentious issues related to exams, syllabi and departmental problems, also replaced Chandrabati Ramayana with the Tulsidas version in the ‘Pre-Colonial Indian Literatures’ elective paper. Responding to criticism, registrar Vikas Gupta issued a statement on Thursday, saying the issues regarding the syllabus were “misplaced and unfounded” and that the oversight committee had “held deliberations with” and received “the recommendations of the head department of English” to “finalise the set syllabus”. The statement said writers of fame had been chosen without consideration of their “religion, caste and creed”. “The university subscribes to the idea that literary content forming part of the text in a language course of study should contain materials which do not hurt the sentiments of any individual and are inclusive in nature to put a true picture of a society, both past and present. Such an inclusive approach is important for the young minds who imbibe the content of the teaching-learning emanating from the syllabus in letter and spirit,” the statement added. AK Bhagi, president, National Democratic Teachers Front, defended the move, saying, "Anything against the ethos and culture of the country is unacceptable. Everything should be discussed on academic merit. Why insist on texts that hurt the sentiment of people and ethos of the country?" But Delhi University Teachers’ Association took issue with this stand. Its statement on Thursday said that DU’s press release was “ample evidence that the university administration is complicit in the unethical and the unacademic chopping of authors like Mahasweta Devi from the BA (H) English syllabus. The university has completely abdicated its responsibility towards upholding academic freedom and critical rigour”. DUTA also claimed it was a “matter of extreme shame and concern” that the Oversight Committee comprising senior academics had “become an instrument to impose censorship on courses and readings as per the diktat of RSS-BJP". Three dissenting AC members — Rajesh Kumar, Biswajit Mohanty and Mithuraaj Dhusiya — also noted, “Without giving any evidence that the texts removed by the Oversight Committee have hurt any sentiment, the press release clearly expresses its ignorance of the subject and also underlines its prejudice to the marginal voices of the society. The ignorance is highlighted by the submission that BA (H) English is not literature but a language course.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/changes-in-english-syllabus-promote-inclusiveness-diversity-harmony-du/articleshow/85669132.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Fishermen get lessons in sustainable practices||Panaji: To reduce overfishing in Goa’s estuaries, experts from the Old Goa-based ICAR-CCARI urged fishermen to follow sustainable fishing practices and manage the ecosystem. A total of 40 fishermen and farmers from fishing villages around the Zuari estuary — Cacra, Odxel, Nauxim, Bambolim, and Siridao — participated in a campaign recently organised by the institute at Carca to discuss various challenges facing sustainability of fisheries. The fishermen were given scientific knowledge to conserve and manage fisheries resources in the natural waters of Goa. Director of ICAR-CCARI, Parveen Kumar urged the fishermen to “use large meshed gillnets in order to reduce the juvenile catch to stop overfishing in the estuaries.” Estuaries of Goa such as Mandovi and Zuari support the livelihood to thousands of fishermen, hundreds of fish farmers, are a source of fresh fish to the state’s inhabitants and also form an integral part Goan life. Emeritus scientist, ESSO-NCPOR and former head, biological oceanography division, NIO, Dr Baban Ingole, spoke about the various anthropogenic pressures such as overexploitation, pollution, habitat degradation, and invasive species that could seriously impact the fisheries resources of estuaries and rivers. “Fishermen must help revive the mussel, oyster and clam beds of the estuaries in a participatory mode so as to provide sustainable livelihood to the youth and women along the coastal region,” he said. Senior scientist, Animal Science and Fisheries, Dr Shivasharanappa N emphasised the importance of the day and ensured all technical support to fishermen and farmers in conserving and managing fisheries for future generations. The fishermen requested for scientific and technical support from ICAR for various welfare schemes in the field of fisheries. They also requested assistance for preparing applications for the schemes from the developmental departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fishermen-get-lessons-in-sustainable-practices/articleshow/85638284.cms||---
---||Goa||In Goa, 1,831 driving licences suspended from January to June||PANAJI: In the first half of this year, 460 motorists in Goa have lost their driving licence after attracting a threemonth suspension for the use of mobile phone while driving or riding their vehicle. “Drivers and two-wheeler-riders are continuously caught using mobile phone and a stringent punishment is required for the same. When the new Motor Vehicle Act comes into force, the steep fines could be a deterrent for them,” said North Goa DySp (traffic), Salim Shaikh. Speeding continues to be one of the highest recorded violations from January to June, as a consequence of which, 912 licences have been suspended in this duration. Figures shared by the transport department reveal that all in all, 1,831 driving licences have been suspended for various violations in the first half of 2021. The traffic cell earlier had four speed radar guns, to which five more have now been added, making it useful for the traffic police to detect more violations. “We have been using the speed radar guns extensively at highways and state roads and book maximum cases for the violation,” Shaikh said. There were also several driving licences suspended for violations such as drunken driving, red light jumping among others. Road safety activist Roland Martins said that the digitisation of the fining system is one of the significant reasons for faster suspensions. “The traffic police are equipped with handheld devices to check the motorist’s history so the speed at which the suspension takes places is sooner now. Thanks to digitisation of the entire system, the process is faster and there is no lethargy to postpone the paperwork for later,” he said. He further said that the implementation of central rules will act help discipline motorists against traffic violations. The new Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act, 2019, which was supposed to come into force earlier this year has still not been implemented. In July this year, the government had decided to postpone it to next year, after the assembly elections conclude. The new law came into force on September 1, 2019, and all states were expected to implement it. But after some governments, including Gujarat and Uttarakhand, raised concerns about some of the hiked fines, they lowered penalties for certain traffic violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-goa-1831-driving-licences-suspended-from-jan-to-june/articleshow/85638311.cms||Nida Sayed

The accused set up a work-from-home sham, offering people data entry assignments and then ‘fining’ the the victims for purportedly inaccurate work. The accused were nabbed on Tuesday. The CID officers said that they had received 10 applications to file a complaint against the accused: Kiran Patel, 27, Saurabh Dam, 32, and Abhay Sharda, 28, all residents of Surat. They have duped people of Rs 84,000, according to preliminary figures. A team of the CID raided the office of the accused and found 13 men and five women working as telecallers who targeted unemployed people. According to documents and statements of the call centre employees, many of the victims were those who had lost their jobs during the Covid-19 crisis. The targets were told that if they worked with accuracy, they would be given whopping returns on their deposit of Rs 5,900. But later, even if the work was accurate, the scammers retained the deposits citing some error or the other. Cops seized articles worth Rs 3 lakh including 23 cellphones, three laptops, eight CPUs, one computer set, and Rs 1.24 lakh cash from the office of the accused. The CID officers said that the number of victims may rise as the investigation is underway. The CID has filed a complaint of breach of trust, cheating, and criminal conspiracy against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/three-held-for-wfh-scam-duping-covid-layoff-victims/articleshow/85638320.cms||---

Priyanka Misra, a constable deployed at MM gate police station, was attached to police lines and an inquiry marked against her by senior superintendent of police (SSP) Muniraj G. The SSP told TOI that her act was against the code of conduct followed by UP Police. "Misra was present in a police store room where revolvers were kept and she used one of them to film the video. She does not have a service revolver allotted to her by the department," the SSP said. Misra had filmed a short Instagram video of herself lip-syncing to a popular Hindi dialogue and uploaded it a few weeks ago. The video was later deleted from her account. In the 21-second video, which was shared with TOI, the constable is seen lip-syncing to the words: “Haryana, Punjab have a bad reputation for no reason…Come to Uttar Pradesh. We will show you what ‘rangbaazi’ is…” Later, the dialogue says: “Here (in UP), kids as young as five use guns.” In 2019, a woman cop in Gujarat had been suspended after she had posted a TikTok video of herself dancing inside the police station while on duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-woman-constable-attached-to-police-lines-for-shooting-video-flaunting-revolver-in-uniform/articleshow/85635470.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Some of the colleges that have already received thepermission from the university to increase the number of seats in somedepartments are Maulana Azad, Scottish Church, Asutosh and Goenka College forCommerce and Business Administration. Thecolleges are yet to receive a formal go-ahead. The university is considering the applications of many morecolleges to increase the seats in the more sought after departments so thatnone of the meritorious students have to struggle to get into a college oftheir choice. Three RKM Colleges in the city which are autonomous innature have already increased seats at the under graduate level depending ontheir resources so that more deserving candidates can be given admission. “Yes, we have increased the number of under graduate seatsin many colleges. We are going through more applications and will be giving permissionto many more colleges in the coming days so that students who have passed classXII this year do not have to struggle to get admission in colleges,” said AsisKumar Chattopadhyay, pro vice chancellor for academic affairs in Calcutta University. Subhasis Dutta, principal of Maulana Azad College, confirmedthat the college had applied after receiving instructions from the university. “We had applied in 2019 but due to some reasons it did nothappen. Few days ago, we received a message from the university asking us toapply. We applied on the invitation of the university. We are yet to get theformal go ahead,” said Dutta. Colleges have often said that in some departments they havetoo few seats to accommodate even a small fraction of students who apply. Thisyear when a record number of students passed class XII boards the university approachedthe colleges to apply for increase in seats in some of the departments. Scottish Church College is one of the many colleges thatapplied for the increase in seats in some of the departments. “We had appliedfor the increase in the number of seats after the decision of the university,”said Madhumanjari Mandal, principal of the college. Bethune College did not go in for any increase in the numberof seats even though there is a demand for subjects like Zoology, Physics,Chemistry and Computer Science. “These are all science subjects with lab-basedwork. Applying for increase in the number of seats in these subjects would haveput pressure on the existing infrastructure,” said Krishna Roy, principal of BethuneCollege. Both Jadavpur University and Presidency University, whichare also referred to as unitary universities, did not have any plans ofincreasing the number of seats at the start of the application process but thesheer numbers have surprised them. “Initially we had no such plans, but we aregoing to discuss the matter after all the applications have come in,” said anofficial of Jadavpur University.

---||Delhi||Decide on validity of Asthana’s appointment in 2 wks: SC to HC||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked Delhi High Court to decide the validity of appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner within two weeks, amid indications that Chief Justice N V Ramana may not prefer to hear the matter if it is brought before the apex court again. While adjourning the hearing on Prashant Bhushan’s plea against the appointment, a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant asked him to approach the high court that has a similar petition .The bench, however, kept the door of the SC open for Bhushan. At the outset of the hearing, the CJI said he had expressed his opinion on “this gentleman” (Asthana) while being on a committee for appointment of CBI director. Widely seen as the front-runner, Asthana was passed over after the CJI, as a member of the appointing panel, sources said, took the stand that he had less than six months of regular service left. The CJI may recuse himself from hearing the case as the order uploaded on SC website says, “The Registry is directed to list this matter after two weeks before an appropriate Bench.” In its challenging the CP’s appointment, Centre for Public Interest Litigation has also flagged the decision of the panel that chose the CBI chief. Bhushan alleged that an “ambush petition” was being filed in HC in collusion with the government to get the petition dismissed. But Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the “ambush petition” was being filed by those who had lost the race. The petition in SC has been filed for quashing the Centre’s decision to appoint Gujarat-cadre officer Asthana as CP for allegedly being in violation of the apex court’s guidelines and of inter-cadre deputation policy of All-India service officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/decide-on-validity-of-asthanas-appointment-in-2-wks-sc-to-hc/articleshow/85638465.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||‘Terming Malabar Rebellion a communal riot, an injustice’||Kozhikode: Speaker MB Rajesh said the ongoing attempts to portray Malabar Rebellion as a communal riot by generalizing the aberrations that had taken place during the movement was an injustice towards history. Speaking at the inauguration of year-long centenary commemoration events organised by IUML at Pookkottoor on Wednesday on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Pookkottoor (one of the major armed uprising against the British), Rajesh said that the current attempts to depict the agitation, as not part of the freedom struggle, was aimed at dividing people on communal lines. He said that though the overriding essence of Malabar Rebellion was its anti-British, anti-feudal character, there were some instances in which it was subjected to communal deviations. “For a big movement or agitation, there could be such aberrations and it happened in Malabar Rebellion too at some stage. Such deviations happened even during the Non-Cooperation Movement which was envisaged by Mahatma Gandhi as a non-violent struggle. But the Chauri Chaura incident, in which 20 policemen were killed, happened as part of it. But can we assess the stir just on the basis of that incident? What is important is the stand leadership takes when such events take place. In the case of Malabar Rebellion, history books have said that Variamkunnath Kunhamed Haji had denounced such acts,” he said. Rajesh said Malabar Rebellion was the eruption of simmering resentment among the people against Britishers and feudal landlords due to the oppressive agrarian relations they tried to promote. “What we should do now on the centenary year of the movement is to respect the supreme sacrifices made by its leaders. We should move ahead by correcting the aberrations/weaknesses of the movement,” he said. “The observance of the centenary year of Malabar rebellion should ensure that there won’t be anything that will adversely affect the unity of people. We shouldn’t allow the people, who are facing exploitation, to be divided on communal lines,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/terming-malabar-rebellion-a-communal-riot-an-injustice/articleshow/85638370.cms||---

---||India||Congress too tried to monetise assets: Finance minister||MUMBAI/ NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday hit back at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his criticism of the Centre’s asset monetisation plan, pointing out that the Congress-led government had done the same with the Rs 8,000 crore Mumbai-Pune expressway deal and had sought bids for New Delhi railway station. Rahul had on Tuesday criticised the government’s asset monetisation plan as a deal to gift the crown jewels created over 70 years to select industrialists, dubbing it a ‘grand closing down sale’. Displaying an RFP (request for proposals) for New Delhi railway station published on 27th October 2008, Sitharaman questioned “Is this not monetisation? If it was, did they sell off the station? Is it owned by jijaji now? Does he understand what monetisation is?” Pointing out that it was Gandhi who tore a government ordinance in then PM Manmohan Singh’s absence because he didn’t like it, Sitharaman asked,“Did he tear up this RFP call for the New Delhi station to be monetised?” She also brought up the 2018 Commonwealth Games scam, saying everything that could be taken out was creamed into the accounts of cronies. She reiterated that there’s no change of ownership in NMP and assets would be handed back. On Wednesday, Rahul again took a swipe with a “IndiaOnSale” hashtag. “First sold out conscience and now...,” he said in a tweet in Hindi. Congress also used the hashtag and accused the government of exploiting India’s assets for the benefit of its “crony friends”. Hinting at a countrywide protest, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee said, “This is not Modi’s asset, whole of India will be united to protest against National Monetisation Pipeline.” “The country will stand together and oppose this decision,” she said. Terming NMP as an “unfortunate decision,” she alleged that the money raised by selling those assets will be used during elections against opposition parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-too-tried-to-monetise-assets-finance-minister/articleshow/85643609.cms||---

---||Delhi||DDA’s plan to build STP at E Delhi park irks residents||New Delhi: To make an alternative arrangement to supply water to Joggers Park in Mayur Vihar-1 Extension, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) recently came up with a plan to construct a Sewer Treatment Plant (STP) for irrigation purposes. The residents, however, were against the idea and argued that the park was in the middle of the colony, and construction of an STP would lead to multiple issues, including foul smell and mosquito breeding. They held a meeting with the DDA officials on Thursday and said that, instead of constructing the STP, water could be supplied from a DJB STP located 500-600 metres from the area. Gagan Batra, secretary of Kirti Apartments RWA, said some digging work had already started at the park opposite Samachar Apartments a few days ago. When the DDA officials were contacted, they said that NGT had earlier issued an order to discontinue use if borewells to save groundwater, which is why they were making alternative arrangements. “But we have our own apprehensions. After the construction of the STP, residents will face problems, including foul smell. Also, in case it is not being maintained properly or operated by DDA later, the entire system will become a reason for nuisance,” claimed Batra. The residents had even approached the lieutenant governor and MP Gautam Gambhir on the issue. “After making several petitions, we finally called a meeting where DDA officials (horticulture) were shown the DJB’s STP located a few metres from this park. We requested them to lay a pipeline from there to the park after obtaining all permission. We also gave them an option to use the rainy well in the area for irrigation,” said a resident. A DDA official, when asked about the plan to shift the STP’s site, said they were a public organisation and would consider all suggestions received from the residents while implementing the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ddas-plan-to-build-stp-at-e-delhi-park-irks-residents/articleshow/85669179.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Reacting to the decision of the MMC to invite tenders worth Rs 8 lakh for cutting and trimming trees posing danger to the public, the Shadow Council has written to the municipality and the district collector suggesting a slew of measures to ensure that the exercise is conducted in “true spirit of containment of the risks as supposedly identified”. While stating that it had no objection to the cutting or trimming of trees posing risks to the public, the Shadow Council had called for the exercise to be conducted under the supervision of a forest department official. “Presence of a forest department official becomes even more essential as we have experienced in the past how trees were fully cut in the guise of trimming,” Savio Coutinho of Shadow Council said. Coutinho demanded that the scope of work for the agency should be defined in the work order/tender.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mmcs-plan-to-axe-135-trees-draws-flak/articleshow/85638349.cms||---
---||Delhi||Flashback: Rallying for our Battle of Najafgarh heroes||New Delhi: Passing by Delhi Gate located in Najafgarh, the Delhi Metro station there and the jheel (lake), it is hard to imagine this is the site of the battle of Najafgarh, when Indian sepoys and British soldiers fought each other on August 25, 1857 during India’s first war of independence. To commemorate the battle and in remembrance of the martyrs, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) unit deployed with Delhi Metro organised a 61-km cycle rally from Raja Nahar Singh metro station in Ballabhgarh to the Najafgarh metro station on Wednesday. The southernmost and westernmost stations of the train network, Ballabhgarh and Najafgarh were at that point in history a part of the kingdom of Raja Nahar Singh, a key figure in the battle of Najafgarh. He was among those who were later sentenced to death by the British. On the day, British forces led by Johnson Nicholson fought the combined forces of the sepoys of Bareilly and the Nimach Brigade, making it one of the most significant stands by Indian soldiers during the siege of Delhi. It is believed that there were over 800 casualties in the battle. CISF said Wednesday’s rally was to honour the heroes who gave their lives in the first war of India’s independence. “The cyclothon was organised to pay our respects to the great Raja Nahar Singh and the countless number of sepoys who fought and died in the battle of Najafgarh,” said Jitender Rana, DIG (Metro), CISF. The cycle rally had 62 men and 13 women cyclists, all from CISF, led by Rana and other senior officers of the security force’s DMRC unit. They covered the 61km of the rally in over three hours. The route they took traversed the historical sites of Ballabhgarh, Tughlaqabad, Siri Fort, Mehrauli, Palam and Najafgarh. The cyclists were flagged in at Najafgarh stadium and welcomed by Rakesh Dahiya, assistant district magistrate, South-West, ex-SDMC mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat, zone chairman Satpal Malik and cheering residents of Najafgarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/flashback-rallying-for-our-battle-of-najafgarh-heroes/articleshow/85638361.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Variamkunnath Kunhamed Haji's kin to protest against Indian Council of Historical Research move||KOZHIKODE: The family members of Variamkunnath Kunhamed Haji, one of the key leaders of the Malabar Rebellion, will hold a protest march and will sit on dharna on Thursday, which also happens to be the centenary anniversary of Battle of Pookottur, one of the major armed uprising against the British during the Malabar Rebellion. Chakkiparamban family members will undertake a march from the district collectorate in Malappuram to the passport office where they would sit on dharna. Leaders of Congress, CPM, IUML and CPM will also participate. The family members are pained by Indian Council for Historical Research’s (ICHR) move to drop Variamkunnath’s name from the list of martyrs of Indian freedom struggle and are anguished by the attempts of some sections to vilify and tarnish the martyr who laid down his life fighting the British. “We want to register our protest against the ICHR move to misrepresent Variamkunnath Kunhamed Haji. They might be able to strike down his name from the ICHR list, but they won’t be able to remove the martyrs from the minds of the people,” said C P Ibrahim, president of Chakkiparamban Family Association, which has around 10,000 members. He said that Kunhammed Haji, despite being born in a well-off family, took the lead in resisting the British and in the process had to sacrifice his life and his entire property, including over 200acres, was confiscated by the British,” he said. Ibrahim said that Haji could not be given a proper burial as the British, after shooting him down at Kottakunnu, burned the body and dispersed the ashes to ensure that there is no burial place to prevent it from becoming a memorial. C P Mohammed, secretary of the association, said that it was unfortunate that the central government too was siding with attempts by a section to malign the freedom fighter. “The anti-British struggle waged by Variamkunnath Kunhamed Haji and his secular credentials were attested by many historians within the country and outside,” he added. Meanwhile, MYL has filed a complaint with Tirurangadi police against the statement by BJP national vice-president A P Abdullakutty that Kunhamed Haji was the first Taliban leader in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/hajis-kin-to-protest-against-ichr-move/articleshow/85638428.cms||---

Multiple colleges have received over 1000 applications till Wednesday. Along with new applicants, a large number of students have used this window to apply in more subjects pushing up the application numbers. Maulana Azad College has received a staggering 7000 applications since the deadline was extended from August 20. Both Bethune College, Scottish Church College and Suredranath College have received over 2000 applications in this five-day period. Principal, Maulana Azad College, Subhasis Dutta said, “The number of applications has far exceeded our expectations. Since we publish a complete merit list will all applications, we will introduce a search bar for students to check their names among the thousands who will figure in the final list. Inability of students to find their names in the voluminous merit lists had led to some complaints last year, we hope the search bar will help the students find their names.” Dutta did not want to delve in details on whether the new applicants were students who had already applied and were applying on more subjects once the deadline got extended or were new candidates, “We are witnessing both,” he said. Principal, Scottish church college, Madhumanjari Mandal Choubey said, “There has been a noticeable spurt in the applications. This is more than expected.” She said, “While the total applications have touched 57000, the number of students who applied is around 40000. So, more students, many of whom had their HS marks revised, are now opting for more subjects after the August 20.” Bethune College principal Krishna Roy said, “With the admission deadline on August 27 we really don’t know where the final numbers will take us. But this time more students are opting for more subject combinations which is pushing up the application numbers.” This year all three boards---CISCE, CBSE and HS had scrapped the plus II examination and evaluation was based on formula framed by different boards and council. After the publication of Higher Secondary results, there were 14000 review applications. Due to this higher education department extended date of submission to August 27.

Their families said it was because of spurious liquor. Late on Wednesday evening, police said forensic reports of four men they had sent for testing confirmed liquor poisoning. “At least 10 deaths have been reported so far — three in Kaulara Kalan, one in Barkula, two in Gadhi Jahan and four in Devri village,” ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna told TOI. “The report from the forensic science laboratory in Agra confirmed the presence of methyl alcohol in the four viscera samples we had sent. They died because of spurious liquor.” Families TOI spoke to also said the men had consumed spurious liquor before they fell sick. “Father came home drunk on Sunday night. After a while, he complained of stomach ache and started puking. He drank again the next day and got sicker,” said Chanchal, whose father Anil, a dairy worker from Kaulara Kalan, died. The same happened to Radhe Shyam, also from Kaulara Kalan. Both were in their early 40s. At Barkula, Bhupendra, whose father Gaya Prasad, a 50-year-old farm hand, died, said his father had gone out with Anil, his friend, and was drunk when he got home. Within hours, he got sick and died while being taken to the hospital Families TOI spoke to also said the men had consumed spurious liquor before they fell sick.Three of the 10 men — Chandrabhan Kushwaha, 43, Ram Sahai, 35, and Roop Singh, 38 — were cremated before an autopsy could be conducted. The family of another man who died, Ramveer Singh, 45, alleged that the police cremated his body “forcefully”. “My uncle was hospitalised on August 22 after his condition started deteriorating. He had consumed hooch. He died on Tuesday evening,” said Yogesh, his nephew. Radhe and Anil, from the same village, had died earlier. Three of the 10 men — Chandrabhan Kushwaha, 43, Ram Sahai, 35, and Roop Singh, 38 — were cremated before an autopsy could be conducted.“Police sent the body for an autopsy at night. We brought it back to the village around 1am. After 20 minutes or so, cops who were present there asked us to take it for cremation. Everyone was surprised because Hindu rituals don’t allow last rites to be performed at night,” said Yogesh. “We told them that his son Deepak works as a labourer in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. We would wait because he was on his way. But they didn’t listen and put his body in an ambulance.” ADG Krishna said he would look into the allegations. “Action will be taken if cremation was done against their wishes and without proper rituals,” he added. Four liquor vends in the area, meanwhile, were sealed for inquiry, Agra SP (east) K Venkat Ashok said. No FIR has been registered so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/10-die-in-3-days-police-confirm-4-deaths-due-to-hooch/articleshow/85635601.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Nagpur||Prepare Lonar lake devpt plan in 3 months: HC to govt panel||Nagpur: After the Maharashtra government declared that it issued a resolution (GR) to constitute Lonar Crater Lake Development Committee (LCLDC), the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the agency to prepare a comprehensive plan for overall development of the historic water body at the earliest. The LCLDC would act as a central agency for taking care of every aspect of preservation, conservation, and development of miscellaneous work to be undertaken, encouraged and continued regarding the crater formed due to meteorite impact about 50,000 years ago. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor further directed LCLDC to complete the exercise as expeditiously as possible. “We hope and expect it would be completed preferably within three months from the date of its first meeting.” The bench asked its registry to make a compilation of all its earlier orders in the petition by lawyer Kirti Nipankar along with Govind Khekale and Sudhakar Bugdane from Buldhana through lawyer Anand Parchure, and send it to LCLDC for consideration. “The orders contain several suggestions and solutions regarding the preservation, conversation and other issues. These measures, we feel, would go a long way in making a comprehensive and effective plan by the committee.” The judges told the registry to send all its orders to LCLDC within a week and also asked the agency to convene its meetings within two weeks. “We also direct the registry to prepare a separate and exclusive volume of record of this case which would contain only orders passed by HC till date. This will facilitate handling of the file. The LCLDC is requested to submit the plan for further consideration,” the judges said before adjourning the hearing for four months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/prepare-lonar-lake-devpt-plan-in-3-months-hc-to-govt-panel/articleshow/85638403.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: For women, free travel comes with rude behaviour by TNSTC crew||MADURAI: Just over 2.25 lakh women utilise the free bus passes for women on TNSTC buses in Madurai city, but many of them say conductors of these buses have only disdain for them and don’t mince words conveying it, much to their discomfiture. Women’s activists say the noble scheme announced by chief minister M K Stalin after taking charge may not have the desired result if this attitude continues. P Roja from Mathur on Alagarkoil road travels to Surveyor colony where she works in a departmental store. ``The free bus travel was a boon for my family, because there is a lot of saving on my salary, but often the conductors make it abundantly clear that we are enjoying an undue privilege, and it hurts,’’ she said. Since the frequency of buses decrease in the nights she says she has to travel by taking a Rs 40 ticket on a private bus back home. N Venkateswari, another regular bus passenger, says that sometimes conductors make demeaning comments. ``They stop the bus about fifty feet away from the bus stop at Tallakulam and we have to run to get into it. Immediately, they ask us if we thought we were queens and could take our time in getting in,’’ she said. ``People may think what’s new in running after a bus, but we have not been experiencing it for a long time after our school days. Now, they make us run with a vengeance. It is a sorry sight to see old women struggling to catch these buses which are not so frequent,’’ said K Nagalakhmi of Karuppatti, a tailor, who claims that the problem is now become routine. ``This was one of the best schemes launched by the Tamil Nadu government, but then TNSTC should also sensitize its workers on how to treat women, because it is something bestowed on them by the government and it is not something to be considered cheap,’’ said S Selva Gomathy a social activist, who says that this problem had been brought to her notice by many garment industry workers with whom she was working. Responding to the charge, TNSTC Madurai general manager K Elangovan said they have received complaints even as videos when the service was launched, after which they took action against the concerned staff. ``We have even placed some of them under suspension. Some are being sent for a two-day training at the drivers and bus conductors training institute at Pasumalai,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/for-women-free-travel-comes-with-rude-behaviour-by-tnstc-crew/articleshow/85640507.cms||---

They also requested the government not to insist on digital meters, withdraw notices issued for canceling permits and allow the renewal of permits. Some taxis that were fitted with meters developed ignition switch problems and batteries were also found to be exhausted. The vehicles are lying unused for so many months as operators have been out of business due to the pandemic, read the memorandum. “We have suffered badly. We pay the insurance and car EMIs. It is not possible to bear the extra cost of digital meters when the situation is bad,” said a taxi operator. The operators suggested that the government introduce app-based meters as done in Karnataka, Maharashtra and some other states. “If our demands are not met, we will oppose BJP in assembly elections,” the taxi operator said. The taxi association has about 600 members in Canacona. “I have tried to help them in the past, but the government has to also implement the high court order. I will nonetheless, take up their grievances before the government and see that no injustice is done to them,” Fernandes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-must-stop-cancelling-taxi-permits-cabbies/articleshow/85638374.cms||---

During the start of HCL, I believed that micro-processors would bring in a big change in the computer world, so I left my job and started HCL with my friends.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Submit vaccination status report, schools told||KOLKATA: The state government has asked schools to submit a report on vaccination status of teachers and other staffers of government and government-aided schools. The education department has also directed district school inspectors to visit institutes and supervise the sanitization of the premises. They have also been told to report any damage to the infrastructure. According to school education department officials, the reason behind the sudden rush to ready school buildings, which had been shut since March 2020, was the chief minister Mamata Banerjee recently announcing that campuses would be reopened in a controlled manner after the Durga Puja if cases remained low. Last week, the school education department had asked all schools to submit a report on the damage the buildings and infrastructure suffered during the shutdown so that those could be repaired to avoid any harm to students when they eventually returned to campuses. “Vaccinating all teachers and non-teaching staff is the most important step before resuming in-person classes. The government has asked us for a report. Many schools have submitted the report,” said Haridas Ghatak, president of Advanced Society for Headmasters and Headmistresses. On Wednesday again, many schools received a message from district school inspectors, asking them to submit their vaccination status report. “We have been instructed by the district administration to compile a report and send them immediately. Since the government is toying with the idea of reopening schools after Pujas, the district administrations have been instructed to ready schools so that in-person classes can resume at short notice. We are also trying to find out how many teaching and non-teaching staff are yet to be vaccinated,” said an official of the school education department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/submit-vax-status-report-schools-told/articleshow/85638437.cms||Zeeshan Javed

TOI had on Wednesday reported that Sajidul Haque Laskar, 18, who passed his Class XII exams from the Saiyyid Hamid Senior Secondary School in Aligarh this year, had tried to apply for BCom courses at Maulana Azad College and Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration. But his application did not go through because the AMU Board is not on the list. He had scored 91.8% in the commerce stream. CU vice chancellor Sonali Chakravarty Banerjee, who intervened after the TOI report, said, “The colleges have agreed to recognise the AMU board on their list of approved boards. Another college, AJC Bose, has agreed as well.” She added that she had spoken with the AJC Bose College about this while the pro vice chancellor (academic affairs) took it up with Maulana Azad and Goenka colleges. Laskar was relieved. “Studying at a Calcutta University college is a dream come true. I will now fill in my application on Thursday,” he said. Laskar, the youngest of four siblings, had studied up to Class X at a CBSE school in Assam. His father is a teacher in Assam. The problem he faced has been a recurring one. The AMU board is listed by the Council of Boards for School Education. The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test recognises AMU board scores. And it was recognised by the UGC in 1984. But last month, another Saiyyid Hamid alumnus, Mursalim Khan, 20, was rejected by Army recruiters because the AMU board was not on the list the UP government had given them. That was because the UP government has not updated the list. A UP secondary board senior official had then told TOI that the AMU board had been a recognised one in the state till 2014 but was dropped for reasons they were not aware of. They are “in the process” of revising it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/toi-impact-3-calcutta-univ-colleges-to-now-admit-students-from-amu-board/articleshow/85635624.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The chief officer in December 2018 had submitted to the commission that the pension arrears under the 7th Pay Commission could not be disbursed due to paucity of funds and asked for three months to disburse the entire arrears of pension to the former employee. But the former employee Krishnanath Pandurang Harmalkar in March 2019 stated that he had still not received his pension arrears. “More than two years have passed but the arrears have still not been paid to the complainant,” stated the three member commission comprising chairperson Justice U V Bakre and members Desmond D’Costa and Pramod V Kamat.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat Congress feels let down ahead of 2022 polls||GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat unit of the Congress party, which is struggling to gain ground lost in the recent urban and rural local body elections and the assembly by-elections, is feeling let down by its national leadership, which does not seem to be taking any interest in earnest preparations for next year’s crucial assembly election. The resignations of state unit president Amit Chavda and leader of opposition (LOP) Paresh Dhanani were accepted by the party high command after the party’s rout in the local polls. Six months on, the party leadership has failed to appoint new leaders in the state, with the 2022 election in mind. State Congress leaders say this callous attitude of the central leadership does not bode well for the party before the election. A senior leader who has been associated with the Congress for over four decades said, “I have never felt such a lack of attention from the central leadership to the Gujarat organisation. The present party organisation in the state is working half-heartedly in anticipation of a leadership change. The party cadre are feeling very low about the party’s prospects and feel the need for anoverhaul.” Key sources in the Congress added that it has been four months since state in-charge Rajeev Satav passed away, but the party has still not appointed a leader to replace him. “The appointment of a new state president and LOP is also hanging for a very long time, which is giving a clear advantage to the BJP. The national leadership’s laidback attitude is allowing theAAP to emerge as a strong opposition in the state. The BJP has aggressively started preparations for 2022, while the Gujarat Congress is still waiting,” added a source in the Gujarat Congress. Ahmed Patel’s loss makes things worse:The demise of veteran national leader Ahmed Patel, who used to advocate for the state Congress, has also created a vacuum in the state Congress leadership, say sources in the party. “Now, there is no one of the stature of Ahmed Patel who can make a representation to the central leadership about pressing issues in the state unit,” said a Congress member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-congress-feels-let-down-ahead-of-2022-polls/articleshow/85638433.cms||Kapil Dave

Work of laying pipes has been completed along this route. “Work was halted on this stretch on June 30,” said Arvind Karmadi, managing director of the Sewerage and Infrastructural Development Corporation of Goa (SIDCGL). Prior to June 30, excavation of this road was carried out at a frenzied pace to meet the high court deadline to complete the laying of sewerage lines for 3.4km and that the compliance report could be filed at the end of the month. However, nearly two months later, authorities are yet to take up repair works. The stretch has turned dangerous for motorists due to the numerous road cuttings, potholes and bulging manholes for the sewer chambers. Karmadi said road soling has been completed, and they are awaiting the supply of cold tar as hot tar cannot be used during monsoon. Colva panch member Pio Furtado said residents along the route as well as motorists are having a tough time owing to the decrepit road condition as well as dust pollution due to the movement of vehicles. Another resident pointed out that it is dangerous to travel along the stretch as both sides of the road are uneven – one side has the pipeline while the other side has sewerage chambers. When contacted, PWD assistant engineer Prakash Pai, attached to the corporation, said that details about the delay and cost of re-surfacing the road stretch should be sought from SIDCGL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/work-on-sewerage-pipeline-leaves-colva-road-in-shambles/articleshow/85638435.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Though the scheme expired in January last year for Sellur and Thiruparankundram shelters, the unexpected onslaught of Covid-19 pandemic has now made it difficult for them to feed the homeless in their care. The corporation had established these centres in coordination with NGOs. P Ramar, managing trustee of Madurai corporation Shelter for Urban Poor in Sellur, says they cannot complain about the funds being stopped as they were told that the central government would fund them for five years from the commencement of the shelter. ``But since about Rs 50,000 from our monthly funding stopped, we have been finding it difficult to manage the homes,” he said. The Sellur shelter was the first to be established under the programme in Madurai. Though it was not initially funded by the corporation, it got its funding under DAY-NULM in 2015. It was given Rs 50,000 a month, both for management and operational expenses, including Rs 300 a month for each inmate it housed. There are 14 such shelters funded under the scheme in various stages of their five-year agreement. Ramar says what was not expected was the Covid pandemic and its consequences. ``Now we run the entire home with public donations, which are usually in the form of groceries and rice. Sometimes, donations made in the form of money are used to pay salaries to staff, including cook,’’ he said. One of the healthier inmates is being paid Rs 3,000 for cleaning the home now, after the funding ended. Even now they have around two new people knocking on their doors every day, but are forced to turn them away. Considering the crisis, if the government extended the funding for another five years it would go a long way in helping homeless urban people, he said. ``There are many who are willing to donate and help, but now due to the pandemic they are providing for many people. So we cannot approach them for monthly running of the shelters,’’ he said. Corporation sources said that the decision on the funding had to come from the central government as it was the funding agency for the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/pandemic-worsens-fund-woes-of-madurai-corpns-first-shelter/articleshow/85640544.cms||---

The Mukkudal police have registered a case against seven people including the mother of the children. While the first child was two years old when the mother sold her, the second child was sold just days after delivery. Preliminary inquiries by child protection agencies who rescued the children revealed that they were the children of Rajeshkumar of Tirupur and Devi. The couple had separated earlier this year. Devi, who was in her early stages of pregnancy with her second child, sought help from a relative in Mayilapuram near Mukkudal in March to sell her 2-year-old daughter. The child was sold to a childless couple. Meanwhile, she also signed an agreement with another childless couple from V K Pudur for the unborn child. A few days ago she gave birth to the baby in a private hospital in Surandai and gave the baby to the couple. She sold the kids for nearly Rs 2 lakh. Based on a tip, the children were rescued by the district child protection unit (DCPU) and handed over to a child reception centre in Tirunelveli on Tuesday. “We are in the process of securing the accused. Only after inquiry we will know the entire story,” police inspector M Anitha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mom-among-7-booked-for-selling-2-children/articleshow/85640576.cms||---

But to feign ignorance for making political gains is indeed an offence against society. The speaker and his party are doing the same. The sinister attempts to divide people along communal likes by twisting recorded history are unpardonable,” he claimed. “All rice-eaters know the motive behind the efforts to equate the one who sacrificed his life for the fulfilment of the one-nation concept and the other who tried to establish a Moplah nation. How can Variamkunnath Haji who murdered several Hindus of his own country be equated with Bhagat Singh. Can MB Rajesh cite a single instance where Bhagat Singh killed Indians, including policemen?” he asked. Muraleedharan said CPM shouldn’t forget that BJP rules the country as per provisions of the Constitution. He wanted Rajesh to clarify whether he has designs to install Variamkunnath Haji’s statue in the Parliament or the state assembly. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sinister-motives-in-speakers-remark-says-union-minister/articleshow/85638477.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: A fifth of women moved from informal to formal sector since 2010, finds study||NEW DELHI: A study conducted by the Institute for Human Development (IHD) on women working in the informal sector in Delhi found that one-fifth of them migrated from the informal to the formal sector between 2010 and 2019. This study is based on a repeat survey of 900 working women of the original 1,400 women contacted in 2010. According to the study, three out of 10 women changed their job between 2010 and 2019. “Women moved out from construction labour, domestic work and vending and moved into sales workers, tuition or teaching, beautician and helper or assistant in offices and factories,” says the study, which was shared at a webinar on ‘Women’s work in Delhi: Dimensions, challenges and emerging issues’ organized by Institute of Social Studies Trust and IHD last week. The study suggests that women who are more experienced, possess higher educational qualifications and belong to higher income groups, are upper caste and non-migrants have a bigger probability of mobility from informal to formal sector compared with other groups. It says that education qualification (graduates have 3.5 times higher probability than unlettered women) and experience are the two most important factors of mobility from the informal to formal sector. Among the challenges faced by the workers in the informal sector are poor working conditions, long working hours, lack of safety or security, lack of credit facility and space to work and changing technologies. The study says only four out of 10 women were aware of various welfare schemes of the government. “Many women engaged in the informal sector are unable to benefit from the several government schemes due to lack of documents or the cumbersome processes,” said Balwant Singh Mehta, who conducted the study. Professor Alakh N Sharma, director, IHD, said, “As across India, women workers in Delhi are also overwhelmingly in vulnerable employment such as domestic work and vending. Providing such informal workers with social security driven largely by the government should be an important policy agenda.” To improve the condition of workers of the informal sector, the study recommended the creation of a national database on informal workers with regular updating. Such workers should be assisted with documentation to link them with existing social security and welfare schemes. The study also suggested that small vendors could be helped with workspace and protected from harassment by authorities, while domestic workers could be recognised with appropriate regulation for payment and working conditions. “Workers engaged in unskilled activities should be provided relevant skill training…. After training, those who are interested in self-employment or entrepreneurship should be provided a start kit and initial financial support to purchase raw material, and also assistance provided in linkage to market,” advises the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-fifth-of-women-moved-from-informal-to-formal-sector-since-2010-finds-study/articleshow/85638460.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Speaking to reporters after a review meeting with bankers in the district on Wednesday, he said that it was the duty of the government to ensure that students from the deprived sections of the society had access to higher education. He added that the government should also ensure that this was implemented in a phased manner. The disbursement of loans to students had decreased over the last few years and that has affected both the urban and rural students, hence a representation was made to the district collector to enhance the provision of educational loans to students. A review meeting to this effect was held at the collectorate on Wednesday, which was attended by district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar, corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan, bankers and chief education officers. It was decided that all the schools should appoint an officer to register the documents required for obtaining education loans for students, who have completed their plus two in the institutions. A service centre for education loans is to be established at the Madurai district collectorate, which would have a telephone number and email address for communication, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/banks-target-rs-500cr-worth-edu-loans-this-year-mp/articleshow/85640559.cms||---

Several have stopped submitting homework and some have not been uploading answer scripts. Given the drastic drop in the number of attendees—sometimes, only half the strength are present in some online classes on certain days —teachers are calling up parents, pointing out kids were losing out on valuable learning time. In some case, even principals are meeting the guardians of “habitual absentees”. But even parents are pleading helplessness, saying they are not being able to motivate the children to attend online classes regularly. Some said their kids faked weak internet connection to stay away from classes. Many parents have gone back to office and so, they said, could not monitor them the way they used to when they worked from home. “This is the natural outcome of a system that is not suitable for schoolchildren. Children between 10 and 17 years are restless. We are keeping them seated in one place within a camera range for at least four hours of lesson time. There is no refreshing variation that a school with classmates offers,” said Sujoy Biswas, principal of Ram Mohan Mission School. Loreto Convent Entally principal Jessica Gomes Surana has been meeting parents of absentees. “One child has not attended classes for over two months. Many sit in front of their gadgets but don’t attend classes. Children are demotivated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-play-truant-as-screen-fatigue-sets-in/articleshow/85638471.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Delhi||HC allows south Delhi colony residents to use park for mourning||NEW DELHI: Carving out a one-time exception, Delhi high court on Wednesday allowed residents of a south Delhi colony to use a local park to mourn those who died due to Covid-19. Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva allowed the plea of residents of Greater Kailash-1 after the south corporation agreed to hold a prayer meet for the departed souls, but on the condition that the park won’t be damaged. The court pointed out that the park in any case is being maintained by the local residents’ welfare society, which spends money for its upkeep even though the corporation is the land owning agency. The court recorded the stand of the SDMC counsel while adding that the same permission can’t be treated as a precedent and is being given in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. In their plea filed through advocate Shivam Goel, the residents challenged a recent circular of SDMC banning the holding of mass public functions such as cultural and religious events, weddings and political rallies in city parks. The society, through its president Mahesh Kumar Gupta, urged the court to intervene, citing the lack of any alternative space for the function. They pointed out that there is no community hall available which can host such a function and since the park is maintained by the local funds, the prayer meet should be allowed in it. SDMC then made its nod conditional on the residents not erecting any “pucca” structure in the park and Covid-related norms will be followed, an assurance that was readily given by the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-allows-residents-to-use-park-for-mourning/articleshow/85638509.cms||Abhinav Garg

A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh acted on a plea filed by NGO Srishti Madurai Educational Research Foundation. The plea said DCPCR gave a considered opinion that the Delhi government and its health department should declare a ban on medically unnecessary, sex-selective surgeries on intersex infants and children except in cases of life-threatening situations, but no decision had been taken on the opinion till date. “The issue of sex-selective surgeries or medically unnecessary normalising surgeries has a long-lasting drastic psychological impact on the minds of intersex people and deters them from even seeking medical attention in future. This aspect is proved by recent news reports that examine the reasons behind the reluctance to seek medical help despite having symptoms of Covid-19 among a significant number of intersex people,” the plea contended. The petitioner sought direction to the government to frame a detailed policy or guidelines specifying the conditions when medical surgery on intersex infants and children can be performed. The plea added that the issue of such surgeries may not be trending news or an issue that gains prominence in front pages of newspapers, but it is indeed an issue that is prevalent in the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-on-sex-selective-surgeries-hc-seeks-govt-reply/articleshow/85638688.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Agra||Govt hospitals in Uttar Pradesh run out of beds as viral fever infections shoot up||AGRA: Government hospitals in Agra and three neighbouring districts are reeling under a severe shortage of beds after a drastic spike in cases of viral fever in the region. In the last two weeks alone, at least 25 patients have succumbed to the viral infection in government facilities in Agra, Firozabad, Mathura and Mainpuri districts. In several hospitals, two to three patients are being forced to share a single bed. The Firozabad district hospital had no vacant beds on Wednesday. Neelam Devi, whose three-year-old child was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of viral fever, said there was also a lack of doctors and medical staff at the children’s ward. Chief medical superintendent of Firozabad medical college, Dr Hansraj Singh, told TOI that additional beds were being added to the general ward while the number of beds in the children's ward had been increased to 75 from 20. Community health centres have also run out of medicines, according to residents of rural areas in the four districts. Chief medical officer of Agra district, Dr Arun Kumar Srivastava, told TOI that teams of doctors are being sent to affected villages to distribute medicines. “Change in weather conditions has resulted in the outbreak of viral fever. Teams of doctors and health staffers have been tasked to provide required assistance in rural areas.” Doctors told TOI that the incidences of viral fever — and even its intensity — were higher this season when compared with the corresponding period in previous years. Dr Saubhagya Katiyar, who practises at a government hospital in Shahjahanpur district, said over 70% of the patients arriving at the outpatient department in their facility were suffering from viral fever. “Symptoms of viral fever include body and muscle pain, headache, joint pain, redness of eyes, skin rash and nasal congestion. Some also experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. This time, the symptoms of viral fever are more intense compared with previous years.” Vimal Mohan, a resident of Tiwaha village under Agra's Fatehabad block, also claimed that there was not a single house in the hamlet without a patient. “At least 20 people from my village have been admitted to a hospital in Agra in the last 24 hours. Two patients died last week. A team of doctors visited us on Sunday and provided medicines. But many are suffering since there is no arrangement to admit them at the community health centre and hospitals in the city are now full.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/govt-hosps-in-up-run-out-of-beds-as-viral-fever-infections-shoot-up/articleshow/85635716.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Tabla virtuoso Pt Subhankar Banerjee loses Covid battle||KOLKATA: Pt Subhankar Banerjee, who accompanied several top artists in the country, besides being one of the most expressive tabla soloists, passed away on Wednesday ending a two-month-long battle following his Covid-19 infection. The tabla virtuoso, 55, is survived by wife Nibedita, daughter Aahiri and son Aarchik. Despite being double-vaccinated, Banerjee got infected in June. According to the statement from Medica Superspeciality Hospital, where he was transferred on July 2 with ECMO support, “He was suffering from severe Covid ARDS with septic shock. He subsequently developed right sided broncho-pleural fistula and thus prolonged ECMO was required. Later, he developed post-Covid complications and acute renal failure.” A few days before his demise, his musician friends including Pt Tejendra Narayan Majumdar, Pt Ajoy Chakraborty, Ustad Rashid Khan, Pt Kushal Das, Pt Bickram Ghosh, Pt Tanmoy Bose and Pt Debojyoti Bose visited him at the nursing home. “While listening to a 20-year-old recording of a concert of ours, Subhankar could recognise which one was being played. His path-breaking style inspired not just his tabla students but also young instrumentalists and those who took talim elsewhere. On Thursday morning, his mortal remains will be taken to his residence before being kept at the West Bengal State Music Academy’s premises for people to pay their last respect,” Majumdar said. One of the busiest accompanists, Banerjee had the rare privilege of being witness to Pt Shiv Kumar Sharma and Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia flying down to Kolkata to play for a concert organised to celebrate his 50th birthday. Banerjee would fondly recall how Ustad Zakir Hussain had introduced him at a concert in his father’s memory saying: “People say that I am the best tabla player in the world. But that’s not true. I am among the 15 good tabla players in the world. Subhankar is also one among them.” In January 2020, the maestro had performed a solo concert in Kolkata in the memory of his mother and mentor Kajalrekha Banerjee. Banerjee had started taking music lessons from the age of four under Pt Manik Das of Benaras gharana. Subsequently, he became a disciple of Pt Swapan Shiva of Farukhabad gharana. “He was no star son. He had no star guru. True talent was his only godfather,” said Pt Bickram Ghosh. A guru to many, he was also conferred the Sangeeth Samman and Sangeeth Maha Samman by the state government. On social media, sarod maestro Ustad Amjad Ali Khan wrote that Banerjee gave “a different dimension and meaning to tabla”. “I’ve known him since childhood. This is the saddest day of my life,” said Ustad Rashid Khan. “He was both traditional and contemporary. His sense of raagdari gave an edge to his solo performances,” Pt Tanmoy Bose said. Describing him as an “elder brother”, santoor player Rahul Sharma said, “He was a refined and cheerful person.” Flautist Rakesh Chaurasia called him the “laughing Buddha”. “He was an accomplished singer and a good composer. In 2008, he conceived ‘The Sacred Drum of India’ ensemble which had four drummers and me as the melody player. He had done all the compositions too,” he said. Sitarist Niladri Kumar described him as a “thinking tabla player”. Banerjee would painstakingly study recordings and adapt his playing style according to demands of instrument and playing styles of artists he was accompanying. His versatility, unique style of playing complicated compositions and improvisational dexterity gained him international acclaim and made him a globe-trotting artist. Once while performing in France, even cops were puzzled since he had crossed over Paris four times in three days. The reason was back-to-back shows in Paris, Barcelona and Zurich. Apart from his performance at the Nobel Peace Prize concert, he had collaborated with John Mclaughlin, Chico Freeman and Gil Goldstein. With albums like ‘Tabla Tale’, ‘The Art of Tabla’ to his credit, he also composed music for ‘Night of the War’, ‘Space’ and ‘Dark Street’. As sitarist Purbayan Chatterjee said: “Both emotionally and musically, we are poorer without him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tabla-virtuoso-subhankar-banerjee-loses-cov-battle/articleshow/85638518.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

So far, at least three or four GHMC colonies — including Uttam Nagar in Malkajgiri GHMC circle and Vijayapuri Colony (Tarnaka) in Secunderabad GHMC circle — have achieved cent percentage vaccine coverage. In comparison, not a single colony under SCB has managed to do so. SCB officials blame it on shortage of vaccines and inordinate delay in vials being allotted to its centres. “Also there is still a lot of hesitancy among people...Even though we have opened enough centres, the footfall isn’t very impressive,” said an SCB official. The board has about 300 colonies under its limits, with a population of 3.89 lakh. Officials say they have opened as many as 10 centres for people to take the vaccine. Meanwhile, Uttam Nagar residents are elated over the commendation certificate for 100% vaccination. “There are over 1,400 households here and every resident, including 18 years and above, have taken the shots,” said former general secretary of of Uttam Nagar Colony RWA, K Raghavendra Rao.

On Wednesday, the civic authorities blocked a long road stretch behind Bidyut Bhavan near Karunamoyee to put a new bituminous layer on the battered surface. The stretch, locals said, had got badly damaged with craters and potholes all along. The civic authorities have also laid new bituminous surface on the road stretch near Tank No. 9. Road patchwork has also started on some of the worst lanes inside blocks. A stretch at AB AC block market also was repaired on Wednesday. With the road conditions in Salt Lake deteriorating, civic authorities had taken up patchwork of roads in several parts of the township a month back, specially on lanes inside the blocks using the Rs 30crore funds sanctioned by the government for BMC. But incessant rains put a stop to the work. “With a pause in the rains we are repairing the most damaged stretches using the available fund,” said a civic official.

Venkatesan said the KVPY scheme has been designed to encourage students having scientific temper by providing fellowships and grants for pursuing higher education and taking up research careers. But it requires improvement to serve the purpose well and for ensuring poor and downtrodden sections to be benefited by availing the same. The MP said that most of the students writing SSLC and higher secondary examinations have regional languages as the medium of instruction. “According to the notification for the KVPY, the question paper would be in English and Hindi only. It is inherently biased towards those students having regional languages as medium instruction,” he said. This would affect students belonging to oppressed sections in large numbers by keeping them out of fray in the initial round itself. He requested the minister to notify ensuring that the question papers are made available in Tamil and other regional languages too. Stating that the examination fees were fixed at Rs 1,250 for general candidates and Rs 625 for SC/ST and disabled candidates, he sought reduction in the same as it would deter those from economically backward families. He sought more centres for the examination to be held on November 7.

The study is being conducted to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a two-dose regimen of BBV87 in healthy adults at nine clinical trial sites across five countries with endemic chikungunya. Bharat Biotech has joined hands with the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), which is leading the Global Chikungunya vaccine Clinical Development Programme (GCCDP), for BBV87. The study is being funded by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) with support from Ind-CEPI mission of Department of Biotechnology. Apart from Clinica San Agustin in Costa Rica, trials will begin in Panama and Colombia by September and in Thailand and Guatemala soon after, Bharat Biotech said. The inactivated whole virion vaccine, based on a strain derived from an East, Central, South African genotype, has completed standard pre-clinical studies, and elicited optimum immune response in phase-I trials in India, the company said. As part of the tie-up, CEPI or Bharat Biotech may look at third-party manufacturing of stockpiles of investigational product to be used for further clinical trials in outbreak conditions to advance vaccine development, it added. The global partnership will provide critical data for further clinical development of the vaccine with the hopes of meeting CEPI’s goal to develop, license and gain WHO Prequalification for a Chikungunya vaccine and make it accessible to affected populations||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bharat-bio-begins-multi-nation-trials-for-chikungunya-vaccine/articleshow/85639883.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

She could even identify monuments and national symbols,” the mother told TOI. Born in 2016, Aaradhya was supposed to join kindergarten in 2020, but it could not happen because of the lockdown. “I started homeschooling her to keep her engaged and to keep her away from gadgets. I found that she has special liking for learning new words after she picked up Hindi and English,” said Indumathi.“To celebrate the 75th Independence Day, I taught her names of states, tourist spots and RTO codes, which she learned in just 10 days. I gave her more challenging tasks and she did them with ease. Now, she can even identify the monuments on currency notes. When we visit orphanages, slums and villages, she is keen to teach children there and share the knowledge. She even educates people on the cause of Covid-19, symptoms of the disease and preventive measures to be taken,” Indumathi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/5-yr-old-enters-record-book-for-photographic-memory/articleshow/85638543.cms||Sampath Kumar

Fatalities too saw a surge in the state. A total of 216 deaths were added on Wednesday—the highest so far this month. There have been two days this month when the state reported over 200 deaths. On all other days, deaths had been under 200. The city’s daily toll was four, taking the total to 15,956. With these, the total caseload rose to 64.4 lakh and deaths climbed to 1,36,571. Mumbai’s caseload jumped to 7.4 lakh and deaths 15,956. A senior official said the jump in fatalities at the state level was due to some districts adding old deaths to the tally—Pune Municipal Corporation alone added 50 deaths while Satara district added 34. At the state level, the daily caseload in five of the eight administrative circles in the state registered an increase, with cases in the Mumbai circle rising from 631 on Tuesday to 777 on Wednesday. Pune registered the sharpest rise from 1,876 to 2,506. The increase in the other three circles was Nashik from 748 to 762, Aurangabad from 9 to 29 and Akola from 7 to 27. State government officials said with easing of curbs a slight rise in cases is expected, though districts have been asked to ensure an effective testing and tracking mechanism.  A senior BMC hospital doctor said an increase in daily test numbers could result in higher detections. In Mumbai, 42,723 tests were done to detect the 342 cases on Wednesday while state-wide tests had increased from 1.9 lakh on Tuesday to 2.08 lakh. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC is gearing to conduct more tests daily as the festive season nears.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/at-342-mum-records-most-cases-in-3-wks-state-highest-aug-deaths-at-216/articleshow/85634929.cms||---

Among the recent interesting findings is an extremely big storage jar. Dr R Sivanantham, commissioner of Tamil Nadu state archaeology department and site director of the Keeladi excavation, said that the storage jar was found at a depth of 348cm in Keeladi. It is a red slipped ware having an inturned rim. The neck less rim was exposed. The portion below the rim has a banded thick rope design. This thick banded rope design is enclosed by grooves on top and bottom. He said a set of two banded rope designs imitate the same but it is relatively thinner. The northern portion of the jar was exposed. The south-western part of the rim was crumbled due to pressure from above. Two centimeters is the thickness of the rim, and the external diameter of the rim is 34 cm and the internal diameter 30 cm, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/large-storage-jar-unearthed-in-keeladi/articleshow/85640649.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Pandemic drives more aspirants to write Telangana Engineering Agriculture and Medical Common Entrance Test||HYDERABAD: Over 43,000 more candidates appeared for the Telangana Engineering Agriculture and Medical Common Entrance Test (TS-Eamcet) this year when compared to 2020. A primary reason: the Covid-19 pandemic, said experts. While many students took the test to keep their options open — as is the case in most years — several others chose Eamcet because they want to stay back in Telangana for their education, given the current situation, experts added. As many as 1,47, 991 candidates appeared for the engineering stream exam this year as opposed to 1,19,183 last year. The agriculture and medical stream saw 79, 009 candidates take the test. In 2020 this number stood at 63,857. “It is likely that all engineering seats will get filled this year as many are looking at joining colleges in Telangana amid the pandemic. In fact, this year, the number of qualified candidates is higher than total number of engineering seats in the state,” said A Govardhan, rector, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad and convenor, TS-Eamcet 2021. He added that going by registrations and number of candidates appearing for the exam, many from the Telugu states are likely to opt for a seat here. Govardhan’s claim was seconded by Satti Trinadha Rao, whose son Karthikeya secured first rank in the state. He said he wouldn’t rule out his son opting to study engineering at JNTU-H.“While IIT, Bombay is his first choice, we would fall back on JNTU-H if the need arises,” said Rao, a civil engineer. The fact that the test was conducted before other entrance exams, including JEE and NEET, organised by Centre, and the deadline (to enrol) was extended multiple times giving aspirants four months to apply for the test — as against the usual 35 to 40 days every year — are also being cited as other reasons for more students appearing for Eamcet-2021. Some academics, meanwhile, maintained that the test provided more options. “It is good to have multiple options at times like these as there is a lot of uncertainty. I think students and their parents want to explore all possibilities just in case some exams get postponed or cancelled,” said Sushma Bopanna, academic director, Sri Chaitanya Group. As many as 7 out of top10 rankers in engineering stream and 9 out of top 10 rankers in AM stream are students of Sri Chaitanya Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pandemic-drives-more-aspirants-to-write-eamcet/articleshow/85639802.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The local crime branch of Chhota Udepur police arrested seven residents of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh and seized 33 stolen bikes from them. Police said that one of the accused identified as Suresh Kalesh was nabbed near Handod in Sankheda taluka with a stolen bike. When Kalesh was questioned about the bike, he said that he had stolen it from Bodeli and was taking it to his native place to sell it. On further interrogation, he revealed that he was part of a gang that steals bikes and sells it in Madhya Pradesh. “The gang targets bikes that are not locked and parked on road during night hours. They then take interior roads to go to Madhya Pradesh and sell them for as low as 10% of the bike’s original price,” said Dharmendra Sharma, superintendent of Chhota Udepur police. Investigations revealed that the gang had been stealing bikes for the last three years and selling them to only those people who ride them within Madhya Pradesh. Based on information shared by Kalesh, six of his accomplices named Dumsing Sasatiya, Kitam Tomar, Dilu Dawar, Kanu Bhaidiya, Nartam Bhaidiya and Kina Bhaidiya were also nabbed.

---||Hyderabad||Hawala transactions of Rs 16 crore to human hair merchant via Chinese betting apps: Enforcement Directorate||HYDERABAD: Enforcement Directorate (ED) investigations have revealed that around Rs 16 crore was paid to human hair merchants by Chinese online betting app companies as part of hawala transactions. Two hair exporting firms based in Hyderabad are said to have received Rs 3.4 crore from the Chinese companies. The firms received money for domestic sales to merchants in north-east through illegal Chinese app owned by Linkyun Technology Private Limited and Dokypay Technology Private Limited Company’s Paytm accounts. The two companies are being probed by Hyderabad police and ED. “...It was found that many domestic merchants were aggregating and selling raw hair to foreign merchants based in Hyderabad, Guwahati, and Kolkata...these are smuggled out of India via road via points at Moreh (Manipur), Zokhawtar (Mizoram), Aizwal (Mizoram) to Mandalay (Myanmar). Ultimately, it finds its way to China where they are labelled as domestic Chinese hair and processed,” ED said. The ED said that, as a result, Chinese traders were able to avoid import duty of 28% and also earn 8% export incentives by claiming smuggled Indian hair as Chinese. Indian exporters are also suspected to be under-valuing exported hair to evade import duties in recipient country. “A few Myanmar citizens are permanently stationed in Hyderabad, are purchasing human hair locally and then exporting it to Myanmar using the IEC code of Indian persons/entities at under-valued prices. The difference amount is settled either locally or through hawala channels,” the ED said. Investigators are now analysing purchase, export prices and quality. Prima-facie, it is suspected that hair exported to Myanmar, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Austria etc are under-invoiced. Evidences have further revealed that some entities have been receiving payments against sale of hair in bank accounts of their employees who withdraw the cash and hand it over to the owners. Most exporters were found not maintaining proper books of accounts and evading income tax liabilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hawala-transactions-of-rs-16cr-via-chinese-betting-apps-ed/articleshow/85640160.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The decision regarding this was taken on Wednesday by the civic body following government directives. The Ganesh festival starts from September 10. Last year Ganesh festival was not celebrated due to Covid-19 restrictions. However, this year with the situation gradually improving, the state government had on Tuesday announced relaxation for Janmashtami and Ganesh festival. Surat Shaher Ganesh Utsav Samiti had raised the issue of Ganesh festival earlier with the government. Till 2019 around 65,000 big and small Ganesha idols have been installed in the city. Of the 18 ponds, five will be constructed in Katargam zone, three each in Athwa, Varachha and Udhna zones. Two ponds will come up in Rander and one each in Central and Limbayat zones. “SMC will develop the ponds as it was done in the past. We have started the process to identify the locations,” said an official. Following environmental concerns, immersion of Ganesha idols and other deities in Tapi river was discontinued and devotees were encouraged to immerse idols in artificial ponds or at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/18-artificial-ponds-to-be-made-for-ganesh-immersion/articleshow/85634734.cms||---

Knight Frank India’s latest survey titled “India buyer survey 2021 - living in the times of Covid-19” stated that more than half of the respondents in the city were inclined to shift to a new home and 55% expressed their willingness to purchase a second home in the next one year. Of those surveyed, 57% expected the price of their current residence to increase by 10-19 per cent in the next one year. This, experts believe, is a quantum shift towards optimistic sentimental value as more than half reported a decline in the value of their primary residence since the start of the pandemic. “Hyderabad’s housing market has been very optimistic on various key parameters across buyers’ sentiments. Larger green open spaces, access to good healthcare and proximity to workplace areas anchored as the key features to influence purchase decision,” said Rajani Sinha, chief economist and national director – research, Knight Frank India. The survey indicated that the 54% reported an increase of 9% in their spending capabilities. “While IT firms continued to grow in their core business, Hyderabad continued to be a promising residential destination for end users and investors alike. Interestingly, the attitudes of the home buyers have been positive when it comes to spending propensity,” said Sinha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/many-in-city-inclined-to-move-homes-eye-second-abode-survey/articleshow/85640202.cms||---
---||India||Amid demands for caste census, Congress asks Centre to remove 50% quota cap||Congress has reminded the Centre that there is an urgent need to remove the 50% cap on reservations if measures for social justice are to have any real impact, seeking to lob a political hot potato towards the ruling BJP amid renewed hype over a caste census following the meeting of a Bihar delegation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Underlining there are over 30 states and UTs which have exceeded the 50% cap on quota, Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi on Wednesday said, “It is important to constitutionally legitimise the reservation percentage in excess of 50% which in a sense is in a legal ‘trishanku’, that is in suspended animation, with challenges pending in courts and lack of clarity about their legality and validity.” He stressed that the breach of 50% in some states includes EWS quota. Singhvi said the government and Parliament recently gave the states the power to make their own OBC lists but “there is no scope of implementing those lists” as most of the states are in excess of 50% quota. “Surely, the Parliament was not intending to pass an empty 127th Constitutional amendment Bill,“ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-demands-for-caste-census-congress-asks-centre-to-remove-50-quota-cap/articleshow/85643641.cms||---

This include 9,100 out of the 11,000 doses supplied to members of the civil society.As it was the highest one-time supply of vaccines to the district so far, resident welfare associations, industrial organizations and associations for differently-abled were roped in to inoculate as many as people as possible.“The civil society model worked in Coimbatore to vaccinate people where there is good support from industrial bodies, resident welfare associations and NGOs,” collector G S Sameeran said.Usually, vaccines arrive in the evening and the plan for vaccination on the next day is chalked out based on the allocation received.“The scenario was entirely different on Wednesday as we were anticipating only 35,000 doses and we had planned accordingly the previous day. But when we learned that 50,000 doses will be arriving, we delayed vaccination in the morning to plan more camps so that people were vaccinated,” the collector said.Wednesday being an immunization day, our existing healthcare system was occupied with immunizing newborn and pregnant women.Nevertheless, we tried to push it through other government staff outside the immunization campaign, he added.Going a step ahead, we engaged members of civil society for the first time. However, they were given vaccines to immunize only the priority category and not for conducting general camps, he said.The collector said they had sought more allocation of vaccines for Coimbatore citing low seroprevalence.The prevalence of antibodies was only 43% of the population in Coimbatore compared to 80% in Chennai in the serosurvey carried in July this year.To give a perspective on the extent of increase in vaccination supply to Coimbatore district, a senior health department official said on an average 19,000 doses were supplied a day till a month back. This was increased to 23,000 a fortnight back and now it has crossed past 38,000 doses.Founder of Namma Kovai, an NGO, M Edwin received 500 doses of vaccine to inoculate elderly people at home and daily wagers who return late from work at Periyanaickenpayam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coimbatore-receives-single-day-highest-of-50000-vaccine-doses-on-wednesday/articleshow/85638571.cms||Sampath Kumar

Places prone to accidents would be identified and safety measures would be enhanced. CCTV cameras will be installed at junctions and traffic flow will be monitored live. If a stretch is congested, immediate action would be taken to divert vehicles through other roads. This will reduce the delays in public transport movement, making buses a more reliable option. The system can be updated periodically according to the development of the city in future,” he said.Authorisation letter has been given to the private companies to conduct meetings with stakeholders such as the traffic police, Road Users Association, Lorry and Private Bus Operators Association, transport officials and representatives of airport and railway. “The process of appointing a nodal officer on behalf of the corporation is under way. The officer will coordinate between the private companies and stakeholders,” an official with the corporation’s engineering wing said.The study is in progress and the report is expected soon, corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara told TOI.

"WWF India is already involved in the conservation process, but now we will conduct research involving experts from Wildlife Institute of India to study on the most favourite pools where dolphins frequent," the DFO added. At present, there are 41 dolphins in the sanctuary. Gangetic dolphins fall under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act and have been declared an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. "We are planning to develop the reserve on the lines of Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary near Bhagalpur in Bihar. But it requires an exhaustive survey and the reserve will be made where the largest concentration of dolphins are found. Those deeper pools provide a conducive environment for the breeding of these dolphins," DFO Kumar further said. Elaborating, he said, "It should not be mistaken with captive breeding, but it will be done in situ, which means, on-site conservation in the natural population and environment of the species." Notably, there has been a steady rise in the population of Gangetic dolphins in the region. For instance, from 22 in 2015, the population rose to 41 in the 2020 census. The WWF-India and Uttar Pradesh forest department’s divisions of five districts - Bijnor, Meerut, Hapur, Amroha and Bulandshahr - have been involved in the conservation of National Aquatic Animal since 2012. Last year on October 5, on the occasion of World Dolphin Day, director general of Namame Gange Rajiv Ranjan had flagged off 'My Ganga, My Dolphin' campaign at Bijnor and also inaugurated the introduction of Dolphin Safari to attract tourists in the region. Later, UP's principal chief conservator forest had directed DFOs to constitute a dedicated Dolphin Protection Force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/now-dolphin-conservation-reserve-to-come-up-with-aim-to-increase-population-base-and-boost-tourism/articleshow/85635806.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Hyderabad||Telangana, HC slugfest over GO 111 & Kokapet auction proceeds||HYDERABAD: The state and Telangana high court on Wednesday made their stands more rigid over removing non-catchment areas from the purview of GO 111, with the HC even warning the government that it would not allow access to Kokapet auction amount. “We will order opening of an escrow account to keep the Kokapet auction money. You will not be allowed to lay your hands on it till you develop drains and sewerage treatment plants for high rises planned there,” an HC bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy warned after state rejected the non-catchment area report of Environment Protection Training and Research Institute (EPTRI), insisting it would wait for its high-power panel’s report instead. The EPTRI, it can be recalled, had said that 948 acres from Vattinagulapalli village was outside the catchment area and could be removed from GO 111. Panel did nothing: HCAgni Agrotech, which has 17 acres in the village, had pointed out that Kokapet was closer to the twin reservoirs but officials allowed construction there and denied them similar benefit. Responding to a query from HC on Tuesday on whether CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had ever told media he wanted to scrap GO 111, additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao said the CM had only commented that he was waiting for the expert panel’s report. When Rao said that the state was actively pursuing the matter, the bench shot back: “We know how actively the high-power panel is working. It did nothing in four and half years. It should be disbanded. In fact, non-catchment areas is not even in the terms of reference of your panel. But the same officials gave clearance to Kokapet auctions for revenue and ignored requests from similarly situated neighbours in Vattinagulapalli.” Rao contended that Vattinagulapalli land was part of the catchment area and sought three more months for the panel to submit the report, adding that Agni Agrotech, which has waited for 13 years, could wait a little longer. The bench, however, said it would consider the request for more time only if the state too agreed to wait for the auction money and posted the matter to Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-hc-slugfest-over-go-111-kokapet-auction-proceeds/articleshow/85640684.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

A policy envisaging this landmark change has been approved by NITI Ayog under the Centre’s National Monetisation Pipeline, an asset monetisation mechanism for central public sector entities announced in this year’s Budget. As per the policy, most commercial activities under the Kalka-Shimla toy train section will be given to a private company, which may include ticketing, coach maintenance, tracks maintenance, cleanliness, tuck shops contracts, platform maintenance and other passenger amenities. However, track repair and replacement as well as railway safety assurance will be vested with the ministry of railways. Privatisation will include signaling system, overhead electrification lines, overhead equipments (OHE), and general maintenance of tracks. Ambala divisional railway manager Gurinder Mohan Singh said, “The policy has been notified by NITI Ayog, but I am yet to go through the points of the policy. Yes, privitaisation was on the charts and it may be implemented.” The process to privatise the section has been initiated and it may come into existence by the end of 2022, reads the NITI Aayog report. Key assets for monetisation over the financial year of 2022 to 2025 include 400 railway stations, including Chandigarh railway station, with 1,400km of the rail network and four hill railways, which include Kalka-Shimla section.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kalka-shimla-toy-train-section-to-be-privatised/articleshow/85638589.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: GMB, GIDC get onboard GIFT train||AHMEDABAD: After the exit of debt-ridden Infrastructure Leasing & Finance Services (IL&FS) from Gujarat International Finance Tec-City Co. Ltd (GIFTCL) last year, Gujarat government has recently roped in two state government-owned entities with a proven track record in infrastructure development as equity partners in the company. The government has, in the process, ruled out the option of bringing a private entity on board. Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC), a nodal agency that develops industrial estates, presently owns about 20% stake in GIFTCL while Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), the regulator for all non-major ports and port-led development in the state, recently picked up 20% equity stake, said sources in the state government. To further strengthen the base, the government has infused equity to the tune of about Rs 425 crore. This was after IL&FS completed the sale of its 50% stake in GIFTCL to the Gujarat government, represented by Gujarat Urban Development Company Ltd which holds the remaining stake. IL&FS received Rs 32.71 crore as equity value for shares as sale consideration last year. The total paid up capital for GIFTCL was about Rs 65.40 crore about a year ago and this has gone up to about Rs 490 crore presently. While GUDC has infused fresh equity to the tune of Rs 225 crore thereby holding about 60% stake in GIFTCL, GMB and GIDC have each invested Rs 100 crore for a 20% stake each, said an official of GIFTCL. “With the government taking full stake in GIFT City, confidence among all stakeholders of GIFT City has been reinforced. The Centre’s continuous support to GIFT City has further boosted the image of the project. After this move, we have seen substantial growth trajectory in terms of participation by financial institutions and those associated with international financial services,” said Tapan Ray, MD & Group CEO, GIFT City. There are over 250 companies that have started operations at GIFT City which is being developed on a sprawling 886 acre-plot near Gandhinagar. It employs over 12,000 people currently. It houses the country’s first International Finance Service Centre (IFSC) which has attracted leading international and domestic players across the financial services spectrum, ranging from banks, asset management companies, alternate investment funds and professional services firms since its establishment in 2015. Banking transactions at GIFT IFSC crossed $100bn in value by the end of July 2021. “GIFT City is on a strong footing today. With GMB and GIDC as equity partners after IL&FS’s exit is an indicator that the government is not considering partnership with any private entity in near future. From a time when GIFTCL officials were reaching out to companies, a stage has been set today where companies come calling to GIFT City to set up businesses here,” said a senior government official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gmb-gidc-get-onboard-gift-train/articleshow/85635798.cms||Maulik Pathak

While the centre at CMCH is also receiving good response, it is not so at the eight government hospitals in the district.“If we open a vial, at least 10 people have to be vaccinated. But we don’t get as many number of people to vaccinate at a time. Hence, we wait till a group of 10 people or at least 5 people come to the centre for vaccination,” a staff member of a government hospital in the district said.Awareness needs to be created in rural areas on the availability of such centres, he added.Collector G S Sameeran had announced that the round-the-clock vaccination centres will operate in 8 government hospitals besides CHCM and ESI hospital in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/round-the-clock-vaccination-centres-receive-good-response/articleshow/85638581.cms||---

Three bus routes that ply on Vivekananda Road too will be rerouted through CR Avenue from either Esplanade or Poddar Court. Six others that presently enter Beadon Street from CR Avenue, will take the BK Pal Avenue route. “We found at least five bus routes will have to be rerouted for this demolition,” said a Jorabagan traffic guard officer. This will include 43 and four minibus routes including Shyambazar-Metiabruz, Shyambazar-BBD Bag, Belghoria-Nimta, Alampur-Ultadanga, Nagerbazar-Howrah, 13 and 13A. “We needed to ensure that bigger and slower moving vehicles do not block Rabindra Sarani-Beadon Street stretch before they reach CR Avenue. Importantly, we wanted Beadon Street-CR Avenue crossing to be less congested,” explained an officer. Meanwhile, with bus pressure set to increase on CR Avenue, cops are hoping to clear the extra pressure felt at Posta with a portion of Strand Road still shut. “We want the Strand Road section to be fully operational to ensure CR Avenue and MG Road both function smoothly. For that, smaller equipments used for demolition must be removed,” said an officer. Howrah Bridge traffic guard sources pointed out that poor road condition might hinder work. KMDA has sent a letter to KMC to carry out repairs. Till reports last came in, KMC had completed an inspection and will start repair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-take-steps-to-ease-flyover-work/articleshow/85638599.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Chandigarh||Middukhera killing: Cops send teams to UP, Delhi||Mohali: Mohali police have interrogated three gangsters and 35-40 other criminals to get leads in SAD youth wing leader Vicky Middukhera’s murder case, but to no avail. So far, they have been able to gather only one clue: spotting the Hyundai i-20 car used by the killers speeding on the Chandigarh-Delhi national highway, heading for Delhi or western Uttar Pradesh. Police spotted the car in CCTV footages of some roadside dhabas near Ambala. In spite of all this, police have been claiming that they have got vital leads in the case and the killers would be arrested soon. Vicky was killed in Sector 71 marker on August 7. Two men were seen shooting at Middukhera while he was getting into his SUV. Middukhera sustained 12 bullet injuries and the postmortem revealed that 10 had pierced through his body, whereas two had to be extracted out. Sources in the Mohali police said they felt the assailants must have fled to Delhi or even to western UP. Teams have been sent to trace the assailants in Delhi and UP, said sources. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Satinder Singh said, “Our teams are working round the clock and we are close to cracking the case.” Mohali police have grilled gangsters Sukhpreet Singh alias Buddha, Aman Jaittu and Bhupi Rana, but failed to collect any concrete intel from their interrogation and ruled out their role in the crime. Police have also questioned 35-40 other criminals associated with Devinder Bambiha gang as well as others who are directly or indirectly involved or associated with other gangsters. The day Middukhera was killed, handlers of Devinder Bambiha gang’s Facebook page had taken responsibility for the crime, saying that he had been passing information to Lawrence Bishnoi gang. Later, gangster Sampat Nehra had said he would avenge the s killing in a Facebook post. He had posted: “You killed one, we will kill four – wait and watch.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/middukhera-killing-cops-send-teams-to-up-delhi/articleshow/85638649.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Delhi||Afghan Sikhs find safety but not jobs and amenities||NEW DELHI: As the situation began worsening late last year, the decision to flee his country of Afghanistan was a no-brainer for Chabul Singh. A year later after settling in India, the 54-year-old and his family still cannot avail government healthcare or get jobs because they have neither been granted Indian citizenship nor provided Aadhaar, Pan or voter's ID cards. Singh relies on menial jobs that bring in a maximum of Rs 15,000 a month. That, and some assistance from NGOs, are all that he has for survival. This sorry state is why Sikh and Hindu refugees from Afghanistan are keener to fly to Canada or some other country rather than live in India. TOI spoke to a number of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, some of whom have lived in Delhi for over a year now, and most desired citizenship to be speedily provided to them for easier integration into society. They also coveted the state refugee status, which could open up opportunities for them. “We are happy, of course, that we came to India and we weep to think of the situation back home,” said Chabul Singh, who is grateful for the assistance given by NGO United Sikhs, which provides him and 10 other families a subsistence amount of Rs 15,000 every month. “We are in touch with other families in Kabul who are ready to cross the border, but the fact remains that we are yet to receive Indian citizenship so cannot work, vote or even receive basic necessities from the state.” Deep Singh, 62, was lucky to have arrived in India in September 2020 from Kabul with five family members. Those coming now are on stricter visa conditions with no permission to work or receive education, he said. "People who reached India last year are still awaiting assistance to resettle, so it will be even tougher for the families that come now. We are grateful to the Indian government, but we also need official help in the coming months to avail basic amenities,” Singh said. Ahmad Zia Ghani, Afghan community leader who has been leading protests outside the office of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, insisted that the Afghans reaching India had the right to education and employment. “A refugee card and an assurance that we can resettle in other countries would be beneficial and we can feel safer,” said Ghani. The deprivation faced by Afghan Hindus and Sikhs in Kabul delayed a recent rescue flight, with a bunch of the refugees aspiring to fly to Canada or the US rather than India. Parvinder Singh Nanda, director, United Sikhs, noted that the visa being issued at present clearly mentions that those reaching India cannot do any jobs, business or avail education, all deterrent to the desperate people fleeing Afghanistan. “The families we have been supporting for over a year now are still facing big problems,” said Nanda. “We have been able to provide them access to healthcare at the mohalla clinics with the assistance of Delhi government. However, Aadhaar or Pan cards cannot be made for them and this makes it almost impossible for them to study or find jobs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/afghan-sikhs-find-safety-but-not-jobs-and-amenities/articleshow/85638635.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

T Kannan, 46 of Chinnamanur, comes from a traditional family of potters for over six generations and they specialised in making idols of local deities such as Muthalamman and Karuppanasamy and others. ``Thirty six years ago, we also started making the festive Ganesha idols, but have never used chemicals or plaster or paris,’’ he said. He said his family including his son Venkatesh and brother specialised in making Ganesha idols in Bombay style. “We browse the net, and make these idols with a difference, where the deity can be seen seated on lions, horses and other animals, in a throne like a king, or with two or three heads, or with other deities like Lord Shiva or Parvathy,” he said. Unlike the moulded idols, they design every portion of the idol by hand using quality mud, and it is dried in the shade and then painted. The idols range from Rs 40 for a three inch statue to three feet which costs about Rs 1500. They have started delivering the idols at the door steps. ``We tried sending them in parcels to many places, but as the parcel service did not take care, sometimes it breaks, so now we only deliver by hand,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/theni-idol-maker-offers-home-delivery-of-eco-friendly-ganeshas/articleshow/85640697.cms||---

The ED summoned top Telugu film director Puri Jagannath on August 31. Actors Rakul Preet Singh, Bahubali fame Rana Daggubati, Ravi Teja, Charmee Kaur, Navdeep, Mumaith Khan, Tanish, Nandu, and Tarun also have been summoned along with Ravi Teja’s driver Srinivas and an unidentified person working as a general manager of ‘F Club’. They have been asked to remain present before ED between September 2 and 22. Rakul Preet was asked to appear on September 6, Rana on September 8, Ravi Teja on September 9 and Mumaith Khan on September 15. Puri Jagannath and Rakul PreetAn ED official said 12 cases were booked by Telangana excise and prohibition department and 11 chargesheets were filed. “Eight drug traffickers were chargesheeted in the cases then. Most of them are lower-level drug traffickers. Tollywood celebrities will be considered as witnesses for now. Their names have figured in the investigation,” he said. The ED also summoned excise department sleuths who investigated the case. The special investigation team (SIT) of the excise department had not proceeded against the actors due to lack of evidence then though they were questioned. They were believed to have been given a clean chit then as no chargesheet was filed against them. SIT in July 2017 collected hair and nail samples of 62 suspects, but did not reveal much afterwards. One of the chargsheets was filed against South African national Rafael Alex Victor for allegedly trafficking cocaine from Mumbai to Hyderabad and for selling it in Hyderabad. Rafael was arrested in August 2017. In a majority of the cases, African nationals, who were lower-rung traffickers, were chargesheeted. When SIT questioned the accused actors, they denied their role in the drugs case. Navdeep and Tarun denied their role.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-summons-top-tollywood-stars-in-2017-drug-bust-case/articleshow/85640717.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The NHAI has issued a circular notifying that vehicle user fees at 14 toll plazas in the state will be hiked by 7% to 10% from September 1. The trade body made this appeal considering the economic impact of the pandemic, fuel price hike and poor maintenance of highways. Jegatheesan said that the additional increase will further increase the financial burden of the trade and industry, truck owners, bus operators and general public. The prices of all essential commodities like vegetables, fruits, grains, paddy, edible oil and milk and non-essential commodities would be increased heavily due to toll fee hike. “There is a rule that toll charges should be reduced when the number of vehicles passing through toll gates increase,” he said. The chamber also pointed at poor amenities such as lack of ample parking facilities on the highways that has caused many accidents and deaths.  The NHAI and contractors should look to fix these instead of burdening commuters.  Jegatheesan said that the government should present a white paper on fees collected by toll plazas in the state, their profits and spending on upkeep of the roads maintained by them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/forego-yearly-toll-fee-hike-tn-chamber-to-govt-nhai/articleshow/85640711.cms||---

In July 2019, a special CBI court found Solanki and five others guilty of the murder and sentenced them to life imprisonment. Solanki filed an appeal in the HC against his conviction. In 2020, the apex court, in response to a PIL, ordered expeditious prosecution in criminal cases pending against MPs and MLAs. Solanki sought priority in hearing of his appeal on the basis of the SC order, and the HC agreed to hear the appeal out of turn. Jethava’s father, Bhikhalal, objected to the priority hearing and approached the SC insisting that Solanki’s appeal should not be heard out of turn. According to lawyers involved in the litigation, the SC has clarified that no priority would be given to MPs/MLAs in hearing of criminal appeals. It also remarked that the HC had misunderstood the order and taken the appeal out of turn. It directed the HC not to hear the appeals of Solanki and co-accused persons out of turn. The apex court clarified that its order of expeditious proceedings was about criminal trials and nothing connected to the appeals should be heard on account of its order, sources said. The high court was to hear the appeal earlier this week, but pending Jethava’s plea in the SC, the hearing was adjourned. Meanwhile, Solanki has filed an application in the high court for suspension of sentence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sc-stops-hc-from-hearing-ex-mps-appeal-out-of-turn/articleshow/85635858.cms||---

While special schools are still closed, schools catering to visually-challenged and hearing-impaired students, which come under the ambit of the Chief Educational Officer, are set to reopen for Class IX to XII by September. “We have started making preparations in terms of sanitization of the campus and classrooms for reopening in September. We have been teaching through videos with sign language. However, it is far from being an alternative for regular classes in school,” said Joyce Mary, principal, YMCA Kamak higher secondary school for the hearing impaired. The principal however said that with the syllabus reduced, it should be easier for students to only learn what is required. Similarly, schools for visually-challenged students are also looking forward to reopening and have started making arrangements. Covid-19 vaccination is also being ensured for staffs. “We have been having online classes through teleconference calls where students can listen and communicate through audio with teachers. Though students are used to it, it is still difficult for them to pick up so they will be glad to have regular classes in classrooms again,” said Roshan Fathima, General Secretary, Indian Association for Blind (IAB), Madurai. Special educators further stressed that more than regular students, differently-abled students need the classroom environment and physical presence of teachers to learn. Suganthi A, a parent of a Class XII hearing-impaired student, said that her son is missing the feeling of going to school. “We are a family of farmers and have two sons who are hearing-impaired and a daughter so sometimes it is a burden for us. Going to school is the only way for our sons to have a bright future ,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/school-reopening-to-bring-big-relief-for-disabled-children/articleshow/85640716.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Hostels must ensure Covid-19 safety measures are followed,” said S Vel Deva, district secretary, SFI. He also added that it is the responsibility of the government to reopen schools and colleges in a safe manner. The protesters held posters and shouted slogans. They said that especially with the third wave of Covid-19 being expected, the students should not be left vulnerable to Covid-19. Similar protests were staged outside the district collector offices in Chennai, Trichy, Coimbatore, Salem and Tirunelveli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sfi-demands-vax-for-students-before-reopening-institutes/articleshow/85640733.cms||---
---||Madurai||Pregnant women continue to cold-shoulder anti-Covid vax||Madurai/Trichy: Even though the anti-Covid-19 vaccination drive for pregnant women began in July, hesitancy and mistrust have ensured that only less than 50% of them in Madurai have taken the jab so far. In Trichy city, only 21% of pregnant women were vaccinated as of August 24 as against almost half in the rural areas. Being a a vulnerable group, doctors have urged pregnant women to avoid misconceptions and take the vaccine. In Madurai district, according to DPH data, as on August 23, a total of 15,119 pregnant women among the total 31,173 identified for the period 2021-2022 have received at least the first dose. Out of 9,162 total antenatal mothers in Trichy city, only 1,952 were vaccinated whereas rural blocks such as Manikandam, Manachanallur and Marungapuri have vaccinated 44% to 52% of their targeted population. “There is no shortage of stocks of the vaccine now and close to 20,000 adults are being vaccinated a day in the district. However, there is some hesitancy from families when it comes to pregnant women. Such fear is completely unfounded,” said Dr S Senthil Kumar, deputy director of health services, Madurai. He said efforts are being taken at grassroots level by village health nurses (VHNs) to allay fears of families in this regard. “Since a majority of pregnant women in Trichy city rely on private clinics for screening, we are approaching them to support us in vaccination,” Dr A Mohammed Hakkim, coordinator of urban vaccination camp said. PHCs, on which pregnant women heavily depend in rural areas, have been managing to convince and vaccinate antenatal mothers during periodical examinations. Dr N Sumathi, HOD of obstetrics and gynaecology at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), said arrangements have been made to immediately get any pregnant women or lactating mother to get Covid-19 vaccine when they come in for OP visits if they are willing. “However, so far, despite awareness, many are not coming forward voluntarily as we would like. Families often fear complications in pregnancy due to the Covid-19 vaccine though so far there has not even been a single such case,” she said. The doctor further said that some are also considering putting off getting the vaccination till after the delivery. A number of southern districts also recorded less than 50% coverage of pregnant women in Covid-19 vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/pregnant-women-continue-to-cold-shoulder-anti-covid-vax/articleshow/85640718.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s sector — the container of family life||In many a novel and movie of yore the country side is painted as a place of peace, honesty, values and strong community bonds. The city on the contrary is a place of crowded living and exploitative working almost becoming a villain - inducing vice and poverty. This connection between untamed urbanisation and societal decay became clear to many a planner in the early 1900’s as the industrial world reeled under the impact of haphazard, ill planned towns. As a counter point to this, the concept of smaller units of functional, self-contained and desirable neighbourhoods with a manageable social, administrative and service infrastructure started developing. We finally realised that if we wish to rebuild our cities we must first rebuild our neighbourhoods. By the time Chandigarh was planned there were many attempts world-wide to create such neighbourhoods. The first master plan for Chandigarh created by Albert Mayer consisted of such neighbourhood units — three of which combined to give a super block which was a self-sufficient module with its own primary schools, markets, generous green areas and restricted vehicular traffic. It was almost like a modern village relearned from the existing settlements on-site. Later when Le Corbusier took on the planning he too claimed to be making a big village with a neighbourhood unit as its module declaring — “The sector is the container of family life”. Measuring 800 m x 1200 m, Corbusier’s sector was based on an ancestral geometry based in the past on the stride of a man, ox or a horse, but in Chandigarh adapted to mechanical speeds. This self-sufficient unit would have its own primary school, dispensary, post office; daily needs market and a hierarchy of green spaces from the house yards to the central green of the sector. Low-rise houses had been scaled well with roads to give a sense of intimacy to the neighbourhoodTo minimise inflow of traffic through the sector, the main roads circling it were allowed to enter only at four points — one from each side of the sector. This simple decision prevented frequent disturbance of the traffic on the V3 while maintaining the serenity of the neighbourhood. Further no commercial activity was allowed in the residential part of the sectors to maintain peace. A loop road connecting the four entries further branched out into the interior of the sector dividing the sector into four parts. Incidentally, the only two sectors that do not follow this geometry are Sector 7 and 8 which, at the insistence of Mayer, were planned on the lines of his superblock with three divisions each. Besides houses the most important component of a mohalla is the shopping area which goes beyond being a place of commerce to become an important node of social and cultural exchange. The typical bazaar is usually the stage for many interactions and transactions that actually provide the bond and anchor in the community — a vital component in a city of immigrants. Corbusier thus placed the sector shopping right in the middle of the sector ensuring that a resident could walk up to the market from any corner of the sector in ten to fifteen minutes. This shopping street provided services necessary to daily life like grocery, vendors, repair shops, etc. An interesting feature is that the shopping street of one sector continues across the V3 into the shopping street of the sectors parallel to it. This not only makes the shops of the neighbouring sectors more accessible but also connects the city from east to west without having to venture on the busier main roads dividing the sectors. An early sketch of a self-contained sector which took into account all the needs of its residentsThe final layout and fleshing out of the sectors was done by Jane Drew, Maxwell Fry and Pierre Jeanneret and somehow the linear rows of houses could not recreate the spontaneity and organic nature of indigenous settlements. The overriding reason was a need to minimise the expense on services like water supply, sewerage and electricity wires by placing them as closely and linearly as possible. The sector offers lessons worth emulating as we strive to house teeming millions. A few adjustments could still show the way to creating humane and sustainable habitats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarhs-sector-the-container-of-family-life/articleshow/85639603.cms||---
---||Delhi||NGT directs committee to suggest remedial action for pollution by illegal factories||New Delhi: National Green Tribunal has directed the monitoring committee appointed by the Supreme Court to undertake a study of the situation and suggest remedial action required after a plea claimed that illegal factories and commercial activities in Nai Sarak are causing pollution. The petitioner claimed that solid and liquid waste generated from units in the area is being unscientifically discharged. The tribunal said the committee may not limit its deliberation only to the area specified by the applicant but also cover other such places in the city. The plea filed in NGT stated that the applicant is a resident of the area and on account of illegal factories and other commercial activities, noise and other kinds of pollution are caused, which continues throughout the night. Industrial safety norms required to be observed in carrying out hazardous activities are not followed, the plea said. The tribunal observed that the issue of industrial or commercial activities in residential or non-conforming areas in Delhi has been a subject matter of consideration by the Supreme Court since 1996. “We direct the monitoring committee to undertake the study of the situation and remedial measures required. DPCC will be the nodal agency for coordination and compliance,” said the bench.

---||Ahmedabad||Castor sowing likely to get a push amid delayed monsoon||Ahmedabad: With no scope for further cultivation of groundnut and cotton due to the stalled monsoon, more farmers may turn to castor crop provided the state receives rains over the next couple of weeks. Castor sowing usually picks up from the second week of August and lasts till mid-September. In case of delays in monsoon, farmers in Gujarat, the largest producer of castor seed in India, prefer castor crop, which requires less water, said agriculture stakeholders. About 3.78 lakh hectares have already been brought under castor cultivation this year as against 3.80 lakh during the same period last year, shows data compiled by the state agriculture department. “Farmers usually opt for castor cultivation when monsoon is delayed and there is no room left for sowing other crops. Castor will also be sown in areas where groundnut or cotton could not be sown due to the stalled monsoon,” said B V Mehta, executive director, the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA), a national body of vegetable oil industry. “With farmers getting good price for castor seed, I believe castor acreage is likely to increase this kharif season,” added Mehta. “If we get rains in next few days, castor cultivation will get a major boost,” added Dilip Padhya, chairman and managing director of Palanpur-based Amee Castor and Derivatives. Another reason for farmers to take up castor sowing is that the prices of the oilseed have spiralled to touch Rs 1,100-1,150 per 20kg. The price usually remained around Rs 950 two months back, said industry players. The price of castor oil, too, has surged from Rs 115 to Rs 130 per kg in past three days. Castor acreage had declined 15% to 6.3 lakh hectares in 2020-21 and the production was estimated at 16.2 lakh tonnes, according to the castor crop survey released by the industry body SEA. The average area under castor cultivation is about 6.37 lakh hectares, which will be achieved this year if monsoon revives in days to come, said sources in the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/castor-sowing-likely-to-get-a-push-amid-delayed-monsoon/articleshow/85635959.cms||---

While Sajjanar thanked the state government and senior officers for giving him a chance to serve the people as commissioner of Cyberabad, the development has triggered speculation that more IPS officers might be shifted soon as Hyderabad and Rachakonda commissioners have been in their current posts for over three and five years respectively. Stephen Ravindra, an alumnus of Nizam College and the University College of Science, OU, is a 1999 batch IPS officer. His father MB Ranjit worked as an ACP in the city. Stephen Ravindra worked as SP of Warangal, Karimnagar, Anantapur and DCP of East and West Zones in Hyderabad in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh. In Telangana, Stephen worked as Group Commander of Greyhounds, joint commissioner of Cyberabad, DIG of Hyderabad range and IG of West Zone. “I thank the chief minister for giving me this opportunity. My focus will be on IT corridor safety, women & children safety, cyber crime, road safety issues. The friendly policing initiatives of Telangana police and best practices of Cyberabad commissionerate will continue,” Stephen Ravindra said after taking charge.

---||Lucknow||Sainik School: Tale of Glorious Past, Promising Future||LUCKNOW: Sainik School, Lucknow, occupies a coveted position in the defence force. The institution which is funded by the state government, has produced eight lieutenant generals, three vice-admirals, one air marshal and seven major general officers. The school’s year-long diamond jubilee celebrations will conclude on August 27 with President Ramnath Kovind gracing the occasion as the chief guest. The boarding school, whose primary role is to imbibe officers-like qualities in students, is also the alma mater of the present chief justice of Guwahati high court, a former MP from Maharajganj, present chief secretary of Andhra Pradesh, among several other IAS officers and top official of the private sector. Established on July 15, 1960 in the regime of the then UP CM Sampurnanand, the school has the unique distinction of having one alumnus who received Param Vir Chakra (posthumously) and also others who received one Vir Chakra, two Shaurya Chakra along with several Sena medals. At present, the school has 450 cadets or students, including 60 girls. On Wednesday, cadets held a march past rehearsal ahead of the President’s visit. Speaking to TOI, Lt Gen Ravindra Pratap Sahi, vice-chairperson of UP state disaster management authority and the Sainik School alumnus (batch 1968-1972), said, “The school groomed cadets into gentlemen. It was the turning point of my life when the school and the faculty members helped me to achieve my dream of becoming an officer in the Indian army.” “The school trained us to become future leaders. Of the total 17 commands of the Indian armed forces, two are being commanded by the ex-cadets of the school--- Lt Gen Raj Shukla is the Commander in Chief of the army training command and Vice Admiral AB Singh is Flag Officer Commander in Chief of navy’s eastern naval command. My junior batchmate Sudhanshu Dhulia is chief Justice of Guwahati high court while Adityanath Das is the chief secretary of Andhra Pradesh,” said Sahi, a native of Deoria, who has led the country’s largest strike corps II based in Ambala. According to Colonel (retired) TBS Pangtey, another alumnus of the school, “Cadets of the Sainik School were the first recipients of UP government aid to promote mountaineering expeditions. Nine cadets under the age of 14 were selected to climb Mt Deo Tibba (in Kullu district) of 6001 metres height in September 1969, but only four managed to climb, including me. It was a record at that time.” Alumni of the school, who later turned non-armed force leaders, include Harsh Vardhan Singh former MP from Maharajganj, DGP (election) Tamil Nadu Ashutosh Shukla, Maj (retd) Sanjay Yadav, information commissioner, UP, Jagdeep Rai, former DRM Lucknow and district magistrate Baghpat Raj Kamal Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sainik-school-tale-of-glorious-past-promising-future/articleshow/85640850.cms||Arvind Chauhan

On August 25, 2007, twin blasts had rocked the city. Visitors at Laserium in Lumbini Park near the secretariat and customers enjoying snacks at Gokul Chat Bhandar at Koti were targeted by Indian Mujahideen terror operatives with improvised explosive devices (IEDs). In the blasts, 44 people had lost their lives and 68 others suffered injuries. Eleven years after the blasts, two IM operatives — Md Akbar Ismail Chowdhari and Aneeq Shafique Sayeed — were given the capital punishment, while the third convict Tariq Anjum was awarded life sentence by a local court in 2018. On Wednesday, Gokul Chat was shut as a mark of respect to those who had lost their lives. Syed Raheem (70) of Saidabad, who lost an eye in the blast at Gokul Chat Bhandar, paid tributes to the victims who lost their lives at the eatery. “I went to Gokul Chat to buy kulfi for my daughter, who was waiting outside in an auto. As I was about to approach the seller, an explosion occurred and I lost an eye. I had received Rs 5 lakh for medical expenses. I need Rs 50,000 every year to replace the artificial eye. My wife is bed-ridden. I have been doing rounds of the collectorate. I was assured I will get a house from the government, but so far it has not materialised. I appeal to the government to allot me a house and provide my son a job,” Raheem told TOI. K Chander Naik, 31, a tribal from Nalgonda district, was 19 when he lost an eye in the IED blast at Gokul Chat. “I was pursing BCom and now I have two Master’s degrees. Prior to the pandemic, I used to teach children how to operate computer, but currently I am unemployed. I have approached government officials and ministers for employment, but so far nothing materialised. I was advised to prepare for competitive exams, but I am unable to focus for more than few hours due to eye sight issues. I am married and we have two children. I hope government provide relief in the form of employment,” Chander, president of Terrorist Bomb Blast Victims’ Association, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2007-blast-victims-still-struggling-for-relief/articleshow/85640902.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Out of the 103 cases of Delta-plus detected till now, 17 were vaccinated with both doses, while 18 people had taken one dose. Delta-plus, which is a sub lineage of the highly contagious Delta variant, is present in 24 districts in Maharashtra. When it was first detected in June, it was found in six districts. Officials from the state health department said the variant was not spreading rapidly, and the new detections were merely the genome sequencing results being communicated in tranches. The count of Delta-plus patients in the state rose to 103 this week with an addition of 27 new cases in seven districts. In the latest batch, most cases were found in the districts of the Vidarbha region. However, the state stressed that Delta is still the predominant strain in Maharashtra accounting for over 70% of cases. In Mumbai’s own genome sequencing facility at Kasturba laboratory, 70% of the 188 samples tested came positive for Delta. About Delta-plus, Dr Pradeep Awate, the state’s surveillance officer, said most patients had mild symptoms or were asymptomatic. “We found that most had not taken the vaccine. Since the sample size is small, we are keeping a close eye on Delta-plus, including the symptoms it can cause and the severity,” he said. Of the 103 cases, 49 patients didn’t require hospitalisation at all. All patients, barring the five who succumbed, have recovered, said Awate. Among the deceased, all were above 65 years. Two were fully vaccinated and three hadn’t taken a single shot. Of the total Delta-plus cases, 56 are men and 47 women. The highest infections have been predictably found in the age bracket of 19 to 45 years. The highest cases of Delta-plus have been found in Ratnagiri (14), and that too a single taluka, Sangameshwar. Jalgaon has 13 cases and Mumbai has reported 11 cases so far. Nearly 12,000 Covid samples have been sent for genome sequencing from the state to Pune’s National Institute of Virology and Delhi’s CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. Awate said sequencing done in Mumbai’s Kasturba lab too has been considered. In Maharashtra, several sub-lineages of Delta, including AY.1, AY.2, Ay.3, which are presently labelled under Delta-plus, have been found so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-unvaccinated-account-for-65-delta-cases-16-had-2-shots/articleshow/85646765.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Manjinder Singh Sirsa loses seat, but SAD wins gurdwara body polls||NEW DELHI: Current Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) functionary Manjinder Singh Sirsa lost his Punjabi Bagh seat as the results of the gurdwara panel polls were announced on Wednesday. He lost his seat to Harvinder Singh. However, Sirsa’s party was able to win 27 out of the 46 seats to retain control over the gurdwara body. SAD (Delhi), led by Sarna brothers Paramjit Singh and Harvinder Singh, was able to win 14 seats. Manjeet Singh GK-led Jago party emerged victorious in only three seats. Sirsa was still nominated by SAD to DSGMC as a member under a provision which allows the panel to co-opt nine members besides those who win seats from the 46 wards. After the mandate, Sirsa tweeted, “We feel humbled and blessed to win 27 seats out of 46 in DSGMC elections. This win is the victory of Delhi’s Sangat. We bow our head to the honour bestowed upon Shiromani Akali Dal by the Sangat of Delhi.” SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said the victory was a referendum of the ‘Sikh quom’ on the Akali Dal’s panthic identity and commitment. “Profoundly humbled & touched to receive ashirwad of Akal Purkh, great Guru Sahiban & Shri Guru Granth Sahib Maharaj. Deeply grateful to the Sikh sangat across the world for blessings,” (sic) tweeted Badal. Manjeet Singh GK, a former president of DSGMC, was able to win his Greater Kailash seat by over 600 votes, while DSGMC general secretary Harmeet Singh Kalka was able to retain his Kalkaji seat. Besides running gurdwaras across the city, DSGMC also manages schools and hospitals, and has been at the forefront during the pandemic, providing free food, healthcare and assistance to the needy people. It has also been assisting Afghan refugees and feeding farmers who are protesting on the Delhi border against new farm laws. Voting for the elections, which had 3.4 lakh members of the Sikh community as listed voters, took place on Saturday. However, a low turnout of 37.2 per cent was recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sirsa-loses-seat-but-sad-wins-gurdwara-body-polls/articleshow/85638870.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Trichy||Plan to refurbish war memorial in Trichy||Trichy: Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) Trichy circle has proposed to strengthen and refurbish the dilapidated century-old World War I memorial without altering its architectural heritage at a cost of Rs 7 lakh. The memorial addressed as Pachampettai Valaivu (Pachampettai arch) situated on Lalgudi road near Valady in Trichy city suburbs was established in 1922 to commemorate the role of Indian soldiers who fought for allied powers’ victory. The two pillars of the arch are now weak, while the stucco appeared damaged due to the adverse weather conditions. This is the first proposal made towards the redevelopment of an unprotected ASI monument ever since the Trichy circle was formed last year. “Our conservation assistants will oversee the work which may go on for 3-4 months once sanctioned. Encroachments near the pillars will have to be removed, locals are supportive,” T Arun Raj, superintending archaeologist, Trichy ASI circle told TOI. The strengthening work will be initiated once the director-general, ASI, New Delhi gives the nod. Recently, Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi Siva requested the regional director (south) ASI to protect the memorial. Sources said there is a likelihood of the Pachampettai Valiavu making it to the list of protected monuments of ASI after the revival. The arch built with red bricks has the phrase ‘Lest We Forget’ and there is a stone tablet that reads that the commemorative structure was erected by Dewan Bahadur G Krishnamachariar and opened by Dewan Bahadur Sir T Desikachariar on August 10, 1922.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/plan-to-refurbish-war-memorial-in-trichy/articleshow/85638836.cms||Deepak Karthik

Issuing directions to this effect at a review meeting, district magistrate Abhishek Prakash said that in order to achieve the target the number of vaccination centres will be increased by organising special camps at schools, colleges, universities, government and private offices, banks, religious places and residential societies. The places where special camps will be held include the head office of the Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam, 10 big city schools, Kalicharan PG College and campuses of state universities among others. The special camp at Chota Imambara will also be revived. Similar camps will be organised in localities such as Khargapur, Patelnagar in Indiranagar, Malesiamau, Amrai, Aliganj, Abrarnagar, Faizullaganj and Dawood Nagar. In these places vaccination rate has been found to be low. Likewise, vaccination camps will be held in various apartments in Gomtinagar extension with the help of resident welfare associations. Chief Medical Officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said, “The directions issued by the DM will most likely be implemented from Friday after preparing a comprehensive plan. The camps will be set up in a phased manner for the targeted population of a locality. For instance, the camp at the Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam will be for the staff and families of the electricity department.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/admin-targets-40000-daily-vaccination-doses-in-capital/articleshow/85640926.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Airport flyway: HC upset with work progress||Lucknow: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court on Wednesday yet again seemed dissatisfied with the progress of construction work on the flyover between the airport and Shaheed Path. However, it has granted some more time to the authorities to finish the work and report back to it on September 10. A bench of Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh passed the order on a PIL filed by SK Singh. The petition raised the issue of bottlenecks owing to which construction is not making any headway. On August 10, the bench had pulled up the authorities concerned for starting work without acquiring adequate land. It had also directed them to sort out differences with land owners whose plots were falling in the way of the flyover. In compliance of the last order, LDA VC Akshay Tripathi, DM Abhishek Prakash, LDA special secretary Mahesh Kumar, municipal commissioner Ajay Kumar Dwivedi and managing director of UP Bridge Corporation Yogesh Pawar were present in court. It was explained to the bench that they were trying their best to resolve the differences with the land owners. Considering the pleas of the authorities, the bench said, “Earlier, 73% work was done and now it is claimed that 76% work has been completed. As such the position emerges that no substantial progress towards completion of the project has been done in the interregnum period from the last date on August 10 till date.” Directing the authorities, including Airports Authority of India, to place a further progress report on September 10, the bench directed the DM, LDA VC and MD of bridge corporation to appear before it then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/airport-flyway-hc-upset-with-work-progress/articleshow/85640970.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya
---||Trichy||10L jabs administered in Trichy||Trichy: Trichy district has crossed the 10-lakh mark in Covid-19 vaccination in the state after Chennai, Coimbatore and Salem. The health department solved the hiccups in locating the vaccination camps, which helped it fully utilise the allotted vaccines in the recent week. By sustaining the zero balance vial status in the camps, the district administration aims at covering 50% of the eligible population in the next few weeks. Health officials said that as of August 24, around 40% of the eligible population in the district was vaccinated with at least one dose of either Covishield or Covaxin. Trichy district has 20.93 lakh people eligible to take jabs. While 8.37 lakh people have received a single dose, around 2.19 lakh people have received both the doses making it crossing 10 lakh doses. The vaccination gained momentum of late as the health department streamlined the allotment and protocols in publicising the locations based on the block-wise vaccination coverage that had happened so far. “We have roped in village panchayat functionaries and volunteers to spread the information about vaccination camps and encourage vaccination. By improvising the camp organising strategy, we are completely utilising the vials allotted within 36 hours,” A Subramani, deputy director of health services, Trichy, told TOI. As the district records zero or minimal vials as balance, allocation of fresh vials in the next phase is ensured in an adequate number by the state health department. Manachanallur block, which has only 27% vaccination coverage and high active Covid-19 cases, were allotted more vials in the recent days. Similarly, Musiri, Manapparai and Thiruverumbur blocks that have high active cases were given preference. Earlier the venues were announced only 9-12 hours before the launch of the vaccination drive, but now, the district administration is announcing the locations 15-18 hours in advance. “Covering more than 50% of the eligible population is our target. In the past one week, we have vaccinated more than 72,000 people,” the DDHS said. In the next five days, around 20,000 people having their due date for the second dose are likely to be vaccinated in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/10l-jabs-administered-in-trichy/articleshow/85638874.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Delhi||Delhi: Over 16k applications received, more than 11k e-learners’ licences issued in two weeks||NEW DELHI: Exactly two weeks ago, Delhi government became the first state in the country to introduce online tests for learners’ licence and has been issuing nearly 900 e-learners’ licences a day. It was among 33 “faceless services” of the transport department that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launched on August 11 so that all transactions can be done online sitting at home. Some e-learners’ licences were issued from zonal offices on a trial basis from August 9. Delhi also became the first state to introduce an artificial intelligence-based facial recognition feature, which matches the photo of applicants with the same on Aadhaar cards to ensure that only genuine candidates appear for the online test. “Till 10am on August 25, 15,798 people had applied for the test and 11,370 applicants were issued e-learners’ licences. The number of applicants who failed the test is 1,109, while 4,428 applicants didn’t appear for the online test,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI. “Under the dynamic leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi has set an example for the country thanks to the scale of faceless services being provided, which means that no applicant needs to come to the motor licensing officer or an officer in any zonal office,” he said. “Delhiites now have true freedom from long queues, and we have been able to roll out the services in a smooth and glitch-free manner. Whether you are at home, office or a cyber cafe, Delhiites can do all these things at their convenience without taking a leave from work or visiting a transport office,” Gahlot added. The department started faceless services on a trial basis on February 19 and has accepted more than 3.5 lakh service requests online. The department plans to make regional transport offices a relic of the past as Delhiites wouldn’t need to visit one for almost any transaction. In case of any problem, applicants can call the helpline of Door Step Delivery of Services on 1076. Three deputy commissioners will also be deputed at the zonal offices in Surajmal Vihar, Dwarka and Sarai Kale Khan for redressing any grievance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-16k-applications-received-more-than-11k-e-learners-licences-issued-in-two-weeks/articleshow/85638913.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Mumbai||Told to avoid second dose after reaction, executive from Navi Mumbai seeks help for nod to take locals||MUMBAI: Eager to get on with life and his sales job, Navi Mumbai’s Sabyasachi Dev had enthusiastically taken the Covid vaccine almost three months ago. But he suffered a severe reaction and was advised against taking the second dose. Dev took it in his stride, but is now feeling discriminated against after the state made complete vaccination a must to board local trains or enter malls. “I am in a limbo… I can’t access basic facilities for no fault of mine,” the 44-year-old told TOI. TimesViewVaccine certificates will inevitably become a critical part of the new world, but the problematic aspects about access or hurdles faced by people in getting the doses cannot be disregarded by the state. While access granted to fully vaccinated people is no doubt based on scientific advice, authorities must keep a window open for exceptions. Some epidemiologists have argued that people who have taken the first dose or those who have recently been infected should be allowed some relaxation as well.Certain he is not the only one in this Catch-22 situation, Dev has raised the issue with health minister Rajesh Tope, the civic health department, even BMC and the Mumbai mayor through social media, but is yet to get a response. Dr Archana Patil, director of state health services, said: “We will see what can be done.” Suresh Kakani, BMC’s additional municipal commissioner, said it may be difficult to make exceptions for individuals. “Very few people in the city have suffered from a serious allergic reaction,” he said. Till June, Mumbai had reported 66 serious medical events after vaccination. The day after taking his shot on June 1 at a private hospital in Belapur, Dev recalls waking up with periorbital swelling, blood-red eyes and blurry vision. He rushed to a private hospital in Koparkhairane, where the doctor on duty diagnosed it as a post-vaccination reaction. The doctor wrote: “He has post-Covid vaccination anaphylaxis. So he is not a candidate for the second dose of Covishield vaccine”. That evening, he felt a sharp pain in his eyes as the lights came on in his house. He rushed to an eye specialist, who put him on a steroid course. A third physician, too, opined that it was better to avoid the second shot. After recent reports about mixing of vaccines, Dev had hoped he could take Covaxin, but doctors said it was not allowed yet. “I work in sales, which requires regular meetings with clients in Mumbai,” he said, adding that he is spending hours on commute because he can’t board the trains. Dr Mukesh Agarwal, who heads the city’s adverse event post-vaccination committee, said it was unlikely to anaphylactic reaction. “It’s a serious reaction that can become life-threatening quickly if an adrenaline injection is not given on the spot. A second dose is contraindicated only in such cases,” he said, adding that in regular allergic reactions, people are advised to go for a second shot as the benefits outweigh the risks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-told-to-avoid-2nd-dose-after-reaction-exec-seeks-help-for-nod-to-take-locals/articleshow/85638950.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Delhi||Settle dues row: Supreme Court to Unitech, Noida officials||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Noida authority and Unitech Group to find a "pragmatic" solution on the dues to be paid by the company to the authority which has raised a demand of over Rs 8000 crore. The Centre-appointed new management of the company though contended that the amount has been arrived at in “complete disregard” of the agreement. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said both the parties should be flexible in their stand as it was necessary to revive the real estate company to protect the interests of 15,000-odd homebuyers who invested their money a decade back but are still waiting to get possession. Terming the demand of Rs 8,063 crore by NOIDA and Greater Noida authority by adding penalty and interest as unreasonable, Unitech Board of Directors urged the Supreme Court to waive off those components and direct the authorities to only demand the principal amount. The bench said if the authority insisted on payment of the amount demanded by it then it would not be possible to revive the Unitech projects and, no one, including the authority, would get anything. "We are not saying that you will not be paid anything . We are not going to accept the contention that no payment is to made to you. You are a public body and you also need funds. So give realistic estimates of dues," the bench told the authority. Advocate Ravindra Kumar, appearing for the authority, hit out at the new management and told the bench that the resolution plan was framed behind its back. It told the bench that the authority made several calls to the head of the Board of Directors, but he did not respond. The bench suggested that they forget the past and sit together to find the way out so that interest of home buyers is protected along with that of the authorities. Unitech, in its application, said it had been allotted land by competitive bidding in Sectors 96,97 and 98 in 2006 and in Sectors 113 and 117 in 2008 but Noida authority has still not been able to give complete and absolute rights for land allotted. It said, “Major portion of leased land was under litigation between Noida and landowners, for over four years, making the project land not utilisable. Noida has shifted the burden of enhanced compensation on Unitech. Noida is even charging interest and penal interest without basis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/settle-dues-row-sc-to-unitech-noida-officials/articleshow/85638961.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Delhi||No bail unless homebuyers’ money returned, Chandras told||New Delhi: As the forensic audit of Unitech Group revealed that its promoters had diverted thousands of crore of rupees paid by home-buyers and banks to off-shore tax havens, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said Sanjay Chandra and his brother Ajay Chandra will be not allowed to come out of jail “until and unless some money comes back”. “You will have to wait until and unless some money from foreign countries comes back,” a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah told senior advocate Vikas Singh who pleaded that Chandras are behind the bars for the last four years and that they should be granted bail now. Singh said that Chandras are not fly-by-night operators and they should be granted relief. But the bench replied, “Your clients know where the money is.” The interim audit report said high value investments were made in off-shore tax-havens, which was later written off. “Between 2007-2010, three subsidiaries of Unitech made investments of Rs 1,745.81 crore in ten companies in Cyprus. Between 2016- 2018, an amount of Rs 1,406.33 crore or 80% of the total investment value was written off while the remaining amount of Rs 339 crore is appearing as equity investments in the books of accounts,” the report said.

Fatalities too saw a surge in the state. A total of 216 deaths were added on Wednesday—the highest so far this month. There have been two days this month when the state reported over 200 deaths. On all other days, deaths had been under 200. The city’s daily toll was four, taking the total to 15,956. With these, the total caseload rose to 64.4 lakh and deaths climbed to 1,36,571. Mumbai’s caseload jumped to 7.4 lakh and deaths 15,956. A senior official said the jump in fatalities at the state level was due to some districts adding old deaths to the tally—Pune Municipal Corporation alone added 50 deaths while Satara district added 34. At the state level, the daily caseload in five of the eight administrative circles in the state registered an increase, with cases in the Mumbai circle rising from 631 on Tuesday to 777 on Wednesday. Pune registered the sharpest rise from 1,876 to 2,506. The increase in the other three circles was: Nashik from 748 to 762, Aurangabad from 9 to 29 and Akola from 7 to 27. State government officials said with easing of curbs, a slight rise in cases is expected, though districts have been asked to ensure an effective testing and tracking mechanism. A senior BMC hospital doctor said an increase in daily test numbers could result in higher detections. In Mumbai, 42,723 tests were done to detect the 342 cases on Wednesday while state-wide tests had increased from 1.9 lakh on Tuesday to 2.1 lakh. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC is gearing to conduct more tests daily as the festive season nears.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/at-342-mumbai-records-most-cases-in-3-wks-state-highest-aug-deaths-at-216/articleshow/85639049.cms||---
---||Pune||Infrastructure for third wave ready in Pune district: Divisional commissioner||PUNE: Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao on Wednesday said 12,000 additional beds for Covid-19 patients could be made available for use in a week in the district, taking the total number to 20,000 ahead of the possible third wave. “We were told to be ready for one-and-half-times the number of patients during the peak of the second wave, which was on April 19 in Pune district. The administration has readied the adequate health infrastructure for the same,” Rao said. Over the last two months, 8,000 beds Covid-19 were made ready in the district. The infrastructure is in place to add another 12,000 beds in a week’s time in private and government facilities, which would push up the total capacity to 20,000 beds. The state anticipates that 65% would require home isolation and 35% patients would require hospitalisation in case of a third wave of Covid-19. Rao, the Pune divisional commissioner, said the district had concentrated on oxygen availability and oxygen storage front, too. Over the last one month, the administration managed to increase the production of daily oxygen by 55 metric tonnes (MT) and in the next two-three weeks, another 50 MT would be added. “The daily production would increase by 100 MT from the existing supply through our Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants and oxygen generation plants,” Rao said. During the second wave, the oxygen requirement went up to 360 MT per day in the district. The state directed all the local administrations to make arrangement for three times the oxygen supply. The divisional commissioner said they had readied up to 1,200 MT storage facilities. The district administration is also maintaining a close watch on Covid norms violations, especially after large scale opening in all the three administrative units. “We are encouraging residents to follow the protocols instead of taking just punitive action,” Rao said. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said the third wave likelihood and severity was speculative as of now. “It would largely depend on people and whether they follow protocols or not. Proper preparedness is important so that we are not caught off-guard,” he said. “We are taking abundant precautions and it (third wave) is most likely to be mutated and delayed unless there is a new variant of concern,” said the task force member. He also said barring five-six districts, the rest of the state appeared to be out of the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/infra-for-third-wave-ready-in-dist-divisional-commissioner/articleshow/85638996.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Trichy||1st indigenous coal-fired X Class loco chugs out||Trichy: The first indigenous coal-fired X Class steam locomotive manufactured at the Ponmalai (Golden Rock) Workshop in Trichy, chugged out of the factory, to be delivered to the heritage Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR), for mainline duties. General manager of Southern Railway (SR) John Thomas flagged off the historic metre gauge (MG) steam locomotive on Wednesday. The steam loco was manufactured in such a way to maintain its heritage look, officials said. The railway board had earlier entrusted Golden Rock Workshop the task of manufacturing the loco with rack and pinion arrangement for the NMR. A team of more than 50 technical personnel were engaged in making the loco which was an arduous task as there were no drawings and sketches available for the vital components such as hydrostatic lubricator, ejector and mechanical lubricator. The workshop took the efforts to manufacture these items by reverse engineering successfully. Some of the features of this loco is a 500 Watt steam-operated turbo generator that generates 32v DC current for electrical equipment like headlight, floodlights and cabin lights and a silencer for the hardy brake to release the exhaust steam from the ejector. The original riveted boiler designed by Swiss locomotive and machine works, has been replaced by a welded boiler of the same appearance. All these special components are of vintage values, which are present only in coal-fired X class locos. Thomas also flagged off the 444th public sector undertaking loco overhauled from diesel periodic overhaul shop, 200th guard brake van (BVCM) manufactured from wagon production shops and 123rd LHB coach overhauled from this workshop. He also conducted inspections at the workshop and reviewed the performance of various shops. To mark the platinum jubilee year celebrations of the Indian Independence, a newly-developed Miyawaki garden inside the workshop consisting of 4,000 saplings, including 500 of Bheema Bamboos planted by the employees, were dedicated to the nation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/1st-indigenous-coal-fired-x-class-loco-chugs-out/articleshow/85639009.cms||---

Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) hotmix department data says all complaints pertaining to potholes in these zones have been resolved. Of the 10 zones, roads under five zones have 3,105 unattended potholes, the data showed.The department claimed it received 5,101 complaints from across the city, and repaired 5,260 potholes between June 1, 2021 and August 22 this year. In Laxmi Nagar zone, the department said it found 133 potholes and repaired 247. In Dharampeth, there were no complaints and “165 were repaired”. Similarly, of the 554 potholes in Nehru Nagar zone, “758 were repaired”. In Satranjipura zone it come across 95 potholes and “filled 606”. In Lakadganj zone, it repaired “677 potholes” against complaints for 94.But TOI found potholes on almost all the tar roads. TOI has been regularly reporting about the deplorable condition of roads.Not maintaining roads is also a contempt of a high court order. The upper layer of tar on many roads, which are maintained by the state public works department, too has loosened. And riding on road from Japanese Garden via Seminary Hills to Old Katol Chowk, maintained by PWD, has become risky. Roads in Sahakar Nagar, represented by Bhoyar, too are in a bad shape. Termed the hotmix department data as misleading, BJP corporator Pragati Patil, who represents Prabhag number 14(D) in Dharampeth zone, said, that most of the tar roads in her prabhag are in a very bad shape. Patil that said potholes near Ravi Nagar Square, Law College Square and another in front of Desphande Hall have literally become a death trap. According to her, there are over 1,000 potholes in her prabhag alone.Another ruling party corporator Parineeta Fuke said that many tar roads, especially internal lanes, in her area are in a bad shape. “The major roads are good and complaints have been addressed,” she said.Transport committee chairman and BJP corporator Jitendra Kukde, who represents Prabhag 26 (D) which comes under Nehru Nagar zone, said that there are at least 20 potholes near his house. “Despite several complaints to the zone office and hotmix department, the administration has done nothing,” he said.Corporators from Laxmi Nagar, Satranjipura and Lakadganj zones TOI spoke had similar views. Former deputy mayor and BJP corporator from Satranjipura zone, Deepraj Pardikar, slammed the information shared by the hotmix department.A senior official from the department said that many potholes have been filled. “The department was closed during the rainy season,” said the official.Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on Wednesday inspected the road work between Sangarsh Nagar and Chandmari for which NMC is spending Rs8.95 crore.

While there has been some respite with the state government relaxing curfew till midnight during the festival, other aspects like installation and immersion processions are still being debated upon. The issue of the size of pandals became clear only on Wednesday when minister Yogesh Patel discussed in the cabinet meeting. Patel said that after his representation it had been decided that the pandals should not be bigger than 300 square feet. The organisers have also sought that some concessions should be given for immersion processions and DJs should be allowed. Many organisers have been arguing that programmes of political parties were going on with large crowds and DJs, but Ganpati processions were not being allowed. Another aspect that has raised eyebrows is that the artificial ponds for immersions was still not ready. Patel said that he had discussed this too and arrangements will be made. Vadodara Municipal Corporation mayor Keyur Rokadia said that the civic body would be sticking to guidelines. “Once we get the guidelines, arrangements will be made according to the norms there,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/relaxations-sought-for-ganpati-immersions/articleshow/85633151.cms||---
---||Pune||Focus on better management of patients in home isolation: Pune administration||PUNE: The district administration on Wednesday promised better monitoring of Covid-19 patients in home isolation at all the three administrative units of Pune through a good network of doctors and call centres. The district health officials claimed that the three administrative units — the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations, and Pune rural had been told to set up call centres through the war rooms being set up to keep tabs on home isolated Covid patients. Former state president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr Avinash Bhondwe said there should be better daily monitoring and online discharge systems. According to the projections, 65% patients would require home isolation in case there is a third wave and 35% would require hospitalisation in the state. An official of the district administration said, “The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Pune rural would have a tie up with doctors and set up a monitoring system to ensure that patients do not violate the rules of home isolation and there is a follow-up.” Dr Bhondwe said, “Home isolation should only be carried under a doctor’s advice.

---||Nagpur||Rare awake brain surgery helps prevent permanent disability in farmer||Nagpur: Doctors at a private hospital in city saved a farmer from Rajnandgaon, in neighbouring Chhattisgarh, by performing awake craniotomy or awake brain surgery, a rare procedure done in only a few cases in the region in last couple of decades. Without the surgery, the farmer was facing permanent disability.Doctors at Wockhardt Hospital said there was a tumour near an area of the brain which controls critical functions like speech and motor skills. In such cases, awake craniotomy is best to identify and safely preserve those abilities, they said.The team comprised neurosurgeon Dr Rahul Zamad, neuro-anaesthiologist Dr Awantika Jaiswal and physician and internal medicine expert Dr Vaibhav Agrawal at the hospital.Dr Zamad explained that awake craniotomies are frequently — but not always — used for various brain tumours in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, which control speech and motor functions and also for certain seizure disorders.“The main goal in such surgery is to remove as much of the tumour as can be removed, in the safest possible way. The patient was comfortable for entire 3.5 hours of the surgery. We aimed to prevent any damage to the brain, and its important structures, which are known as eloquent areas,” said Dr Zamad.He added, “The biggest challenge was to keep the patient awake, comfortable during the surgery and ensure he doesn’t feel pain when the effect of anaesthesia subsides.”He said similarly, if the patient is able to respond by speaking or make limb movements, doctors remain comfortable. “If there is a deficit in these functions or the patient shakes his head even once, the surgery fails, especially when the surgeon is either on brain or tumour,” said Dr Zamad.Dr Awantika Jaiswal said, “The brain doesn’t have direct pain stimulation meaning it doesn’t have the sensation. First the head is numbed. When brain has to be opened, we had to drill it. So that time we have to give patient local anaesthesia but keep him fully awake. In the end, we have to sedate him to keep him comfortable.”She added that the heart rate and CO2 shouldn’t increase, oxygenation shouldn’t decline or the brain would start swelling.Dr Vaibhav Agrawal said, “The most important player of the procedure is the patient, as he has to feel comfortable with the idea of waking up during surgery. A patient with severe symptoms may not be able to effectively contribute to the neurological exams during surgery.”Dr Zamad said before the surgery a green signal from the physician is crucial. “The fitness of the patient is important. Hence, he was only stressed till a certain limit and then sedated to keep him relieved while the surgery goes on,” he said.InfoAWAKE CRANIOTOMY* Also known as awake brain surgery, patient is able to talk to doctors during surgery without pain and give them immediate feedback if he feels any problem while they operate* Functions are located in particular areas of the brain, with bundles of nerves passing to the spinal cord and throughout the body. During surgery doctors map these nerves using brain mapping gadgets, to understand those connected to key functions, so they can avoid them as they remove the tumour* Damaging critical nerves could cause permanent disability* Awake craniotomies are frequently — but not always — used for brain tumours which occur in frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, which control speech and motor functions, and also for certain seizure disorders.WHAT WAS DONE AT WOCKHARDT* Being awake, patient helps map areas of brain by letting doctors know of weakness in limbs or difficulty in speech* In this case, area of interest was motor and premotor cortex. Neurosurgeon stimulated part of the brain near the tumour by sending a light electrical current down the nerves* At the same time, neuro-anaesthesiologist gave some simple verbal tasks to see if the stimulation affected neurological function, and rest of the time also continued active communication with patient* Finally, when intracranial work was done and patient’s condition was stable, he was sedated to complete rest of the procedure||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rare-awake-brain-surgery-helps-prevent-permanent-disability-in-farmer/articleshow/85636496.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The submissions were made before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat during the hearing of his bail plea in a case in which he has been alleged to be a part of a premeditated conspiracy behind the riots. Senior advocate Rebecca John, appearing for Saifi, said that if he and others had felt that CAA and NRC were unjust, they had every right to protest. “Khalid Saifi did protest against CAA, NRC, as did I and so many people in this room. That does not make him or any of us culpable... Was there an incitement to violence?” she asked. “Today bails in UAPA are granted either on their (prosecution’s) concession or when the trial is delayed… It cannot be the intent of the legislation that people are incarcerated...” John further said a random search of 750 FIRs showed that in 416, members of the Muslim community were either complainants or victims. She claimed that statements of two of the protected witnesses were fabricated as they did not level the same allegations against Saifi in another case, in which he had got bail. She referred to the statement of a third witness and said he had pretended to be a Muslim and was snooping at the protest site. “He says he knew Ishrat Jahan and Saifi very well and yet he... grows a beard and pretends to be a Muslim and doesn’t get recognised...

The revenue department had also issued a notification about this 11 years ago. Letter has once again written for action in compliance with this notification. The district collectors and commissioners of local bodies will be appointed as a nodal officer to perform the task. An official said, “The local bodies are not getting the land for proper development. On land is available, an action plan to develop land for public utility. The notification was issued by the revenue department on 8 December 2010. However, it was not followed till date,” Similarly, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) is also set to strip the ownership of land owners who have illegally developed colonies on agriculture land. The civic body has also prepared the list of such colonies. An official said, “To discourage such practice in future, proceedings for cancellation of ownership has been implemented under the Section 175 of Rajasthan Tenancy Act against the land holders.” These illegal colonies were developed either after encroaching the government land or on agriculture land without the civic body’s approval. After land mafias became active and developed many illegal colonies during the pandemic, the JDA recently conducted a meeting to tackle the issue. Directions were issued to the enforcement wing to act against these illegal establishments after dividing it into three categories. An enforcement wing official said, “There has been zero tolerance against encroachment on government land. Second point in our agenda was to act against the mafias who are using agricultural land for non-agricultural and commercial purpose after illegally developing a colony.” To protect residents from getting duped, the JDA has also directed the enforcement wing to again conduct zone-wise physical survey of illegal colonies. The civic body has also issued an appeal to the public and buyers to thoroughly verify the ownership documents of the land before purchasing any plot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/revenue-dept-to-transfer-pasture-lands-to-local-bodies/articleshow/85639097.cms||---

When his condition neurologically deteriorated, a team of doctors declared him brain dead on Tuesday. Kingsway Hospital coordinators counselled Kusum and daughter Snehal and son Sushant. As per a note issued by Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre coordinator Dr Sanjay Kolte, both Sushant and Snehal readily agreed to donate the organs. “Instead of getting wasted, the valuable living organs will give a new lease of life to someone in need,” said Snehal. Dr Prakash Khetan, managing director, senior nephrologist & transplant consultant at Kingsway, said that there are many patient waiting for transplantation. “If more people come forward for donation, better will be outcome of patients with end-stage organ failure. This was first organ retrieval at Kingsway,” he said. He added that Kingsway was recognised for liver and kidney transplant. “There was no patient of same blood group for liver, so it went to New Era Hospital. One kidney was retained for the hospital’s patient as per norms and other went to OCHRI by rotation. Being a post-Covid patient, heart and lungs were not retrieved while eyes were not found fit,” he said. The kidneys were donated to a 48-year-old woman at OCHRI and 59-year-old man at Kingsway. Liver was transplanted in a 45-year-old man at New Era Hospital. Kingsway Hospital staff created the honour corridor for the donor and provided free ambulance service to send the body to Gajbhiye’s native place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-recovered-mans-liver-kidneys-donated-save-3-lives/articleshow/85636528.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The report, however, said the presence of fewer trees in the Peth areas was a cause of concern. “The developmental and infrastructure projects have been carried out in the densely populated areas, which has led to tree cutting. Even though, trees were planted to compensate for the tree cutting, a majority of them were planted in the fringe areas. The core city areas hardly have place for tree plantation,” said a senior PMC official. The 2016 environment status report (ESR) of the PMC had stated that the civic areas had around 38.60 lakh trees. The number has gone up to 47.13 lakh trees as per ESR of 2020. “The merger of 11 villages has helped in increasing the count of trees. The tree census, which was started a few years ago is now complete,” said Mangesh Dighe, environment officer of PMC told TOI. As per the civic data, the per capita tree count has gone up from 1.23 to 1.39 since 2016. The civic areas also have 429 different tree species. Civic official said the promotion and improvement of urban forests at Pachgaon Parvati, Warje, Bhamburda and Dhanori also helped in improving the green cover, which is spread over 1,800 acre. The tree census showed that the Dhankawdi-Sahkarnagar areas had the highest number of trees at 11 lakh. The Bhavani Peth had around, 12,000 trees, which is the lowest. According to the PMC data, the civic body had initiated the tree census in 2016. It was based on Geographical Information System (GIS) to effectively map and enumerate the city’s trees. The location, type and other details of each tree were recorded. Funds for geo-tagging trees were made available. Around 200 people worked on the tree census, which will be a continuous process and the data will be updated online every month. Citizens can post their suggestions and objections regarding the data and the administration will make changes, if needed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/green-cover-increases-in-pune-municipal-limits/articleshow/85639159.cms||---

The plan is to have a stock of at least one month. The offices of the civil surgeon (CS), district health officer and chief medical officer of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) have drawn up a blueprint of the drug requirement. Procurement process too has started with the CS acting as the nodal officer coordinating with the public health department under the supervision of collector Vimla R. The drugs and medical kits would be used at 10 rural hospitals and two sub-district hospitals (Kamptee and Ramtek).District health office of Zilla Parishad too has a stock of drugs and medical kits for primary health centres. ZP CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar said, “We have received some medicines and more are on the way.”NMC’s medical health officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar has sent a requirement to the CS office for 1,000 vials of Remdesivir, 1,000 vials of methyl prednisolone, 2,000 vials of ceftriaxone injections, 2,000 units of low molecular weight enoxaparin and others for the civic body’s hospitals and clinics. According to experts and private practitioners, the administration should also focus on other crucial drugs like Tocilizumab and the cocktail therapy of monoclonal antibodies costing around Rs1.20 lakh a pair. Infection diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said that monoclonal antibody would be crucial in the projected third wave “which may hit by October”. “Tocilizumab and Remdesivir would remain among the top priority drugs,” he said.Associate professor of community medicine, Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital, Dr Sushma Thakre said that the drugs should be stockpiled keeping in mind that projected third wave is expected to affect the paediatric population.Physician Dr Rajesh Atal said that like in the last wave, Remdesivir and steroids would be crucial next time too. “Monoclonal antibody too would be life-saving in cases of serious disease,” he said.

---||Nagpur||High drama in HC, after lawyer hurls expletives against cops & judges||Nagpur: High drama prevailed in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday after a lawyer allegedly hurled expletives against the judges, administrative officers and lawyers inside the premises. He was reportedly enraged after being prohibited by the police personnel at the main entrance gate over not wearing a mask.High Court Bar Association (HCBA) secretary Prafulla Khubalkar told TOI that they would not be taking any action against the lawyer as he was not their member and he also tendered an unconditional apology for his unruly acts and behaviour. Earlier too, the lawyer had indulged in such acts on the district and sessions court’s premises here.Lawyer Ajay Dongaonkar, who is in his mid-30s, started his tirade at the entry gate against the police and even threatened them with dire consequences. He allegedly hurled obscene abuses against women constables on duty when they advised him to wear a mask. The cops also offered him the mask, but instead Dongaonkar asked them who had issued prohibitory orders in this regard. After being informed that the HC senior judges and the administration had set the norms for entry inside the premises, he started creating ruckus.Dongaonkar somehow got entry by tying a handkerchief on his mouth and soon after entering the corridors, he again started abusing the judges, officers and lawyers in a loud voice near the library on the ground floor. He then went to the corridor near the courtrooms and repeated his act. Even those who were trying to persuade him came under his verbal attack. There was a commotion outside the courtrooms for some time as onlookers, including the litigants, lawyers and officers, gathered on the first floor to watch him.Finally, HCBA office-bearers intervened and asked the police to act against him. The cops took him to their office at the entry gate and detained him for some time. The women constables had also planned to lodge a police complaint against him for using abusive and obscene language against them. After realizing his blunder, he tendered an unconditional apology to police and others and assured that he wouldn’t repeat his acts. The Sadar police station then decided not to act against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/high-drama-in-hc-after-lawyer-hurls-expletives-against-cops-judges/articleshow/85636537.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Jaipur||Sanskrit varsity struggling to attract students||Jaipur: Jagadguru Ramanadacharya Rajasthan Sanskrit University (JRRSU) has received lower admission forms this year as compared to last year. In under-graduate courses, 67 students have submitted fees on 470 seats and in Post-Graduate courses, 127 students have deposited the fees for 520 seats. The condition of state’s only Sanskrit University is degrading every day which shows the lack of interests’ students have in the university. JRRSU, the only Sanskrit university in Rajasthan, was established in 2001 to promote the ancient language but after two decades, the varsity is still not able to attract students. JRRSU public relation officer Shastri Kosalendra Das told TOI that they have shifted the last dates of form submission from August 26 to September 30. One important reason for students not showing interest is the distance of the university from Jaipur and no public transport being available. Moreover, according to the university administration, in the 44 sanctioned teaching posts, only 21 are filled and rest lying vacant. Since, July 2018 the university does not have any professor. In Shastri i.e. BA course, a student has to study two Sanskrit subjects and three general subjects (English, Hindi, Political Science) but in the two decades not, a single permanent teacher has been appointed for these subjects.University registrar Rajendra Sigh Charan said, “We have extended the dates for the form submission and we expect that numbers of forms will increase.”“It is too early to conclude anything.” Saroj Kumari, alumni of JRRSU said that there is no system in the university and administration is really poor. When she has complained against any discrepancies, it has never been resolved. Meanwhile, Jain Darshan, Puran Itihas and Darshan Shastra, subjects for under-graduates zero applications have been received. Only saving grace for the university has been Yoga course in which for 60 seats, 76 forms have been received.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sanskrit-varsity-struggling-to-attract-students/articleshow/85639288.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Home demand in high near park, hospital||KOLKATA: Two out of five middle-income families scouting for a home in Kolkata are actually looking to upgrade to a more spacious apartment that is preferably located near a park or a water body and not too far from a hospital. And they are willing to spend up to 9% more than they had originally planned to move into a home of their choice. A survey on the impact of the pandemic on home buyers by international property consultant Knight Frank revealed that the lockdown in 2020 and restrictions thereafter has led to people prioritising their homes and looking for larger spaces. One in five respondents said they had already moved to a new home since the start of the pandemic. Another 18% said they would relocate to a new address in the next 12 months. One in three respondents in middle-income families said they were even looking at a second home following the pandemic, possibly in the suburbs where they can stay while working from home or attending online classes. However, many professionals, including lawyers and architects, are looking to return to work at least five days a week. Half the salaried class among the respondents also said they would like to return to work. The factors behind the choice of homes include good air quality and access to green spaces. Also, medical infrastructure is more important after the pandemic. Also, two in three respondents expect the value of residential property to increase in the next 12 months. “It is remarkable to witness a majority of respondents from Kolkata expecting their current residence to attract an incremental value in the next 12 months. This marks a quantum shift towards optimism amongst the city home buyers. Kolkata’s residential market has showcased resilience in the times of adversity. The recent budget announcement by the state government with regards to reduction in stamp duty by 2% and circle rates by 10% is expected to bring sales resurgence in the industry at large,” said Knight Frank India chief economist and national director Rajani Sinha. One in two respondents also said they were more likely to live in an apartment or condominium followed by 38%, most of them in the high income group preferring villa or independent homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/home-demand-high-near-park-hospital/articleshow/85636541.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: KMC plugs pipe leak in night-long operation to avert major water crisis||KOLKATA: A major water crisis for the entire north and central Kolkata was averted on Wednesday morning after KMC swung into action and repaired a main pipe in the Barrackpore cantonment area that was breached on Tuesday evening. As the water supply department could repair the pipe on time, the civic body did not have to shut down the Palta water treatment system, which would have made large parts of the city dry. However, residents in some parts of north Kolkata, including Cossipore, Dum Dum (Chiria More), RG Kar Road and Paikpara, received inadequate water on Wednesday morning compared to a normal day. According to a KMC water supply department official, most parts of north and central Kolkata would have gone dry had not the civic body detected the leak in time and started the repair process on a war-footing. The 64-inch pipe, considered indispensable in supply of potable water from Palta to Tallah, had to be repaired by early morning to avert a water crisis in most parts of Kolkata. “It was really a challenging task as we had to chase a deadline in repairing the pipe that is considered the lifeline for the city’s water supply system. The garrison engineer from the cantonment extended his cooperation and expertise. We heaved a sigh of relief as we could wrap up the repair process by early morning,” said a KMC water supply department official. Sources in the KMC water supply department said the crack in the pipe was quite large and water was gushing out of it. This apart, we had to rope in labourers in large numbers so that the pipe could be repaired by Wednesday morning. “It was difficult to locate the leak as first we needed to prevent wastage of water. At a point of time, a part of the cantonment area was flooded by water gushing out of the pipeline. A team of 70 workers, trained in leak repair, was pressed into service and we could finish the work in time,” the KMC official said. A senior official in the KMC water supply department said efforts were on to examine the condition of some other major water pipes that carry potable water from Palta (Barrackpore) to Tallah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-plugs-pipe-leak-in-night-long-op-to-avert-major-water-crisis/articleshow/85636573.cms||Saikat Ray

Collectively, the three cantonments in the district now have 400 oxygen beds ready, besides, four operational oxygen generation plants. Two of these plants are in the Pune cantonment limits and one each in Khadki and Dehu Road. Before the pandemic in March last year, none of these cantonments had oxygen generation plants and were dependent on supply of oxygen cylinders from private agencies. Amit Kumar, chief executive officer, Pune Cantonment Board (PCB), told TOI on Monday, “Apart from two oxygen generation plants that we have, a third plant is being set up at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment General Hospital. We can now cater to the oxygen requirement for 200 beds and 20 ICU beds.” Kumar’s counterpart from Khadki, Pramod Kumar Singh said that its hospital will receive oxygen through the newly installed oxygen generation plant of 500 LPM capacity. R Haritwal, chief executive officer, Dehu Road cantonment, said many patients, particularly from humble backgrounds, will get benefit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-cantts-in-district-claim-self-reliance-in-o2-supply/articleshow/85639206.cms||Sandip Dighe

Complaints about unauthorised wall posters are being received through CEC mobile app, for which e-challans are being generated and served. Large numbers of posts are being received on illegal to-let boards, GST, wanted, spot jobs and plot sales across the city. Penalties are being imposed on to-let boards erected at private places by owners of premises. In this regard, the CEC is imposing penalties only to commercial business agents, brokers, house rental firms, real estate firms, who are pasting wall posters on a large scale across the city to promote their business but not to the individual property owners. “These firms are defacing the image of the city by pasting wall posters in a mass mode at various public places and hence the same are liable to be penalised. To-let boards, when erected by an individual property owner in their own premises are not being penalised,” said the EVDM office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cell-to-penalise-illegal-banners-flexies-posters/articleshow/85641274.cms||---

The decision was taken after volunteers of a newly formed New Town residents’ forum dedicated to women’s safety met senior cops of New Town on Tuesday with a slew of demands and suggestions that included more police patrol, better CCTV surveillance, a helpline number for women in distress, better illumination of all blocks and lanes, removal of encroachments and self-defence courses for women. “The cops agreed to all our demands and offered some suggestions too. They advised us to form an RG Party to work in coordination with the local police. We have formed a team of volunteers from Action Areas I, II and III and drawn up a list of vulnerable places where women have been tormented in the recent past, and have shared it with cops,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News. Following a complaint by an 18-year-old woman who was stalked and molested near New Town police station earlier this month, several women in the township have come forward sharing trauma of being chased, groped and teased on New Town roads over the past few weeks. At the meeting, cops also promised to hold a self-defence workshop under the state’s women’s safety programme called Swayamsiddha. Senior women cops will also organise confidence workshops for women in the area. “We have listed some stretches that need proper illumination and have to be made free of encroachments. We have also asked cops to act against men partying late into the night, disturbing residents’ sleep and violating the state’s Covid restrictions,” said Das. At the meeting, the residents stressed on implementation of zero FIR and ensuring presence of women cops at police stations through the day. A senior officer said the meeting was fruitful and they would work towards speedy implementation of the discussed measures. “Our officers are always alert and continue to patrol the township at odd hours to ensure safety of the residents. But if the residents themselves become more alert and extend a helping hand, it will help us keep the township safer,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rg-party-to-make-new-town-safe-for-women/articleshow/85636631.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: CBI files chargesheet in Rs 209 crore bank fraud||JAIPUR: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CB) filed a chargesheet against 18 accused for their alleged involvement in causing a loss of nearly Rs 209 crore to the Syndicate Bank. In a statement released Wednesday, the agency said the chargesheet has beeen submitted before the court of special judge, CBI cases in Jaipur. The agency named 18 people which included a chartered accountant and former officials of the Syndicate Bank, among others. The CBI said that it had registered a case back in 2017, following a complaint from the bank’s regional office located in Jaipur, which alleged that 118 loans were sanctioned and disbursed from three branches of the bank located in Jaipur and Udaipur. “The 118 loans were housing loans, term loans for the purchase of commercial property in World Trade Park (WTP), among others,” the agency said in the statement. As per the agency, an Udaipur-based CA, identified as Bharat Bomb, along with his employees and others hatched a conspiracy with bank officials in Jaipur and Udaipur to sanction various credit facilities. “The accused thereby cheated the bank to the tune of Rs 209.93 crore (approximately) on the basis of forged and fabricated documents, bills, quotations, certificates, etc. It was also alleged that several of the borrowers were found to be ordinary employees in firms owned by the CA and others, and (they were) not eligible for such high-value loans,” the agency said. During its investigation, the CBI found that the accused had allegedly approached the bank’s Jaipur branch located on MI Road, seeking term loans for purchasing commercial properties and units at the World Trade Park ltd, on the basis of forged income tax returns showing inflated income of the borrowers, forged quotations, invoices, purchase orders, work orders, and forged CA certificates along with audited financial statements. It was also alleged that the then manager of the bank’s MI Road branch recommended and the then AGM/branch head to sanction various credit facilities by violating bank guidelines and without exercising due diligence. These bank officials allegedly sanctioned term loans for the purchase of commercial properties, housing properties, and working capital term loans to various individuals, firms, and companies linked to the accused. “Searches were also conducted at various premises of (the) accused. Further investigation is will be done to look into the role of the other accused,” the agency said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cbi-files-chargesheet-in-rs-209cr-bank-fraud/articleshow/85641280.cms||---

Today, the number has shrunk to just about 40 companies which are drawing insignificant volume of power. The cross subsidy surcharge imposed by the state has gone up to Rs 1.78 per unit from 83 paisa in 2016-17. Combined with additional surcharge of 82 paisa, the total additional burdern on the consumers drawing power from exhanges has gone up by Rs 2.52 a unit.“Due to stringent open access regulation in the state and despite low prices the volume dropped to 0.3 bvillion units in 2020-21 with only few consumers participating in exchange,” said Rohit Bajaj, Rohit Bajaj, senior vice-president, Business Development, Indian Energy Exchange (IEX).Bajaj said in 2016-17, the total volume by open access consumers was around 4 billion units from more than 500 consumers participating at exchange. As per IEX data, the average price per unit of power was Rs 2.82 in 2020-21 in the day-ahead category. The same was Rs 3.19 a units in the first quarter of the current financial year. Bajaj also drew attention to the vast potential the green energy market provides to investors and Rajasthan is well-positioned to take advantage of it. “IEX offers contracts lfor green energy. It could potentially provide the generators with the opportunity to sell renewable power at competitive and viable prices and the flexibility to map their generation profile. Similarly, for buyers it proves to be an excellent avenue to source green power in an efficient, competitive and flexible manner,” added Bajaj.The green energy market offers consumers a sustainable choice, helps the government achieve its renewable energy goal and enable integration of renewables in the most flexible and efficient way, added Bajaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cos-in-raj-fail-to-tap-exchange-power-due-to-high-surcharge/articleshow/85639204.cms||---

The experts said it has already been five-six months since many of the healthcare workers took their second shot and there are fears of the antibody levels waning. Vaccine expert Dr Naveen Thacker, who was also part of the committee of experts constituted under the National Institute of Disaster Management, told TOI, “Considering the possibility of future waves and long Covid, booster shots for this segment should be given a priority once the supply is ensured.” He said, “The government is saying that a person can stay protected against serious infection and death months after the second dose. But now research is showing that even those who have mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 can experience its long-haul symptoms.” Leading virologist Dr T Jacob John told TOI, “Scientifically and immunologically, the healthcare workers should be given priority for the booster doses. A booster dose is ordinarily given six months after the first schedule of the two doses. At present, this is the right interval for the booster doses for many of them.” He said, “Programmatically, the government will have to take a call on dividing the available doses in three portions for three priority groups: one for healthcare workers’ booster doses, second portion exclusively for people whose second doses are due and the third portion for citizens who have not yet taken the first dose of the vaccine. The government should formulate a policy, which may include priority booster doses for healthcare workers aged above 55.” Dr J A Jayalal, national president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), said, “Scientifically, a policy on booster doses for healthcare workers is required, with the fears of a third wave imminent. We have, however, left it to the government to take a suitable call as per the availability of vaccines because a bulk of the population is yet to be inoculated.” Virologist Dr Shahid Jameel, however, said there was no need for booster shots at this time. “It’s more important to give at least one dose to the maximum number of people and finish up with the two doses,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-favour-booster-for-healthcare-workers/articleshow/85639173.cms||Neha Madaan

It has also sought an appointment with the commissioner to discuss the issue citing privacy of its customers. Meanwhile, some owners of bar-cum-restaurants are finding it difficult to comply with the order within the stipulated two weeks due to non availability of key materials. The state excise department had issued an order making installation of CCTV mandatory for all restaurants with bar licences.  NRAI Calcutta chapter president Sagar Daryani said members were not comfortable with the order as it could affect customers’ privacy. “In view of certain recent incidents in more than one Excise district where restrictions on hours of service of liquor were found to have been transgressed, all foreign liquor ‘on’ establishments in Excise districts are hereby required to ensure the following for the sake of a hassle-free and business-friendly compliance mechanism in the interest of public law and order,” the order said. In the letter, NRAI had sought to draw the attention of the Excise commissioner to certain aspects of the order. “The various considerations and apprehensions which our members feel to be very relevant and pertinent and deserves kind considerations of your authority,” the letter said. According to the order, CCTV cameras over the bar have to be installed in a way that operations can be clearly captured. The directive added that cameras may commence capturing audio-visual data every evening from an hour before scheduled hour of closure till 4am of the following morning. Such recording of data may be done over the same duration even on days when no liquor is mandated to be served.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/eateries-seek-cctv-order-review/articleshow/85636597.cms||---

They, however, managed to return unscathed, after a nightmarish 12 hours, on August 22. The woman married an Afghanistan national in 2016 and went to Afghanistan on December 2, 2020, to meet her in-laws in Jalalabad city. She and her husband were among the 150 people who were taken from the gate of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul to the base by the Taliban fighters on August 21 morning. “I will never forget those two hours at the base. I was praying for my life,” the woman told TOI on Wednesday. She is currently staying with her husband at her parents’ house at Dhanori. Recalling her frightful experience, she said a total of 180 people, including, Afghan nationals who have Indian spouses, were waiting in eight buses outside the airport. “One of the passengers had uploaded a video on a social media site explaining the difficulties faced by us. Within 15 minutes, gun-totting Talibani fighters hopped on to our buses and took us to their base, a few kilometres away from the airport,” she said. They separated the male and female passengers. “After 15 minutes, they asked my husband to collect our passports,” she recalled. “After two hours, they arranged lunch for us. That’s when we felt a little comfortable. They sent us back to the airport on the buses without harming anyone,” she added. However, the airport gates remained shut that day. She said, “We waited inside the bus till 6pm. Later, our coordinator took us to the Khalij wedding hall, where accommodation was arranged for us. Around 9 pm, we finally entered the airport via the VIP gate. After seeing the Indian Air Force aircraft there, I felt a little relieved. The flight took off at midnight and we landed at Hindon IAF base in Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh early on August 22.” The couple could not board a flight for Pune that day. They stayed in New Delhi overnight and arrived at Pune airport on August 23 morning. “We were booked on an Air India flight on August 19. However, we could not get inside the airport. We had to wait till August 22. Those three days in Kabul were the longest days of my life,” said the woman’s husband Najib Safi, who completed bachelor’s degree in computer application from a city college in 2016. Safi is worried about his parents, two brothers and sister back home.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Ujjwala a gimmick, costly LPG beyond villagers’ reach, says Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Accusing the BJP of taking the poor for a ride in the name of Ujjwala Yojana 2.0 launched by UP CM on Wednesday, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said the scheme was another design to lead the housewives in villages to buy cooking gas cylinders which are getting costlier by the day. He said the scheme was yet another gimmick of the BJP in the run up to UP elections. “The tagline of the scheme should be changed from ‘clean fuel, better life’ to ‘expensive fuel, difficult life’ as prices of the cooking gas cylinders are increasing by the day,” he said. The SP president said the scheme was introduced as an initiative to empower women in the rural areas but the reality is that these gas connections have become mere showpieces as poor villagers are unable to get refills because of the ever-increasing cost of the gas. “As per a National Statistical Office (NSO) survey report, almost 20% of the families living under the below poverty line have a monthly income of Rs 1,065. In the past 15 days, the prices of cooking gas cylinders have been increased by Rs 321. In July, a gas cylinder was being sold for Rs 933. From August 1, price of 19kg commercial gas cylinder has increased by Rs 73.50 while the subsidy amount is fixed,” Akhilesh said. He said the beneficiaries of the Ujjwala Yojana are not in a position to get a refill once the first cylinder is used. Almost 78% of the beneficiaries have switched back to chulha they used before they got the gas connection. The poor villagers are not in a position to buy a new cylinder. “It is a conspiracy to make the poor poorer,” Akhilesh said, adding that the scheme is ill-conceived.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ujjwala-a-gimmick-costly-lpg-beyond-villagers-reach-sp/articleshow/85641302.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The direct flights were suspended nearly 18 months back. No official dates have been finalised for the resumption of flights. Kuwait’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) circular number 32, dated on Tuesday, stated resuming operations of commercial flights with India, Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal, with the adherence to protocols. Kuwait is likely to resume direct flights from India, starting in a phased manner. Nelson Sandesh, who works in the food and beverage sector in Kuwait, had returned in February last year. A relieved Neslon said: “The company I work for is repeatedly calling me to return. I have my vaccine certificate approved by Kuwait, and was anxiously waiting for the flights to start.’’ There are many like him stranded here, and some of them have even lost their jobs. DGCA’s circular number 33 stated that those who receive two doses of the vaccines approved by Kuwait, like Pfizer BioNTech, AstraZeneca/Oxford and Moderna, and a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, are allowed to enter Kuwait. Those who have received two doses of unapproved vaccines in Kuwait like Sinopharm, Sinovac and Sputnik, must have received at least one additional dose of one of the approved vaccines in Kuwait. Saudi Arabia relaxes rule The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has also relaxed rules for expatriates vaccinated in the country. India in Saudi Arabia @IndianEmbRiyadh, the official twitter account of Embassy of India, Riyadh, tweeted on Tuesday: “Embassy is pleased to inform that Saudi Authorities have announced that Indian nationals who have travelled to India after receiving both doses of the vaccine in Saudi Arabia will be able to return to the Kingdom directly without need for quarantine in a third country.” Two weekly flights to Muscat from MIA Mangaluru International Airport will start operating two weekly flights between MIA and Muscat, starting from September 2. The flights will be operated on Thursdays and Sundays. Air India Express has started bookings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/nris-relieved-as-kuwait-plans-to-resume-direct-flights/articleshow/85633902.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

A source in a hospital said the supplies had been hit possibly because of the delay in arrival of Sputnik V doses at Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Limited following the sudden spike in cases in Russia. Sputnik V uses two different types of adenovirus vectors in its vaccine — rAd26 for the first shot and rAd5 for the second. A representative of a city hospital administering the vaccine told TOI, “We are now giving second doses of the vaccine and are out of first doses because of no supplies from the Hyderabad-based company. It has been a month since we have been facing supply constraints for Sputnik.” Abrarali Dalal, the chief executive officer of Sahyadri Hospitals, said, “We started with Sputnik V vaccination at our Ahmednagar Road and Hadapsar units in Pune apart from our units in Nashik and Karad, which received an overwhelming response. We have ordered 10,000 more doses, which have been pending for a long time. We are expecting the doses by next week.” The vaccination in-charge of another private hospital said, “For all the first doses earlier supplied to us, the company sent the required second doses. Now, they are not giving the next lot of first doses.” Authorities at another Sputnik vaccination centre said they had been unable to get their first dose requirement of Sputnik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hosps-face-huge-delay-in-getting-new-sputnik-stock/articleshow/85639238.cms||Neha Madaan

The inspection began with Jorabagan traffic guard and continued with the Headquarters traffic guard and the Howrah bridge traffic guard on Tuesday and Wednesday. “It has been decided to set up high-mast lights at a few points, like close to Nandaram Market on the Howrah bridge approach road (Brabourne Road), near Armenian Ghat, the Gandhi Statue area and the southwest portion of Park Street. Cops said similar inspections will be conducted at all 25 traffic guards. The entire inspection is likely to take another two weeks. Cops have already identified close to 150 points — most of them in added areas — to set up high-mast lights at a cost of Rs 60,000-Rs 70,000 each. “Areas like Haridevpur, Behala, Sarsuna, Madurdaha and Mukundapur are in focus. Each of the proposals may not be implemented, but we are trying,” said an officer. “We have prepared a detailed report at each traffic guard to be shared with the KMC. Once KMC experts are choosing a spot, they are ascertaining two things from us — if the location serves both motorists and pedestrians, and whether it is hampering normal flow of traffic in any manner,” said an officer. The police have been writing to KMC since May, highlighting the need to illuminate certain spots. “The thrust is primarily on areas off main thoroughfares used extensively by pedestrians and motorists. We are happy that KMC has come forward to make the city safer at night. An illuminated street creates doubt in the mind of the criminal. This will also mean that CCTV footage will be clearer and the accused can be traced faster,” said an officer. “We have identified a few stretches that turn desolate after dark and have asked police stations to ensure cop presence throughout the night,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-mast-lights-for-city-shadow-zones/articleshow/85636672.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Schools are set to restart for classes 9 to 12 on September 1 following the pandemic lockdown. Though the number of Covid-19 cases have gone down, the government has decided to follow all proper guidelines for school reopening. For classes 9 and 10, schools will start from 7.30am to 12.30pm, and for classes 11 and 12, it will be from 8am to 1pm. A gap of half-an-hour has been allowed to prevent overcrowding on school premises. Mid-day meals will not be prepared in schools and only dry ration will be provided. Institutions have to sanitise school buses and drivers must have taken at least one dose of the vaccine. If possible, there will only be a single student on a bench in classrooms, but enough space should be provided if there are more students to let them sit at an appropriate distance. Reacting to the government's decision, president of private school association, School Shiksha Parivar, said, “We want schools to reopen from primary classes as has been done in other states as well. The RTE payment that is still pending should be cleared by the government as soon as possible to help students attend classes from this session.” However, parents’ association have objected to the opening of schools and said this would pose a big risk to the lives of students. Sanyukt Abhibhavak Sangh has demanded the state government to reconsider the decision to open schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/strict-covid-norms-forraj-school-reopening/articleshow/85641319.cms||---

The association has also threatened to go on an indefinite strike if the government does not agree to its decision to hike the rates. “Last year, too, we had decided to increase the rates, but the transport department didn’t allow us to do so. We had planned a protest but then the pandemic hit, and all PUC centres were closed for months altogether. We are adamant this time and have decided to increase the rates from September 16. If the state government tries to stop us and intimidate us, all the PUC centres will shut down for an indefinite period,” Sandeep Bhandare, the president of the All PUC Centre Owners’ Association said. At present, there are a total of ,1667 PUC centres across the state and 396 in Pune and the PCMC areas. “Before the pandemic, there were 1,800 centres but around 200 of them shut down as the owners couldn’t sustain heavy losses,” said Bhandare. “According to the authorities, unless the transport department approves, we cannot increase the rates, but this is not mentioned in the Motor Vehicle Act. The rates will increase this time and we plan to go to sit on a hunger strike in front of the transport department office in Mumbai, if the authorities disagree,” he added. A Pune RTO official said that the association cannot take a decision on increasing the charges. “The charges are fixed by the state government. They cannot just go ahead and increase the charges,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/puc-association-seeks-hike-in-rates-from-september-16/articleshow/85639246.cms||Joy Sengupta

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Dharmender Singh discharged him under Section 125A (penalty for filing false affidavit in an election) of the Representation of People Act. “No prima facie case is made out against accused (Hans) and accordingly, proceedings against him are stopped and he is discharged,” the court said in its order. The complaint, filed by Congress functionary Rajesh Lilothia, had alleged that Hans did not give the correct information in the election affidavit regarding his educational qualifications, financial status of his wife, income of his dependents and regarding holding of office in National Safai Karamchari Commission. The complaint had alleged that the BJP functionary had stated his educational qualification as “MATRIC”, however, he further pursued the studies and passed “PREP” (equivalent to Class XI) from DAV College, Jalandhar. The court noted that according to a report submitted, he did not pass “PREP” from the college and so it was clear that he had given the correct information regarding his educational qualifications in his form. It said no document had been filed on record to show that Hans’s wife was in employment or doing any business. The court stated that the accused had not mentioned his sons as dependents during filing his nomination form and there was no requirement to mention the assets or income of such a child who was not dependent upon a candidate. “Except allegations, no material has been brought on record on behalf of prosecution to prove that both sons of the accused are dependent upon him,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hans-raj-hans-gets-courts-clean-chit-in-poll-affidavit-case/articleshow/85639258.cms||Usha Das

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: In first Covid wave, BMC spent Rs 182.6 crore to revive & run SevenHills Hospital||MUMBAI: The BMC spent around Rs 182.6 crore on setting up and maintaining SevenHills Hospital in Marol, Andheri, during the first wave of the pandemic, making it the most expensive Covid-related spending among the city’s municipal hospitals. According to data shared by the BMC with the civic standing committee for post facto approval, over 25,000 patients have been treated at the Marol hospital so far. “SevenHills Hospital has been a game-changer in the city’s fight against Covid-19. The treatment provided here was on a par with private hospitals and hundreds of lives were saved. We appreciate the work done by the doctors and BMC staff,” said Congress corporator Ravi Raja, Opposition leader in the BMC. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra concurred. “Instead of spending money on temporary jumbo centres, the BMC must build more permanent hospitals, like SevenHills, to save lives,” he said. SevenHills Hospital was initially set up in 2010 as a public-private partnership between a Vizag-based hospital chain and the BMC, which provided land in lieu of free beds and treatment for poor patients. It was a 1,500-bed hospital, including 300 ICU beds, but was later shut down after a prolonged legal dispute between the two parties over treatment costs. A day after Maharashtra reported its first two Covid cases on March 9, 2020, former BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi toured the defunct Marol hospital and mobilised funds to revive it within a week. Mission ‘renew SevenHills’ started the very day Mumbai reported its first two Covid cases—on March 11, 2020—and the first international traveller walked into the quarantine facility set up on the eighth floor on March 14, 2020. Mumbai thus got India’s first Covid-19 dedicated hospital, which was fully funded by Reliance Industries Ltd.Civic officials said that between March and December 2020, the BMC spent Rs 118.7 crore on setting up and running the 300-bed hospital, and from January to March 2021, it spent Rs 63.9 crore. According to officials, the BMC has till date spent around Rs 150 crore per month on Covid-19 mitigation—a total of Rs 2,500 crore. Every year, the BMC keeps aside some money in its contingency fund. “Wh-en the pandemic broke out, we had around Rs 1,000 crore in the contingency fund, but all that money was spent to fight Covid-19. Another Rs 450 crore was needed to foot the bills when the financial year ended in March 2021,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-1st-wave-bmc-spent-rs-182-6cr-to-revive-run-sevenhills-hosp/articleshow/85639272.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Rawat made the statement after a delegation of dissidents, including four ministers and three MLAs believed to be close to new Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, held a two-hour meeting with him in Dehradun to convey “the feelings and grievances of party members and the people of the state”. Rawat acknowledged the concerns expressed by the ministers and MLAs as being “serious in nature and important for the party”. He assured them that their grievances would be conveyed to the Congress high command. Claiming there was no threat to the government in Punjab or the party, Rawat said he would leave for Delhi in a day or two to discuss the legislators’ grievances. Sources said Rawat made his displeasure known over the disgruntled Congress legislators “washing dirty linen in public” rather than voicing their grievances on a party platform. The dissenters had said on Tuesday they no longer had faith in Amarinder’s ability to deliver on poll promises. They also accused the CM of being “hand in glove with SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal”. Rawat claimed the delegation that met him “was not here to oppose any individual” but only to sought a roadmap to ensure a Congress victory in the 2022 polls. “These MLAs met Sidhu on Tuesday. Sidhu has been given the responsibility of the party unit in Punjab, but it does not mean there are no other leaders. We have senior leaders like Amarinder Singh, Pratap Singh Bajwa, Ambika Soni and all work together for the party,” Rawat said. While Amarinder is yet to react, his wife and Patiala MP Preneet Kaur blamed PCC chief Sidhu and his advisers for the turmoil in the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-jolt-to-sidhu-rawat-says-captain-to-lead-congress-to-polls/articleshow/85643681.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Lucknow||Patients of non-communicable diseases were sitting ducks to Covid||One of the key lessons learnt during the coronavirus pandemic were related to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) that kill 41 million people every year – about 71% of the total deaths reported across the world. Described as chronic ailments, NCDs are life-long diseases like diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and chronic respiratory conditions and account for over 47% of the total disease burden in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state. The burden was felt during the first and second waves of the pandemic when many NCD patients lost battle to the novel coronavirus. “Covid-19 patients with underlying co-morbid conditions, particularly NCDs like hypertension, diabetes or CVDs, suffered the most in terms of mortality,” says Dr Vikasendu Agarwal, nodal officer for Covid-19 surveillance in UP. Though the department was busy controlling the situation, internal assessments indicated that up to 85% of Covid-19 deaths were linked to comorbidities. The pattern was noted by specialists at tertiary care centres of UP – SGPGIMS and KGMU in Lucknow and Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. “Co-morbid conditions aggravated the damage caused by the virus in many patients. Often the damage progressed faster than anticipated,” says Prof Satyendra Tewari, a faculty member at SGPGI’s cardiology department. His colleague at KGMU, Prof Rishi Sethi, says NCDs were detected in nearly 55-60% Covid-19 patients who died during the first and second pandemic waves. Medical superintendent at IMS-BHU, Dr KK Gupta, also confirmed the trend. Director, Government Institute of Medical Sciences, Noida, Brig (Retd) Dr Rakesh Gupta said the number of Covid-19 deaths in patients with a history of NCD was higher in the first wave as compared to the second. “While in the first wave, over 75% Covid-19 casualties could be linked to NCDs, particularly diabetes, hypertension and CVDs, the numbers went down to around 50-60% during the second wave. The combined figure for first and second waves was around 60%,” he said. Similar pattern was reported in other states too. For example, in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, co-morbidities were linked to three out of every four Covid-19 deaths. Assessments by health agencies indicated the same for India. In summary, those battling with NCDs are like sitting ducks for any microbe and the pandemic has simply proved that the bubble of life is too fragile for this lot. What adds to the concern is that every fifth person in the country above 45 years of age – also in UP – indulges in at least one health risk behaviour like smoking, tobacco consumption, heavy episodic drinking, physical inactivity, high blood sugar, hypertension and high cholesterol. “NCDs are not just medical problems but also have huge personal, social and economic impact. Their premature demise or impaired productivity due to long-term illness or chronic disabilities can impoverish them and their families,” is how the ‘Defeat NCD partnership’ describes NCDs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/patients-of-non-communicable-diseases-were-sitting-ducks-to-covid/articleshow/85641351.cms||Shailvee Sharda

CM Nitish Kumar announced the relaxations through a series tweets after the crisis management group (CMG) meeting with senior members of his cabinet and top bureaucrats in the state. “All kinds of public events, including social, political, entertainment-related, sports, cultural and religious can be organized with required precautions after taking permission from the district administration concerned. All universities, colleges, technical institutions, schools and coaching institutions will also open in normal way. State universities, colleges and schools can organize their examinations. Cinema halls, clubs, gyms, swimming pools and restaurants will be opened with 50% of their capacity,” Nitish said. Chief secretary Tripurari Sharan issued a fresh notification, announcing the new relaxations. As per the fresh notification, all employees and customers visiting the shops would have to wear face masks. Only vaccinated employees would be allowed to work in the shops and business establishments. The shopowners would have to ensure vaccination of all the employees and also maintain their list. All coaching institutions can be opened in a normal way, but only vaccinated persons will be allowed to work. No programme at any public place would be organized without prior permission of the district administration and without observing the standard operating procedures (SOP) for Covid-19. The district administration would have the right to fix the maximum number of people to participate in such a public event. Wedding ceremonies can be organized with necessary compliance of the updated SOP, but there would be no permission for DJ and ‘baraat’ (wedding procession). The local police station would have to be informed at least three days prior to the wedding ceremony. Last rites and shraddh programmes can be organized with necessary compliance of the Covid SOP, the notification reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-lifts-covid-curbs-on-shops-parks-malls-coaching-centres/articleshow/85636864.cms||Madan Kumar

The court declined relief on a petition filed by a mother, whose child was admitted following the admission process that began in January. The mother stated that she already paid the fees. Her counsel argued that the circular ought to have been issued by the government well in advance, before the academic year began. He added that the chief minister made a statement that the New Education Policy would be implemented from the next academic year (2022-2023), while he was speaking at a two-day seminar. He also submitted to court a news extract of his statement dated August 12. The court was told that the statement was made by the chief minister and not by a peon or lower divisional clerk, and hence should be taken seriously and the child be permitted (to be admitted). The lawyer also sought to know why only this one aspect of the NEP was being implemented. Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that this was a decision taken by the state government pursuant to the NEP. He added that a child below three years of age should be stress-free, and added that the circular was issued pursuant to the NEP, as well as the report of the task force, comprising experts. He said that the NEP would be implemented in a phased manner over a period of ten years. “A newspaper item/report in the face of a stated categorical decision in place of the government would seldom prevail,” stated the division bench comprising Justices Sunil P Deshmukh and Mahesh Sonak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-hc-relief-for-mom-who-wanted-kid-aged-under-3-in-nursery-school/articleshow/85639280.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Officials said they can try to recover amounts if the victim approaches them immediately. The 68-year-old complainant had shopped on an online portal but was unhappy with the order, so she searched online for the customer care number. The number she found belonged to a fraudster. The fraudster convinced her to download an app which gave him remote access to her phone. He told her to initiate a small payment to get a refund. When she did it, the fraudster saw her debit card details and OTP via the app. He transferred Rs 1.01 lakh from her account through multiple transactions. On realising she was duped, she approached Khar police in less than three hours. Police got in touch with her bank and e-wallet. The e-wallet account was frozen and amount was recovered. In another case, a 58-year-old manager from Andheri was duped of nearly Rs 3 lakh by a cyber fraudster posing as the executive of a leading phone service provider. Andheri police registered an FIR and are looking for the accused. The incident was reported on August 17.

---||Jaipur||RSS neta ‘hiding’ after booked in graft case: Govind Singh Dotasra||JAIPUR: Rajasthan Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra on Wednesday claimed that a state RSS leader is in hiding after being booked in a corruption case. Dotasra was referring to Nimbaram, who is mentioned in a case registered against Rajaram Gurjar, the husband of suspended Jaipur mayor Somya Gurjar. The case was registered by the Anti-Corruption Bureau on the basis of a video clip that surfaced on social media, purportedly capturing a discussion on a Rs 20-crore “commission”. The RSS had condemned the naming of its functionary in the FIR, claiming that the Congress government in the state was trying to defame him. Dotasra alleged that Nimbaram is in hiding in Delhi and Lucknow. "It is unfortunate that people who do politics from behind the scenes also run the government at the Centre and in the states,” he said. He charged that they indulge in corruption and when cases are registered against them they hide in “some corner of the country". Meanwhile, Congress leader Sachin Pilot lashed out at the Centre on Wednesday over its asset monetisation programme, saying the central government should help the poor and the middle class instead of giving away the assets created in the past 70 years to the private sector at throwaway prices. The former deputy chief minister also accused the BJP of misleading people and doing divisive politics. "The government should help poor and middle-class people instead of handing over the assets of the country to select people," he told reporters in Dausa. He claimed that the Centre wants to give the assets, be it railways, airports or big institutions, to its acquaintances at throwaway prices. Pilot said despite the rise in fuel prices and unemployment, Union ministers are taking out 'Jan Ashirwad Yatra'. "The price of petrol is above Rs 105, a gas cylinder is for Rs 900, there are no jobs, lakhs of people have died due to coronavirus. There was an oxygen shortage during the second wave of the pandemic but still the ministers are seeking blessings," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dotasra-rss-neta-hiding-after-booked-in-graft-case/articleshow/85639314.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa government earmarks Rs 120 crore to avoid power fee hike||PANAJI: Even as AAP promised up to 300 units of electricity free to every household, the state government on Wednesday approved Rs 120 crore from the state treasury to avoid a hike in power tariffs, as was done during the last financial year. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that as the state government decided not to increase the tariff, it will have an additional burden of Rs 120 crore on the state government. Last year, due to the pandemic, the state government had kept the tariff order in abeyance up to March 31 this year. “Considering the prevalence of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, it was also proposed to keep the tariff order for financial year 2021-22 in abeyance,” a cabinet note said. The cabinet note also stated that since the general public is facing difficulties on account of the ongoing pandemic, implementation of the tariff order issued in the financial year 2021-22 at this juncture would further increase the burden on consumers. Further, the pandemic has resulted in a downturn in the tourism and hospitality sectors as well as other related commercial activities, leading to loss of business and earning to a wide spectrum of state’s population. “The income of a large section of citizens has been adversely affected due to the cascading effect of the downturn in business and other activities. Hence, to give relief to the consumer and revive the state economy, the government of Goa has taken relief measures,” the note said. The cabinet accordingly resolved to keep the tariff order for financial year 2021-22 in abeyance from April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022, except for the levy of tariff of Rs 3.5 per unit as per the tariff order for financial year 2021-22 to the “electric vehicle charging station” category, and the implementation of kVAh-based tariff for high tension (HT) or EHT categories. For all other categories, the subsidy will apply to nullify the tariff order for 2021-22, issued by the joint electricity regulatory commission. Reacting to the cabinet decision, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal congratulated the people of Goa. “AAP along with the people of Goa had an agitation. As a result, today, the Goa government provided a subsidy to stop a hike in electricity tariffs. Without having a single MLA, AAP has managed to stop the hike in electricity tariffs. I would like to appeal to the people of Goa to change the government, (and) electricity would be provided free,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-earmarks-rs-120cr-to-avoid-power-tarrif-hike/articleshow/85639347.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Gorakhnath temple on its public welfare mission through education||GORAKHPUR: When President Ram Nath Kovind dedicates the Guru Gorakshnath Vishwavidayalaya to the public, apart from laying the foundation of the Guru Gorakshnath Uttar Pradesh Ayush University here, it will be another feather in the cap of the Maharana Pratap Siksha Parishad. The parishad, which runs 47 educational and health institutions across eastern UP, under the aegis of the Gorakhnath Temple, carries forward its motto of 'public welfare through education'.There are 50,000 students and over 5,000 employees -- both teaching and non-teaching -- in the institutions being run by the temple. Maharana Pratap Siksha Parishad(MPSP) was established in 1932 by Mahant Digvijaynath, the then mahant of the Gorakhnath Teple, to promote nationalist education in the country. It's contribution in the field of education since then -- right from the setting up of Gorakhpur University to establishing schools and colleges across the region -- has been immense. “Mahant Digvijaynath was the key person behind establishment of DDU Gorakhpur University in 1957. He used to say that right education promotes national development including economical, social and cultural development. He established MPSP in 1932 with a school in a small room in the Buxipur area," says MPSP president Prof UP Singh. When the Gorakhpur University was being planned in the early 50s, the state government offered land worth just Rs 50 lakh which was not sufficient. It was then that the Mahant Digvijaynath donated two colleges being run by the MPSP -- MP College and MP Women's College -- to the state government and the Gorakhpur University came into being in 1957. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who is also the head of Gorakhs Peeth, has vision, mission and action which are required for creation and there is no doubt that he created an educational environment in the region and fulfilled the dream of his guru Mahant Awaidyanath," Prof Singh added. Guru Gorakshnath Vishwavidyalaya VC Dr Atul Bajpai says that the University would be a big center of medical, nursing and para-medical education and on the instructions of CM Yogi, the it is also being developed as model institute for education of art, commerce, science, agriculture, technology and employable education. The university is different from other private institutes as its objective is to impart education to all the sections of the society, he says. "The university is a silver-lining in the space of education as all the institutes working under the MPSP work to educate all the sections of society and promote Indian tradition, culture and feeling of nationalism and patriotism," Pradeep Kumar Rao, Principal of Maharana Pratap PG College at Jungle Dhoosar said. The teacher of political science at DDU Gorakhpur University, Mahendra Singh, says, “This is a historical moment for MPSP and the establishment of the university will bring a boom in educational development in Purvanchal and it will ensure access to higher education to vulnerable section of the society.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gorakhnath-temple-on-mission-to-serve-people-through-education/articleshow/85641419.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra political culture hits rock bottom as abuses & stones are hurled||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena-Narayan Rane feud, which culminated in the arrest, and release on bail, of the latter who is a Union minister and BJP leader, reflects on the escalating decline in Maharashtra’s political culture, said observers. Rane attracted Sena’s ire for his remark, which he made at a press conference in Mahad early this week, that he would have slapped CM Uddhav Thackeray who forgot, while addressing the state on August 15, how many years it has been for India’s independence. While Sena took to the streets, pelted stones at Rane’s Juhu residence, plastered posters calling the former Sena CM ‘kombdi chor’ and ordered the Union minister’s arrest, the BJP, in support of Rane, was quick to point out that Thackeray too had recently threatened to serve a ‘jhapad’ (slap) to anyone who dared to attack Sena Bhavan, the party’s Dadar headquarters. Thus, the-pot-calling-the-kettle-black game continues, observers said. “What is worrying is the choice of phrases which trigger hatred and violence. There is a sharp degeneration of values in the political sphere and it shows in the language Maharashtra politicians use,” said political analyst Bhanu Kale. Stating ‘netas’ have to pander to the lowest common denominator to win polls, Kale said, “Sadly, they neither have time nor inclination to read or participate in intellectual exercises which deepen democracy. Politicians need a mentor to groom them about the challenges of a modern, democratic society.” Mantralaya veterans recall the 1960s and ’70s when Congress leaders felt the need to uphold decency in public life. “The Congress had a firm control over the state. However, Yashwantrao Chavan, Vasantdada Patil and Vasantrao Naik were soft-spoken and low profile, in or out of office,” said Ashok Dhamanaskar, a retired state official. A CM who once berated opposition leaders as “serpents and scorpions” found hardly any support from state Congress or the administration, he noted. A section of Maharashtra’s intelligentsia thinks ‘Maratha,’ a firebrand Marathi daily which spearheaded the Samyukta Maharashtra movement in the 1950s, popularised risque humour and cheap puns. It was said Acharya Atre, the editor of ‘Maratha,’ would dip his pen in vitriol to lambast his detractors. A noted Marathi writer recalled that the 19th century debate between radical right-wing leaders and their backward class counterparts reeked of hatred and calumny. “Balasaheb Thackeray, who emulated Atre, evolved a lingo in Marathi which was, to put it mildly, coarse. In his speeches Thackeray often made crude remarks about women,” said social commentator Prakash Bal. “Rane is steeped in Sena’s values. His lexicon shouldn’t upset Uddhav Thackeray,” Bal stated. Kale thinks criminalisation of politics in the 1990s led to a decline in public discourse. Bal too feels the power-pelf combination dealt a body blow to ethical values in public life -- and to Marathi, the language, Bal said, “which has given us great poets and litterateurs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-political-culture-hits-rock-bottom-as-abuses-stones-are-hurled/articleshow/85639379.cms||---
---||Jaipur||3 dead, many hurt as car hits military vehicle near Jodhpur||Jodhpur: Three pilgrims died and one was injured in a road accident in Balesar near Jodhpur on Wednesday evening, when their vehicle collided head-on with a military vehicle. Three more people were injured when the military truck overturned on a motorcycle after the collision. Some soldiers also sustained injuries, who were taken to a hospital. According to the SHO (Balesar) Samarveer Singh, all the victims were devotees of the folk deity Baba Ramdeo and were returning after paying obeisance at the shrine of the deity at Pokhran in Jaisalmer district. He said that four pilgrims from Gujarat in a car who had just visited the shrine, were returning when their speeding car lost control in order to save another vehicle and collided with a military vehicle coming from the opposite direction near Agolai in Balesar sub-division on Wednesday evening. “Three of them died on the spot and got badly stuck in the car. Police along with the passers by initiated a rescue operation and arranged to send the injured to the hospital,” said the officer adding that the collision was so intense that the car turned into a mangled mass of iron beyond identity. The military vehicle, which also lost control after the collision, overturned on a motorcycle at a little distance, injuring a family of three. They also were devotees of Baba Ramdeo and were returning after paying obeisance at the shrine. Singh said that the family was rushed to the hospital in Jodhpur, where they are undergoing treatment. The military vehicle with some soldiers was headed to Jaisalmer. Some of the soldiers have also sustained minor injuries and were rushed to the military medical facility. It may be noted that the ongoing month draws a huge crowd of pilgrims from surrounding states as well as different districts of Rajasthan to the shrine of Baba Ramdeo in Pokhran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/3-dead-many-hurt-as-car-hits-military-vehicle-near-jodhpur/articleshow/85639386.cms||---
---||Jaipur||42-year-old Sikar native evacuated from Kabul, reaches home safely||Jaipur: A native of Sikar, Yogesh Sain (42) is among the few lucky Indians to have been safely evacuated from Kabul, taken over the extremist group Taliban, weeks ago. Sain was in a logistical unit operated by a British Company working at the special military base for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces in Kabul. The base is adjacent to the airport. He could see utter chaos on the airport road with a long queue of vehicles facing the gun-toting Taliban forces frisking almost every car. “Since August 12, the fear of being hit by bullets, missile or grenade was so high that I couldn’t sleep till I reached Qatar on August 17,” said Sain. The evacuation of staff at the base started on August 15. He was asked to keep his mobile, charger and medicines along with a small bag and be ready to board an Indian Airlines flight anytime on August 16. “I was on my toes for the whole day and felt dejected to hear that the flight was not allowed to land at Kabul airport due to security reasons,” said Sain, who knew that it was not easy to leave the war-torn country. The next day, around 500 people from the base shifted to the airport escorted by the NATO army. Here he gave up on boarding any flight to see that the airport has no security cover and people frantically running all over the airport with children in one hand and bags on the other. “People at the airport were panicky and violent at the same time. Everybody wanted to board the flight come what may. The situation was such that nobody could trust anyone. I could see them helplessly from behind the only secured and guarded area, waiting to hear about my flight,” said Sain. Finally, he could see his name in the list of 230 passengers among the British, US, Nepalese, Pakistani and Afghan evacuees. From the flight, he could see hordes of people around the plane and it took a couple of hours by security forces to clear the runway so that the flight can take off. He was living in Kabul since 2012 and had never thought of having to exit this way. He considers himself lucky enough to have been working with a British Company which made his early exit possible. “Since the evacuation was the duty of the company, they provided me with all help by booking ticket for me in the special flight even after having hundreds of evacuees on the waiting list,” said Sain, whose only fear is his job. He went to war-torn Kabul due to 10 times more remuneration than anywhere else for his work. “I have no idea what I would be doing with my life. I would prefer to work in United Arab Emirates (UAE),” said Sain. He is aware that he might not be able to see Afghanistan again in life but says will miss the warm welcome by the locals he had always received as an Indian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/42-year-old-sikar-native-evacuated-from-kabul-reaches-home-safely/articleshow/85639387.cms||Shoeb Khan

It is to be mentioned that due to the fair being postponed for the last two years, businessmen have suffered losses to the tune of Rs 200 crore. In such a situation, the shopkeepers were hopeful that the fair will be organised this year. Jaisalmer district collector Ashish Modi confirmed that the Ramdeora fair has been postponed due to the possibility of a third Covid wave. Block level task force committee was formed for organising the fair from September 7 to 17, comprising nine members which included Pokhran SDO Rajesh Kumar, Pokhran tehsildar and others. The task force in their report said that every year, 30-40 lakh people come to the fair and their boarding and lodging arrangements are done at Ramdeora.

---||Chennai||TN flags Rs 516cr scam in crop loan waiver||Chennai: Days after the DMK government said it was putting on hold the cooperative banks farm loan waiver scheme announced by the erstwhile AIADMK government, cooperative minister I Periyasamy on Wednesday told the Tamil Nadu assembly that there were irregularities in disbursement of loans to the tune of Rs 516 crore, including Rs 503 crore worth of loans given to beneficiaries in Salem and Namakkal districts. The government has found that loans were extended to beneficiaries disproportionate to their land holdings and in violation of the norms fixed by a state-level technical committee for disbursing loans. Participating in a debate in the assembly, former cooperation minister Sellur K Raju said the DMK government could initiate legal action against those found guilty. Former CM Edappadi K Palaniswami, during the last days of his tenure, had announced on February 5 that his government had waived off Rs 12,110 crore crop loans. The government had fixed January 31, 2021 as the cut-off date for the waiver. “Crop loan waiver certificates were issued to 80% of the loanees. It has been found that loans were extended disproportionate to the land holdings of the beneficiary farmers,” said Periyasamy, adding that the violations were purposefully done. The violations had tumbled out during the field-level investigation carried out by cooperative department staff in the last 45 days. He said that Rs 54.51 lakh was credited to the savings bank accounts of 66 farmers in Erode in February, 2021, well after the cut-off date for loan waiver. They too enjoyed the waiver benefits. As per the revenue records given by village administrative officers, 2,698 members of 12 societies in Salem should have received loans to the tune of Rs 4.9 crore, but their loans actually totalled Rs 21.7 crore, all because of jacking up land extent in the applications and wrongful mentioning of crops under cultivation. In Madurai, 11 cooperative societies, including the one located in Kochadai – which forms part of the city - extended loans to 81 farmers, violating the norms. The department also found that 1,338 farmers availed loans to the tune of Rs 9.5 crore in seven districts after the cut-off date, but they too were included on the waiver list. They include Salem (Rs 3.7cr), Kanyakumari (Rs 42.4 lakh), Tirunelveli (Rs 3.3cr), Thanjavur (Rs 1.1cr), The Nilgiris (Rs 28 lakh), Erode (Rs 54.5 lakh) and Tirupur (Rs 3.5 lakh). Raju denied the charges of irregularities in the disbursement of loans and waiver scheme. He said the AIADMK government issued a circular to the department – to all regional and district-level officials - on the guidelines for loan waiver on February 8. Periyasamy asked how could the previous government identify 16 lakh beneficiaries within days of announcing the loan-waiver scheme. He said there was a rush to include names on the beneficiaries’ list. He said the DMK government would ensure that all eligible people get loans in future too. He said there were societies that were eligible to extend loans up to Rs 4 lakh only, but they actually gave loans to the tune of Rs 10 crore. He said the government also had the task of reclaiming the societies from the clutches of money-lenders. The minister alleged that the previous AIADMK regime had disbursed 13.9 lakh multiple jewellery loans to the same beneficiaries and the amount involved was Rs 5,998.4 crore. For instance, Balakrishnapuram society in Dindigul disbursed 11 gold loans worth Rs 2.9 lakh to T Meena, 6 gold loans worth Rs 3.5 lakh to A Shaktivel and five loans worth Rs 3.4 lakh to S Selvavinayagam. Sources said the beneficiaries split the loans into five sovereigns each to enjoy the benefit of loan waiver announced in political parties’ election manifestoes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-flags-rs-516cr-scam-in-crop-loan-waiver/articleshow/85639390.cms||Julie Mariappan

City police chief N Shashi Kumar along with DCP (law and order) Hariram Shankar and DCP (crime and traffic) B P Dinesh Kumar, after visiting the police station on Wednesday, told reporters that the police station building situated on .67 acres was built in 1889 at a cost of Rs 16,000. The restoration works were taken up by inspector Govindaraju B, who was recently transferred to CCB Bengaluru, with the help of philanthropists, including City Centre Mall and others, at an approximate cost of Rs 8 lakh. “Several works, including replastering, electrical works, plugging seepage, parking and laying of interlocks have been undertaken. The colonial structure needs some more restoration to enhance its historic value, as it is located in the Central Business District of the coastal city, with close proximity to the old port,” Shashi Kumar said. ACP Central Subdivision, P A Hegde, and inspector Raghavendra M Byndoor provided details, and accompanied city police chief across the two-floor building. The station accommodates 65 staff, including five police sub-inspectors, eight ASIs, 20 head constables, 31 police constables and one inspector.

---||Mumbai||Arrest of Narayan Rane is justified but custodial interrogation not needed: Mahad court||MUMBAI: While granting Narayan Rane bail, the Mahad magistrate in his late night order observed that the arrest of the union cabinet minister was justified. Mahad police had arrested Rane on Tuesday afternoon after registering an FIR over his “slap” remark against CM Uddhav Thackeray. The police produced Rane before a judicial magistrate first class S S Patil in Mahad at 9.55 pm. The order said, “Admittedly the accused being a Central Cabinet Minister,” police necessarily should have remained along with him. The FIR was by a political party member, noted the magistrate and after considering reasons of arrest and the law said, “I find that arrest is justified.” Custodial interrogation is not necessary, said the order as statements Rane allegedly made were made before the police and “available on media” and as the FIR says, had gone “viral on social media.” Senior counsel Rajendra Shirodkar for Rane submitted he advised his client not to make similar statements in public. The court noted, “But he did not concede to give an undertaking to that effect,” citing liberty of the accused. “Considering the nature of offence I do not find it necessary to hand him over in police custody. Hence the accused is remanded in magisterial custody till September 4,” said the order. Rane then applied for bail, and the magistrate heard his counsel Shirodkar and Sangram Desai and perused objections of the prosecutor Bhushan Salvi and investigating officer Prakash Joshi. Salvi said that as Central cabinet minister, Rane may make a similar statement which will create disharmony in the community. Shirodkar however said the minister is 69 years old, has “roots in society,” doesn’t pose a flight risk and “will not abscond.” He said, he is “ready and willing to cooperate” with the investigating machinery and will abide by any conditions that will be imposed on him. Sections 153 B (1) (c ) (promoting disharmony) and 505(2) (statements to promote enmity or ill-will between classes) of the Indian Penal Code invoked in the Mahad FIR are cognizable offences and non-bailable, but not punishable with life imprisonment or death sentence. They attract up to three years’ imprisonment. The rest of the offences invoked against Rane are bailable, said the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mahad-court-arrest-is-justified-but-custodial-interrogation-not-needed/articleshow/85639452.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Lucknow||BSP has nothing to fear, we fought 110 cases and got clean chit, says BSP national general secretary SC Mishra||As the BJP continues to follow its Hindutva plank ahead of UP elections, the opposition parties, especially the BSP, are also out to woo Brahmins. BSP national general secretary SC Mishra has been criss-crossing the state to hold ‘prabuddh sammelans’ to win over Brahmins. In an interview to Rajiv Srivastava, Mishra spoke on Hindutva, party’s poll plans and social engineering. Excerpts:You have completed three phases of BSP’s ‘prabuddh sammelan’. How is the response?The response has been very good. I have done all this in 2004 and 2007 but I can say that the response has been 3-4 times better than what it used to be in the past. What could be the reason?Brahmins feel they have been cheated by the government in the name of Lord Ram as there have been several atrocities on them. You have been talking about the encounter of Bikru don Vikas Dubey. Are you not eulogizing a hardened criminal?If Vikas Dubey was a hardened criminal, how did he have connections with senior officers? There are photographs of Dubey with such officers. I have never justified his activities. Had you treated every criminal like Vikas Dubey, there would have been no problem. At least 50 Brahmins are behind the bars in the name of Vikas Dubey. It was not an encounter but a shootout. But the judicial commission has given a clean chit to cops…They said witnesses did not turn up to testify. Can clean chit be given like this? Whatever they (Yogi government) wanted has been written in the report. Only those will testify, whom they want to. If BSP forms government, will there be fresh inquiry into the Vikas Dubey encounter case?Definitely. Why do you talk about the encounter only?I talk about the atrocities on Brahmins. I am talking about those killed and harassed in the name of Dubey. And what about Vivek Tiwari or Rakesh Pandey? What about the trader’s murder in Mahoba where a senior police official is absconding for so long? What was termed as social engineering in 2007 ended in Brahmin appeasement. Now, you are again at it.We are not appeasing Brahmins. In 2007 too, social engineering was not appeasement but an effort to bring SCs and Brahmins together. We told Brahmins that they are 16% and if they join hands with Dalits, everyone would get honour. What happened in 2012?Brahmins thought they had got everything. Even otherwise, BSP was second on 2/3rd of the seats. We did not lose vote share and bagged 29% votes. In 2017, BJP played the Hindutva card and claimed that all work would be done in the name of Lord Ram. You are talking about Lord Ram, Lord Krishna and chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ are heard in your meetings? Why this sudden display of devotion to Lord Ram?My party never stopped me from offering prayer and visiting temples. I have been openly offering prayers. Every year, I organise recitation of the Ramcharitmanas at a temple in New Hyderabad, Lucknow. BSP chief Mayawati has been saying that such people are ‘manuwadi’.What does ‘manuwadi’ actually mean? It means there should not be any difference between upper and lower caste. During his supplementary budget speech, CM Yogi Adityanath said those who never took the name of Lord Ram are bowing before Him. What is your take?Why is Yogiji having trouble if we are talking about Lord Ram? Do they have exclusive rights? Have they ever thought about Lord Krishna? They just believe in showing off. Had we been showing off, we would not have developed Vrindavan, the abode of Lord Krishna. Can you imagine Vrindavan and Mathura without a sewer system? We provided a sewer line. We spent Rs 550 crore on the development of Vrindavan and Mathura. What should the majority expect from the BSP if it forms the government in 2022?The BSP government has never abandoned the places of worship or faith of Hindus. We have carried out so many development works at various places, be it Bithoor (Kanpur) or Varanasi. The only difference is that BJP only makes noise. They have spent Rs 250 crore and organised ‘deepotsav’ and claim they are working for Ayodhya’s development. One can see the poor condition of Ayodhya. Only the BSP can improve the condition in Ayodhya and Vrindavan. Yogiji is the head priest of Gorakshpeeth. He is concerned about Gorakhpur and he is doing work there. Ayodhya is our concern and we will work for it. There are speculations that you will be the BSP’s CM face in 2022?This is the handiwork of BJP and other parties. I am toiling hard to ensure that the BSP president becomes UP CM for the fifth time. The way you are travelling across the state, it appears you are the main leader of the BSP.I am BSP’s national general secretary. Mayawati held a press conference to announce that she has instructed me to tour the state. I am following the instructions. After the demise of former CM Kalyan Singh, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav skipped the last rites. How do you see this?There should not be any politics on the death of a national leader. Mayawati jiwas the first to pay tribute even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit was planned. If BSP falls short of numbers, will it go for any alliance, post-poll or pre-poll?There will not be any alliance. How would you respond to claims that BSP is BJP’s ‘B team’?It is being said by those who are in the ‘C and D’ categories of popularity. Those parties are on the verge of extinction. There are discussions on social media that Mayawati is afraid of action by the BJP government. Is it true?What action can they take and in which case? Whatever they had to do, they have already done. We contested 110 cases. BJP got CBI raid conducted against behenji and Congress carried the case forward. What was the result? We got clean chit in all the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsp-has-nothing-to-fear-we-fought-110-cases-and-got-clean-chit/articleshow/85641475.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Union minister Narayan Rane defiant, says ‘where is the law and order in Maharashtra?’||MUMBAI: A day after being arrested and released on bail for remarks against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Union minister Narayan Rane struck a defiant note, hitting out at Shiv Sena leaders and pledging to renew efforts to “get the guilty punished” for the deaths of Disha Salian and Puja Chavan, two politically sensitive cases where probes are still on. Addressing a presser at his residence on Wednesday, Rane steered clear of repeating his controversial comments, but said he was justifiably angry that the CM should be ignorant about India’s independence and said what he did so that it does not happen again. He read out statements made by Thackeray to underscore the intemperate language used by Sena leaders against rivals. “Our colleague Lad (MLC Prasad Lad) made a statement, ‘Bring down the Sena board’. At the BDD chawl function, the chief minister responded, ‘anyone says anything about Sena Bhavan, ‘thobaad fodaa (break their face).’ On Yogi Adityanath (UP chief minister), he said, ‘Ha Yogi aahe ki dhongi, chhapaline marayla pahije (Is he a yogi or charlatan? He should be beaten with slippers).’ For Amit Shah and me, he used the word, ‘nirlajj (shameless)’. Is this not a crime?” he asked. The court rulings in his favour in the present case clearly showed the rule of law, said Rane. Referring to a video which allegedly shows Sena minister Anil Parab pressuring police officials to arrest Rane, he asked “Where is the law and order in the state?” Rane said women are not safe in the state. “Women are being raped and killed. Be it Disha Salian, Puja Chavan…no investigation. We shall ensure...action is taken. We will ensure the minister is arrested,” he said. Salian who was Sushant’s Singh’s manager, allegedly died by suicide days before the actor too allegedly ended his life. BJP had accused a “Yuva” minister of involvement in the case. The allegations prompted Aditya Thackeray to issue a statement that he had nothing to do with the controversy. In case of Puja Chavan, a Tik Tok star, Sena MLA and former forest minister Sanjay Rathod was forced to resign after audio clips surfaced linking him to Chavan, who died by alleged suicide. Rane also spoke of the Yuva Sena protestors outside his Juhu home. He said his home was attacked when the male members were not present. “Do you have no family, children? I am not afraid of anyone…I have made a big contribution to the growth of the Shiv Sena. Those who move around as leaders were not therethen,” he said. Rane said he would resume his Jan Aashirwad yatra from Sindhudurg on Friday. His son and MLA Nitesh Rane earlier tweeted a picture of Yuva Sena members meeting the CM at his official residence and said, “So it was indeed state-sponsored violence just like West Bengal! As a head of the state the CM shud be ensuring safety but he is actually felicitating hooligans! State of affairs in Maharashtra! President’s rule is the only way out to ensure safety from these thugs!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rane-defiant-says-where-is-the-law-and-order-in-maharashtra/articleshow/85639474.cms||---

Thanvi, who is a V-C of Harideo University of Mass Communication and Journalism in Jaipur was given the additional charge of the MDS in September 2020.“Thanvi’s decisions of questioning the autonomy of Centre for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management (CESBM) ran for 17 years by former dean of Commerce and BJP leader BP Saraswat and allegations that Thanvi removed the Yoga teachers from the MDS doesn’t go well with the party leaders of Ajmer,” said a source.The letter jointly signed by Ajmer MP Bhagirath Choudhary, former education minister Vasudev Devnani, Nasirabad MLA Ramswarup Lamba, senior BJP leader Omkar Singh Lakhawat and local BJP leader BP Saraswat alleged Thanvi of violating the rules and demanding full-time V-C.The CESBM was developed by the central government by initial funding of Rs 1 crore on the basis of a proposal sent by the university. Saraswat was made the in-charge of the centre. “Thanvi decided that the budget of the centre will be decided by the university since it is part of the university. Saraswat, who was the director of the centre vehemently opposed the decision and called it a merger of centre with the university. In a letter to the governor said that centre is autonomous which is independent of the university,” said the source.Clarifying on dropping Yoga trainers, Thanvi in a letter to the governor said that the decision of dropping the trainers was taken by the academic council formed during the tenure of former VC RP Singh. They have not been dropped,” said the source.PC Trivedi, the V-C of Jai Narain Vyas University in Jodhpur has been given the additional charge of MDS university. Devnani tweeted that I welcome the decision taken by the governor of removing the V-C Om Thanvi. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mds-univ-v-c-relieved-of-duties-after-plaints-by-ajmer-bjp-leaders/articleshow/85639455.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Dispel myths about radiation risks from cell towers: Chief secy||Jaipur: Chief secretary Niranjan Arya directed to address the problems of telecom service providers to ensure effective use of Information Technology. Arya said that in order to increase the number of mobile towers in the state, it is necessary to create awareness among the people about the misconception about mobile radiation which is a major hurdle in the state. Arya said that Rajasthan being the state with the largest geographical area of the country, effective expansion of communication facilities is very important and a challenge. The chief secretary was presiding over the meeting of the state level Broadband Committee through video conferencing for effective implementation and dissemination of Broadband Campaign in the state under the National Broadband Campaign. Arya directed that pending cases with various departments for installation of towers should be disposed of at the earliest so that telecom infrastructure could be strengthened in the state. He also suggested re-fixation of user charges paid by telecom service providers. In the meeting, principal secretary, Information Technology and Communications Department, Alok Gupta informed that there are about 6 crore mobile users in the state. But despite being the largest state geographically, the number of mobile towers is less. So by removing the negative attitude of the people towards mobile radiation, best telecom facilities could be provided to the people. Besides officials, representatives of various telecom companies and the representatives of Infrastructure Providers Association, representatives of Cellular Operators Association of India were present through video conferencing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dispel-myths-about-radiation-risks-from-cell-towers-chief-secy/articleshow/85639485.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘Haritha Haram should become state’s norm’||Dr Anjal Prakash, research director and adjunct associate professor, Bharti Institute of Public Policy at Indian School of Business, says there is an urgent need to turn environmental planning into action in order to reduce detrimental effects of climate change. As the author of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on cities, settlements and essential infrastructure, he tells Sribala Vadlapatla extreme droughts and heatwaves are likely to become common and severe. Excerpts from the interview.What are the big worries for Hyderabad based on the IPCC report?Scientists forecast warmer conditions for semi-arid locations across the world and Hyderabad has a similar climate. It means that summers would be hotter and monsoons will be wetter. The IPCC report states that urban flooding or drought will be the result of climate changes but the location and frequency of these events will be determined by expected changes in regional atmospheric circulation like monsoons and mid-latitude storm tracks. Explain how the city’s rainfall pattern is changingIn July this year, Hyderabad received almost 31% of the total rainfall for the month with some areas receiving 22 cm of rain in a single day. The number of rainy days will decrease, resulting in more rainfall in a shorter period of time and long periods of non-rainy days throughout the monsoon. Cities are drivers of climate change and recipients of catastrophic events if their infrastructure is not designed to cope with them. What consequences are expected for Telangana based on the IPCC report?A large portion of Telangana is in dry or semi-arid agro-ecological zones, which will be severely impacted by global warming. As per the IPCC report, the globe will be warmer by 1.5 degrees in the next 10-20 years. Each degree of warming will have a significant impact on the state. What should Telangana do to lessen the effects of climate change?Programmes like Haritha Haram should become the state’s norm. Aforestation is one of the key areas that have both adaptation and mitigation benefits. Telangana has tanks and ponds, intentionally created on a landscape to arrest water even with little rainfall. Unique laws should be formulated and implemented strictly to protect their boundaries. Lakes are also regulators of the local climate. The second step is to make cities and communities more climate-resilient. This means that infrastructure must be re-evaluated in order to incorporate the latest research and make the required improvements to adapt. Environmental planning and urban planning should go together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/haritha-haram-should-become-states-norm/articleshow/85641516.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Won’t take coercive action against Narayan Rane till September 17, Maharashtra govt assures Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The state government on Wednesday assured the Bombay high court that it will not take any coercive steps till September 17 against Union cabinet minister Narayan Rane in connection with the FIR registered against him at Nashik over his “slap” remark against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The state’s special senior counsel Amit Desai made the statement before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar after the HC granted Rane leave to amend a freshly filed quashing petition and to bring on record all the FIRs filed against him, while adjourning the hearing till September 17. Desai said Rane be asked not to make any similar statements in the meantime. Rane’s counsel Satish Maneshinde and Aniket Nikam, who were seeking interim relief against any coercive action in the case, opposed, saying it is matter of his freedom of speech. “I can’t make any statements that he (Rane) will not utter anything,” said Maneshinde. Rane, 69, is Union minister for micro, small and medium enterprises. On Wednesday, he filed a petition through advocate Nikam before the high court to seek quashing of an August 24 FIR against him at cyber police station in Nashik. His petition said that a series of crimes registered for the same transaction is nothing but an attempt to cause him “harassment” and multiplicity of litigation. He also said “there is a possibility of many more such FIRs being registered” in different parts of the state “out of political vengeance and grudge.” The FIR and 3 others at Pune, Mahad and Thane were filed following Rane’s “slap” remark against CM Uddhav Thackeray during a press conference on August 23. The offences invoked included Section 153 (B) for allegedly making statements to promote disharmony and breach of peace in society. Maneshinde said Rane made a statement in a press conference which was hypothetical. “One hypothetical statement has created so many ripples in the state.I do not know what will happen if truth is said. It’s a total malafide exercise of power.” He added that the person who registered the FIR took umbrage to the statement and the state machinery is being misused and with a political vendetta FIRs are being registered statewide over the same press conference under different provisions of law even when no criminal offence is disclosed. Rane’s petition said, “It is settled position of law that effects of the words must be judged from the standards of the reasonable, strong-minded, firm and courageous men and not those of weak and vacillating minds nor of those who scent danger in every hostile point of view.” It stated the allegations against him are “vague.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/wont-take-coercive-action-against-rane-till-sept-17-state-assures-bombay-hc/articleshow/85639521.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Third Covid wave not expected to be as big as second, says BMC||MUMBAI: The third Covid-19 wave is imminent and could begin as early as next month, coinciding with the festive season, according to BMC officials. The silver lining, though, is the third wave may not be as “big” as the second when the number of active Covid-19 cases had touched 91,000 in April, said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani on Wednesday. Though the third wave could be delayed, it is certain to hit Mumbai, said Kakani. “There are a few reasons for this—the upcoming festive season, a receding monsoon season and reverse migration,” he added. Cases had shot up after Ganeshotsav in September 2020 when, due to weather change, virus activity had increased too. Lastly, BMC officials say unskilled workers who had left for their hometowns during the second wave restrictions would be returning to the city in huge numbers in coming weeks. The peak was observed around September 18 when active cases rose to 34,259. “We expect the number of active Covid cases during the third wave to be between the first and second waves,” Kakani added. A factor contributing to a lower third wave would be the ongoing mass vaccination drive. Around 73% of the city’s eligible population has taken the first dose while 25% are fully vaccinated. Experts have maintained that changes in the disease patterns would be visible once 30% of the population is fully vaccinated; herd immunity will require more than 75% of the population to be fully vaccinated. “This number of those who have taken the first dose may reach 80% soon (before the third wave) while the number of those who will be vaccinated with both doses is also increasing,” he added. In a bid to increase the percentage of fully vaccinated people, the BMC plans to reserve certain days of the week to vaccinate those seeking the second dose. A senior BMC health department official said the field staff have been told to vaccinate as many people as possible when stocks come in. As the vaccination drive in the past 10 days has shown, the BMC can on its own vaccinate over 1 lakh people in a single day (that is, over and above those vaccinated in the private sector). Officials said during the festive season in the country it is difficult to keep citizens away from socialising as it has been the tradition followed in the country. “Therefore, the festive season, which begins in September and goes on till December, will be very crucial and to watch out for as far as the third wave is concerned,” said a BMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3rd-wave-not-expected-to-be-as-big-as-2nd-says-bmc/articleshow/85637028.cms||Richa Pinto

The deceased was identified as Khoda Dabhi, a resident of Bhegali village. According to Mota Khuntavada police, a complaint was lodged against Bhupat Jetapara, brother of village the sarpanch, for culpable homicide and hiding evidence. Jetapara is on the run. On the night of August 21, Dabhi left his house to fishin Shetrunji river. His family was worried as he did not return home till the morning, police said. “We went to the river in search of him and also informed the police about my missing brother. Later, on the same day, his body was found from a farm owned by Kalu Kakadia. There was a blood stain near his ear and abnormal injuries on legs. The postmortem revealed that he had died of electrocution,” Deva, the deceased’s brother, said in his police complaint. Police learnt that Bhupat Jetapara had put up an electric fence around his farm. During the investigation it came to fore that in order to destroy evidence, Jetapra disposed of the victim’s body in a nearby farm. Later, he removed the wire fencing and buried it at his farm. Cops spotted the marks that could have been left by dragging the body at Jetapara’s farm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/talaja-man-touches-electrified-fence-dies/articleshow/85634294.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: CM Yogi Adityanath's poll sweetener with cane price hike after Centre raises Fair and Remunerative Price||LUCKNOW: Hours after the Union cabinet approved an increase in Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugar, chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced his government’s decision to raise State Advisory Price (SAP) for the crop, ahead of the ensuing crushing season. The state government had left SAP unchanged at Rs 315 (for common variety) for three years in a row since 2018-19. The UP government had, however, raised SAP by Rs 10 per quintal soon after assuming power in 2017. The move is expected to placate restive farmers, particularly in the west UP region, ahead of the high-stakes assembly elections next year. The CM also announced that cane arrears since 2010 will be paid before the next crushing season. “We will ensure timely payments and raise sugarcane price,” Yogi said. “The decision will be communicated to all stakeholders so that farmers are not misguided,” Yogi said, after meeting a delegation of farmers, including members of BJP Kisan Morcha. On Wednesday, the Centre raised FRP from Rs 285 to Rs 290 per quintal, triggering speculation that state governments would fall in line and raise SAP in the cane crushing season from October. “The state government has managed to pay more than 85% cane dues to farmers for the 2029-21 crushing season. A record Rs 1.45 lakh crore was paid to farmers in the last four years,” a senior official in the cane department told TOI. He said, the cane payment was done, despite challenges posed by the pandemic that brought economic and industrial activity to a standstill. Experts say the demand for sugar in the commercial sector fell dramatically and sugar mills faced a contracted paying capacity. Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said the FRP hike has raised expectations about an increased minimum selling price (MSP) of sugar as well. “It will be necessary to help sugar mills accommodate higher cane price payment to farmers in current and next season,” ISMA said. The association said, MSP of sugar has remained static for over 30 months, even though cane FRP was raised by Rs 10/quintal in 2020-21. It further noted that the Group of Ministers, Niti Aayog, Committee of Secretaries and several state governments had sought an increase in sugar MSP between March and July 2020 last year. “We hope the government will pay heed to these recommendations and increase MSP up to Rs 35/kg. That MSP will be adequate to cover the increase in cane FRP and cost of producing the sugar,” the association maintained. Interestingly, Centre’s decision to increase FRP and Yogi Adityanath’s announcement to raise cane price came a day after Congress-ruled Punjab raised SAP by Rs 50 from Rs 310 to Rs 360 per quintal. Opposition ranks were quick to react with Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Jayant Chaudhary raking up the demand for an increase in SAP in Uttar Pradesh as well. This also comes ahead of the scheduled ‘mahapanchayat’ by Kisan Sanyukt Morcha in Muzaffarnagar on September 5. The morcha comprises Bhartiya Kisan Union, one of the factions that stood at the vanguard of farmers’ agitation against new farm laws. BKU state vice-president Harinam Singh Verma said, the issue of cane farmers will feature prominently in the ‘mahapanchayat’ to pressurize the ruling BJP to take up farmer welfare measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogis-poll-sweetener-with-cane-price-hike-after-centre-raises-frp/articleshow/85641558.cms||Pankaj Shah

The state should benefit from it by taking up health projects, Pawar said. “The Centre has sent the first instalment of Rs 123 crore to Maharashtra under NHM to enable the health department to carry out various health projects. The state should take up Covid management and other activities,” said Pawar. A senior state public health official has said for financial year 2021-22, the Centre has approved a plan of Rs 4,500 crore on a 60:40 sharing formula, according to which, the Central government will provide Rs 2,700 crore and the state government Rs 1,800 crore, the official said, adding it will include a provision of Rs 1,300 crore for tackling Covid-19. “The proposal was approved at a high-level meeting of the national project consultation committee before the beginning of the financial year,” he said.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan sees over 48,000 estimated excess deaths since March 2020||JAIPUR: It is estimated that the state has reported 48,173 excess deaths since the Covid-19 pandemic emerged in March 2020. Excess deaths are measured as the difference in the total number of deaths in a crisis compared to those expected under normal conditions. It means that tragically, 48,173 more persons have lost their lives than it would have expected at the particular time period of the pandemic. According to the WHO, Covid excess mortality accounts for both the total number of deaths directly attributed to the virus as well as the indirect impact, such as disruption to essential health services or travel disruptions. The excess mortality is a measure of the overall impact of the pandemic but it’s hard to predict how many of the fatalities happened due to Covid. Rajasthan’s estimated excess deaths per million is 605, which is much better in comparison to most of the states such as Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh with 2,403,791, 4,585, 1,806 and 2,985 deaths, respectively. The estimated excess deaths per million in Andhra Pradesh is 4,610 and 2,883 in Tamil Nadu. In Rajasthan, the number of virus deaths stands at 8,954, which means as many as 113 persons died of Covid per million. But, when the estimated excess death is calculated during Covid-19 pandemic, the death toll stands at 48,173. This means, going by the estimated figure, it is 5.38 times of 8,954 Covid fatalities that happened since March 2020. Bihar’s estimated excess deaths is 48.6 times of 9,650 Covid deaths happened in the same period. Likewise, Madhya Pradesh’s estimated excess deaths are 23.8 times, Andhra Pradesh’s 17.9 times, West Bengal’s 11.1 times and Gujarat’s 9.81 times of the virus deaths reported in their districts in the same period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-sees-over-48k-estimated-excess-deaths-since-mar-20/articleshow/85639588.cms||---

The decision on the same will be taken by the end of the month, said P S Yadapadithaya, vice-chancellor. According to the university, they need three justifications for conducting semester examinations through online mode. The first justification is that the examination calendar is getting affected due to the pandemic. Any further delay will cause inconvenience to students who want to take up jobs or go for higher studies. The second is that 90% of teaching has been done online for students and the third is that students have been demanding online examinations. Yadapadithaya told TOI that online examinations can be conducted using face recognition technology at every campus, in less than 1.5 hours. There is a room to conduct more than two examinations per day, for each candidate. Moreover, it will be a multiple-choice question based examination. “The positive side of online examination is that it saves time, and results can be announced in a few days for all courses,” he said. On promotion of undergraduate second and fourth semester students and postgraduate second-semester students as per UGC guidelines, Yadapadithaya said it will be taken up as soon as the results of ongoing semester examinations are announced. “We have completed 80% of evaluation of ongoing examination papers, and results are likely to be announced any time after September 15. After a week, we will take up promotions for even-semester courses. It is applicable for both undergraduates and postgraduates,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mu-mulls-online-exam-for-final-semester-ugpg-students/articleshow/85634310.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Kolkata||Suman Salt Lake road repair 25.08.21||Kolkata: Taking advantage of the dry weather in the last couple of days, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has taken up emergent road repair work on some of the most damaged stretches in Salt Lake. On Wednesday, the civic authorities blocked a long road stretch falling behind Bidyut Bhavan near Karunamoyee for putting a new bituminous layer on the battered surface. The stretch, locals said had become badly damaged with craters and potholes all along. The civic authorities have also laid new bituminous surface on the road stretch near Tank no 9. Not only the most damaged main thoroughfares, road patch work by laying new bituminous layer have also started on some of the worst lanes inside blocks. A stretch at AB AC block market was also repaired on Wednesday. With condition of roads in Salt Lake deteriorating with the onset of monsoon, the civic authorities had taken up patchwork of roads in several places of the township about a month back, specially on the lanes inside the blocks using the Rs 30crore funds sanctioned by the government for BMC but work had to be stopped due to the incessant rains. “Now with a pause in the rains which could be seen, we are repairing the most damaged stretches as much as possible using the available fund,” said a civic official. The civic authorities have already placed a detail project report to the state government for taking up thorough road repairs for all the 41 wards of BMC covering Salt Lake and Rajarhat and is awaiting approval and clearance of funds. Proper upkeep and maintenance of roads have been a constant worry for the BMC authorities, as it has been seen that roads which undergoes patch work, again deteriorate sbadly after a few spells of heavy rains in a few months. BMC was piling up a list of such roads to take up the matter with the agencies engaged with road repair work by asking them to look after maintenance of the roads for three years failing which action will be taken against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-salt-lake-road-repair-25-08-21/articleshow/85637142.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Deputy commissioner Sushant Gaurav said, “The district response team will employ local youths and they will be the first responders in case of any mishap. This will enable us to save lives. The NDRF teams will be called only when the local team cannot tackle a major disaster.” Simdega sub-divisional officer Mahendra Kumar said 57 young men, who know swimming, have been picked from various blocks and have been enrolled in a two-day boot camp. “Forty more men were trained at Kobang Dam under Pakartarn block while 22 men from the previous batch were trained at Kelaghagh Dam,” Kumar added. They are being trained by an 11-member NDRF team in various swimming and boating techniques and rescuing people from high-river current and from drowning. “We have selected these men from Simdega, Kolebira, Pakartarn, Kersai and Bolba blocks after they showed their interest to save lives in case of a disaster in any part of the district,” Kumar said.

---||Ranchi||Hope springs for herd immunity as 6 districts in Jharkhand become Covid-free||RANCHI: Though health experts have not ruled out a possible third wave in the coming months, doctors believe that the trends in Jharkhand are indicative of herd immunity. In terms of figures, Jharkhand has shown an encouraging trend with as many as six districts becoming Covid-free while four others have one case each. As on Wednesday, Chatra, Deoghar, Garhwa, Gumla, Hazaribag and Palamu has no active case while Bokaro, Dumka, Pakur and Simdega have one case each. The cumulative load of active cases in the state has come down to 153, a level that was last breached on May 20, 2020, during the initial month of the outbreak of the pandemic when the state had recorded 158 active cases. According to data, the first case of Covid-19 was reported in Jharkhand on March 31 last year and it crossed the 150 mark for the first time after 50 days on May 20 the same year. Other data too offer a positive indication. On August 26 last year, the number of active cases was hovering at the 10,000 mark. People are prone to catching the flu more during the monsoon months (July-September) because of hyperactivity of several influenza-causing viruses during this period. Doctors at Rims agree that even this year, the number of patients with influenza-like symptoms have increased. “While the symptoms are similar to those of Covid-19, most of the patients have tested negative,” said a doctor at Rims. Head of department of Preventive Social Medicine (PSM) at Rims, Dr Devesh Kumar, said it was after the sudden peak in infection in the months of April-May this year that Jharkhand has moved towards herd immunity. “I think the best explanation for fewer cases this year during the same season when it was at its peak, last year lies in possible herd immunity,” he said. His opinion was supported by president, Jharkhand Chapter of Indian Medical Association, Dr AK Singh, who gave credit to natural infection and vaccine coverage as well. “A little over 60% of the eligible population have received vaccine doses and more than 10% of the population is known to have got infected with the virus, so it wouldn't be wrong to assume that we are heading towards herd immunity,” he said. Despite the optimism among a section of medical experts, another section has recently warned of a possible third wave by October. Explaining the concern, Kumar said some medical experts believe that the naturally gained immunity after exposure to the virus will gradually wane by October and they would again be susceptible to fresh infection. “I personally believe that had it been the case we should have witnessed a spike in infections by August-September. Those still carrying the virus, though in small numbers, may infect those who recovered long ago but it's a matter of time before it can be scientifically established that natural immunity also lasts longer than thought previously,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hope-springs-for-herd-immunity-as-6-districts-become-covid-free/articleshow/85638657.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Salahuddin Sheikh used Covid centre to divert foreign funds||VADODARA: When Covid-19 pandemic hit the city last year, accused Salahuddin Sheikh played a key role in starting a centre on Waghodia Road where Covid patients were treated. But investigations have led police to reveal that he actually used the centre as a front to illegally divert money he got through foreign donations. Cops are now scanning the bank accounts of this centre and other organisations that Sheikh was connected to. “Prima facie investigations show that he used this Covid centre too for diverting foreign funding,” said a senior police official. Cops are investigating how the accused prepared fake bills, bloated expenses, and then laundered the cash for funding legal expenses of the accused arrested in anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests and Delhi riots. “Sheikh is connected to several organisations and all of them are under the scanner. He was in close contact with some persons in Bharuch and Surat who were a part of this money laundering racket. Some more arrests are expected in the coming days,” the official told TOI. The investigators have applied for a transfer warrant in a local court and a team of cops is expected to leave for Uttar Pradesh in a couple of days to take custody of Sheikh and another accused Mohammed Umar. Sheikh was getting foreign donations in Afmi Trust in the name of social causes like aid to widows, buying food kits, funding hospitals and also for Covid pandemic. He used to make bogus bills to show these payments while the money was diverted to other bank accounts for allegedly building mosques and for conversion activities. The UP ATS had arrested Md Umar and Qazi Jahangir in June this year on the charges of mass conversions of people through inducements like marriage or jobs. Umar was alleged to have converted over 1,000 persons in UP. He is suspected to be involved in mass conversions of deaf and mute students, women and children. During their interrogation, the cops learnt that Sheikh’s bank accounts were used for hawala transactions. Donations for trust misused:Cops said Sheikh had diverted over Rs 7.27 crore fund he got for Afmi Charitable Trust, of which he is a trustee. He misused the foreign donations and sent it to build more than 100 mosques in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Assam and Madhya Pradesh in the last few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sheikh-used-covid-centre-to-divert-foreign-funds/articleshow/85634131.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Ranchi||AICC appoints Rajesh Thakur as new Jharkhand Congress chief||RANCHI: Less than a month after the horse trading controversy erupted, the Congress leadership on Wednesday evening deposed its incumbent Jharkhand unit president Rameshwar Oraon and named one of his deputies as his successor. Septuagenarian Oraon, the finance minister in the cabinet of chief minister Hemant Soren, was replaced by 49-year-old Rajesh Thakur. Thakur was one of the five working presidents who were reporting to Oraon. AICC general secretary KC Venugopal, in his letter, put Thakur at the helm of affairs in Jharkhand with immediate effect and appreciated Oraon for his contributions during his two-year-long stint. Along with Oraon, four other working presidents – Kamlesh Kumar Mahto, Irfan Ansari, Manas Sinha and Sanjay Lal Paswan – were also deposed. Their places were taken by Singhbhum MP Geeta Koda (former CM Madhu Koda’s wife), Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey (former education minister of the state), Jaleshwar Mahto and Shahzada Anwar (former Rajya Sabha candidate of the party last year). “It is an honour for me that the party’s national leadership has given an ordinary karyakarta like me the opportunity to lead. My focus will be on strengthening the organization at the grassroots, bring cohesion within the rank and file of the party and take the party forward in the state,” Thakur told TOI over phone from New Delhi. Oraon, an IPS officer-turned-politician, who also served as the chairman of the National SC/ST Commission, will demit office after two years. Handed the leadership baton after Ajoy Kumar’s hasty exit after the 2019 Lok Sabha poll debacle, Oraon led the grand old party to its biggest ever victory in the Jharkhand assembly polls by bagging 16 seats after contesting the polls in an alliance with JMM and RJD. However, Oraon became the subject of scrutiny soon after his appointment as the finance minister. While there were voices of dissent within the party ranks with him holding two posts, resentment within the MLAs and horsetrading row further worsened his sway within the ranks. Thakur, a former NSUI leader in Delhi University, rose through the party ranks and became the Bokaro district Congress chief. He was appointed the chairman of media cell of the party during the tenure of former state Congress chief Sukhdeo Bhagat in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/aicc-appoints-rajesh-thakur-as-new-state-congress-chief/articleshow/85638785.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||HC junks plea challenging JPSC age cut-off date change||Ranchi: The Jharkhand high court on Wednesday dismissed an appeal seeking modification in the cut-off date for determining age limit to appear in the 7th Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) examinations. A division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad dismissed the appeal clearing way for the commission to hold its examinations. The appeal was filed by Rina Kumari, Amit Kumar and several other candidates who challenged the decision of the JPSC to alter the cut-off date for being eligible to sit for the preliminary examinations of the public service commission. The exams are proposed to be held in September this year. The appellants’ counsel, Ajit Kumar, argued before the court that earlier the commission had issued an advertisement declaring the cut-off date for being eligible to appear in the exams to be August 2011. The advertisement was issued in the last year. The JPSC then issued a fresh advertisement earlier this year declaring the cut-off date to be August 2016. The appellants were aggrieved by the second advertisement of the commission and pleaded that the cut-off date should be August 2011. The plea of the appellants was opposed by the state government and the JPSC. Arguing on behalf of the state government, advocate general Rajiv Ranjan said that the decision of the commission was in the larger interest of candidates and was a matter of policy. The high court after having heard the parties at length upheld that the decision of the JPSC to alter the cut-off date for eligibility of candidates to appear in the exams cannot be challenged and dismissed the appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-junks-plea-challenging-jpsc-age-cut-off-date-change/articleshow/85639673.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Clean chit for Ajoy in Maoist-link case||Ranchi: A special court for trying MPs-MLAs offenses on Wednesday acquitted senior Congress leader Dr Ajoy Kumar for lack of evidence in a 10-year-old case pertaining to his alleged links with an extremist. BJP leader Dineshanand Goswami had registered a case with Sakchi police station in July 2011 alleging that Kumar had talked to an extremist, Samarji, and sought the latter’s help in winning the Jamshedpur parliamentary by-election. Goswami had also gave the police a compact disc purpotedly carrying the record of the conversation between Kumar and the extremist. The case was transferred from the Jamshedpur district court to the special court in Ranchi in September 2020. Kumar had recorded his statement before the court on Tuesday under section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code saying he was innocent. Lawyer Vimal Kumar who represented the Congress leader in court said, “The court of Dinesh Kumar acquitted Ajoy Kumar as the prosecution could not produce substantial evidence which could prove the allegations against Kumar beyond reasonable doubts. The prosecution produced one witness during the trial but could not establish that compact disc of call recording produced before court was of Kumar’s conversation with the Maoist leader Samarji.” It may be stated here that Kumar had won the Jamshedpur parliamentary by-election as a Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) candidate in 2011. Goswami had contested the election on a BJP ticket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/clean-chit-for-ajoy-in-maoist-link-case/articleshow/85638739.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Jugsalai municipality, cops come down hard on Cov-rule violators||Jamshedpur: A special drive was undertaken by the Jugsalai municipality and local police to book those flouting Covid-19 protocols. As directed earlier by East Singhbhum deputy commissioner Suraj Kumar to keep a close watch on the market places in both urban and rural areas, where people are more prone to disregarding the guidelines, the team during operation caught around 100 people violating the protocols. Administration officials said on Wednesday that those caught at various places in Jugsalai market area were taken to camp jail. They were detained and let off only after Covid-19 tests and with a warning that repeat offenders will not be spared. Gyaneshwar Prasad of the Jugsalai civic body said those found roaming in the market area without masks were picked up and taken to the camp jail. A fine of Rs 3,500 was collected from the shop owners for not following the rule book. Similar checking was done in several areas under Sonari police station. Those found not wearing masks were let off with a warning. They were directed to wear masks without fail even if they have received the second dose of the jab. Three shops in the area which were found not following the protocols, were sealed for 24 hours. Another shop was sealed for 72 hours, officials said. The shopowners were directed to allow only customers with proper masks to enter the premises. If the direction is not followed, the shopowners would be penalised.

---||Ranchi||‘New appointment policy will strengthen healthcare facilities’||Ranchi: A day after the Jharkhand cabinet gave its approval to the department of health, medical education and family welfare’s proposal to frame new appointment regulations to recruit professors and assistant professors in medical colleges on a contractual basis, the state health minister, Banna Gupta, on Wednesday termed the new policy as a ‘historical one’. He said that not only will it strengthen healthcare facilities but also improve medical studies in Jharkhand. While talking about the advantages of the policy, Banna said, “With the new policy, we will ensure that all vacant posts are filled up at the earliest, so that academic sessions can start on time this year. Our students had suffered a lot due to the National Medical Commission’s (NMC) control over the admission process of the three new medical colleges (Palamu, Hazaribag and Dumka) in Jharkhand. Had NMC allowed admissions to take place, we would have hired 300 aspiring doctors last year.” Last year, the NMC had not allowed admissions to take place in the medical colleges of Palamu, Dumka and Hazaribag by citing lack of specialised faculty members. The contractual system of employment has a massive attrition rate in Jharkhand and when TOI asked Banna about it, he said, “Although it’s true that the contractual system is marred by protests, as we have seen in the past, we must keep in mind that people protest when they aren’t paid for their work and are removed forcibly even when they haven’t done anything wrong, a practice followed by earlier governments. In the new policy, we have made it a point to make sure that an employee’s benefits are not affected anytime.” Under the new policy, a professor will be paid a salary ranging from Rs 2.2 lakh to 2.5 lakh while an associate professor will be paid a monthly remuneration between Rs 1.88 lakh and Rs 2 lakh. The policy also states that the faculty members will be appointed for a two-year term and he/she will have the opportunity of becoming a permanent staff during his/her tenure. Asked if the new policy only applies only to the new medical colleges, Banna said, “It will be effective for all medical colleges and for any department or superspecialty hospital that needs resources.” Upon contact, a senior health department official said that there are over 200 vacant posts across state and they needs to be filled up at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/new-appointment-policy-will-strengthen-healthcare-facilities/articleshow/85639563.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren to unveil new state industrial policy in Delhi||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Tuesday travelled to New Delhi to unveil the new Jharkhand Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy (JIPP)-2021 and attract investments across diverse sectors in the state. Soren’s office announced that he will camp in the national capital for three days and will hold one on one meetings with the stakeholders, industry representatives and listen to the proposals and requirement of the investors. Representatives of the country’s leading industrial houses are expected to attend the meetings on August 26 and 27, his office said. Earlier this year, Soren had held consultations with industry representatives and sought their suggestions for drafting the new policy. The JIPP-2021, which was approved by the state cabinet on July 6 this year, will replace the 2016 state industrial policy that was drafted by the erstwhile Raghubar Das government. Armed with the new policy, the state government aims to fetch investments worth Rs 1 lakh crore with a focus on textile and apparels, automobile, auto components and electric vehicles, food and meat processing, pharmaceuticals, tourism, health, IT, renewable energy, breweries and distilleries, education and technical institutes and MSMEs. “Jharkhand is a land of unlimited opportunities. We will welcome all investors with open arms and provide them every possible facility right from the scratch to production,” Soren said. Soren’s push towards fetching new incentives comes at a time when nearly 3,000 industrial units across the state’s industrial areas have either ceased production or have permanently shut down. Soren’s party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), had in its 2019 election manifesto promised 5 lakh jobs to the youth of the state within one year of assuming office. JMM had been critical of the erstwhile Das government’s 2017 Momentum Jharkhand Global Investors’ Summit which was held in Ranchi. “Through the new policy, we are aiming to maximize the incentives for investors and ensure that they enjoy a business-friendly ecosystem in Jharkhand,” industry secretary Puja Singhal said. The JIPP-2021 promises capital investment subsidies up to Rs 25 crore and a 100% SGST relief for nine years to new companies if they set up units in Jharkhand. At the meet, the industry department will try to woo investors from the electronic manufacturing and design sector by showcasing its newly built electronic manufacturing cluster in Adityapur. The 82-acre facility can accommodated 92 factory units and 51 electronic manufacturing units, the government said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-to-unveil-new-state-industrial-policy-in-delhi/articleshow/85638614.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||India||Eye on polls, UP to junk stubble-burning cases||NEW DELHI: The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday announced withdrawal of cases filed against farmers for stubble-burning. It also announced to waive off the fines imposed on them for the offence. The state is slated to go to polls early next year. An official release issued by the state government quoted chief minister Yogi Adityanath as saying, “The government will withdraw stubble-burning cases registered against the farmers and the decision on refund of fine will also be taken.” The CM held an interaction with farmers on Wednesday evening. According to the release, Adityanath promised farmers that his government will ensure that all previous payments of farmers that have been pending since 2010 are cleared before the new cane-crushing season. He said the decision will be communicated to all the stakeholders so that the farmers are not misguided. The government said the CM has instructed officials to not sever electricity connection of any farmer due to pending dues. He assured farmers that a ‘One-Time Settlement (OTS)’ scheme will be introduced to ensure that they don’t have to pay interest or penalty on electricity dues. Lashing out at the previous governments, Adityanath said the sugar mills were shut down in the ‘Sugar Bowl’ of western UP. He listed the names of the new sugar mills that were started in Pipraich-Munderwa and enhancement of the capacity of the closed Ramala sugar mill. He announced that sugar mills would start in the western region from October 20 and in the central region from October 25. The CM said from 2007 to 2016, only Rs 95,000 crore were paid to sugarcane farmers. He claimed that over 45.74 lakh sugarcane farmers in UP have been paid a record cane price payment of more than Rs 1.4 lakh crore between 2017 and 2021. “While 6 lakh metric tonnes of wheat was procured in 2016-17, this year a record 56 lakh metric tonnes of wheat was procured despite Corona,” he said. Centre hikes sugarcane FRP by 5 to 290 per quintalThe Centre on Wednesday approved in the new Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane for the next sugar season starting October 2021, at Rs 290 per quintal, an increase of Rs 5 over the last year. Briefing the media after the Cabinet meeting, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal said the decision will benefit five crore sugarcane farmers as well as five lakh workers employed in sugar mills across the country. The Centre announces the FRP, the minimum price that mills have to pay to cane growers, every year before start of the sugarcane crushing season. In order to ensure that higher sugar recoveries are adequately rewarded and considering variations amongst sugar mills, the FRP is linked to a basic recovery rate of sugar, with a premium payable to farmers for higher recoveries of sugar from sugarcane. Goyal said the increased FRP for sugarcane will be based on 10% recovery. If recovery is less than 9.5%, farmers will get Rs 275 per quintal.

---||Nagpur||RSS, Left unions miffed over Rajnath say on corporate OF||Nagpur: Defence minster Rajnath Singh’s statement at Nagpur that he was thankful to employees of ordnance factories for having amicably agreed to government’s move on corporatization has left leaders of both Left-leaning and RSS-backed unions miffed. Sources in the two unions said Singh’s statement was perhaps directed towards support that came from most unexpected side. Congress-backed Indian Defence Workers Federation (INDWF), which had opposed the move earlier, has changed its mind and agreed to corporatization last month. At a function to hand over grenades made by Nagpur’s Economic Explosives Limited (EEL), Singh had said there were apprehensions that workers may go on strike against corporatization, but they rather peacefully agreed. General secretaries of the leftist All India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF) and RSS’s Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS) said the unions were forced to not go on strike due to a last-minute ordinance issued by the government. As talks between the government and unions failed mid-June, the latter had planned to go on an indefinite strike. However, in a fortnight, the government came up with Essential Defence Services Ordinance (EDSO), which has now become an Act. The Act makes strike by employees in any defence establishment, including ordnance factories, illegal. Reacting to Singh’s statement, the leaders of AIDEF and BPMS said it’s only because of the ESDO the employees have not gone on strike. Corporatization will convert the OFB into a PSU. Unions are apprehensive that it may ultimately lead to privatization. Earlier, all the three unions — AIDEF, INDWF and BPMS had threatened to go on strike. After talks with the defence minister on July 16, INDWF submitted its acceptance to corporatization, saying the government has assured to protect the interest of workers. INDWF is the second largest union in ordnance factories. However, if AIDEF and BPMS cadres are combined together, INDWF number will fall short, said union sources. The other two unions have condemned the stance by INDWF. A letter issued by AIDEF and BPMS said the INDWF president and defence minister had met alone and the decision to back corporatization is anti-labour. INDWF general secretary R Srinivasan could not be contacted for a comment. C Srikumar of AIDEF said, “Such a statement should not have come from a seasoned politician like the defence minister. The unions continue to oppose corporatization. A daylong protest has been again organized on August 27.” Mukesh Singh, general secretary of BPMS, said the strike is not happening only because it has been termed illegal now. Being government employees, they will have to abide by the law. Singh said it’s only the Congress-backed union that is supporting corporatization and not the rest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rss-left-unions-miffed-over-rajnath-say-on-corporate-of/articleshow/85639853.cms||Shishir Arya

Safety in public areas such as hospitals, hazardous industries, educational institutions and marketplaces is important. Major General MK Bindal, executive director, National Institute of Disaster Management said fire accidents only result in loss of lives, injuries and property. “Due to its peculiar nature, fire in houses and buildings have become complex and salvaging operations have become more difficult and awareness for fire safety has become the need of the day” he said. He also said that most of the incidents that take place are due to three major reasons which are shock circuit, gas cylinder burst and human negligence. Dr DK Shami, fire advisor and director, talked about fire and life safety of health care facilities and how things go wrong because the fire alarm system is found off. He also talked about the various hazards due to medical gas and vacuum systems. Another presentation on safety rule measures in various activities were conducted by Ashok Menon, directorate of fire and emergency services in which he talked about fire and life safety components, extinguishment, emergency response, detection of alarm, compartmentation and escape.

---||Nagpur||Captured problem leopards from Chandrapur dumped in Gadchiroli?||Nagpur: The decision to capture an animal should be the last option, and animals trapped after deliberate attacks on humans should never be released back into the wild, says the MOEFCC guidelines for human-leopard conflict management. However, defying these norms, four leopards, three of them problem animals, were released into the wild by Chandrapur officials recently. Also, some were released far away from their home range, violating another MOEFCC guideline. Of these four leopards, two were from Saoli, one from Halda in Brahmapuri and one from a forest area near a village close to CSTPS. While three leopards were released in late-night operations immediately after capture in July and August, the CSTPS leopard was released three months ago. According to sources from the field, these animals were released in Chaprala wildlife sanctuary and Sironcha division of Gadchiroli circle. Earlier too, such leopards were clandestinely released in Gadchiroli forest areas. However, Chandrapur CCF NR Pravin said, “We released one leopard in Kanhargaon Wildlife Sanctuary while others were released in Chandrapur district, where there was no human habitation in close vicinity.” “On July 27, a female leopard was trapped in a cage at Saoli forest range. As a male was involved in attacks, the female was released in Gadchiroli,” said sources. However, the guidelines say, “If the captured leopard is to be released, it should be within the animal’s home range. Leopards are highly adaptable animals and exhibit amazing homing instincts.” On August 3, a male leopard was trapped at Saoli. It was involved in killing a woman on July 13, while she was sleeping in the front yard of her house. On July 14, a leopard mauled a farmer from Samda while he was working on his farm. Another woman was mauled while she was sleeping inside her house in Wagholi Buti on July 20. Vyahad, Samda, Wagholi Buti, Konapur, Kapsi villages were reeling under leopard threat. Despite the trapped animal being a problem leopard, it was also released in the wild in Gadchiroli. The guidelines state that animals trapped after attacks on humans should never be released back into the wild. “A translocated leopard trying to navigate to its home territory through dense human landscape may lead to increased incidence of conflicts rather than reducing the same. By translocating problem leopards, forest officials have shifted the conflict to other areas,” say experts. PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye said, “If it is a rescue operation, it is fine to go ahead, but if a problem leopard needs to be captured or released back in the wild my permission is mandatory. I will have to check whether permissions were granted.” Gadchiroli CF Kishore Mankar said, “I have no idea or information about leopards being released in Gadchiroli.” Similar was the reply from Sironcha DyCF Sumeet Kumar. CCF Pravin said, “Of the three leopards released recently, two had permission from the PCCF (wildlife). We released one as it was caught accidentally. All attacks in which the male leopard was involved were accidental cases and it was not a man-eater. We did not release any leopard in Chaprala, as the last time we released an animal it created problems. We released them in low-density areas.” Pravin added, “We are facing a problem of plenty as there is no space to accommodate these leopards. Gorewada Rescue Centre is overflowing, besides rescue centre in Chandrapur lacks space. We cannot keep such animals for long in captivity to avoid human imprint on them.” MOEFCC GUIDELINES * No animal captured after deliberate attack on human should be released into the wild * Such animals should be monitored by marking them with microchips and ear tags or colour coded collars before release * Radio-collars should be put on a sub-set of released animals to monitor post-release movements and survival * If captured leopards are to be released, they should be released within their home range * Best to avoid translocation, as translocated leopards can traverse back a distance of 400km to return to their home territory||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/captured-problem-leopards-from-chandrapur-dumped-in-gadchiroli/articleshow/85640084.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Police said that Raj Mohammed alias Pappu Sheikh and his wife Nimisha alias Anisha Sheikh had hired cars from 17 people living in different areas of Vadodara on a monthly rent of Rs 20,000 to Rs 26,000. The duo had told the car owners that they have contacts in different companies in Vadodara and they can sub-let the cars. Since many of the car owners were using their vehicles as school vans, they decided to give their vehicles on rent. Despite legal agreements made between the car owners and the couple, the couple did not pay them the rent. When the car owners asked the two accused to return their cars, they said that they had sold them off. Shocked by the duo’s action, the car owners approached police and an offence of cheating was registered at Gorwa police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/couple-booked-for-selling-rented-cars/articleshow/85633975.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: One four-lane section of new Zuari bridge to finally meet December deadline||PANAJI: A four-lane section of the new Zuari bridge is finally set to meet its latest completion target of December this year despite the project facing a series of hurdles, including pandemic-induced restrictions. The entire project will be completed by mid-2022, Atul Joshi, vicepresident (constructions) for the contractor, Dilip Buildcon, told TOI. Sources said the government plans to inaugurate the four-lane section on December 19 to mark the 60th year of Goa’s Liberation. It is expected to be thrown open to use by traffic soon after. “The pandemic had affected work briefly, but construction of the bridge has now picked up pace. There is good progress on work on the approach roads, too. One section will be ready by December this year, as per the target,” Joshi said. The bridge project will serve as an expressway between Panaji and Margao, over the Zuari river. While the bridge is 640m in length, the approach roads stretch from near the Bambolim cross in North Goa to near the Verna industrial estate in South Goa, covering over 13km. “The other four-lane section of the project will be ready within six months of the first section being completed,” said Joshi. By mid-2022 the entire project including the bridge and approach roads will be complete, except the towers planned atop the bridge as an international tourist attraction. Work on the towers is yet to be tendered. Opening of the four-lane section for use will finally mean putting an end to the inconveniences commuters have been enduring due to the massive bridge project work being in progress since late 2016. Sources said that while the new Zuari bridge project plans included toll booths, any plans to make the them operational are on hold for now. The government is also yet to announce whether the bridge will be open to both twowheelers and four-wheelers for use. Sources said, unlike in the case of the Atal Setu over the Mandovi river where only four-wheelers are permitted to ply, the Zuari bridge is expected to be open to all traffic, being a crucial link between North and South Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/one-four-lane-section-of-new-zuari-bridge-to-finally-meet-dec-deadline/articleshow/85637937.cms||---
---||Nagpur||SEC starts process for civic polls; all parties welcome single-member ward system||Nagpur: The State Election Commission (SEC) on Wednesday directed 18 municipal corporations, including four in Vidarbha — Nagpur, Amravati, Chandrapur and Akola, to prepare draft of ward delimitation for municipal elections in 2022. The delimitation of wards will be done as per one corporator in one ward, and not four corporators in one ward, which has been in existence since 2017. After a gap of 15 years, NMC will again witness single-member ward system. All political parties have welcomed the system and also claimed advantage for their parties. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “NMC received directives from SEC. Accordingly, we will start the process from August 27. A committee will be formed for the process.” Six-term corporator Sunil Agrawal said, “Delimitation will be as per population census of 2011, since new census was due in 2021 and could not happen due to Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, population of 24.47 lakh will be considered, and not the current population. Also, 50% seats will be reserved for women. There will be 151 wards, with 30 reserved for Scheduled Caste and 12 for Schedules Tribe. Of remaining 109 wards, 54 will be for women and 55 will be open,” he said. The SEC did not mention reason behind switching over to single-member ward system from existing four-member. West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre, who is also Congress city president, said, “It is a good decision by our MVA government to benefit common man. When it came up for discussion in the state legislature, there was difference of opinion among MLAs. I spoke in favour of single-member ward system. I have contested in all systems, right from one to two to three and four members, and single-member ward system is the best. Congress will emerge victorious.” MLC and BJP city president Pravin Datke said, “It makes no difference for BJP whether it is one, two, three or four-member ward system. We have won in all systems. The government, which fears loss, has done the revision. Under the leadership of Union minister Nitin Gadkari and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, we have done a commendable job and will take our work to each and every citizen of the city. We will win in NMC again.” NCP city president Duneshwar Pethe said, “People will benefit as they were forced to run from one corporator to other in existing system. In single-member ward system, corporator will be responsible for entire ward, so he cannot give excuses. Also, true activists in contact with people and working in their areas will get elected in this system. It will end the system of one powerful politician helping other three to win.” Pethe also said the strength of his party will grown in the house. Shiv Sena corporator Kishor Kumeriya also said single-member ward system will benefit the people and also his party. “I worked in all systems and true development is possible only in single-member ward system. Area is also smaller, and corporator can directly hear and solve problems of all people,” he said. BSP group leader in NMC Jitendra Godeshwar said, “BSP will have advantage compared to other parties in single-member ward system. People faced serious inconvenience due to BJP making it four-member ward system. Now, people will become powerful and corporators will have to work for them.” Going by the schedule, code of conduct is likely to come into effect in January followed by polling in February. Election of mayor has to be done on or before March 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sec-starts-process-for-civic-polls-all-parties-welcome-single-member-ward-system/articleshow/85640165.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
