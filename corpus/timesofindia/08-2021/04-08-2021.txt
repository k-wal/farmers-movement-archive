As per records placed before division bench of chief justice Sanjay Karol and justice S Kumar by the state government on Tuesday, 2.52 acres of land bearing thana number 21, khata number 231, plot number one of mauja Dhawalpura was mentioned as “gair majarua aam nali” in cadastral survey of 1905. However, around 15 bigha of this plot was shown in the name of two people – Basudev Sahay Verma and Ranjit Kumar Sinha – in municipal survey number 1480 and their names were also entered in register-II with mutation. It also came to light that a title suit for part of 15-bigha plot was filed before court of sub judge-I in Patna City in 1999 without even making the state government a party in it. Following it, a compromise decree establishing private ownership on government land was given by court of sub-judge-III in favour of Basudev’s son Bipin Bihari Verma on September 14, 2000. The suit was filed against Umesh Prasad who later filed a compromise petition. A case had been filed by Patna sadar circle officer on February 17 this year for cancelling the mutation of government land done in favour of Basudev and Ranjit which is pending before an additional collector, Patna. The PIL was filed on January 25. Looking at the seriousness of the matter, state’s additional advocate general Anjani Kumar submitted that a supplementary affidavit would be required to be submitted in the matter to apprise about positive developments made by the additional collector so that the entire government land be made encroachment free and action be taken against erring people. Bipin has filed an intervention petition in the PIL claiming his ownership of the land on the basis of court decree and other documents, but AAG Kumar cited Supreme Court rulings before the bench to oppose it. AAG Kumar submitted that the compromise decree has been obtained by playing fraud with court which can be set aside in a collateral proceeding. The petitioner, represented by counsel Sumeet Kumar Singh, had urged the high court that authorities concerned be directed to protect and preserve Jalla Hanuman Mandir in Patna City. He has also pleaded that authorities be directed to remove all encroachments from pond outside the temple and surrounding areas besides installing CCTV cameras and street lights there. It was in backdrop of this PIL that a counter affidavit was filed by Patna sadar CO Jitendra Pandey which brought the forgery before the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/15-bigha-govt-land-grabbed-by-2-hc-told/articleshow/85016511.cms||Debashish Karmakar

But a dozen districts including Chennai, Cuddalore and Erode reported an increase in new cases. There are 20,217 people still under treatment for the viral infection. The cumulative case tally touched 25.65 lakh and the death toll reached 34,159, including 29 deaths on Tuesday. Coimbatore had the highest number of fresh cases at 208, which was marginally lower than the 219 on Monday. Chennai had the second most cases at 203, an increase from 189 on Monday. Amidst the rising R-naught – the number of people a person can infect – public health officials said they did expect the fall to slow down with fluctuations. “But this is the time we monitor things closely,” said state health secretary J Radhakrishnan. Districts with lower seroprevalence, such as Erode and Coimbatore, have been instructed to focus on increasing vaccination coverage. In districts with higher prevalence such as Chennai and Virudhunagar, health officials have been told to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour. “People should not be casual. We don’t know the link between seroprevalence and newly emerging variants. We must ensure people are tested, traced and treat early even as we continue the whole genomic sequencing on a regular basis,” the health secretary said. Barring Coimbatore and Chennai, all other districts reported fewer than 200 cases. Erode recorded 181 followed by Chengalpet (122) and Thanjavur (118). All other districts reported less than 100 cases each. While three districts – Tenkasi (9), Ramanathapuram (8) and Perambalur (7) – reported cases in single digits on Monday, only Ramanathapuram did so on Tuesday. Samples were drawn from 1.4 lakh people on Monday when 2,047 people were discharged from the registry. While active cases decreased across the state, Coimbatore reported an increase to 2,043 compared to 2,008 on Monday and 1,961 on Sunday. Active cases also increased in Chennai to 1,802 from 1,735 on Monday and 1,675 on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/chennai-among-12-districts-reporting-spike-in-new-cases/articleshow/85026874.cms||---

A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka asked the authorities to continue their ongoing action vis-a-vis removal of unauthorised dangling cables across the city. Petitioner NP Amrutesh, an advocate, submitted an interlocutory application (IA) for impleading the Cable TV Operators’ Association and various telecom/internet service providers. The court directed him to file amended copies of the petition in two weeks, while ordering notice to the newly added parties. The petitioner pointed out that 507 deaths have been reported due to dangling cables and electrical shocks during 2015-19 as per media reports. A survey conducted by BBMP and Bescom showed more than 7,000 buildings have been constructed right below high-tension power, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/alert-service-providers-remove-cables-bbmp-told/articleshow/85017880.cms||---

To serve the ends of justice, the HC had initially, in its order on May 5, 2020 following a PIL in the light of the extraordinary circumstances owing to the pandemic, had extended the interim orders till June 11, 2020. Later, the interim orders were extended from time to time, postponing the enforcement of orders and statutory proceedings in the light of the emergent circumstances under which it was not feasible to access the courts and tribunals easily for relief. But on February 15, 2021, the high court disposed of the PIL and lifted the orders extending the interim orders taking into consideration the marked decline in the number of instances of persons affected by the pandemic and resumption of normal activities in the previous two months. However, on April 29, the high court registered a case taking suo motu cognizance of the situation in the wake of the second wave of Covid-19 and restored extension of all interim orders on bail, anticipatory bail, interim bail, parole and evictions in view of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic in the state. The extension was effective till August 2. While vacating all its orders on Monday, the two-judge bench of Chief Justice S Muralidhar and Justice B P Routray said, “The interim orders passed earlier ‘shall not continue hereafter’ as the state government had in its July 31 notification lifted the restrictions on movement of persons and public transport in the entire state, while placing some restrictions as regards the cities of Cuttack, Bhubaneswar and Puri.” Besides, the hybrid hearings have been resumed in the high court and in the district courts, the Bench said in the order, a copy of which was released on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/with-most-curbs-lifted-hc-vacates-interim-orders/articleshow/85018164.cms||lalmohan.patnaik

The Bhartruhatri Mahtab-led committee, in its report tabled in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, said it was not convinced by the government’s “alibi” that the health ministry does not maintain the classification or categorisation of workers who succumbed to Covid. “It is equally deplorable to observe the ministry’s inability to furnish information regarding the deployment of the dependant family members of those workers who lost their lives due to the pandemic. What is more worrisome is the statement of the ministry that there is no such guideline or any scheme that anybody is bound to provide any employment to the wards of any person who died due to Covid,” the committee said in its report submitted to the House. The House panel was reporting the impact of Covid-19 on the working class and said the labour ministry should “initiate urgent efforts” to collate such technology-driven data so as to prudently facilitate and extend timely post-death benefits to the dependant and needy family members of the deceased workers. The panel urged the ministry to be prepared to handle exigencies like the migrant workers’ exodus during the pandemic, rather than waiting for the judiciary to intervene. The panel said 1.14 crore migrant workers returned to their native places during the pandemic in the first wave, while 5.15 lakh migrant workers returned to their home states in the second. “When the entire nation was witnessing a heart-rending sight of lakhs of migrant workers walking back to their native places helplessly without anything to fall back on, the committee finds it surprising that the ministry waited for as long as two months i.e. until June 2020 to write to the state governments and that too after goaded by the Supreme Court, to collect the much needed detailed data of the migrant workers,” the report said, adding that it spoke “volumes of the inaction/delayed action on the part of the ministry at that specific point of the crisis, notwithstanding a number of appreciable and pro-active measures undertaken by the central and state governments subsequently to provide food, shelter, transport and health facilities to the migrant workers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/house-panel-pulls-up-labour-ministry-for-lack-of-statewise-data-on-covid-deaths-of-workers/articleshow/85018101.cms||Swati Mathur

Late Monday afternoon, the duo were seen at Mangal Market near the railway station where some Army personnel were already sitting. Seeing the two in uniform, the Armymen got suspicious and sought their credentials. Sensing trouble, the duo pushed the Army personnel and managed to flee from the spot. A subsequent search in the area wasn’t fruitful, police said. Early Tuesday, a massive search operation was launched by a joint team of police, SOG, Army, BSF, CRPF and other agencies in villages of Bari Brahmana area in Samba district to locate the suspects. SSP Samba said the operation was carried out in the dense forests of Purmandal, Smailpur and parts of Bari Brahmana. “Nothing suspicious was found after more than six hours of search but security agencies are keeping an alert,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/suspects-in-combat-dress-search-yields-no-result/articleshow/85018286.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Later in the day, a policeman and a civilian were injured when terrorists opened fire at a police party in Srinagar’s Sheeraz Khanyar area. Both were shifted to a hospital, said a senior police officer. The encounter came three days after two Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists, including Lamboo — a Pakistani commander of the outfit and a key conspirator in the 2019 fidayeen attack in Pulwama’s Lethpora that left 40 CRPF troopers dead — were slain in an anti-terror operation in Pulwama’s Dachigam area. Based on intelligence inputs about a terrorist hideout in Bandipora’s Chandaji area, a joint team of the Army’s 26 Assam Rifles, CRPF and J&K Police launched a cordon-and-search operation there early Tuesday. On seeing the security forces approach, the holed-in terrorist opened fire, triggering an encounter, IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said. “A foreign LeT terrorist, Babar Ali — who had managed to escape from the Shokbaba operation on July 24 in which three terrorists were slain — was shot dead in the encounter in Chandaji forest,” the IGP confirmed. Ali was a native of Ugada district in Pakistan’s Punjab province, police said. Arms and ammunition, including an AK rifle, two AK magazines, 40 AK rounds; and one pouch, medicine bag and wireless set each were recovered from the spot of the gunfight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lashkar-terrorist-from-pakistan-killed-in-jk-encounter/articleshow/85018388.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The pilot and the co-pilot, Lt-Colonel Abheet Singh Batth and Captain Jayant Joshi, are feared to have died in the crash. An Army public relations officer (PRO) said that the `Rudra’ chopper, an armed version of the indigenous advanced light helicopter, was from the 254 Army Aviation squadron and had taken off from Mamun cantonment. The chopper developed some snag about 10 minutes after getting airborne and crashed into the centre of the reservoir. Deepwater divers were called to search the reservoir for the missing pilot and co-pilot, while boats of Ranjit Sagar Dam and the tourism department of Kathua district in Jammu and Kashmir Union Territory (JKUT) were pressed into service to recover the wreckage, SSP Kathua R C Kotwal told TOI. “The chopper crashed into the centre — the deep waters — of the reservoir,” he said. As night fell, the search was temporarily suspended. It would resume at daybreak on Wednesday, the SSP added. According to locals, the helicopter plunged into the reservoir around 10.45am near Purthu village — popularly known as “mini Goa” — in Kathua district and Uchha Thara near Pathankot district’s Dhar tehsil. As news of the crash spread, the civil and police administrative officials of Pathankot district in Punjab and Kathua district of JKUT reached the spot to begin rescue operations. SSP Pathankot Surinder Lamba said there was no trace of the pilots so far. In a video, believed to be recorded by some locals moments before the crash, the helicopter can be seen flying at a low altitude and fully manoeuvrable, but it suddenly disappears. An eyewitness, Avtar Singh, a resident of Uchha Thara, said he was at home when he saw a low-flying helicopter making a turn and then suddenly disappearing in the lake. Kuldeep Singh, a resident of Purtho, said he was tilling his fields when he saw the helicopter appearing from the direction of the dam and turning towards Uchha Thara village of Punjab and then suddenly falling into the centre of the lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-chopper-crashes-into-ranjit-sagar-dam-reservoir/articleshow/85018481.cms||---

An IIT-M study shows passengers at bus stops at busy intersections are exposed to high levels of PM2.5 and noise pollution due to vehicles emitting smoke and drivers honking frequently. The study measured an average concentration of PM2.5 in six bus stops at 46.3microgram/m3, with those waiting for a minimum of 15 minutes in a bus stop may be exposed to 7.6micrograms. Similarly, they were exposed to an average noise level of 76.8 dBA (decibels), which exceeded 95 dBA frequently due to constant honking. Srinath Mahesh, of IIT-M’s department of civil engineering and corresponding author of the study, said in his paper that emissions from diesel powered cars, buses and trucks with internal combustion engines could be a source of high PM2.5 levels at bus stops. The high noise levels were due to habitual honking, particularly at intersections when traffic light turns from red to green. “In our study, emissions from buses may be considerably high because most MTC buses are very old and often emit a substantial amount of visible smoke from the tailpipe. Idling of buses at stops for boarding and alighting of passengers adds to PM2.5 concentrations. These emitted particles are pushed towards the bus stop by the turbulence caused by vehicles moving at high speed,” he said. Exposure to particulate matter is known to cause cardiovascular ailments, lung cancer and premature death. “Commuters are also continuously exposed to noise levels exceeding CPCB guidelines,” the author added. The study was done at bus stops at Kotturpuram, CLRI, Madhya Kailash, Gurunanak College and Taramani, and Vana Vani on the IIT-M campus using low-cost portable optical sensors and smartphone application. In January, the highest concentration of 68.7micrograms/m3 was recorded at Gurunanak College stop, the lowest of 21.1microgram/m3 was at CLRI. In October, highest of 70.4micrgram/m3 was recorded at Taramani and lowest of 14.5microgram/m3 at Gurunanak College. The concentration varied during the two periods possibly due to meteorological parameters like the wind speed, which if low could lead to accumulation of pollutants in the air. The permissible limit of PM2.5 in the air is 60microgram/m3 for 24 hours and 40micrograms/m3 annually. The median noise level at all the bus stops except Vana Vani was around 85 dBA (decibel), 30 dBA greater than the permissible limits. In addition, the maximum noise levels at all the bus stops except Vana Vani exceeded 100 dBA. Proper planning of location and design of bus stops could cut down exposure to pollution, say experts. “Buses have to arrive on time and not make people wait for long. Second, if bus stations are wide and away from the main road, exposure to pollutants will be limited,” said Prof S M Shiva Nagendra, department of civil engineering, IIT-M.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/people-waiting-at-bus-stops-exposed-to-pollution/articleshow/85018497.cms||U Tejonmayam
---||India||Karnataka: Over 20 new ministers to be inducted in Bommai cabinet on August 4||BENGALURU: After days of parleys in New Delhi, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai is all set to induct 22-24 new ministers into his cabinet on Wednesday. Chief secretary P Ravi Kumar said that the new cabinet ministers would be sworn-in at Raj Bhavan at 2.15pm on Wednesday, even as the CM maintained confidentiality of the list of ministers. The chief minister is likely to announce the list on Wednesday morning when he comes back to Bengaluru from Delhi, in order to avoid any last-minute rebellion among the aspirants. Bommai took oath as the chief minister on July 28 after the resignation of BS Yediyurappa on July 26. Since then he has spent more time in Delhi than Karnataka. On Monday night, Bommai had a detailed discussion with BJP president JP Nadda for close to an hour. After the meeting, Bommai said he had submitted two-three draft lists and that the party chief would finalise the new ministers on Tuesday evening. Bommai was expecting to get the final list and return to Bengaluru by a 7.50pm flight, which was rescheduled to 9.30pm. However, things took a different turn on Tuesday evening with the chief minister getting a nod to his list pretty late after meeting Nadda thrice. And, Bommai was forced to cancel his flight. Sources said Bommai would come to Bengaluru early on Wednesday morning when he would also ask the new inductees to arrive in the state capital for the oath taking ceremony. Cabinet expansion hanging fire amid third-wave threatThe expansion of the Karnataka cabinet that witnessed a massive political turmoil a month ago has been hanging fire, even as a threat of the third Covid-19 wave looms large and several districts reel under flood-like situation. Sources said the BJP is finding it tough to maintain a balance between the new entrants to the party and its old leaders who are ministerial-berth aspirants. It is expected that the number of slots available to the BJP old guard will be curtailed significantly due to the inclusion of 8-10 migrant MLAs in the cabinet. However, not more than 30 ministers are expected to be inducted at present in the cabinet, even as the maximum limit is 34. Meanwhile, the opposition raised questions on CM Bommai’s two trips in as many days to Delhi. “When the BJP and the new CM are claiming everything is fine, why is he making so many frequent trips to Delhi? This, at a time when the state is facing the Covid-19 crisis and floods in north Karnataka, along with rising unemployment,” said state Congress working president Eshwar Khandre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/karnataka-over-20-new-ministers-to-be-inducted-in-bommai-cabinet-on-august-4/articleshow/85018135.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

Meat and poultry giant Tyson Foods said it will require all of its approximately 120,000 U.S. employees to get the shot over the next three months, becoming one of the first major employers of front-line workers to do so. And an estimated 150,000 unionized workers at the big three US automakers will have to go back to wearing masks starting Wednesday.  "The goal here is to convince everyone that this is the time. If we're going to stop the delta variant, the time is now. And that means getting vaccinated right now," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said in announcing the aggressive new measures that will go into effect in mid-August.  Vaccination cards will be accepted as proof of inoculation, along with state and city apps.  Covid-19 cases across the US have increased sixfold over the past month to an average of more than 85,000 per day, a level not seen since mid-February. Deaths have climbed over the past two weeks from an average of 254 per day to 386.  Florida has more people now in the hospital with Covid-19 than at any other time during the outbreak - over 11,500. Louisiana reported an all-time high of more than 2,100 hospital patients with the virus, most of them unvaccinated. Both states' vaccination rates are below the national average.  "They're just coming in faster than we discharge them. It's definitely people in their 40s and 50s right now," said Justin Senior, CEO of Florida Safety Net Hospital Alliance, which represents some of the largest hospitals in the state caring for poor people.  The crisis has become a race between the delta variant and the vaccine. Experts say the vaccine is still highly effective at preventing serious illness and death from the more contagious mutant version.  Amid the growing alarm over the way the virus is storming back, vaccinations across the country have begun to tick up slightly in recent weeks, reaching more than a half-million per day on average, but are still far below the peak of 3.4 million per day in April.  Seventy percent of the nation's adults have received at least one shot, and nearly 61% are fully vaccinated - well short of where President Joe Biden wanted the U.S. to be by this point.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running for reelection next year while eyeing a 2024 presidential bid, doubled down Tuesday as the state again broke its record for COVID-19 hospitalizations, insisting that the spike will ease soon and that he will not impose any business restrictions or mask mandates. He encouraged people to get vaccinated.  "We are not shutting down," DeSantis said. "We are going to have schools open. We are protecting every Floridian's job in this state. We are protecting people's small businesses."  The auto industry's decision to mask up again was made by representatives from General Motors, Ford, the parent company of Chrysler, and the United Auto Workers union, and it applies even to employees who have been vaccinated. The move comes just under a month after vaccinated autoworkers were allowed to shed their masks.  As for Tyson, Donnie King, CEO of the Springdale, Arkansas, company, said in a memo to employees that the vaccine requirement is needed to overcome persistent hesitancy to get the shots.  "We did not take this decision lightly. We have spent months encouraging our team members to get vaccinated - today, under half of our team members are," King wrote.  In New York, Sean Ogs, manager of the Woodside Cafe in Queens, said he was "floored" when he heard the news about mandatory vaccinations for customers.  "We've already been in a struggle. I don't know how I'm going to deal with it," Ogs said. "It's going to be extra work. It'll make things impossible."  Debbie McCarthy, a regular at the Woodside Cafe who is unvaccinated, said she was turned away over the weekend from several establishments that had already begun requiring proof.  "I'm a little shocked they would do that," said McCarthy, who said she recovered from COVID-19 months ago and believes her antibodies will protect her from another infection. "Why are they so afraid of people who haven't been vaccinated? I think we should have a choice."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nyc-big-employers-taking-hard-line-against-vaccine-holdouts/articleshow/85018531.cms||---
---||Chennai||Dredged sea sand dumped into TN's Kosasthalaiyar river has toxic metals||CHENNAI: A report released by the Save Ennore Creek campaign on Tuesday said dredged sea sand dumped into Kosasthalaiyar river’s backwaters in Ennore allegedly by Tangecdo has high levels of toxic metals like Arsenic, cadmium, copper and chromium. Sand samples were taken in July and tested by the Healthy Energy India Initiative, a public health collective which documents pollution in Chennai, at the Chester Labnet in Oregon, US. This is a serious environmental issue which affects the livelihood of local fishermen, the collective said. “The level of metals in the sea sand is higher than what it should be and is an indication of historical pollution in the estuary and river due to fly ash and coal handling,” said Pooja Kumar, part of the campaign. A spokesperson for Tangedco said that the electricity minister Senthil Balaji had inspected the spot last week and that there were no deviations noted. The report stated that arsenic levels were at 14.96 milligm per kg, which is more than two times the Interim Sediment Quality Guideline (ISQG) for aquatic life. Cadmium concentration was 15.23 mg/kg which is 20 times ISQG, copper at 23.54 mg/kg which is 1.25 times ISQG and chromium at 106.1 mg/kg which is twice the safe levels of ISQG. ISQG is a Canadian government standard which recommend concentration levels of chemicals to support and maintain aquatic life. The campaign’s contention is that a January 2020 report submitted to the National Green Tribunal by a joint committee had found high concentrations of these same metals in the sea sand dumped in the Ennore creek by the Kamarajar Port. “The levels of metals found in the latest samples are higher than the high concentrations reported by the joint committee,” the report stated. Another issue also pertains to the livelihood of the fishermen. “Fish is an inexpensive source of protein for the poor. Dumping contaminated sand in this section ofthe river is like poisoning their food. This is the place where we catch the fish that we sell in the market,” said RL Srinivasan, a fisherman from Kattukuppam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dredged-sea-sand-dumped-into-kosasthalaiyar-has-toxic-metals/articleshow/85018547.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

The issue pertains to a defamation complaint moved by former official spokesperson of AIDAMK Va Pugazhendi against the two leaders in their capacity as the joint coordinator and coordinator of the party. When the plea came up for hearing on Tuesday, special judge N Alicia issued summons to the duo for their appearance on August 24. According to the complainant, on June 14, Palaniswami and Panneerselvam announced that Pugazhendhi had been expelled from the post of official spokesperson of the party in view of his anti-party activities. The communication also informed that he was removed from the primary membership of the party, he said. Alleging that the expulsion letter levelled vague and baseless allegations against him, he submitted that he had not committed any misconduct, which had caused disrepute and defame to the party in any manner and never acted in contravention of any rule and regulations of the party. “Adding insult to the injury, and as a rude shock, in the expulsion letter, the accused have mandated that none of the AIADMK cadres should be in touch with or should have any contact with the complainant in any manner,” he said. However, the communication failed to state how the complainant acted against the party and what are the instances or actions warranting the extreme step of expulsion, he added. Claiming that he was loyal to the party for over 30 years, the complainant argued that he had suffered a great assault to his reputation in the society due to the unwarranted expulsion. Therefore, he wanted the court to punish the duo for criminal defamation under Sections 499 and 500 of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/eps-ops-summoned-by-court-as-expelled-leader-files-complaint/articleshow/85018668.cms||---

Speaking to TOI over phone, Boro said, “The opposition is strong. Everyone is saying that. But isn’t our Lovlina strong? She has been able to create history in the ring and I am cent per cent sure she will do it.” Talking about Lovlina, who is the first person from Assam to reach the semi-final stage, Boro said, “It was 2013. I had gone to Golaghat to scout for talent under a project of SAI. She struck me as a promising boxer. That is what I am seeing in the Olympics.” Lovlina got a bye in the first round. She advanced to the quarterfinals in her debut Olympic appearance by defeating German veteran Nadine Apetz in a closely-fought last-16 bout on July 27 in the pre-quarters. Lovlina, who is a two-time World and Asian championships bronze medalist, defeated Chinese Taipei’s Nien-Chin Chen in the quarterfinals on July 30 and advanced to the semifinals. Meanwhile, SAI, Guwahati director Satish K. Sarhadi, said, “The fight in the ring on Wednesday will be tough. But, Lovlina is a dedicated and focused boxer. We are confident enough that she will show her skills inside the ring and go to the final.” Meanwhile, prayers were offered at her native village in Golaghat district in upper Assam as well as other parts of the state for Lovlina. Mass prayers by people of different religions were offered in lower Assam’s Kokrajhar while Muslims offered prayers at Athgaon mosque in Guwahati. Residents of Baro Mukhi, Lovlina’s native village, offered naam prasanga (a prayer in Vaishnavite culture in Assam) at the village naamghar (prayer house). Everyone wished Lovlina well for her bout so that she can strike gold at the world’s biggest sports extravaganza. “Lovlina is our pride. People are praying for her. I am sure the almighty will bless her and give strength to defeat the opponent in the semi-finals and script history,” a resident of Baro Mukhi village said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/tough-fight-but-lovlina-will-win-says-coach-padum-boro/articleshow/85018682.cms||Mukut Das

Cachar district authorities said there is no economic blockade on NH 306 as claimed by Mizoram. In fact, hundreds of truckers, who have parked their vehicles in Cachar district, are refusing to move forward into Mizoram for fear of being attacked. Many of them said when six policemen could be gunned down in broad daylight by police of another state, there was no guarantee to their lives and vehicles. Since the flare-up on the Assam-Mizoram border on July 26 in which six Assam Police personnel were gunned down and several others were injured by Mizoram Police, there has been no movement on NH 306, which is the lifeline of the hill state. The next day after the incident, locals of Cachar district spontaneously blocked the national highway as a mark of protest and prevented movement of traffic to Mizoram. But this blockade ended after 24 hours. But no one travelled on the highway to Mizoram as the situation on the border remained tense. On July 29, the Assam government issued advisories to the people of the state against travelling to the neighbouring state and asked those working in Mizoram to “exercise utmost caution.” Assam home and political commissioner and secretary MS Manivannan, in the travel advisory, stated that certain Mizo civil society, students and youth organisations are issuing provocative statements against Assam and its people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/mizoram-promises-safety-of-drivers-and-passengers/articleshow/85018684.cms||Prabin Kalita

Earlier on Sunday night, Joan was arrested while peddling drugs and taken to JC Nagar police station, where he later complained of chest pain. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he died of suspected cardiac arrest. Joan’s death triggered protests by several African nationals in front of JC Nagar police station, leading to ugly scenes of confrontation between police and the protesters. Police decided to carry out a postmortem only after the arrival of embassy officials and shifted the body to Bowring hospital. Embassy officials will have a look at the body before sending it for autopsy, said police. So far, five men have been arrested for alleged involvement in the violence that followed Joan’s death. Sleuths from Criminal Investigation Department (CID), probing the custodial death of Joan, visited JC Nagar police station on Tuesday. After collecting documents related to the case, they interacted with the staff and senior cops. Two FIRs against suspects:Two separate FIRs have been registered against the accused, who indulged in the violence reported outside JC Nagar police station. The first FIR was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by a woman sub-inspector of Subramanyanagar police station. She accused the protesters of attacking her during the stir. The second was filed by the parents of a minor boy, who sustained injuries when protesters while escaping police lathi-charge, pushed him to the ground. “We have everything recorded on camera as well as CCTV footage. Initially, we had allowed them to stage protest outside the station for over three hours. During the protest, they abused us using filthy words, made unparliamentary gestures towards women police staff and, finally, attacked us,” an investigating officer said. Three special teams have been formed to trace and nab the other fugitive suspects. Police are visiting Hennur, Ramamurthynagar, Banaswadi and RT Nagar where the fugitive suspects live.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/custodial-death-congo-embassy-officials-in-city/articleshow/85018859.cms||---

Herat, capital of the eponymous province, was the first city feared to fall to the Taliban as they had reached close to the government offices. The latest deployment of forces by Kabul helped the Afghan soldiers and private militia headed by former warlord Muhammad Ismail Khan to drive the militants out of key parts of the provincial capital. Until lately, the militants had engaged government troops in a street-to-street fight. Officials in Herat said that government forces had managed to push back Taliban fighters from several areas of the city, including near the airport, which is vital for resupply and aerial operations. "Afghan security forces plus resistance forces launched a big operation in the west of the city," said Jailani Farhad, spokesman for Herat’s governor. On Monday night, the residents of the city, sensing the Taliban retreat, marched on the streets of Herat chanting "Allahu Akbar (God is Great)". The locals had announced their support for the government forces and vowed to defend the province. They also celebrated the advances of the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces in their fight against the Taliban in the southern parts of Herat city. Monday was the sixth day of fighting in Herat. The move was welcomed by Afghans in other regions, who joined in by creating the hashtags "Herat uprising" and "Allahu Akbar" to register their support for the people of Herat. Wide support for Herati residents came from Kabul where residents took to social media and asked for a similar act in the capital city on Tuesday night. Welcoming the move, Afghan vice-president Amrullah Saleh said: "This was the day I was waiting for. I am thrilled by this act." Herat governor General Abdul Saboor Qani said on Tuesday the security forces in the province, with air support, have started a large-scale military offensive to clear the province of the Taliban. Ismail Khan, who is leading public uprising forces in the fight against the Taliban, asked Heratis to mobilise against the insurgents and assured them that the city will be defended. Reports from the region claim that clashes continued between security forces and the Taliban in Herat on Monday and Tuesday morning at a distance of at least 2 km from the city centre. In recent weeks, several provincial capitals have been encircled by the Taliban and heavy fighting has been going on for days now in the capitals of Helmand and Kandahar provinces in the south, as well as in the city of Herat. Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand, has been witnessing the heaviest fighting and Taliban fighters are said to be in the heart of the city. Media reports suggest that non-stop gunfire continues around the governor’s compound, police headquarters, prison, and main government buildings in the city centre. According to the Afghan health ministry, at least 38 people have died in the past three days and 156 others have been wounded in Lashkar Gah. Officials said the Taliban have seized nearly a dozen local radio and TV stations in the city, leaving only one pro-Taliban channel that broadcasts Islamic programming. "Fighting was intense this morning. We stopped broadcasting two days ago because the Taliban captured the building of our station," said Sefatullah, director of Sukon radio in Lashkar Gah. If Lashkar Gah falls, it would be a significant strategic and psychological blow for the government, which has pledged to defend cities at all costs after losing much of the countryside to the Taliban since Western forces announced a date for their final pullout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/taliban-retreat-follows-public-uprising-in-herat/articleshow/85018883.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Why is 2-wheeler parking allowed on footpaths: HC||BENGALURU: Observing that even police themselves are not complying with the judgment and order passed by the court vis-a-vis parking of vehicles on footpaths, the high court on Tuesday directed the Station House Officer of Jayanagar police station to submit an affidavit on why two-wheelers were allowed to be parked on pavements. A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka gave this direction after counsel for the petitioners submitted several recent photographs showing vehicles parked on footpaths near the station and at various other places. Taking the same on record, the bench directed traffic police and BBMP officials concerned to immediately visit the spot and take necessary action as well as submit a report (vis-a-vis other places) to the court by August 23. The PIL is filed by Letzkit Foundation, a Bengaluru-based NGO. The petitioner has claimed that Bengaluru footpaths have been encroached by police, BMRCL and Bescom. Meanwhile, BBMP submitted a memo showing newspaper advertisements intimating the general public about the April 21 order passed by the court in an earlier PIL, calling upon officials to ensure due compliance of the same. However, the bench pointed out that so far they have not come across an instance wherein criminal law has been set into motion. While disposing of a PIL on April 21, the court had directed the government and police department to take steps for effective implementation of various sections of Motor Vehicles Act governing those violations and set criminal law into motion immediately, with or without a complaint. BBMP was told to issue necessary directions to its officials on the issue. The bench had said that under Section 177 of MV Act, whoever contravenes any provisions of the Act can be fined Rs 500 for the first offence and punished under another penal provision in section 20, dealing with obstruction to free flow of traffic. It was also pointed out that violations pertaining to directions issued under MV Act and rules can be proceeded against under section 188 of IPC and indiscriminate parking on footpaths is a public nuisance within the meaning of sections 268 and 283 of IPC (danger or obstruction to public view).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/why-is-2-wheeler-parking-allowed-on-footpaths-hc/articleshow/85018888.cms||---

The score reflected a marked improvement over last year’s 98.23%. Of the 62,529 students who appeared for the exams, 62,503 cleared it, leaving only 26 students to take the retest. While Bengaluru region is second in the country behind Thiruvananthapuram which scored 99.99%, Karnataka ranked 12th among the states. The big states that have recorded better results are Tamil Nadu (100%), Andhra Pradesh (100%) and Telangana (99.99%). In Bengaluru region, which consists only of Karnataka, Kendriya Vidyalayas, Navodaya Vidyalayas and Tibetan schools improved their scores to get centum results. The independent schools improved their results from 98.06% to 99.95%. Last year, around 9.8% students had more than 90% marks and 2.2% had over 95% nationally. This year, 9.6% and 2.8% have secured marks in these brackets, respectively. The class 10 exams were cancelled owing to the pandemic. Instead, the scoring was done for 80 marks based on unit test (10 marks), mid-term exams (30 marks) and pre-board (40 marks).  Due to closure of schools, many of them conducted these assessments online. Students who are unhappy with the results can take exams that will be conducted between August 16 and September 15. The dates will be announced soon. A detailed process for dispute resolution will also be announced in case any candidate has an issue. ‘Students happy’Many students in the city scored centums in several subjects. Two students from Deens Academy — Aditi Ponnammal and Priyamvada Bangre Praveen — scored 99.8%, losing only one mark out of total 500. “Students are happy. There is a phenomenal number of centums in different subjects. Practically, 60% of the batch has secured above 90%,” said Shanthi Menon, principal, Deens Academy. Agreed Jyothi Menon, head of school, Ekya School ITPL: “There is a significant increase in the number of students who scored above 90%. Overall, the performance of all students has been good.” Nature of calculation made a difference, say someHowever, some other schools differed. “While the school average was 93% last year, it dropped to 87% this time. This is mostly because teachers have been strict in evaluating pre-board papers. However, many students have been able to achieve centum,” said M Srinivasan, founder, GEAR Innovative International. “While the overall results remained high this time — 498 of our 549 students achieved distinction — we see the scoring in basic maths hasn’t been as much because of the nature of the calculations. While the average is 87% in other subjects, it is 77% for basic maths,” said Manju Balasubramaniam, principal, DPS North. Many schools said students and teachers showed resilience despite the pandemic. “The year 2020-21 has been tough for the entire academic fraternity. From virtual classes to unique evaluation criteria, the teachers and the students went through many uncertain events. Despite all these challenges, the students showed immense resilience,” said Ashwani Kumar Saxena, principal of Global Indian International School (GIIS) Whitefield.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-is-12th-among-statesschools-see-centums-galore/articleshow/85018902.cms||---

The flower is considered a rare yield among aquatic farmers. Jyothi, a software professional in the US, returned to Bengaluru a few years ago and took to farming with special focus on aquatic gardening. She converted the terrace of her RR Nagar home into a garden with vegetables and flowers. Jyothi then began cultivating aquatic flowering plants at her farm in Kadujakkasandra village of Ramanagara district. All her efforts bore fruit on Tuesday. “In the morning, I noticed that a lotus tuber which was planted in May in a water pot bore an Ultimate Thousand Petal flower, well-known as UTP. It was a delightful sight,” a thrilled Jyothi said. Claiming it was the first such lotus to bloom in this region, Jyothi said it blossomed with over 1,000 petals and is considered quite an achievement in aquatic gardening circles. There have been stories of 1,000 petals blossoming in parts of Kerala and farmers flaunting the pink flower much to the awe of others. But not much was heard about the flower in Karnataka. “I firmly believe it’s the first in the region and a number of aquatic farmer groups which I’m part of have vouched for it,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/1000-petalled-lotus-blooms-in-blureans-farm/articleshow/85018968.cms||---

The company's total expenses during the quarter under review increased to Rs 3,464.88 crore, from Rs 1,805.24 crore a year ago. APSEZ said the company reported the highest year-on-year quarterly growth of 83 per cent against all India cargo growth of 33 per cent. Its consolidated revenue grew 99 per cent, from Rs 2,293 crore in the first quarter of 2020-21 to Rs 4,557 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal on account of an increase in cargo at port by 83 per cent, rail volume by 10 per cent, and terminal volume by 13 per cent in the logistics business, the company said. Port revenue increased 75 per cent to Rs 3,339 crore, while revenue from the logistics business stood at Rs 268 crore, a growth of 34 per cent. Total Ebitda grew 82 per cent to Rs 2,620 crore during the June 2021 quarter, against Rs 1,438 crore in the year-ago period. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Increased cargo volume, savings in operating cost and operational excellence enabled port's Ebitda to grow 78 per cent to Rs 2,356 crore during the quarter under review, from Rs 1,324 crore in the year-ago period. "Our strategy of establishing a network of world-class ports to balance cargo across the east and west coasts has been tracking precisely as per plan, thereby continuing to de-risk our growth as well as lay the foundation of a broader logistics platform. "This has resulted into APSEZ accelerating its market share gain," Karan Adani, chief executive officer and whole-time director of APSEZ, said in a statement. Adani further said that therefore, the company has raised its target cargo volumes to 350-360 MMT (million metric tonnes), which translates into a year-on-year growth of about 45 per cent. "APSEZ also became the first Indian infrastructure company to have raised a dual-tranche of 10.5-year and 20-year unsecured bonds," he said adding that the company's goal of becoming the first port firm to be carbon neutral by 2025 is very well on track. Its board has formed a committee of independent directors to evaluate an acquisition for consolidating Gangavaram Port Ltd (GPL) with APSEZ Group, including merger, post completion of 10.40 per cent stake sale by the Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) in GPL, the company said. In notes to April-June quarter earnings, APSEZ said the company acquired balance 25 per cent stake in Krishnapatnam port for Rs 2,800 crore, making it a 100 per cent subsidiary of APSEZ. It said that as a second international foray, it will develop a container terminal at Colombo Port with a capacity of 3.5 million twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEUs). "Construction is expected to start in December 2021." The firm also said the consideration for 58.1 per cent stake from DVS Raju and Family, agreed at Rs 120 per share, and process for acquisition of balance 10.4 per cent from GoAP are at an advance stage. In the statement, APSEZ also said that the merger scheme for consolidating rail track assets (by acquiring SRCPL and demerging Mundra rail assets) has been filed. According to the company, cargo volume increased due to growth in all types of cargo — dry bulk grew 104 per cent, container 69 per cent, and liquid cargo (including crude) 57 per cent. As part of its social outreach programme, APSEZ said it decided to vaccinate its employees in April 2021. The company, under the corporate quota, provided free vaccination to all its employees. Its 97 per cent employees are vaccinated, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/adani-ports-net-profit-jumps-77-to-rs-1342-crore-in-june-quarter/articleshow/85019298.cms||---
---||Business||RBI issues framework for outsourcing of activities by payment system operators||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank on Tuesday came out with a detailed framework for outsourcing of activities by Payment System Operators (PSOs) with a view to mitigate risks and ensure continuity of service. Under the framework, PSOs will not outsource core management functions, including risk management and internal audit; compliance and decision-making functions such as determining compliance with KYC norms. Also, a PSO will be required to carefully evaluate the need for outsourcing its critical processes and activities, as well as selection of service providers based on comprehensive risk assessment. The RBI has also clarified that outsourcing of any activity by the PSO will not reduce its obligations, and those of its board and senior management, who will ultimately be responsible for the outsourced activity. "The PSO shall, therefore, be liable for the actions of its service providers and shall retain ultimate control over the outsourced activity," the framework said. The outsourcing arrangements, it added, will not affect the rights of a customer of a payment system against the PSO, as well as those of a payment system participant against the PSO. The PSOs, by virtue of services they provide and the construct of models on which they operate, largely outsource their payment and settlement-related activities to various other entities, RBI said. The framework has been issued in order to enable effective management of attendant risks in outsourcing of such activities. Outsourcing is defined as use of a third party (service provider) to perform activities on a continuing basis that would normally be undertaken by the PSO itself, now or in the future. As per the framework, a PSO which has outsourced its customer grievance redressal function must also provide its customers the option of direct access to its nodal officials for raising and / or escalating complaints. Also, the PSO should have a board-approved comprehensive outsourcing policy. The framework also lists out the role of the board and responsibilities of the senior management. The service provider will also have to develop and establish a robust framework for documenting, maintaining and testing business continuity and recovery procedures arising out of any outsourced activity, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-issues-framework-for-outsourcing-of-activities-by-payment-system-operators/articleshow/85019408.cms||---
---||Business||Formulate coherent policy responses to enable banks overcome Covid challenges: Parliament panel to finance ministry||NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over delay in resolution of large legacy bad loans of public sector banks (PSBs), a Parliamentary committee on Tuesday asked the finance ministry to formulate coherent policy responses which will empower the lenders to overcome challenges, especially those arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic. In a report on the action taken by the Centre, the Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by BJP MP Jayant Sinha, acknowledged that the government has taken specific steps to revamp the banking system in the areas of loan monitoring, risk management, resolution and recovery of non-performing assets (NPAs), reforms in governance, marketing strategy and reach, among others. However, the large legacy NPAs remaining unresolved or unsettled cannot be ignored, the report cautioned. The committee reiterated that large legacy loans or NPAs may be segregated for resolution, allowing banks to move ahead with their regular business without getting bogged or dragged down with legacy issues. "The Committee desire that both the RBI as the regulator and the central government as the majority stakeholder in PSBs should formulate coherent policy responses which will enable and empower the banks to overcome the challenges facing them, particularly those emerging due to the Covid-19 pandemic and chalk out their growth path for future with confidence," it said. The committee was also informed that the gross NPAs have reduced from Rs 8.96 lakh crore in March 2018 to Rs 5.77 lakh crore in December 2020. A record recovery of Rs 2.27 lakh crore has been effected since March 2018 till March 2020, it said. Besides, the finance ministry has informed that asset quality has improved significantly with the net NPA reducing from 7.97 per cent in March 2018 to 2.32 per cent in December 2020. Besides, the capital risk weighted asset ratio (CRAR) increased from 11.66 per cent in March 2018 to 13.74 per cent in December 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/formulate-coherent-policy-responses-to-enable-banks-overcome-covid-challenges-parliament-panel-to-finance-ministry/articleshow/85019473.cms||---
---||World||Saudi Arabia says sees an emboldened Iran around Middle East||WASHINGTON: Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Tuesday he sees an emboldened Iran acting in a negative manner around the Middle East, endangering shipping, arming Yemen's Houthis and contributing to political deadlock in Lebanon. "All around the region, Iran continues to be emboldened," Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud told a US think tank in an online appearance, alluding to reports that Iranian-backed forces were believed to have seized an oil tanker off the coast of the United Arab Emirates. "Iran is extremely active in the region with its negative activity, whether it's continuing to supply the Houthis with weapons or endangering shipping in the Arabian Gulf, which we have got reports coming in today that may indicate additional activity there," he said. Iran, he added, had abetted the political impasse that has undermined Lebanon's economy. Addressing a virtual gathering of the Aspen Security Forum, he also repeated Riyadh's stance that it could live with a "longer and stronger" version of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers if it ensured Tehran never obtained nuclear arms know-how. "We certainly support a deal with Iran as long as that deal ensures that Iran will not now or ever gain access to nuclear weapons technology," he said, saying Riyadh would welcome an Iran that contributed to regional stability and prosperity. "But that would require (Iran) engaging in the region as a state actor in a normal way, not supporting militias, not sending weapons to armed groups, and most importantly, giving up a nuclear program which might be used to develop nuclear weapons."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-says-sees-an-emboldened-iran-around-middle-east/articleshow/85019419.cms||---
---||Business||Insolvency process: Parliament panel suggests benchmark for 'quantum of haircut'||NEW DELHI: A Parliamentary panel has suggested having a benchmark for the "quantum of haircut" in an insolvency process amid instances of financial creditors taking steep haircuts on their exposure to stressed companies. Besides, the committee has pitched for measures to prevent protracted litigations with respect to an insolvency resolution process. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), which came into effect in 2016, provides for a market-linked and time-bound resolution of stressed assets. Emphasising that the fundamental aim of the Code is to secure creditor rights which would lower borrowing costs as the risks decline, the panel said there is a need for greater clarity in purpose with regard to strengthening creditor rights through the mechanism devised in the Code. The committee particularly mentioned about the "disproportionately large and unsustainable 'haircuts' taken by the financial creditors over the years". In some insolvency resolution processes, the haircuts taken by creditors were more than 90 per cent. "As the insolvency process has fairly matured now, there may be an imperative to have a benchmark for the quantum of 'haircut' comparable to global standards," it noted. Generally, haircut refers to losses incurred by creditors on resolution of a stressed asset. The suggestions have been made by the Standing Committee on Finance in its report on the 'Implementation of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code - Pitfalls and Solutions'. The report was tabled in Parliament on Tuesday. It is a matter of grave concern for the committee that the insolvency process has been stymied by long delays far beyond the statutory limits. It is disconcerting that even admission of cases in NCLT has been taking an unduly long time, which thus defeats the very purpose of the Code, the panel noted. The committee also pointed out that there have been instances of frivolous appeals, which further drags the resolution/ recovery process leading to severe erosion of asset value. The panel said it would therefore recommend that misuse/ abuse of well-intended provisions and processes should be prevented by ensuring an element of finality within the statutory stipulated period without protracted litigation. There have been six amendments to the Code so far. According to the committee, any legislative enactment and implementation need to constantly evolve to meet the challenges in the ever-changing ecosystem. However, the panel said it is of the opinion that "the actual operationalisation of amendments made so far may have altered and even digressed from the basic design of the statute and given a different orientation to the Code not originally envisioned". Further, the committee flagged that "the low recovery rates with haircuts as much as 95 per cent and the delay in resolution process with more than 71 per cent cases pending for more than 180 days clearly point towards a deviation from the original objectives of the Code intended by Parliament".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insolvency-process-parliament-panel-suggests-benchmark-for-quantum-of-haircut/articleshow/85019593.cms||---
---||Business||Sebi allows payments banks to act as investment bankers||NEW DELHI: To provide easy access to investors to participate in public and rights issues by using various payment avenues, markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday allowed payments banks to carry out the activities of investment bankers. Non-scheduled payments banks, which have prior approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), will be eligible to act as a banker to an issue (BTI), Sebi said in a circular. This is subject to fulfilment of the conditions stipulated in the BTI rules. Further, payments banks registered as a BTI will also be permitted to act as self-certified syndicate banks, subject to the fulfilment of the criteria laid down by the Sebi in this regard from time to time. "The blocking/movement of funds from the investor to issuer shall only be made through the savings account of the investor held with the payments bank," Sebi said. In a notification dated July 30, the regulator amended the Bankers to an Issue rules, thereby permitting such other banking company, as may be specified by the Sebi, from time to time, to carry out the activities of Bankers to an Issue (BTI), in addition to the scheduled banks. Bankers to an issue mean a scheduled bank or such other banking company as may be specified by Sebi carrying activities, including acceptance of application money, acceptance of allotment or call money, refund of application money and payment of dividend or interest warrants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-allows-payments-banks-to-act-as-investment-bankers/articleshow/85019674.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||Covid-19: Over 95% of 18+ in Bhubaneswar jabbed||BHUBANESWAR: The state capital has administered both doses of vaccine to more than 95% of the targeted population. As per records, 8.1 lakh people have got both the jabs out of an estimated 8.5 lakh eligible population above 18 years. The number of first dose recipients in Bhubaneswar, pegged at 10.74 lakh, is more than the target because the city has also been giving vaccine to the floating population, the ones who come from the districts. Many are also believed to be intentionally visiting the city due to the availability of vaccine. To bring down daily cases, the city authorities had decided on expediting inoculation by introducing drive-in, near-home and walk-in vaccination, which drew people to the sites. Since May first week, the pace of vaccination took a jump and by the first week of June, the 45 plus age group here had been saturated with both the doses. In terms of vaccine usage, the city authorities claimed to have crossed 100% by using more than 18 lakh doses. “Since our eligible population is 8.5 lakh and we have used doses more than the double, we have achieved 100% vaccination,” said Sanjay Kumar Singh, commissioner, Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC). He added that they had a target of inoculating 3,25,000 in the 45 plus age group and 5,17,000 in the 18-44 age group and both have been achieved. “We are going to carry out mop up activities to identify if any resident is left to be vaccinated,” Singh said. The BMC officials said according to the 2011 census, the capital’s population was 8,37,737, but in 2021, the population is estimated to be 10,97,000. Singh said the BMC had conducted a survey and data revealed 24,000 people had not taken the second dose. Upon verification of 12,000, 75% said they have taken the second dose. “There is data mismatch and we are looking into it. Given the mismatch, it can be said number of persons fully vaccinated can be higher,” the commissioner clarified. The second wave of Covid has put an end to vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in the capital, where the number was high. Initially, their footfall at vaccine sites was very low. Many doctors and nurses had turned their back on vaccination, although they were the first among the priority groups to avail Covid vaccines given their exposure. Many were reluctant to take Covaxin, which is meant only for Bhubaneswar, as then it had just cleared the first phase trial. After the third phase trial report came and the Covid wave re-emerged, those who were initially reluctant came forward to take the jabs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/over-95-of-18-in-state-capital-jabbed/articleshow/85018907.cms||---
---||Goa||States nominate 29 teams for I-League Qualifiers, AIFF to select 10||Panaji: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has started the process of shortlisting teams for the I-League Qualifiers after 18 state associations nominated 29 clubs. The AIFF had asked each state association to nominate a maximum of two teams while only one – the league winner, on sporting merit – would get the nod. Several state associations conducted their leagues in a hurry to fulfil the requirement. In Rajasthan, for example, teams played seven matches in nine days to complete the eight-team league. Zinc Academy finished as champions, ahead of Rajasthan United, both of whom have been nominated. Not all league winners, though, have been nominated. In the JKFA Professional League, J&K Bank FC emerged on top but opted out due to their inability to fulfil the club licensing criteria. Instead, the association nominated Hyderya FC, who finished second, and third-placed Downtown Heroes. In Goa, the nomination was secured by Vasco Sports Club, even though they finished fifth in last season’s Goa Professional League. All four teams above them – Sporting Clube de Goa, Dempo SC, Salgaocar FC and Calangute Association – have no interest in I-League at the moment. At least two states – Assam and Uttarakhand – did not provide league details, so their entries are unlikely to be accepted. Indian Football Association, governing body for football in Bengal, did not conduct the league last season and didn’t start this season but have nominated 2019-20 winners Peerless SC and fifth-placed Bhawanipore FC. “The teams that finished on top will get preference. Only if they do not fulfil the club licensing criteria, will we look at the second nomination. Only one team (from a state) will get the nod,” said a senior AIFF official. The AIFF will select a maximum of 10 teams. Nominated teams: Vizag FC (Andhra Pradesh), Oil India FC, Elevenstar Club (Assam), Shirsh Bihar United (Bihar), Indian Heroes Daman and Diu FC, Young Hearts FC (Daman and Diu), Sports Hostel Cuttack (Odisha), Delhi FC, Garhwal FC (Delhi), Vasco SC (Goa), Gandhinagar FC, ARA FC (Gujarat), Techtro Swades United FC, Shimla Football Club (Himachal Pradesh), Peerless SC, Bhawanipore FC (Bengal), Hyderya Sports Kashmir FC, Downtown Hero's FC (Jammu & Kashmir), Kerala United FC, Basco Othukkungal (Kerala), FC Bengaluru United, Kickstart FC (Karnataka), Madan Maharaj FC (Madhya Pradesh), Ryntih SC (Meghalaya), Rajasthan United FC, Zinc Football Academy (Rajasthan), Amenity Sports Academy (Uttarakhand), PIFA Sports, Kenkre FC (Maharashtra).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/states-nominate-29-teams-for-i-league-qualifiers-aiff-to-select-10/articleshow/85019932.cms||---
---||World||Psaki criticizes policy in states blocking masks||WASHINGTON: White House press secretary Jen Psaki criticized policies in states such as Texas and Florida that have moved to block employers and proprietors from implementing mask or vaccine requirements to curb the coronavirus. Those two states are among several facing surging cases from the delta variant. “I think the fundamental question we have is, ‘what are we doing here?’” Psaki asked. Biden planned to speak Tuesday about US strategy to slow the spread of the coronavirus at home and abroad, noting that “we’re all in this together.” Earlier, the White House announced the US had shipped more than 110 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to more than 60 countries. Biden has promised the US will be the “arsenal of vaccines” for the world, and it has shipped the most vaccines abroad of any donor nation. While notable, the 110 million doses donated largely through a vaccine program known as COVAX represent a fraction of what is needed globally. The White House says the US will begin shipping half a billion doses of Pfizer vaccine it has pledged to about 100 low-income countries at the end of August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/psaki-criticizes-policy-in-states-blocking-masks/articleshow/85019628.cms||---

As of Tuesday evening, 1,04,611 students registered online on the Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) website to attend admission counselling. As many as 74,309 students made payment and 56,935 students uploaded their certificates, officials from TNEA said. Candidates can apply for the counselling till August 24. “Many students wanted to join engineering courses through counselling due to low fees for government quota seats in the counselling. With more students scoring higher in Class XII board exams, most of them said they will get a seat in good colleges. This is one of the main reasons for the number of applications touching one lakh within 10 days,” said career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi. Colleges expect a boost in engineering admissions following better placements in the past year. “Due to good placements and higher marks in Class XII, more students prefer engineering courses in good colleges. With still three weeks left, we expect the number of applications to cross 1.3 lakh,” said RM Kishore, vice-chairman, RMK Engineering College. As per the schedule, the candidates will be assigned a random number on August 25. The engineering rank list will be released on September 4. Based on the number of applications to counselling, the TNEA will conduct online counselling in four or five rounds. The certificates also will be verified online due to the pandemic. Counselling for special categories will be conducted from September 7 to 11. The online general counselling will be conducted from September 14 to October 4. The supplementary counselling will be held from October 12 to 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/applications-for-be/btech-cross-1-lakh-in-9-days/articleshow/85020043.cms||---

Nearly a month and half ago, the constant coughing of the sick felines had sent alarm bells ringing among the staff. Now, zoo director Debasis Jana told TOI, there was relief as all the seven lions had tested negative and were healthy. Their diet also had been reverted to beef and liver every day, he said. On the treatment, Jana said it was a challenging task as lions cannot be handled like humans. “There are limitations in the treatment of wildlife in captivity,” he said. A team of veterinarians along with animal keepers constantly monitored them, checking their respiratory rate and body temperature periodically using a thermal image camera from a distance. They were given the same medicines administered to humans infected by the virus antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids. They were also subjected to nebulisation treatment which was a challenge as the animals kept moving up and down in the enclosure. It was only when each lion lay down that the vets thrust a nebulizer affixed to a stick through the bars and kept it close to the nose. This laborious process lasted nearly four hours for each animal, but the monitoring team managed it, he said. During the treatment, the vets noticed kidney problems in two lions and used enteric dialysis to cure them. Two of the seven lions were very old and had to be administered a fluid diet for about 10 days to help them recover. Earlier, soon after the lions tested positive for Covid-19, the zoo managers changed their diet. “Normally, we provide each lion with seven kg of beef and one and half kg of liver. This was changed to chicken, chicken soup, mutton soup every day for nearly 45 days,” he said. Since the third week of July, the animals have been getting their normal diet and are being let out into the open during the day, Jana added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/lions-at-vandalur-zoo-free-of-covid/articleshow/85020155.cms||P Oppili

Action has been initiated against the bus conductor in Tiruvallur, who issued a higher-priced ticket to passengers by mistake. Strict action will be taken against employees who collect higher fares from passengers, the minister told reporters. “It is not fair to say that fares have been raised in all 20,000 buses just because mistakes have happened at a few locations,” he said, responding to allegations by AIADMK leader O Pannerselvam about the alleged fare hike. TOI on Monday had reported how town buses in Chennai’s suburbs, which allow free travel for women, have silently increased the minimum bus fare from 5 to 10 to cover up for the expenses incurred. This attracted responses from various political parties including OPS. Rajakannapan said that the state government has sanctioned 1,200 crore to transport corporations in order to meet expenses incurred in allowing women to travel for free and over 6.5 crore women have travelled in government buses in the last 22 days. Around 60% of passengers in town buses these days are women. Answering questions on Covid-19 protocols, he informed that 93% of the total 1.22 lakh employees of the state transport department have already got their jabs and that vehicles were disinfected regularly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-hike-in-fares-of-govt-town-buses-transport-minister/articleshow/85020176.cms||---

Gerald Williams, 34, surrendered Monday at the Houston police department's downtown headquarters, the Houston Chronicle reported. He faces a murder charge for the July 6 killing of 17-year-old David Castro, who was shot in the head as he and his family were driving home from a baseball game. During a news conference Monday, the teen's father, Paul Castro, thanked the authorities and members of the public who called in tips after the attack. The attack happened after Paul Castro made a hand gesture as Williams tried to merge in his lane, according to police. Williams had been driving aggressively and swerving around vehicles when he got stuck in traffic, Detective Justin Brown said. Williams was convicted in 2008 of felony aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon and sentenced to 13 years in prison. He was released on parole in February 2020. Williams' bond in the latest case was set at $350,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/man-suspected-in-houston-road-rage-killing-turns-himself-in/articleshow/85020277.cms||---
---||India||Members of 15 opposition parties show up at Rahul’s breakfast meeting||NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday led a breakfast meeting of over 100 opposition MPs after which the attendees rode bicycles and walked to Parliament to emphasise a “united” opposition burying differences for a bigger cause to take on BJP. The show of unity was by opposition leaders from 15 parties, including Trinamool Congress, NCP, Shiv Sena, DMK, CPM, CPI, RJD, Samajwadi Party, JMM, JKNC, IUML, RSP, KCM, LJD and RSP. Among the parties not present were BSP, BJD, TRS and AAP. Given Congress's rivalry with Akalis in Punjab, they were not present too. Trinamool's presence seemed linked to the recent thaw between Mamata Banerjee and the Gandhis. With Congress sidestepping questions about leadership, Tuesday morning’s gathering, opposition leaders said, was called to discuss a range of issues, including the Pegasus snooping row, handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, farm agitation and the issue of price rise among others. “When the government shuts us up in Parliament, they are not just humiliating us as MPs, but also humiliating the voice of the people of India and the majority voice of India. The single motive to invite you is that we should unite. The more this voice unites, the more powerful it will become, the more difficult it will become for BJP and RSS to suppress this voice,” Rahul said in a brief speech. He added, “We should remember the foundation of unity and it is important that now we start to come up with the principles of this foundation.” The Congress leader also said the government’s claim that the opposition is not letting Parliament function is an insult to democracy and to the public, claiming that opposition MPs represent 60% of India’s people. Rahul was presumably referring to BJP getting 37% of the votes rather than the number of seats in Lok Sabha won by the ruling side. While invites were sent out to 17 parties, AAP and BSP, though they have backed opposition protests inside Parliament, did not attend. Following discussions, opposition MPs also agreed to highlight the issue of fuel price hike, which led to some cycling and others walking to Parliament. Trinamool Congress, which skipped the last meeting of opposition leaders, hosted by Gandhi, sent its MPs to attend Tuesday’s meeting, but its main floor leaders kept away. Its presence, however, seemed to flow from CM Mamata Banerjee's recent meeting with Sonia Gandhi and Rahul. Several opposition leaders, including Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut, JDU’s Manoj Jha and NCP’s Praful Patel spoke, each stressing on opposition unity and the need to strengthen it further. Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said, “The government is not responding to our request. Nobody in the government is listening. So we have decided to get together. The opposition is united and we are all together.” Claiming the entire Opposition is united, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, “We will proceed unitedly without fear and deterrence, be it (the) Pegasus (snooping controversy), be it this terrible price rise, be it the farmers' issue, be it any number of fundamental governance issues.” CPI leader Binoy Viswam said, “The common idea is to defeat BJP and that idea is taking shape. We cannot call this an electoral alliance yet, but it is a common platform." Congress leaders did not rule out more frequent meetings of opposition MPs, saying this was also a sign that Rahul Gandhi was warming up to his opposition colleagues in Parliament, and readying for “deeper engagement on all fronts”. Apart from Rahul and Congress MPs, TMC was represented by Saugata Roy, Kalyan Banerjee, Mohua Moitra, Nadimul Haqe and Shanta Chettri while Sena’s Sanjay Raut and Priyanka Chaturvedi, DMK’s Kanimozhi and SP’s Ram Gopal Yadav were also in attendance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/members-of-15-opposition-parties-show-up-at-rahuls-breakfast-meeting/articleshow/85020683.cms||Swati Mathur
---||World||British navy group: 'Potential hijack' of ship off UAE coast||DUBAI: The British navy warned Tuesday of a “potential hijack” of a ship off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in the Gulf of Oman, without elaborating. The incident comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the West over Tehran’s tattered nuclear deal with world powers and as commercial shipping in the region has found itself caught in the crosshairs. Most recently, the US, the UK and Israel have blamed Iran for a drone attack on an oil tanker off the coast ofo Oman that killed two people. Iran has denied involvement. The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations initially warned ships Tuesday that “an incident is currently underway” off the coast of Fujairah. Hours later, they said the incident was a “potential hijack,” but provided no further details. Shipping authority Lloyd’s List and maritime intelligence firm Dryad Global both identified the vessel involved as Panama-flagged asphalt tanker Asphalt Princess. The vessel’s owner, listed as Emirati free zone-based Glory International, could not immediately be reached for comment late Tuesday. The US military’s Mideast-based 5th Fleet and the British Defense Ministry did not immediately return calls for comment. The Emirati government did not immediately acknowledge the incident. Earlier, six oil tankers announced around the same time via their Automatic Identification System trackers that they were “not under command,” according to MarineTraffic.com. That typically means a vessel has lost power and can no longer steer. “At the same time, if they are in the same vicinity and in the same place, then very rarely that happens,” said Ranjith Raja, an oil and shipping expert with data firm Refintiv. “Not all the vessels would lose their engines or their capability to steer at the same time.” One of the vessels later began moving. An Oman Royal Air Force Airbus C-295MPA, a maritime patrol aircraft, flew in circles for hours over the waters, according to data from FlightRadar24.com. Apparently responding to the incident, Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh called the recent maritime attacks in the Persian Gulf “completely suspicious.” He denied that Iran was involved. “Iran’s naval forces are ready for help and rescue in the region,” Khatibzadeh said. The event comes just days after a drone struck an oil tanker linked to an Israeli billionaire off the coast of Oman, killing two crew members. The West blamed Iran for the attack, which marked the first known assault to have killed civilians in the yearslong shadow war targeting commercial vessels in the region. Iran denied playing any role in the incident, though Tehran and its allied militias have used similar “suicide” drones in past attacks. Israel, the United States and United Kingdom vowed a “collective response” to the attack, without elaborating. The Gulf of Oman is near the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all oil passes. Fujairah, on the UAE’s eastern coast, is a main port in the region for ships to take on new oil cargo, pick up supplies or trade out crew. For the past two years, the waters off Fujairah have seen a series of explosions and hijackings. The US Navy blamed Iran for a series of limpet mine attacks on vessels that damaged tankers. In July 2019, Iran seized the British-flagged Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz as it was headed from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas to Dubai. The raid came after authorities in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, seized an Iranian supertanker carrying $130 million in crude oil on suspicion it was breaking European Union sanctions by taking the oil to Syria. Both vessels were later released. Last year, an oil tanker sought by the US over allegedly circumventing sanctions on Iran was hijacked off the Emirati coast in July, following months of tensions between Iran and the US The vessel and its crew ended up in Iran, though Tehran never acknowledged the incident. And in January, armed Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops stormed a South Korean tanker and forced the ship to change course and travel to Iran. While Iran insisted it stopped the ship for polluting, it came as Tehran sought to increase its leverage over Seoul ahead of negotiations over billions of dollars in Iranian assets frozen in South Korean banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/british-navy-group-potential-hijack-of-ship-off-uae-coast/articleshow/85020419.cms||---

On February 25, an explosive-laden Scorpio was found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s South Mumbai residence, Antilia. It was alleged that on March 4, Scorpio owner Hiran was murdered. The prosecution submitted that Hiran was the “weak link” and was aware of the entire conspiracy. It was also submitted that had he been alive, the larger conspiracy would have failed. It said Hiran’s phone was switched off for a long time and later switched on in Palghar before it was destroyed. The prosecution said it wanted to ascertain which of the accused had done this. “It is submitted that the conspirators in furtherance of the larger conspiracy had placed a threat note along with gelatin sticks (explosives) inside the vehicle in order to threaten the Ambani family, and subsequently threat letter emerged demanding money by Jaish Ul Hind, which is a very serious act. The involvement… needs deeper probe regarding terrorist involvement,” the prosecution submitted. The prosecution also submitted that a team in Delhi had recorded statements in connection with the threat letter. The involvement of Jaish Ul Hind and from where the letter was uploaded on messaging service Telegram was being looked into, the prosecution added. The prosecution said there had been extra judicial confessions made by the accused to friends. It said the accused were involved in a larger conspiracy to commit a terrorist act. It also submitted the accused are dangerous and should not be granted bail. The prosecution claimed that 4-5 witnesses were threatened and given police protection, while a few others had refused to come forward fearing for their lives. “Among the accused are police officers and they know how to dodge the investigating agency,” the prosecution submitted. It said that so far, statements of over 150 witnesses had been recorded. The prosecution submitted that a witness, a person from a well-known family, had said they were so fearful after the incident that they cancelled a holiday they were to go on the very same day. The prosecution alleged that some of the accused had gone to Nepal and Dubai after Hiran’s murder. It said the gelatin sticks, obtained in loose form, belonged to a Nagpur-based solar company. The prosecution said the NIA needed to speak to around 50 traders to ascertain how Waze procured it. It was alleged Waze had been misleading the NIA on this aspect. The arguments will continue on Wednesday along with a hearing on Waze’s bail plea, which was earlier rejected by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rs-45-lakh-paid-for-hirans-killing-nia-tells-court/articleshow/85020925.cms||Rebecca Samervel

This comes at a time when Vodafone Idea, which is facing acute financial stress, has sent an SoS to the government, citing possible impact on its 27 crore subscribers. The telecom department’s move, if it goes through, will be an extension to the already-running moratorium that was originally extended in November 2019 for fiscal years 2020-21 and 2021-22. The bailout, if approved, will be for all telecom players and not just restricted to the ailing Vodafone Idea, where key shareholder Kumar Mangalam Birla has appealed for government intervention to ensure that the company remains a going concern. This would mean that any support will also be extended to other players such as Bharti Airtel and market leader Reliance Jio, and would be worth thousands of crores. Read AlsoVoda Idea lenders fret over ‘too big to fail’ telco giantA day after Kumar Mangalam Birla’s letter warning that Vodafone Idea (VIL) may reach an “irretrievable point of collapse” became public, banks are worried about the fate of the telecom major which, they say, is “too big to fail”.“The government is concerned about the health of Vodafone Idea and especially the fact that its further deterioration, or even collapse, may have a debilitating impact on their nearly 27 crore mobile customers and the financial system. A moratorium on spectrum payments is one of the options being considered. However, nothing has been finalised as of now,” sources told TOI. The proposal is being discussed “at the highest levels” in the government, “both within and beyond the telecom department”, sources added, pointing out that the finance ministry and even the Prime Minister’s Office have been sounded out on the matter. Vodafone Idea currently has loans worth Rs 1.8 lakh crore (at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020-21), and its last recorded losses stood at Rs 7,022 crore. The company has exposure worth thousands of crores with banks, while it has to pay even more to the government for spectrum and other dues. Apart from this, Vodafone Idea also has to pay a little over Rs 50,000 crore to the government as part of AGR dues following the Supreme Court verdict, though companies had been given a ten-year schedule to make the payout. The telecom ministry, led by secretary Anshu Prakash, also took stock of the situation to work out ways to ensure minimal disruption. Prakash also heads the Digital Communications Commission, the top inter-ministerial body empowered to take decisions on the telecom sector. The challenge for the government, however, is to assess whether a moratorium will be effective save Vodafone Idea from an impending bankruptcy. “It will be just a temporary relief in case their own business fundamentals doesn’t improve,” another source said. In the previous spectrum payment deferment decision taken in November 2019, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the industry was being handed out a Rs 42,000 crore lifeline by delaying immediate payments. It was also extended in view of the poor financial health of the telecom sector then, and as per estimates, the immediate spectrum payment relief for Airtel at that time was Rs 11,746 crore, for Vodafone Idea Rs 23,920 crore, and for Reliance Jio Rs 6,670 crore. However, companies had been mandated to pay interest on the delayed payments so that the NPV (net present value) of the payable amount was protected. Also, they had to provide the government a financial bank guarantee of the revised annual instalment amounts payable subsequently. If another moratorium is extended now, the same terms would be applicable, sources said. Another relief was handed to the companies in 2017 when the DCC (then called the Telecom Commission) had increased the payment tenure for auctioned spectrum to 16 years against the previously-mandated 10 years. This had also been done to increase the cash in hand for companies and help them tide over financial difficulties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-mulls-moratorium-on-spectrum-payment/articleshow/85021199.cms||Pankaj Doval

The number of deaths from Covid-19 also rose to 126, the most fatalities since June 1, as the country battles another wave of the virus which has spread since authorities relaxed pandemic-related restrictions. The number of new cases hit 24,832 on Tuesday, up from 22,898 the day before. "If we follow the rules of combating the epidemic and get our vaccinations, we will take action to end the epidemic," health minister Fahrettin Koca said in a tweet accompanying the daily data. Two-thirds of Turkish adults have received at least one Covid-19 vaccine, while slighly less than half have received two or more doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/turkeys-coronavirus-cases-jump-to-nearly-25000-highest-since-early-may/articleshow/85021095.cms||---

Firefighters saved homes Monday in the small northern California community of Greenville near the Plumas National Forest as strong winds stoked the Dixie Fire, which grew to nearly 400 square miles (1,036 square kilometers) across Plumas and Butte counties.  "Engines, crews and heavy equipment shifted from other areas to increase structure protection and direct line construction as the fire moved toward Greenville," the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, said Tuesday morning.  The community of about 1,000 people was under a mandatory evacuation order. About 3,000 homes were threatened by the blaze that has destroyed 67 houses and other buildings since breaking out July 14. It was 35% contained.  Crews contended with dry, hot and windy conditions "and the forecast calls for the return of active fire behavior," Cal Fire said.  Similar weather was expected across Southern California, where heat advisories and warnings were issued for interior valleys, mountains and deserts for much of the week.  Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.  More than 20,000 firefighters and support personnel were battling 97 large, active wildfires covering 2,919 square miles (7,560 square kilometers) in 13 U.S. states on Tuesday, the National Interagency Fire Center said.  Dry conditions and powerful winds made for dangerous fire conditions again on Tuesday in Hawaii.  Firefighters gained control over the 62-square-mile (160-square-kilometer) Nation Fire that forced thousands of people to evacuate over the weekend and destroyed at least two homes on the Big Island.  About 150 miles (240 km) west of California's Dixie Fire, the lightning-sparked McFarland Fire threatened remote homes along the Trinity River in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The nearly 25-square-mile (65-square-mile) fire was 5% contained Tuesday.  In southern Oregon, lightning struck parched forests hundreds of times in a 24 hour-period, igniting 50 new wildfires as the nation's largest blaze burned less than 100 miles (161 kilometers) away, officials said Monday.  Firefighters and aircraft attacked the new fires before they could spread out of control. No homes were immediately threatened.  Oregon's Bootleg Fire, the nation's largest at 647 square miles (1,676 square kilometers), was 84% contained and is not expected to be fully under control until Oct. 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/huge-california-fire-grows-as-heat-spikes-again-across-state/articleshow/85021290.cms||---

A bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari set aside the orders of a lower court and Bombay high court which had allowed a plea of a man to order DNA test of his child in a matrimonial dispute with his wife after he alleged that he was not the biological father and that his wife had physical relations with other men. Referring to Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act which talks about presumption of the legitimacy of a child, the bench said that DNA test could not be straightaway ordered to prove adultery and the lower court and the high court erred in passing the order. The court said there must be some primary evidence to prove the adultery allegation and only then the court can consider going for the scientific evidence of DNA testing. “Where is the primary evidence? Straightaway DNA test cannot be done. You have to show some primary evidence,” the bench told the man’s counsel Manisha Karia who had contended that the order passed by the HC was right. The couple had got married in 2008 and a daughter was born in 2011. Six years later, the husband filed a divorce petition. Subsequently, he filed an application before the family court for the DNA testing of the child. The petitioner said he had not raised doubts on the legitimacy of the child in his divorce petition as he was under the impression that he was the biological father but later on “realised that there was no possibility that he was the cause of (the girl’s) birth, as he had been using protection whenever she allowed him to be physically intimate”. The lower court allowed his plea which was upheld by HC and the wife then moved SC. Senior advocate Devadatta Kamat, appearing for the wife, told the bench that no allegation of adultery was made in the divorce petition filed by the husband and not one averment was made in that petition. He said that the allegation levelled against her was baseless. The court, after hearing both sides, quashed the order for the DNA test and said, “In the absence of primary evidence by the respondent in the case of adultery, the conduct of a DNA test which is the secondary evidence ought not have been passed. We set aside the order”. The bench, however, suggested that the parties to go for a divorce settlement instead of raising the issue of adultery and DNA test again in a lower court. As the counsel appearing for both the parties agreed to convince their clients, the bench posted the hearing for Wednesday to settle the dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-dna-test-if-there-is-no-proof-of-adultery-supreme-court/articleshow/85021297.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

As regards disputes with Kerala, he said water resources secretaries of Tamil Nadu and Kerala would soon decide on the date for the next round of talks to resolve pending issues. Duraimurugan said Karnataka government should respect the verdict of the Supreme Court and the final award of the Cauvery water disputes tribunal. “The chief minister’s stand that he would not accept the verdict and the observations of the court is unacceptable. His father, senior Bommai was very affectionate and friendly towards our leader Kalaignar (M Karunanidhi), and the state of Tamil Nadu. I am confident that he would follow the path of his father,” the minister said. An all-party delegation led by Duraimurugan had recently met Union jal shakti minister Gagendra Singh Shekhawat and presented a resolution passed by all Tamil Nadu parties against giving clearance to Karnataka government to build the dam near the inter-state border. Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai had announced a hunger protest against the Karnataka government on August 5 in the Cauvery delta. Reacting to the protest, Bommai told reporters in Bengaluru last week that Tamil Nadu BJP’s opposition to the project would not deter Karnataka government. He said the Karnataka government had the rights and would build Mekedatu dam since it had already done the detailed project report. He expressed hope that his government would get approval for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/duraimurugan-karnataka-cm-is-showing-disregard-for-court/articleshow/85021303.cms||---

"The government of Karnataka is planning to construct a dam across the Cauvery River at Mekedatu. If this dam is constructed, the Karaikal region delta farmers will be badly affected. This proposed dam can store water up to 67TMC (thousand million cubic feet) which will affect the supply to Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. This in turn will affect the agricultural activity in this region and the economic condition of the people.

---||World||Tyson Foods, Microsoft mandate vaccinations, US automakers mask up||Tyson Foods Inc, Microsoft Corp and Detroit's Big Three automakers joined a growing list of US companies that are fast changing their vaccination and masking policies as the Delta variant triggers renewed pandemic restrictions. Microsoft said on Tuesday that all employees, vendors and guests will be required to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination to enter its US buildings, while meatpacker Tyson Foods said it is mandating vaccinations for its workforce. "We did not take this decision lightly," Tyson Chief Executive Donnie King said. "We have spent months encouraging our team members to get vaccinated – today, under half of our team members are." While not mandating vaccinations, General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Stellantis NV and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union will reinstate requirements to wear masks at all US plants, offices and warehouses. Surging Covid-19 cases and new guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that recommends fully vaccinated individuals wear masks have led companies to rethink their policies. US officials said on Monday that Covid-19 cases, along with hospitalizations and deaths from the virus, have increased in the last week, even as vaccination rates have accelerated amid concerns over the highly contagious Delta variant. Many of corporate America's biggest names have acted following the CDC's guidance, including mask mandates from McDonald's Corp and Apple Inc, and vaccination requirements by Walmart and Walt Disney. Tyson said it is negotiating with unions about mandating vaccines for unionized workers, who make up about one-third of its hourly workforce. Rival JBS USA also said it is in talks with unions about vaccine mandates and already requires vaccines for new corporate employees, America's largest meatpacking union, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said it is concerning that Tyson is implementing its mandate before the US Food and Drug Administration has fully approved vaccines. Labor unions and meat companies pushed states to speed up the vaccine rollout in the food sector to protect workers and avoid supply-chain disruptions from Covid-19 outbreaks, such as closures of slaughterhouses last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/tyson-foods-microsoft-mandate-vaccinations-us-automakers-mask-up/articleshow/85021341.cms||---

Police also arrested two women on charges of assisting him in aborting his granddaughter’s foetus. Police said the man's granddaughter and grandson were staying with him after his daughter died a few years ago. His son-in-law married another woman after the death of his daughter and settled in Bengaluru. Police said the man has been sexually harassing his granddaughter for the past three years. The minor girl became pregnant and the man, with the help of a woman living in the same locality and a retired nurse, aborted the foetus. The issue came to light when a section of villagers alerted the village administrative officer, who lodged a complaint against the man and two others with Thirukoilur all-women police. Police booked him under section 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault), 5 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault), 5 (j) (whoever commits penetrative sexual assault on a child), 5 (j) (ii) (makes child pregnant as a consequence of sexual assault) and 17 (punishment for abetment) of the Protection of children from the sexual offences (Pocso) act, 2012 and arrested the man and two women who assisted him in aborting the foetus of his granddaughter. Police produced the three before a judicial magistrate who remanded them in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-71-impregnates-granddaughter-held/articleshow/85021381.cms||---
---||India||HC quashes Tamil Nadu’s ban on online betting games||CHENNAI: The erstwhile AIADMK government’s blanket ban on online betting games was quashed on Tuesday “in its entirety” by the Madras high court as it was irrational and excessive. The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said: “The legislation challenged herein has to be regarded as something done by the legislature capriciously, irrationally and without adequate determining principles such that it is excessive and disproportionate…" However, the court made it clear that nothing would prevent appropriate legislation, conforming to the constitutional sense of propriety, being brought in the field of betting and gambling by the state. The court declared the Tamil Nadu Gaming and Police Laws (Amendment) Act, 2021, which amends the Tamil Nadu Gaming Act, 1930, as ultra vires the Constitution. The order came on a batch of pleas moved by online gaming companies challenging the validity of the legislation. Opposing the challenge, the Tamil Nadu government contended that young teenagers and adults in the age group of 25-30 were losing their entire earnings and savings playing such online betting games. Rummy might be a game of skill, but when it is played for stakes it becomes gambling, the state said. Disagreeing with the state, the bench said that by bringing in an ordinance in November 2020, which was later adopted as an amending act, the legislature erred in expanding its field of legislation by widening the scope of gambling and ascribing a connotation to betting that the relevant entry in the State List does not envisage. “It is true that the entry ‘Betting and Gambling’ appears, at first blush, to cover the possible distinct fields of betting and gambling; but the law as declared defines gambling as a game of chance which skill cannot control; and, the authority conferred on a state legislature by the relevant entry appears to be confined to the arena of betting in games of chance," the bench said. It added that viewed in such a perspective, the legislation does not appear to be genuinely referable to the field of legislation allotted to the state under Entry-34 of the State List in the Constitution. At the same time, the amending act and the law laid down on the subject in a plethora of judgments are so inconsistent and irreconcilable that both cannot stand together. Even the Law Commission’s recommendations stressed on regulation, and not prohibition, the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-quashes-tamil-nadus-ban-on-online-betting-games/articleshow/85021489.cms||Suresh Kumar

---||World||Democratic lawmakers press White House on lapsed Covid-19 eviction moratorium||WASHINGTON: US congressional Democrats on Tuesday pushed the White House to reinstate an expired moratorium on residential evictions that kept millions of people from being forced out of their homes for unpaid rent during the pandemic, but which expired over the weekend. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi both called for reinstatement of the ban on evictions that expired at midnight on Saturday. Congress wants the Biden administration to reinstate the ban, while the White House says a Supreme Court ruling in June means it lacks legal authority to do so without congressional approval. On Sunday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rejected President Joe Biden's request for a new scaled-down pandemic-related moratorium on residential evictions, the White House said. Democratic Representative Maxine Waters tweeted "every minute wasted means another family could be forced onto the streets. Biden, #ExtendTheMoratorium now!" A Supreme Court opinion last month indicated that legislative approval would be required to impose a new moratorium. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that if the White House extends the moratorium without congress authorizing the CDC's power to do so, it could risk an adverse court decision. On Sunday, Biden asked the CDC to target a new moratorium on counties with higher COVID-19 case rates, the White House said. White House officials said Biden has not given up as he asked officials to look at any potential authority to reinstate the eviction moratorium. Biden also called on state and local governments to extend or put in place eviction bans for at the least the next two months, Psaki said. On Friday House Democrats tried https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-house-take-up-residential-ev iction-moratorium-extension-2021-07-30 to advance legislation to extend the moratorium to Oct. 18, but a Republican congressman blocked their bid to pass the measure by unanimous consent. Pelosi told lawmakers such an extension would provide more time to speed distribution of $46.5 billion in rental relief already allocated by Congress. Only about $3 billion of that sum has been distributed so far. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday it "doesn’t seem to me to require any additional legislative action to get the money out there that’s already been made available, so it can solve the problem." More than 15 million people in 6.5 million US households are currently behind on rental payments, according to a study by the Aspen Institute and the Covid-19 Eviction Defense Project, collectively owing more than $20 billion to landlords.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/democratic-lawmakers-press-white-house-on-lapsed-covid-19-eviction-moratorium/articleshow/85020960.cms||---

The Cachar district administration denied there was any economic blockade on the highway. “In fact, truckers who have parked their vehicles in Cachar are refusing to move into Mizoram for fear of being attacked” an official said.

The arrest came despite a directive to all police stations by the HC on Monday that the state would require the leave of the court before taking the accused in custody. Bera was given bail on Monday in a job racket case. Asking Bera to cooperate with the investigating agency, Justice Rajasekhar Mantha had observed that a writ court was required to intervene “even at a suggestion of any plan or attempt to take away the liberty of a person”, with “ulterior motive” or “for doubtful reason”. Justice Mantha observed that there were “repeated attempts by persons to lodge one complaint after the other” against Bera in a “planned and systematic manner”. On Tuesday, the news of Bera’s arrest reached the courtroom after an HC bench concluded hearing on the state’s appeal challenging the previous day’s bail order. Bera’s son received an SMS on Tuesday that a Tamluk court had granted permission to police to arrest him and the information was subsequently submitted to the HC. The bench asked for the name of the officer who made the arrest.The court held that it would pass an order only after it got to know the name of the officer by Wednesday. Justice Mantha on Monday had directed that all police stations in the state might register FIR but he should not be arrested “without the express leave of this court”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-dismayed-over-suvendu-aides-re-arrest-despite-bail/articleshow/85022037.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

Making these observations, Justice Pradeep Kumar Srivastava dismissed the criminal appeal filed by one Harshvardhan Yadav of Kanpur, seeking bail in an alleged case of rape. The appellant is accused of forcefully establishing sexual relations with a woman on the false promise of marrying her. The court also said that making a false promise of marriage with the mala fide intention to deceive the victim was becoming a phenomenon and that it was widely believed by the accused persons that they will escape from criminal liability and punishment in such cases. The court said that till such a law is enacted, the court should take into consideration the social reality and reality of human life and continue giving protection to such women who have suffered on account of false promise of marriage. Yadav, currently in jail, had filed a criminal appeal against rejection of his bail application by the lower court in a case registered under Section 376 (rape) IPC and Section 3(2)5 of SC/ST Act. The victim is a police constable and belongs to scheduled caste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/specific-law-needed-on-cases-of-sex-on-false-promise-of-marriage-hc/articleshow/85022129.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The increase is mainly driven by Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Karnataka and Puducherry where the R-number is increasing. India’s R-number is now on par with the US, Canada and Australia and officials said the worry is not just its high value but also its rising trend in these states.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Apart from these eight with R-value more than one, nine states have the value exactly at one. These include Delhi, Maharashtra, Bengal, Andhra, Haryana, Goa, Jharkhand, Nagaland and Meghalaya. “Whenever this number is at more than one, this means that the case trajectory is increasing and thus needs to be brought under control,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said.

Kerala reported 23,676 new cases on Tuesday as the effects of the “weekend dip”Underlining the need to contain the infection in limited geography, the Centre pointed out that 44 districts have positivity above 10%, of which 10 are in Kerala and 30 in northeastern states, mainly Manipur (nine) and Mizoram (six). The country’s overall weekly positivity rate has fallen significantly to less than 2% in the week ending August 2. The increase in daily new cases is also limited to specific districts. During last four weeks, 18 districts were reporting rising trend in daily new cases, of this 10 were in Kerala, three in Maharashtra, two in Manipur and one each in Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Mizoram. Around 57 districts are now reporting more than 100 cases daily. Kerala alone accounts for 40.6% of daily new cases, whereas Kerala and Maharashtra together have 60% of total active cases. Kerala is the only state with more than one lakh active cases, whereas eight states have active cases ranging between 10,000 to 1 lakh. Active caseload is less than 10,000 in 27 states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/increasing-r-number-in-several-states-a-growing-concern-govt/articleshow/85022236.cms||Sushmi Dey

The latest sero-survey also included vaccinated individuals who are likely to have got vaccine generated antibodies, the Centre said, and also highlighted that national level sero-surveys are not meant to reflect the granularity at the level of states. The point was underlined in the context of “over reading” of state-level projections. It was felt that for states, it was better to refer to sero surveys conducted by the regional governments rather than the national survey. “Making a mathematical calculation and drawing a picture of your own is not scientifically valid. This is not a way of data interpretation,” Niti Aayog member Dr V K Paul said. Findings of the fourth national sero survey shows 67.6% of the general population had antibodies against the SARS-CoV2 virus. “Sero-survey is carried out with the specific purpose of enunciating how many people have previous experience of Covid… It is not meant to cover the granularity at the level of state(s)… This isn’t the way interpretation of data should be done or convey misleading info,” Paul said. The comment came in the wake of reports that sero-survey findings show a serious under-counting of actual infections. “All the sero-surveys that have been done portray the national picture. If the antibody is found in any person it shows the person has been exposed to Covid. It doesn’t mean it was a serious disease,” Paul said. Officials also said it would be difficult to make a count of asymptomatic persons in any country and surveys throw up estimates. He also said while most cases are asymptomatic, it’s possible that such people don’t get tested, and may not be aware about the incidence of the disease. But, in sero-surveys such asymptomatic cases may also get reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-use-sero-surveys-to-claim-under-reporting-says-government/articleshow/85022314.cms||---
---||India||India, China plan buffer zone at PP-17A near Gogra post||NEW DELHI: In an incremental step forward in the overall stalled troop disengagement in eastern Ladakh, India and China now plan to establish a no-patrolling or buffer zone between the rival soldiers at one of the `friction’ points in the Gogra-Hot Springs-Kongka La sector. The phased disengagement with physical verification at Patrolling Point-17A is likely to kick off over the next few days, once the “in-principle agreement” reached during the 12th round of corps commander-level talks last Saturday is “ratified” by the two governments. “China’s final confirmation is awaited,” said a source on Tuesday. The other friction point in the sector, PP-15, as well as the much more intractable issue of the blocking of Indian troop patrols in the strategically-located Depsang Bulge area and the tents pitched inside Indian territory in the Demchok sector will need to be further discussed with China, added the sources. “After PP-17A, which is near our Gogra post, it will have to be a step-by-step process. China, as of now, is unwilling to take forward the discussions on PP-15, Depsang and Demchok. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is maintaining its overall aggressive military posture all along the frontier in eastern Ladakh. Our mirror deployments also continue,” said a source. The proposed buffer zone at PP-17A will be akin to the one established in Galwan Valley, which is to its north, after violent skirmishes left 20 Indian soldiers and an unverified number of Chinese troops dead there on June 15. China has until now officially acknowledged only four casualties in the Galwan clashes, though Indian sources maintain the PLA lost more soldiers. Incidentally, Chinese online handles on Monday released another short video of the Galwan clashes, which show PLA troops hurling stones at Indian soldiers from a height. The disengagement zone at Galwan extends to 1.4-km on each side, adding up to around 3-km. Around 30 soldiers each are positioned at the edge of this zone in tents, with another 50 each in the second layer some distance away. At PP-17A and PP-15, there are only around 30 soldiers each (platoon strength) in close proximity of around 500-metres after partial disengagement was carried out at the two locations last year. Both armies, however, continue to maintain thousands of troops in the “immediate rear areas” of the region, backed by heavy weaponry like howitzers and air defence batteries, like elsewhere along the line of actual control in eastern Ladakh. “The completion of the stalled disengagement at PP-17A, as also PP-15, can take place quickly once the modalities are approved by both the sides,” said a source. If it happens, it will represent the first small step forward in the military stalemate since the successful troop disengagement on both sides of the Pangong Tso in February this year. India maintains that troop disengagement from the remaining friction points, followed by de-induction and the consequent de-escalation, is critical for improvement in bilateral ties. But China wants the border row to be kept at an “appropriate place”, without it impinging on the overall ties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-china-plan-buffer-zone-at-pp-17a-near-gogra-post/articleshow/85021794.cms||Rajat Pandit

Bharat Biotech is currently supplying around 2 crore doses of Covaxin per month, which is projected to increase to around 2.5 crore doses in August. Covaxin supplies faced a slowdown as its new manufacturing facility in Bengaluru with a large-scale fermentation plant facing initial glitches during standardisation of first few batches in June-July, resulting in delays in ramping up supplies. According to officials, the issues have been resolved and supplies have started from the factory. “The quantum jump in Covaxin supplies will come from Bharat Biotech’s Bengaluru facility. This has a large size reactor and system established by them and the contribution of supplies have started coming,” Niti Aayog’s member (health) Dr V K Paul said. In a written response in Parliament, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said between August and December, the monthly vaccine production capacity of Covishield is projected to increase to over 120 million doses from 110 million doses, whereas that of Covaxin is projected to increase to 58 million doses from 25 million doses. The projections were given based on information shared by vaccine manufacturers. Apart from IIL, the two other PSUs — Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation and BIBCOL — which received government support to manufacture Covaxin — are expected to supply the jab by December this year, Paul said. So far, the government has provided nearly 50 crore doses, of which around 47.52 crore were administered across the country till Monday. The average daily vaccination increased to 43.41 lakh doses in July, from 39.9 lakh in June and 19.9 lakh in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covaxin-output-set-to-rise-govt-hopes-to-meet-135-crore-dose-goal/articleshow/85022413.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||World||Relatives of Dayton shooting victims sue gun magazine maker||COLUMBUS, OHIO: The high-capacity magazine used by the man who gunned down nine people in Dayton two years ago serves no purpose other than allowing for the killing of as many people as possible, family members of four victims alleged in a lawsuit against the magazine maker. The complaint filed Sunday in Nevada accuses magazine maker Kyung Chang Industry USA Inc, of deliberately marketing and selling 100-round magazines of the kind used by Dayton mass shooter Connor Betts in the August 4, 2019, attack. The company made and sold 100-round magazines fully aware they "have no or negligible utility for lawful uses of firearms but pose a tremendous risk to public safety because they are extremely effective and attractive for use in unlawful mass shootings,'' the lawsuit said. The magazine allowed Betts to fire 41 rounds in 32 seconds in Dayton's Oregon entertainment district before he was killed by police, according to the lawsuit. The magazine's capacity "enabled the Shooter to transform the popular commercial district into a war zone, in seconds,'' the lawsuit said. The victims' relatives are seeking unspecified financial damages above $15,000 and a court order stopping the company from supplying high-capacity magazines "without reasonable safeguards to prevent their misuse.'' The complaint was brought by family members of shooting victims Derrick Fudge, Lois Oglesby, Logan Turner, and Beatrice Nicole Warren-Curtis. Messages were left with the company Tuesday seeking comment on the lawsuit. Betts was killed by police half a minute after he opened fire August 4, 2019, in Dayton's crowded Oregon district entertainment area. Armed with an AR-15-style gun with the extended ammunition magazine, Betts killed nine people, including his sister, and wounded dozens more. After the shooting, high school classmates said Betts was suspended years ago for compiling a "hit list'' of fellow students he wanted to harm. Two of the classmates said Betts had also been suspended after he came to school with a list of female students he wanted to sexually assault. Police investigators said Betts had a "history of obsession with violent ideations with mass shootings and expressed a desire to commit a mass shooting.'' The FBI said it uncovered evidence Betts "looked into violent ideologies.'' But authorities have also yet to identify a motive, or been able to say definitely whether Betts intended to kill his sister, Megan, or if her death was inadvertent. The Ohio Supreme Court rejected requests by the media, including The Associated Press, for copies of Betts' school records. The court said last year that state law didn't permit disclosure of such records without a student's consent and didn't make exceptions if the student was deceased. Last month, the maker of the rifle used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting offered some of the victims' families nearly $33 million to settle their lawsuit over how the company marketed the firearm to the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/relatives-of-dayton-shooting-victims-sue-gun-magazine-maker/articleshow/85022156.cms||---

Live updates: Coronavirus pandemicKerala reported 23,676 new cases on Tuesday as the effects of the “weekend dip” in detection of cases wore off to reveal a more accurate picture of the pandemic’s spread in the country. This was the highest daily case count in the state since May 27 and the highest reported by any state since Tamil Nadu had logged 24,405 on June 3.   The spike in Kerala took India’s daily cases to 42,497, back above the 40,000 mark after a day’s break, as per TOI’s Covid database collated from state government figures. On the positive side, the national tally was slightly lower than the number reported last Tuesday (42,948). Fresh cases on Monday too were marginally below the count reported on the same day week, indicating that the surge in India’s cases seen last week has not carried over to this week yet.

A storm that dumped rain on the blaze Monday evening helped keep it contained to the property of National Salvage and Services Corp., but it wasn't enough to douse the flames, said Billy Barrett, chief of the Valley Grande Volunteer Fire Department.  "(It) could be up to a week before it's completely burned out," said Barrett.  An apparent lighting strike started the fire about 6 p.m. Sunday, Barrett said. No one was hurt and no evacuations were required, but officials said the heavy smoke from wood treated with chemicals could cause breathing problems for people with asthma or other medical conditions.  The company yard typically holds "thousands upon thousands" of railroad ties that are ground up and used for fuel, primarily in industrial boilers, a spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/railroad-tie-fire-still-burning-in-alabama-despite-storm/articleshow/85022656.cms||---
---||India||Kerala’s managed well so far, needs scientific approach to unlocking: Experts||Even though Kerala’s high Covid numbers has prompted questions about the much-lauded Kerala model of Covid management, public health experts seem to agree that the state’s health system seems well in control of the situation. However, they also feel the state needs a more scientific approach towards opening up instead of weekend lockdowns or restricted opening of shops, which only leads to overcrowding and higher chances of Covid spreading. From roughly 13,000 new cases daily at the beginning of July, the numbers crossed 20,000 cases per day by the last week and remained at this level over one week. Simultaneously, active cases have gone from below 1 lakh at the end of June to almost 1.7 lakh now. This has prompted the government to call for more strict lockdowns in areas with higher caseloads. But ICU beds and ventilators for Covid are still at 40% occupancy, while total Covid bed occupancy is about 57%. A look at the data shows why public health experts laud the Kerala model. Kerala’s low seropositivity, just 44% compared to India’s almost 68%, shows that it has been more successful than any state in ensuring that a smaller proportion of its population got infected. This is even more of an achievement considering that Kerala has the second highest density of population and almost 50% is urban. Kerala has also fully vaccinated about 23% of its adult population, double the national average of 11%. A majority, 53%, have got at least one shot compared to 39% nationally. A comparison with other states that had similar case loads as Kerala shows that its health system was able to ensure much lower mortality despite having the highest proportion of elderly population in India (14%) and with one in 20 persons being diabetic. The case fatality rate in Kerala is 0.5 compared to over 1.3 nationally. The two times that cases peaked in Kerala, in October last year and again in May this year, the health system was not overwhelmed to the point that people could not get a bed or oxygen. The number of hospitalisations remained more or less the same in the two peaks, though ICU admissions and ventilator use went up in the second wave. However, by then the state had ramped up the number of ICU beds as well as ventilators. The state managed to draw out the peaking of cases to give the health system enough time to gear up for the increase in cases. According to Dr T Anish, associate professor of community medicine in Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, the biggest achievement is that the state did not allow a huge spread of the disease even during the second wave as is evident from the sero-survey conducted by the ICMR between June 14 and July 6, which showed just 44% sero prevalence. “If the spread had been huge then, the health system would have collapsed. The fact that we managed to prevent that is the biggest achievement. People saying Kerala has failed don’t seem to understand that it is a failure of the state if it has high sero prevalence like 70%. They also do not seem to realise that excess mortality means that lakhs of people who died were not reported and hence fewer reported deaths is not a success,” said Dr Anish. Epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya echoes that last point. “When other states are under-reporting, as the sero survey has revealed, the cases in Kerala are bound to seem like a lot. High reporting is a sign of a well-functioning system and states should not be penalised for reporting. However, Kerala needs planned lifting of curbs and more work on micro containment to stop transmission. Maharashtra has a better planned unlocking strategy.” Dr Lahariya added that Kerala needs to be allocated more vaccine doses as its sero prevalence is low. “Kerala must concentrate on vaccinating the younger adult population who are moving around much more,” said Lahariya. “We urgently need more vaccines from the Centre,” added Anish. “We have saved a lot of people from getting infected and so we will have more cases every time lockdown is lifted unless we vaccinate more people in that time,” he said. He added that piecemeal locking down was not helping and a better strategy is expected to be announced soon. Epidomeliogist Dr Gagandeep Kang had in a recent interview pointed out that the sero prevalence study showed that Kerala had detected one in six actual Covid cases against the national average of one in 33, which testified to the smartness of its testing strategy. She had lauded the state for its handling of the pandemic and even suggested that it should act as a model for other states. Gautam Menon, professor of Physics and Biology at Ashoka University, said while Kerala has been getting it right on testing, tracing, isolating and getting people to hospitals and ensuring that the health system is not overwhelmed, its opening up process was wrong. “Instead of restricting the hours a shop stays open, when a lot of people will be crowding in during restricted hours, it ought to make them stay open longer so that there are fewer people and no crowding in any closed public space,” said Prof Menon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/keralas-managed-well-so-far-needs-scientific-approach-to-unlocking-experts/articleshow/85022734.cms||Atul Thakur

The Guild, which joins journalists and activists who have already filed petition in the apex court, has pleaded that the court should intervene in the issue as the government “has not expressly denied procuring Pegasus spyware”. It said snooping was done not only against journalists but also holders of constitutional posts and opposition leaders, which amounts to attacking the integrity of several democratic institutions and the political process. Challenging the constitutional validity of the existing legal architecture for surveillance and use of hacking and spyware, it said, “The indiscriminate use of these capabilities against journalists and other democratic actors destroys freedom of speech and poisons the heart of democratic accountability. The petitioners, are therefore, constrained to seek the intervention of this court in enforcing the Rule of Law, public accountability, ensuring law and order, and safeguarding of fundamental rights, including freedom of speech and expression, freedom of the press, and privacy.” “It is regretfully submitted that all attempts to seek accountability and enforce constitutional limits through parliamentary processes have been stonewalled. Through their intransigence, the respondents have deliberately avoided public debate on this issue and have provided obfuscated answers, forcing the petitioner to approach this court,” it said. “In the face of NSO Group’s stated position that it only sells to vetted governments, these allegations of spying raise grave concerns of abuse of office; dismantling of separation of power; infringement of fundamental rights to privacy, freedom of speech and expression, and freedom of the press; subversion of the democratic process; and commission of serious criminal offences,” the petition said. “Pegasus cyber attacks have raised severe questions as to the integrity of several democratic institutions and the political process. Amongst names on the list of potential targets included a former Election Commissioner, several members of the Opposition, and political strategists. If unaddressed, this can shake the public faith in democratic processes, and create a chilling effect, which is poisonous to the health of any democracy," the Guild argued. It said the success of democratic processes hinges on its fairness and integrity and snooping of citizens will have a deterrent effect on public participation in democratic processes and institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-skirting-pegasus-issue-says-editors-guild-moves-sc/articleshow/85022903.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Bengaluru||Govt to revise guidance value of properties in Karnataka soon||BENGALURU: Property prices in the state may largely go up soon as the government is looking at revising guidance values. A Central Valuation Committee (CVC) comprising senior officials of the revenue department is assessing guidance values in all districts and could submit its report this month, said a senior revenue department officer. Guidance value is the base price of properties fixed by the government, and property registrations cannot go below it. Karnataka collects a duty of 5.65%, including cess and surcharge on transaction value, and a 1% registration fee on guidance value. Mohan Raj, inspector-general of registration and commissioner of stamps, said, “Revision of guidance value is scheduled every year, but it didn’t happen over the last two years due to Covid-19. Now, it’s course correction to fix the gap between guidance value and prevailing market rates.’’ Though the quantum of increase is not finalised, revenue department sources said it could increase by at least 5%-10 %. In some places, it may drop as it has reached saturation point. The revision is expected to boost revenue that has seen a decline in stamp duty fee of property registration due to the pandemic and lockdown, said another officer. For 2020-21, the revenue department’s target is Rs 12,655 crore. The real estate sector was taken aback as it hoped for a cut in both guidance value and stamp duty of properties above Rs 45 lakh. Former revenue minister R Ashoka has often said his department will cut guidance value by 15%-20% in sync with corrections in property prices. The Bengaluru chapter of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India (Credai) sought a 30% reduction in guidance value, citing Maharashtra and Delhi which slashed guidance value to encourage transactions. Shabeer Sait, executive head of operations, Irshads Property Matters, said guidance values in some places are slightly lower (15% to 20%) than market rates and higher (20% to 25%) in some places. “Necessary corrections are needed and a uniform reduction across all zones, even if it’s small, will help drive up sales and result in savings for customers. These savings will come back into the market via other expenditure by consumers, so effectively the government won’t lose much,” he added. Monica Matthias, director, Hoysala Projects, said: “Reduction of guidance value helps buyers reduce overall price burden via lower stamp duty payment and sellers (in second transactions) benefit from reduced capital gains bill.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-to-revise-guidance-value-of-properties-soon/articleshow/85023095.cms||Manu Aiyappa

We’re hoping to finalise this tender by October-November. After three months, we will invite tenders for the Kanaka line. Both Sampige and Parijaata corridors are not scrapped and they will be taken up in the next phase,” said a K-RIDE official. He said the plan is to make the Mallige line operational in three years after the work order is issued. “It’s not difficult to complete all corridors in six years. For instance, we have enough land for the Sampige line. For Parijaata, Cantonment-Whitefield quadrupling work is in progress and we’ll use those tracks to run suburban trains. So we need to focus only on the remaining Kengeri- Cantonment section. But land acquisition between KSR Bengaluru City and Cantonment is difficult so we are going elevated there,” said an official. The Rs 15,657-crore project was cleared by the Centre in October 2020 but there has been no progress on the ground. Officials blamed Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns for delays. In fact, K-RIDE had recently cancelled several tenders like selection of a general consultant for Bengaluru suburban rail project, detailed design consultant for detailed/conceptual design and drawings for all systems, consultancy services for assessment of market value of land and structures and implementation of human resources management system. Asked about the reason for the cancellation of these tenders, the official said: “We had to re-draft these tenders according to the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (KTPP) Act. All tenders will be floated again in a few weeks.” K-RIDE sources said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to lay the foundation stone for the project during the inauguration of the city’s third coaching terminal of Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal, Byappanahalli. KfW, AFD may fund projectSources said Germany-based KfW and France-based AFD are likely to fund the project. The Centre has given its approval for Rs 7,438 crore external borrowings as part of the Rs 15,767 crore project. The project is being funded in the ratio of 20:20:60, with the state and Centre having equal fiscal responsibility and the rest 60% to be generated from loans. “We are in negotiations with KfW and AFD for external funding for the project and they were very positive,” he said. Loop line to DevanahalliAccording to the detailed project report (DPR) prepared by RITES, two depots were planned — at Jnanabharathi (56.9 acres) on Parijaata line and Devanahalli (61.2 acres) on Sampige line. However, these two corridors are only taken up in the second phase. “We are now thinking of building a loop line from Yelahanka which is part of Kanaka line towards Devanahalli, where the government has identified land for the depot,” said an official. Officials feel acquiring BU land at Jnanabharathi won’t be easy as environmentalists may oppose it. In places like Huskur near Electronics City, the railways have land parcels and K-RIDE is also assessing whether to set up a depot there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/civil-work-tender-for-25km-mallige-suburban-rail-likely-by-month-end/articleshow/85023122.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||World||Mistaken identity lands man in Hawaii mental hospital||HONOLULU: Hawaii officials wrongly arrested a homeless man for a crime committed by someone else, locked him up in a state hospital for more than two years, forced him to take psychiatric drugs and then tried to cover up the mistake by quietly setting him free with just 50 cents to his name, the Hawaii Innocence Project said in a court document asking a judge to set the record straight.  A petition filed in court Monday night asks a judge to vacate the arrest and correct Joshua Spriestersbach's records. The filing lays out his bizarre plight that started with him falling asleep on a sidewalk. He was houseless and hungry while waiting in a long line for food outside a Honolulu shelter on a hot day in 2017.  When a police officer roused him awake, he thought he was being arrested for the city's ban on sitting or laying down on public sidewalks.  But what he didn't realize was that the officer mistook him for a man named Thomas Castleberry, who had a warrant out for his arrest for violating probation in a 2006 drug case.  It's unclear how this happened as Spriestersbach and Castleberry had never met. Spriestersbach somehow ended up with Castleberry as his alias, even though Spriestersbach never claimed to be Castleberry, according to the Hawaii Innocence Project.  Spriestersbach's attorneys argue it all could have been cleared up if police simply compared the two men's photographs and fingerprints.  Instead, against Spriestersbach's protests that he wasn't Castleberry, he was eventually committed to the Hawaii State Hospital.  "Yet, the more Mr. Spriestersbach vocalized his innocence by asserting that he is not Mr. Castleberry, the more he was declared delusional and psychotic by the H.S.H. staff and doctors and heavily medicated," the petition said. "It was understandable that Mr. Spriestersbach was in an agitated state when he was being wrongfully incarcerated for Mr. Castleberry's crime and despite his continual denial of being Mr. Castleberry and providing all of his relevant identification and places where he was located during Mr. Castleberry's court appearances, no one would believe him or take any meaningful steps to verify his identity and determine that what Mr. Spriestersbach was telling the truth - he was not Mr. Castleberry."  No one believed him - not even his various public defenders - until a hospital psychiatrist finally listened.  All it took were simple Google searches and a few phone calls to verify that Spriestersbach was on another island when Castleberry was initially arrested, according to the court document.  The psychiatrist asked a detective to come to the hospital, who verified fingerprints and photographs to determine the wrong man had been arrested and Spriestersbach spent two years and eight months institutionalized, the petition said, noting that it wasn't hard to determine the the real Castleberry has been incarcerated in an Alaska prison since 2016.  According to records, a 49-year-old man named Thomas R. Castleberry is in the Spring Creek Correctional Facility in Seward, Alaska. His relatives couldn't be reached for comment. The Alaska public defender listed for him declined to comment Tuesday.  The Hawaii Innocence Project document also claims Spriestersbach had ineffective counsel: the Hawaii public defender's office.  Police, the state public defender's office, the state attorney general and the hospital "share in the blame for this gross miscarriage of justice," the petition said.  Hawaii Public Defender James Tabe and spokespersons for the state attorney general's and health department didn't immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday.  Once the fingerprints and photographs were finalized, officials moved quickly, but secretly, to release Spriestersbach in January 2020, the petition said.  "A secret meeting was held with all of the parties, except Mr. Spriestersbach, present. There is no court record of this meeting or no public court record of this meeting. No entry or order reflects this miscarriage of justice that occurred or a finding that Mr. Spriestersbach is not Thomas Castleberry," the court document said.  His lawyers think officials didn't think anyone would believe Spriestersbach or no one would care about the homeless man who fell asleep waiting for food, only to wake up to a living nightmare.  Spriestersbach, 50, who lives with his sister in Vermont, declined to comment for this story.  His sister, Vedanta Griffith, spent nearly 16 years looking for him. He moved to Hawaii with Griffith when her husband was stationed on Oahu with the Army in 2003. He moved to the Big Island and then disappeared, while suffering mental health issues, she said.  "Part of what they used against him was his own argument: 'I'm not Thomas Castleberry. I didn't commit these crimes. ... This isn't me,'" she told The Associated Press. "So they used that as saying he was delusional, as justification for keeping him."  After his release, he ended up at a homeless shelter, which contacted his family.  "And then when light is shown on it, what do they do? They don't even put it on the record. They don't make it part of the case," Griffith said. "And then they don't come to him and say, 'We are so sorry' or, how about even 'Gee, this wasn't you. You were right all along.'"  Spriestersbach now refuses to leave his sister's 10-acre property.  "He's so afraid that they're going to take him again," Griffith said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/mistaken-identity-lands-man-in-hawaii-mental-hospital/articleshow/85023193.cms||---

Well-placed Congress sources said Kishor has suggested that the leadership form a special advisory committee, under the chairpersonship of party president Sonia Gandhi, that will take political decisions. The panel is to be a “compact body” that can discuss and finalise proposals on political moves — ranging from alliances to strategies to campaigns. After doing the necessary ground work, the panel will put the proposals before the party’s apex decision-making body, Congress Working Committee, which is a larger group with representations from all regions and communities, for further deliberations and approval. Read AlsoWhy Prashant Kishor is wooed by every political leaderThe electoral strategist nourishes the personality cult. Irrespective of the party they belong to, the leaders all start appearing a little authoritativeThe suggestion is that select party leaders besides Kishor be part of this panel, it is learnt. “He wants a national role, and is not hooked on the usual sought-after designations like AICC general secretary,” a senior leader said. The post of AICC general secretary remains the top organisational position in Congress, which opens the possibility of it also being the possible perch for the high profile poll strategist. There is a buzz among insiders that Congress may go in for an organisational overhaul in the coming months, which would include fresh appointments and also creation of new panels. Read AlsoHow Prashant Kishor became the man who made the impossible possibleIndian politics had been looking for a game changer in terms of method. Is Prashant Kishor, strategist, service provider, spinmeister, disruptor, what Indian politics needs today?The special panel, however, will be the focus area as the Congress chief moves closer to a final decision. “A decision can be taken any time. The negotiations and the in-house deliberations have been on for over one and half months now,” a source said. After being the election manager for Trinamool Congress, and helping the Mamata Banerjee-led party fend off an aggressive BJP campaign in the West Bengal assembly polls and win a third term in the state, Kishor entered into talks with the Congress leadership for joining the party. He has also submitted a proposal on how the Congress grassroots should be reorganised to make it resurgent. What has boosted Kishor’s candidature is the support of key satraps who have a positive opinions about his skills, with some of them having worked with him in the management of elections. “He is seen as a good input to the party and he was told to join without any conditions,” a senior functionary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/prashant-kishor-seeks-national-role-congress-set-to-take-a-decision-soon/articleshow/85023023.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||World||Biden to announce new eviction ban due to Covid spread||WASHINGTON: The Biden administration will announce a new 60-day eviction moratorium that would protect areas where 90% of the US population lives, according to three people familiar with the plans who insisted on anonymity to discuss the forthcoming announcement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified a legal authority for a new and different moratorium that would be for areas with high and substantial increases in Covid-19 infections. The extension helps to heal a rift with liberal Democratic lawmakers who were calling on executive action to keep renters in their homes as the delta variant of the coronavirus spread and a prior moratorium lapsed at the end of July. Administration officials had previously said a Supreme Court ruling stopped them from setting up a new moratorium without congressional backing, saying that states and cities must be more aggressive in releasing nearly $47 billion in relief for renters on the verge of eviction. The new policy came amid a scramble of actions by the Biden team to reassure Democrats and the country that it could find a way to halt potential evictions. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen briefed House Democrats Tuesday on the administration’s efforts to prevent widespread housing evictions after a moratorium lapsed, but lawmakers protesting outside the US Capitol said more needs to be done, intensifying pressure on President Joe Biden to act. Yellen told Democrats on a private call about the work underway to ensure some $47 billion in federal housing aid approved during the Covid-19 crisis makes it to renters and landlords. She provided data so that lawmakers could see how their districts and states are performing with distributing the relief, according to a person on the call. The White House has said state and local governments have been slow to push out that federal money and is pressing them to do so swiftly after the eviction moratorium expired over the weekend. The treasury secretary tried to encourage Democrats to work together, even as lawmakers have said Biden should act on his own to extend the eviction moratorium, according to someone on the private call who insisted on anonymity to discuss its contents. Yellen said on the call, according to this person, that she agrees “we need to bring every resource to bear” and that she appreciated the Democrats’ efforts and wants “to leave no stone unturned.” But progressive lawmakers, who have been camped for days outside the Capitol with dozens of supporters, are trying to pressure the administration to put the moratorium back in place. “What we need is for the White House to actually do, to do the thing — and they need to actually extend the moratorium,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at the Capitol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-to-announce-new-eviction-ban-due-to-covid-spread/articleshow/85023350.cms||---
---||India||Art 370 nixed, but how many Pandits have returned: Omar||NEW DELHI: National Conference leader Omar Abdullah feels the abrogation of Article 370 has not served a purpose, saying the country has moved away farther from the solution to the vexed Kashmir issue despite the Centre withdrawing the special status to the erstwhile J&K state two years ago. In an interview to Times Now, he said the government had failed to address the issue of Kashmiri Pandits’ migration despite scrapping Article 370. “You had said how Kashmiri Pandits were forcefully evicted from Kashmir. It has been two years since Article 370 was removed, how many Kashmiri Pandits have been able to go back to Kashmir?” Omar, who along with his father Farooq Abdullah met PM Narendra Modi just five days before the scrapping of special status to J&K in 2019, said he had “no clue that things were about to change” even after meeting the PM. When asked what the PM had told him at the meeting, Omar said: “It was a conversation between us. I can’t tell you what happened. I feel I misunderstood what I had heard, what I understood from our conversation I feel I misunderstood it.” “Almost everyone was taken by surprise. Just a handful of people were aware of it before it was implemented. Some in the media were told about it. We were not told about it at all,” said Omar. Omar, who remained in detention for 234 days, said his outlook towards the country has not changed. “I do not hold the country responsible for what happened. But I may not be as trusting of the institutions as I ordinarily should have been or would have been.” Asked if he included courts when he talked about institutions, he said: “…the fact that nothing has happened in our petition for two years would make me critical. But I can’t divorce myself from the reality of almost two years of a Covid pandemic which has affected the functioning of courts everywhere. So, am I disappointed that the Supreme Court has not found the time to begin hearings of our petition? Absolutely! But do I understand the circumstances that prevailed in the country? Yes! There will come a time when, despite these circumstances, we will expect the Supreme Court to begin hearings.” When asked about charges that he “sails in two boats” via-a-vis the Kashmir issue, he said: “We were always in Hindustan’s boat. But before we were on board, there were promises made by the Indian government.” He added: “We are angry because India didn’t keep its promise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/art-370-nixed-but-how-many-pandits-have-returned-omar/articleshow/85023392.cms||---
---||World||Saudi Arabia to back Iran nuclear deal if Tehran never gets nuclear weapons: Saudi Foreign Minister||WASHINGTON: Saudi Arabia will support a nuclear deal with Iran as long as the agreement ensures Tehran will never acquire nuclear weapons, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said on Tuesday. "We certainly support a deal with Iran as long as the deal ensures that Iran will not now or ever gain any access to nuclear technology," he said during an Aspen Security Forum event. Iran and Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties in 2016, with the latter repeatedly calling for harsher conditions for Iran in the 2015 nuclear agreement. The countries have recently launched several rounds of talks to discuss bilateral relations and ways to resolve regional issues. In 2015, Iran sealed a deal on nuclear development with Russia, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, France and Germany, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under the terms of the agreement, Tehran had to scale back its nuclear program and considerably decrease its uranium reserves in exchange for sanctions relief. However, the agreement was all but mothballed in 2018 when former US President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the deal and re-imposed a sanctions policy against Tehran, which responded by gradually abandoning its commitments under the agreement. Since April, Vienna has been hosting sessions of the JCPOA joint commission, as well as informal meetings in different formats aimed at preventing the Iran nuclear deal from falling apart after the United States withdrew from the agreement. The sixth round of the talks finished on June 20. Tehran said that the negotiations should resume after President-Elect Ebrahim Raisi takes office on August 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-to-back-iran-nuclear-deal-if-tehran-never-gets-nuclear-weapons-saudi-foreign-minister/articleshow/85023336.cms||---

Addressing the weekly parliamentary party meeting, the PM expressed his unhappiness at the conduct of opposition members. “The members who tore papers and threw around have not even regretted their conduct. This shows their arrogance,” parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said, quoting the PM. Modi accused the opposition of an “undemocratic” attitude and said they are not keen on meaningful debates. However, he asked BJP lawmakers to exercise restraint. While TMC MP Shantanu Sen had torn the statement of IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on the Pegasus issue in Rajya Sabha, many opposition members had torn papers in Lok Sabha and threw them. Modi also referred to a tweet of TMC MP Derek O’Brien in which the latter had equated passage of recent bills with making “papri chaat”. “Such comments are derogatory to parliamentary procedure and the esteem of elected representatives,” MoS V Muraleedharan said quoting Modi. The PM also asserted that the Centre will leave no stone unturned to fulfil its commitments, saying bills do not belong to the government but are for people's welfare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tearing-papers-in-parliament-papri-chaat-remark-insult-to-legislature-pm-modi/articleshow/85023453.cms||---

Referring to the Covid-19 situation as the “biggest crisis of the century”, Modi said the government ensured that the poor feel that whatever might be the calamity, the country is with them and it did not let people sleep hungry. “Despite hunger becoming a massive problem in many countries of the world, India identified the crisis and worked on it from the very first day of the pandemic,” he said, after a virtual interaction with PM-GKAY beneficiaries in Gujarat. Under this scheme, nearly 80 crore identified beneficiaries get 5 kg of free foodgrain per month and this will continue till Diwali. “This is why Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana is being praised across the world, and big experts are praising India for providing free foodgrain to more than 80 crore people during the pandemic. The country is spending more than Rs 2 lakh crore on this. Our only aim is that none of our Indian brothers and sisters remain hungry,” he said. The PM-GKAY food security scheme is helping crores of poor people during the pandemic which has helped lessen the worries of the poor, Modi said in his address, marking the completion of Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani’s five years in office. The scope and budget of cheap ration schemes rose since Independence but the effect it should have had on the poor remained limited due to ineffective delivery systems and selfish elements, the PM said. He added that the government used new technology to make the foodgrain delivery system to the poor more effective.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/free-grains-in-pandemic-made-poor-feel-govt-is-with-them-pm-modi/articleshow/85023515.cms||---

Hazel was believed to be close to 30 years old, the Corolla Wild Horse Fund wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday. She didn't show signs of trauma, injury or illness when the organization found her.  But her death came when the National Weather Service said some areas of the Outer Banks saw heat index values near 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius).  "We had noticed that she'd been slowing down some lately," the mustang protection group said. "The heat has been really hard on the older horses."  Hazel was part of a herd of about 100 Spanish horses that occupy a beach area north of Corolla off North Carolina's coast. She "seemed to enjoy her role as honorary grandmother to the foals" and was often seen babysitting them, according to the organization.  The Corolla Wild Horse Fund has been testing DNA from the horses to piece together the herd's history. It said several of Hazel's offspring and relatives have been identified so far, and the group expects to find more as it continues to collect samples.  She was laid to rest near Penny's Hill, the area where she spent her whole life.  "Hazel lived and died as every wild horse should - free, and on her own terms," the organization said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/honorary-grandmother-of-north-carolina-wild-horses-dies/articleshow/85023526.cms||---
---||India||Criminal justice system not at level where accused’s name can be redacted: HC||MADURAI: Dismissing a plea moved by a man seeking to redact his name from a judgment of the Madras high court that acquitted him in a criminal case, the HC on Tuesday observed that “this court honestly feels that our criminal justice system is yet to reach such standards where courts can venture to pass orders for redaction of name of an accused person on certain objective criteria prescribed by rules or regulations”. “This court must take judicial notice of the fact that the criminal justice system that is prevalent in this country is far from satisfactory. In various cases involving heinous crimes, this court helplessly passes orders and judgments of acquittal due to slipshod investigation, dishonest witnesses and lack of an effective witness protection system,” observed Justice N Anand Venkatesh. The judge observed that though this court came to a prima facie conclusion that an accused person is entitled to have his name redacted from the judgments or orders and more particularly the ones that are available in the public domain and which are accessible through search engines. However, on a deeper review of the issue, this court has taken cognisance of the fact that the same is not as simple and straight as it sounded. This court felt that there may be ramifications if such a generalised order is passed and directions are issued. The judge observed that during the course of deliberation, the attention of the court was drawn to various foreign judgments and also the relevant regulations and enactments of those countries which specifically provides for expunction, expungement, redaction or destruction of criminal records. “No such rule or regulation exists in India for the present. In the absence of any statutory backing, this court cannot undertake the exercise of issuing directions when no judicially manageable standards exist in the first place. There must be a proper policy formulated in this regard by means of specific rules. In other words, some basic criteria or parameters must be fixed, failing which, such an exercise will lead to utter confusion,” observed the judge. The judge observed that it will be more appropriate to await the enactment of the Data Protection Act and Rules thereunder, which may provide an objective criterion while dealing with the plea of redaction of names of accused persons who are acquitted from criminal proceedings. “If such uniform standards are not followed across the country, the constitutional courts will be riding an unruly horse which will prove to be counterproductive to the existing system,” observed the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/criminal-justice-system-not-at-level-where-accuseds-name-can-be-redacted-hc/articleshow/85023553.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Appearing for the consortium of banks, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that if Surendra was allowed to go abroad on the basis of an order obtained from the HC by suppressing facts, then the Union government "may have to initiate another extradition proceeding", thus indicating that there was every chance of the accused not returning to India. A bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari restrained Surendra from going abroad even though his counsel, senior advocate Sidhaarth Luthra, assured the court that his client would not travel abroad till the SC heard the appeal filed by the consortium of banks challenging a three-month-old order of the HC. The banks through advocate Sanjay Kapur told the SC that though the order modifying the interim bail conditions was passed in the month of April, it came to the knowledge of the petitioners only when the immigration authority brought it to their notice a request by Surendra, on the basis of the HC order, for withdrawal of lookout circular restrictions on his travel abroad. The HC in a series of orders, first granted him anticipatory bail, then relieved him of the condition to appear before the CBI officer at Bengaluru once every week and then allowed him to take back the passport, which he was earlier ordered to surrender to the investigating agency. Among the banks which were allegedly defrauded by CPL are SBI, IDBI Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bank of Maharashtra, Oriental Bank of Commerce, which later merged into Punjab National Bank, Andhra Bank and Corporation Banks that later merged into Union Bank of India, Exim Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis bank, SBM Bank India and SBM Bank Mauritius, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank, Tata Capital Financial Services, and Yes Bank. The SBI-led consortium accused Surendra of "falsification/fabrication of books of accounts; defrauding the banks by mortgaging properties which were sold prior to mortgage; mortgaging agricultural land as collateral without holding valid title over the lands; and, submitting forged documents for creation of mortgage." "An amount of Rs 8050.8 crore, being public money, is due and payable to the banks by the accused. As per the forensic report, Surendra, in collusion with others, has committed the fraud while obtaining credit facilities from various banks," the petitioners said. In December 2018, the national Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata bench, had appointed liquidator for CPL after lenders had dragged it for defaulting huge loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/travel-bar-on-chief-of-firm-accused-of-fraud/articleshow/85023576.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

"I think he should resign," Biden told reporters at the White House. New York's attorney general, Letitia James, unveiled the results of an investigation earlier on Tuesday that showed Cuomo had engaged in unwanted groping, kissing and hugging and made inappropriate comments to multiple women. Biden previously said that if the investigation determined Cuomo acted inappropriately, he would call for his resignation. On Tuesday, Biden said he stuck by those comments in calling for the Democratic governor to step down. The investigation found Cuomo groped, kissed or made suggestive comments to 11 women and created a "toxic" workplace in violation of the law. In a recorded statement after the attorney general unveiled the findings of the five-month independent inquiry, Cuomo denied he had acted inappropriately and made clear he has no plans to resign. The civil investigation will not directly lead to criminal charges against Cuomo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-calls-on-new-york-governor-cuomo-to-resign-following-investigation/articleshow/85023575.cms||---

A survivor of the tragedy made this revelation on Tuesday. The survivor, Sachin Sanas of Kondalkarwadi village, spotted a group of people from at Taliye village waiting for their neighbour who had gone to had rushed into his hoe on July 22. Sanas shouted out, telling them to move to a safe spot, said Kisan Deshmukh (75), a retired policeman. But the people chose to wait for the man to return. Later, the bodies of the 30 people were found buried under the rubble. Among them was a child found close to its mother. A little farther, a wad of torn notes of Rs 500 denomination was found near the body of Sampat Pol who had rushed to his house. The cash, said another villager, was meant to be a bulwark that they hoped would help them tide over the looming uncertainty. The cash has been handed over to Pol’s son, said Dilip Rayannavar, a tehsildar. Others who had scurried out of the same place, about an hour earlier, survived, said Deshmukh. The next day, a team from National Disaster Response Force, or NDRF, trudged through a slushy 2km jungle path to reach the place. Kunal Deshmukh from Varandh village said that the NDRF team also retrieved the cellphone besides the shredded currency notes. Later, another phone was found on another dead person, said Sanjeev Kumar, sub-inspector of NDRF. “All of these have been handed over to the authorities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mans-dash-for-cash-got-him-29-killed-in-maharashtra-landslide/articleshow/85023583.cms||Umesh K Parida

The home ministry, citing data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), told the House that 72 political murders were committed in 2019, of which 13 were in West Bengal. Replying to a query, minister of state for home Nityanand Rai informed the MPs that NCRB is collecting data, under the head ‘motive of murder for political reasons’, from the states since 2017. He said 61 cases were recorded under this head in 2019, involving 72 victims. In 2018, 54 cases of murder for political reasons were registered and 59 people murdered. In 2017, 98 cases were registered for the murder of 99 persons. Among the states, West Bengal accounted for the highest political murders — 13 in 2018 and the same number in the next year. The numbers are same for both years apparently due to the failure of the state government to furnish the 2019 figure on time. The other states that saw political reasons as motive for murder included Karnataka (9); Andhra Pradesh (7); and Bihar, Kerala and Jharkhand (6). In 2017, Jharkhand recorded the highest murders — 42 — for political reasons, which accounted for nearly 43% of the nationwide victims in this category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/230-killed-due-to-political-reasons-in-3-years-govt/articleshow/85023445.cms||---

The junior home minister, Nityanand Rai said that as per information received from the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), 100 deaths in police custody and 236 cases of torture during detention by cops were reported in 2020-21, down from 112 deaths and 411 instances of torture in police custody in 2019-20 and 136 deaths and 542 torture instances in 2018-19. The minister’s reply was to Sivaganga MP Karti Chidambaram’s question related to police violence against civilians while enforcing Covid lockdowns. Rai also said ‘police’ and ‘public order’ are state subjects as per the seventh schedule of the Constitution, with the responsibility of maintaining law and order, including investigation, registration and prosecution of crimes, conviction of accused, protection of life and property etc resting primarily with the respective state governments. Times ViewDeath in police custody is a matter of shame in any democracy. That there have been at least 100 such deaths in the past three years is a matter of extreme concern. Such deaths need to be investigated thoroughly and the offenders brought to justice, something that rarely happens. That’s the only way to discourage and reduce such cases.Regarding the sub-query, seeking details of action taken against the offending police officers behind custodial deaths and torture, the home ministry reiterated that ‘police’ and ‘public order’ being state subjects, “the state governments are empowered to deal with such offences which come to their notice as per the extant provisions of the law."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/348-killed-1189-tortured-in-custody-in-last-3-years-govt/articleshow/85023919.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||High court notice to former Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa, son & kin on graft plea||BENGALURU: The high court on Tuesday issued notice to former CM BS Yediyurappa, his son BY Vijayendra, former minister ST Somashekar and others in connection with a petition alleging corruption in a housing project. Social activist TJ Abraham, who filed the petition, challenged the July 8, 2021 order of the trial court rejecting his private complaint. Apart from restoration of his complaint, Abraham sought directions from the court to register an FIR and investigate Yediyurappa (then CM) and others, both under the Prevention of Corruption Act and various sections of IPC vis-a-vis various instances of corruption cited by him. Justice Sunil Dutt Yadav also ordered notice to Yediyurappa’s grandson Shashidhar Maradi, son-in-law Virupakshappa Yamakanmaradi, Sanjay Sree, son-in-law of Yediyurappa’s daughter Padmavathi, and businessman Chandrakanth Ramalingam among others. The petitioner argued that though the trial judge was convinced there was material to proceed against the accused named by him, the private complaint was rejected on the ground that the governor had refused sanction for prosecution under the anti-corruption Act. Now that Yediyurappa no longer holds the post of chief minister, it was argued, prior sanction from the governor is not necessary. Abraham alleged that Rs 12 crore was paid as bribe to revive a BDA housing project in favour of M/s Ramalingam Constructions Private Limited — revealed subsequently in a TV expose — and Rs 17.5 crore cash was collected on behalf of Yediyurappa by his family members. He filed the complaint with the Anti-Corruption Bureau on November 19, 2020. Two days later, a notice was issued to him, seeking originals of documents. He claimed though he offered clarification for the doubts raised, ACB sent an endorsement on December 15, closing the complaint submitted by him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-notice-to-bsy-son-kin-on-graft-plea/articleshow/85024096.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai set to induct 22 members into cabinet today||NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: After three days of hectic consultations with central party leaders, Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai is set to induct 22-24 members into his cabinet here on Wednesday, but question mark hangs over having deputy CMs in the team. Even as suspense continued over the names of candidates, a communication from the chief secretary’s office to Raj Bhavan said the oath-taking ceremony was scheduled for 2.15pm. Bommai told reporters in Delhi that the cabinet will be expanded in two phases. He said there were “detailed discussions on two candidates” and whether to have deputy CMs though such a move looks inevitable given the current political climate. The party will communicate its decision on the two candidates and deputy CMs by Wednesday morning. Ministers have been chosen keeping in mind the 2023 assembly elections. The CM said BS Yediyurappa is likely to hold discussions with party national president JP Nadda on cabinet expansion on Wedneday. Bommai will arrive in Bengaluru on an early-morning flight on Wednesday, making his stay in Delhi for cabinet talks longer than expected. Bommai took oath as chief minister on July 28 and since then, he has spent more time in Delhi than in Bengaluru. On Monday night, Bommai held detailed discussions with Nadda for close to an hour. Bommai said he had submitted “2-3 draft lists” and the party chief would finalise the names. On Tuesday, the CM is learned to have met Nadda thrice, going over the permutations and combinations. He finally secured the party chief ’s nod for the list of ministers late Tuesday night. Bommai had said on Monday the focus of the expansion would be on parity of regional representation and social justice. The main issue, say observers, is to balance the aspirations of the 8-10 new entrants and the old guard. The opposition has continued to pile pressure on Bommai, ridiculing his two trips to Delhi. “When BJP and the new CM are claiming everything is fine, why is he making so many trips to Delhi? This, at a time when the state is facing a Covid-19 crisis and floods,” said Karnataka Congress working president Eshwar Khandre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bommai-set-to-induct-22-into-cabinet-today/articleshow/85024102.cms||---

But with the UAE’s National Emergency and Crisis Management Authority tweeting on Tuesday that people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and holding valid residency permits will be allowed into UAE from Thursday, the long ordeal of expatriates may be over. The only option available was a quarantine package that involved travelling to another country which is under the green list of UAE, quarantine for 14 days and then enter UAE. However, this option was expensive: It was 10-15 times costlier than a oneway ticket, and there is also no guarantee that by the time expats finish their quarantine, the rules won’t change, barring their entry into UAE. As of now, the available options include chartered flights from India to UAE via Tashkent in Uzbekistan or through Armenia, and individual packages via Male in Maldives and Doha. All these options cost a minimum of Rs 1.3 lakh for double occupancy stay at the quarantined country, or upwards of Rs 1.7 lakh for single occupancy in a three-star or similar hotel. Travel industry sources said the quarantine packages started in the middle of May and are continuing even now. Though they do not have the exact numbers, travel agents here estimate that 700-800 people have travelled to the UAE, exercising these options. William D’Souza, MD, Globe Travels, said the only quarantine package available directly from Mangaluru is to Doha in Qatar, which costs upwards of Rs 2 lakh on double occupancy rates for a single person. Eulalia D’Souza of Lia Tours and Travels, said while chartered flight options start from Bengaluru, Kochi and New Delhi, only the Doha option is available directly from Mangaluru, and to the Maldives from Bengaluru. The price of the package includes meals (since the person cannot go outside), cost of visa, airport transfers and cost of RT-PCR test. In welcome news, UAE’s National Emergency and Crisis Management Authority posted on Twitter that travellers who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and hold valid residency permits will be allowed into the country from Thursday. Travellers need to apply for online entry permits prior to travelling, and need a negative RT-PCR test taken 48 hours prior to departure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/double-jabbed-residency-permit-holders-can-re-enter-uae-now/articleshow/85017958.cms||Stanley Pinto

Four girls from Chennai have top scored with 498 out of 500 marks. The toppers said the consistent performance in unit tests, mid-term tests and pre-board exams enabled them to score better. CBSE on Tuesday declared the Class X results, which were based on weightage to periodic tests/unit tests (10 marks), half-yearly exams/mid-term exams (30), pre-board exams (40) while computing theory marks. The remaining 20 marks were given to internal assessment and practicals. "I didn't take online classes lightly and did every assignment and test seriously. I was getting good marks throughout the year. The teachers were also very encouraging," said Dhriti Karnani from Bhavan's Rajaji Vidyashram in Kilpauk. She scored centum in maths, science, social science, Sanskrit and 98 in English. She wants to pursue MBA at an IIM and joined commerce stream in Class XI. Three students from Chennai Public School in Thirumazhisai -- R Dhanvanyaa, Dhaksha Kalidoss and Jyositha N -- scored 498 out of 500. Jyositha N scored 100 marks in maths, social science and English and 99 in Tamil and English. "Due to the lockdown and remote mode of learning, I felt I had a lot of time to study. I got time to revise my concepts better and practice the questions," she said. She is preparing for the NEET and has selected a biology-math group. Dhaksha Kalidoss said she wanted to pursue aerospace engineering. R Dhanvanyaa is interested in astrophysics and plans to prepare for JEE. Chitrakala Ramachandran, principal of Chennai Public School in Thriumazhisai, said the school recorded every activity and assessed every child from the beginning. K Manoharan, principal of SBOA School and Junior College in Anna Nagar, said 90% of the students from his school passed with distinction. "The number of students passing with distinction has slightly increased in our school compared to previous year," he said. Two students from the school, Rahul Malaikani and J Joshima Getsia, scored 497 out of 500. Modern Senior Secondary School in Nanganallur had 10 centums in maths and eight centums in social science this year. "Of 209 students who appeared from our school, 23 students have scored above 475 marks out of 500," said L Padmavathy, principal of the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/four-girls-from-city-score-498-out-of-500-marks-in-class-x/articleshow/85020149.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Shivananda Circle steel flyover to be ready by month-end||By: Pavan Kumar Pateel BENGALURU: After seeing three governments and as many chief ministers besides four mayors, the steel flyover at Shivananda Circle will be ready by August-end. Currently, 85% of work on the 493-metre-long flyover is over. While all girders have been erected, one slab is being cast and the up and down ramps are being built. Fifteen of the 16 pillars are ready. According to BBMP officials, a 700mm water pipeline that had to be shifted delayed work on the 16th pillar. The road needs to be repaired on both sides of the flyover. After that’s done, it will be opened to the public in a phased manner, officials said. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta inspected the project progress on Monday. “It was delayed for multiple reasons. Water and sewer pipes had to be shifted, which took close to three months. Initially, the project was under litigation and later the flyover length was increased. Approval for the revised project cost took time. However, the work will be completed in a month,” Gupta told TOI. The flyover was initially meant to be 326-metre long. With the increased length and the delay, project cost shot up from Rs 19.8 crore to Rs 39.5 crore. Congress functionary Padmavathi G, who was Bengaluru mayor when the foundation stone was laid in 2017, blamed officers’ negligence for the delay. “We did get enough funds to complete the project in time. Though the court resolved the issue, officers did not show much interest,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/shivananda-circle-steel-flyover-to-be-ready-by-month-end/articleshow/85017301.cms||---
---||Business||Voda Idea lenders fret over ‘too big to fail’ telco giant||MUMBAI: A day after Kumar Mangalam Birla’s letter warning that Vodafone Idea (VIL) may reach an “irretrievable point of collapse” became public, banks are worried about the fate of the telecom major which, they say, is “too big to fail”. Lenders both Indian and global have an exposure of Rs 1.8 lakh crore. A large part of this is in the form of guarantees. Some private lenders with a funded exposure have already started making provisions. However, the bulk of the exposure is with public sector banks. If Vodafone fails to repay its dues to the government and these guarantees are invoked, it would immediately turn into debt and would soon be classified as a non-performing asset. The hit on PSU banks will not be as large as their exposure because in recent years, lenders have been demanding a substantially higher cash margin from Vodafone for their guarantees. IDBI Bank is understood to have up to 40% margins for the guarantees it has extended. But even then it will be large enough to wipe out profits for many. For banks, recovery of debt is contingent on VIL remaining operational and retaining customers. While the company continues to have close to a fourth of the Indian market, its situation could change overnight if there is a default. According to bankers, the insolvency process can work only when there are buyers. In the case of Vodafone, the Rs 53,000-crore AGR (adjusted gross revenue) dues to the Centre are a deterrent. This is despite Birla being willing to write down his entire equity. The government dues cannot be avoided as the Centre cannot make an exception for one company. Even in insolvency cases, the department of telecom has claimed its dues to be that of a financial creditor although there have been attempts to mark them as operational creditors. The uncertainty over DoT’s claims, which is already being experienced by lenders in the Reliance Communication insolvency case, would makes telecom resolutions a challenge. Lenders do not want to risk insolvency as this would result in the exit of customers which was the case with Reliance Communications. Lenders say besides the company’s debt obligations being equal to 1.5% of the banking sector’s credit, VIL is a large telecom infrastructure provider. Several business applications run on their networks and the company is one of the largest providers of “internet of things” service. A bank executive told TOI that insolvency would be a worst-case scenario as there is a risk of operations getting disrupted and customers migrating. This was the case with Reliance Communications. Vodafone, which holds 44.4% in VIL, has made it clear that it will not invest additional funds in India. Responding to an analyst query, Vodafone chief executive Nick Read had said that India is a question for Vodafone Idea. “We, as a group, try to provide them as much practical support as we can. But I want to make it very clear, we are not putting any additional equity into India,” he said. Not investing any more: VodafoneVodafone global CEO Nick Read had said they will not infuse any more equity in the joint venture, when asked at an analyst call on July 23 about the troubles in Vodafone Idea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/voda-idea-lenders-fret-over-too-big-to-fail-telco-giant/articleshow/85024446.cms||Mayur Shetty

As a result, the sensex rallied 873 points or 1.7% to close at 53,823, while the Nifty closed at 16,131 points, up 256 points or 1.6%. The strong buying in the market also pushed investors’ wealth to a new peak with BSE’s market capitalization now at Rs 242 lakh crore, or about $3.3 trillion. The day’s rally was largely driven by large caps, while mid- and small-caps stocks underperformed, a note by domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. In contrast to smart gains in benchmark indices, the Nifty midcap 100 Index was flat, while Nifty smallcap index closed -0.2% lower. Of the 30 sensex constituents, 27 closed with gains, while just three NTPC, Tata Steel and Bajaj Auto closed in the red. Although a section in the market is cautious since the rally is yet to be supported by strong economic fundamentals, in the medium term the up move is expected to sustain. According to Amar Ambani, Senior President & Research Head, Yes Securities, the broking house maintains its Nifty target of 18,000 points by December 2021. “Corporate balance sheets have been significantly strengthened with record equity raise in FY21. On the revenue front, the listed universe is on firm ground with accelerated trend of unorganized to organized, digital super-cycle and sustained cost management,” he said. “We expect the government to continue spending on infrastructure and fast track the reform agenda as we have seen with lowered corporate tax rates, PLI schemes, RBI (liquidity) support and strategic divestments. With accommodative financial conditions worldwide, we see the mega rally in risk assets to continue,” Ambani said. On the other side, there are people who are cautious. There are at least three factors bothering marketmen, a dealer with a local brokerage said. For one, the rising Covid-19 cases around the world and its likely impact on global trade & economies is a cause for concern. In India, the rising interest rate with the benchmark yield on 10-year at 6.20%, up from 6.10% a month ago, is also a spot of bother. Lastly, the continuing foreign fund selling is also keeping people on the watch-out mode. In July, after recording a Rs 11,300-crore net outflow from stocks, the numbers are marginally positive for the current month, CDSL and BSE data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-nears-54k-as-lockdown-rules-eased/articleshow/85024530.cms||---

A case was also lodged with SK Puri police station in this connection. Assistant drug controller of Patna, Vishwajeet Dasgupta, said on Tuesday that small medical stores running in residential areas and those attached to private clinics or nursing homes were under scanner. The action was taken following the Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh’s order on a complaint by Dighwara block development officer (BDO), who was given an injection purchased from that medical shop as part of the treatment for his gall bladder problems. Within minutes of leaving the clinic premises, he felt uneasiness and came back to the clinic where he found that he had been administered an expired medicine. He contacted the DM, who directed SDO, Patna Sadar, Dhananjay Kumar and three drug inspectors to raid the medical store. Dasgupta said physician’s samples seized by the team would also be examined for their quality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expired-drugs-seized-from-medical-store-in-patna/articleshow/85015164.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Ahmedabad||New-onset diabetes in Covid biggest risk factor for black fungus: Study||AHMEDABAD: Diabetes was the undisputed, most significant risk factor for deadly mucormycosis that plagued Covid-19 patients in the lethal second wave. Interim analysis of a local case control study of black fungus has now revealed that new onset of diabetes was found to be a far more significant risk factor than pre-existing diabetes as well! A study of 300 subjects, which include 234 Covid-19 patients and 64 mucormycosis patients with history of Covid-19, was conducted at Sterling Hospital post second wave to understand the risk factors for mucormycosis in Covid-19 patients. “The biggest takeaway of the interim analysis of the study is that patients in whom diabetes was unmasked during Covid-19 illness had a significantly higher probability of getting black fungus than patients who had a known past history of diabetes,” said infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel. He is member of Gujarat Covid-19 task force and one of 30-authors of the global recommendations for mucormycosis treatment. Experts say that nearly 25% Covid-19 patients were detected with new onset diabetes in the state. This includes Covid-19 induced diabetes triggered by severe pancreatic inflammation, stress, steroid treatment or unknown diabetes detected during pandemic illness. “Other important findings revealed by the interim analysis include that steroids, tocilizumab and even oxygen were not significant risk factors,” said Dr Patel. Dr Patel said probability value of new onset diabetes for black fungus was found to be less than 0.001 while that of diabetes was less than 0.156. Here, lower the probability value means higher risk factor. In fact, p-value lower than 0.05 is considered significant. “New onset diabetes in Covid-19 as a risk factor will now be studied in 1,000 MM patients across 29 centres across India to give better prevention, intervention and treatment guides for future cases especially during the pandemic,” said Dr Patel. The findings are significant as estimated 25% black fungus patients had history of new onset diabetes during Covid-19. Dr Bela Prajapati, professor and head of the ENT department at Civil Hospital, said of 819 mucormycosis patients treated in past two months, 192 or 23% recorded no prior history of diabetes. “These patients acquired blood sugar after their Covid-19 infection,” she said. Likewise, at Sola Civil Hospital, the figure of such patients was about 25-30%, said Dr Neena Bhalodia, head of the ENT department. “After the second wave of the pandemic, several young patients who had tested diabetic. Covid-19 and it’s treatment may have been responsible as steroids used in the treatment spiked blood sugar,” she said. Dr Neeraj Suri, ENT surgeon at Gandhinagar Civil Hospital, said that not all patients who tested diabetic after Covid-19 had mucormycosis. “The fungal infection was a sum of several factors including age, severity, and comorbidities among others. Some mucormycosis patients didn’t even have diabetes even as they had recovered from Covid. But the presence of blood sugar surely played a big role in the prevalence of fungal infection that fed off the sugar,” she said. Dr Bela Prajapati, professor and head of the ENT department at Civil Hospital, said that they had seen 819 mucormycosis patients over a course of two months. “Out of total, 192 or 23% of the patients were such where there was no prior history of diabetes. These patients acquired blood sugar after their Covid-19 infection,” she said. Likewise, at Sola Civil Hospital, the figure of such patients was about 25-30%, said Dr Neena Bhalodia, head of the ENT department. “After the second wave of the pandemic, we saw several young patients who had tested diabetic. The treatment of Covid was partially responsible as steroids used in the treatment spiked blood sugar,” she said.

Dr Rajesh Vishwakarma, a city-based ENT surgeon, said that not all patients of mucormycosis had diabetes only after Covid-19. “It is also possible that the patients might have borderline diabetes which got aggravated due to Covid-19 and got detected as part of the medical reports,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/study-new-onset-diabetes-in-covid-biggest-risk-factor-for-black-fungus/articleshow/85020468.cms||Radha Sharma

Veteran all-rounder Bipul Sharma and his spin twin Gurinder Singh, along with middle order batsman Ankit Kaushik and medium pacer Jaskaran Buttar missed the trials, which were conducted under the supervision of UTCA - manager operations Manjit Singh said on Tuesday. All three selectors - Sanjay Dhull, Vineet Jain and Gurendra Singh were present on the occasion. While Gurinder is playing in England, Jaskaran has been plying his trade in Canada while Ankit and Bipul are in the US, playing for their respective sides. The quartet, however, won’t be required to feature in the trials and are expected to gain automatic entry into the squad. “All the four players have taken due permission from the UTCA to play overseas cricket, since it was difficult to play in the country considering the second wave of Covid-19 situation. But there was one condition when permission was granted, we wanted them to keep us regularly updated on their performances for their respective sides,” Manjit Singh told TOI. Manjit added that UTCA wanted to keep their teams ready for the upcoming season and despite the monsoon affecting smooth conduct of trials, they were working on getting the best possible combinations. “Since the BCCI announced the itinerary for the domestic season a few weeks back, it was very difficult to conduct trials during the monsoon, so, the UTCA decided to hold it in phases. We conducted the first phase last month, but the rains forced us to change the venue,” he said. The trials were conducted in three phases, with the first phase held on July 10 at the Cricket Stadium in Sector 16. Due to poor weather conditions, the trials had to be postponed for Tuesday, wherein the remaining two phases were conducted before and after lunch. The second and third phases were held at the Tricity Indoor Cricket Academy, Peermuchalla in Zirakpur. UTCA president Sanjay Tandon said that around 120 applications were received for the senior team trials and everyone was invited to showcase their talent. A total of 97 players turned up during the trials. Trials for all categories of girls will be conducted on Wednesday, after which trials of remaining categories of boys would be announced. Coaches, support staff appointments next week The UTCA has almost finalised candidates for coaches and support staff, including a new set of selectors, and could likely make an announcement about it by next week. TOI had reported on July 11 that the UTCA had invited fresh applications for support staff, including coaches and selection panel. “It is in the final stages, we are likely to make the appointments by next week. It will help build team composition. The new set of selectors and coaches will get enough time to get a hang of their new roles before the start of the season,” Singh said. This time, BCCI has announced the domestic schedule with the Ranji Trophy returning to the itinerary, after the tournament was cancelled last season due to the pandemic. Besides the traditional four-day meet, the board will also conduct the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament, the Vijay Hazare one dayers apart from women’s one day league, women’s one day challenger trophy and women’s T-20 league along with the junior tournaments. In the truncated 2020-21 domestic season, the Chandigarh men’s team played the Vijay Hazare one-dayers in March early this year. Placed in the Elite Group for the first time in the 50-over games, the Manan Vohra-led team narrowly missed entering the knock-out stage with a second-place finish in their group. In January, the Chandigarh team had played the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tourney, where luck again evaded them as they narrowly missed the cut for the knockouts despite winning four successive games after their opener was washed out. Meanwhile, with the women’s one day league in September kick-starting the season, Chandigarh girls are also fine-tuning their skills and are keen to get into the thick of the action after being indoors since the senior women’s one dayers in March due to the second wave of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/four-key-players-miss-senior-utca-mens-trials/articleshow/85018081.cms||Tridib Baparnash

Lenders, both Indian and global, have an exposure of Rs 1.8 lakh crore. A large part of this is in the form of guarantees. Some private lenders with a funded exposure have already started making provisions. However, the bulk of the exposure is to public sector banks. If VIL fails to repay its dues to the government and these guarantees are invoked, it would immediately turn into debt and would soon be classified as a non-performing asset (NPA). The hit on public sector banks will not be as large as their exposure because in recent years, lenders have been demanding a substantially higher cash margin from Vodafone for their guarantees. IDBI Bank is understood to have up to 40% margins for the guarantees it has extended. But even then it will be large enough to wipe out profits for many. For banks, recovery of debt is contingent on VIL remaining operational and retaining customers. While the company continues to have close to a fourth of the Indian market, its situation could change overnight if there is a default. According to bankers, the insolvency process can work only when there are buyers. In the case of VIL, the Rs 53,000-crore AGR (adjusted gross revenue) dues to the Centre are a deterrent. This is despite Birla being willing to write down his entire equity. The government dues cannot be avoided as the Centre cannot make an exception for one company. Even in insolvency cases, the telecom department has claimed its dues to be that of a financial creditor although there have been attempts to mark them as operational creditors. The uncertainty over telecom department’s claims, which is already being experienced by lenders in the Reliance Communication insolvency case, would makes telecom resolutions a challenge. Lenders do not want to risk insolvency as this would result in the exit of customers which was the case with RCom. Lenders say besides the company’s debt obligations being equal to 1.5% of the banking sector’s credit, VIL is a large telecom infrastructure provider. Several business applications run on their networks and the company is one of the largest providers of “internet of things” service. A bank executive said insolvency would be a worst-case scenario as there is a risk of operations getting disrupted and customers migrating. This was the case with Reliance Communications. Vodafone, which holds 44.4% in VIL, has made it clear that it will not invest additional funds in India. Responding to an analyst query, Vodafone chief executive Nick Read had said that India is a question for Vodafone Idea. “We, as a group, try to provide them as much practical support as we can. But I want to make it very clear, we are not putting any additional equity into India,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/voda-idea-lenders-fret-over-too-big-to-fail-telco-giant/articleshow/85023239.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Business||Most hiring by top cos came from 3 IT cos and 5 private banks||Mumbai: There is another pointer to consolidation in the corporate sector during the lockdown. Three IT giants and five private banks accounted for the bulk of the hirings by listed companies in FY21. Without these seven companies, overall hiring by listed companies would have seen a decline. According to an analysis by Care ratings of the 423 companies that have published their annual reports so far, there was a very modest increase in employment by 1.6% in 2020-21 compared with 4.5% in 2019-20. “While it is lower, prima facie, the number gives a positive signal on employment. In terms of the net increase in employment, it was just 56,054. This was with an increase of 1.08 lakh jobs in the 11 industry groups and a decrease of 52,813 in the other 18 sectors,” the report said. Within banks, 5 private banks (Axis, Kotak, AU Small Finance, Bandhan and HDFC Bank) together added around 24,000 jobs. In the IT space, three companies, Infosys, TCS and Wipro added around 70,000 jobs. Of the 1.08 lakh jobs added 69% came from IT, 13.5% from banks and 12% from healthcare. While banks were large employers in absolute terms, in terms of growth rate the top three sectors were healthcare (7.4%), IT (6.8%) and logistics (2.7%). The biggest losers in employment were hospitality (-14.4%), trading (-12.3%) and Crude Oil (-10.5%). The increase in healthcare sector hirings was a direct outcome of the pandemic as the focus shifted to healthcare. The IT sector grew despite the lockdown, supported by the shift to digital and as offshoring to India continued. Logistics was boosted by the growth of e-commerce as the pandemic and the lockdown increased dependence on online purchases. In 2020-21, 235 of these companies, which is around 56% of the sample had witnessed a decrease in headcount with the job loss being 103,208. 175 companies that added to the headcount by 1,59,262 thus leading to a net increase of 56,054. The top 10 companies added 1.12 lakh jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/most-hiring-by-top-cos-came-from-3-it-cos-and-5-private-banks/articleshow/85023543.cms||Mayur Shetty

He has scored perfect 100 in mathematics and social science, 99 in English and Hindi and 98 in science. Gaurav said he was satisfied with his marks, but would have preferred to write papers. “I am quite relieved as the marks have been given on the basis of our overall performance throughout the year,” Gaurav said, adding he wants to become a lawyer and have already started preparing for the CLAT. Among few students who have scored above 99%, 17 are from Litera Valley School – Abhinav Ayush, Binayak Raj, Khyati Sinha, Piyush Raj, Anshika Raj, Praket Priya, Shiwangi Shreya, Durgesh Tewary, Mayank Modi, Anubhuti Singh, Kalash, Nihal Singh, Ritvik Ravi, Shambhavi Shree, Shashwat Suman, Shlok Shankar and Sneha Singh.

---||Patna||Nitish Kumar is close to my heart, says Lalu Prasad Yadav||PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Tuesday made a heavily loaded political statement that chief minister Nitish Kumar occupies a place in his heart. “Nitish Kumar hamare dil mein hain,” Lalu said a day after Nitish supported the demand for a probe into Pegasus snooping allegations. “Rishte to bante bigarte rahte hain. Aur humlog to saath mein rehen hain (relationships make or break depending on the situation, but we have worked together),” Lalu told reporters after meeting former union minister Sharad Yadav at his residence in Delhi. He, however, parried questions on any likely truce between the RJD and the JD(U) in near future. JD(U) is a BJP ally in the state as well as at the Centre. Lalu’s statement assumes significance as his son and leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, met Nitish on July 30 and requested him to seek time from PM Narendra Modi to meet him with a delegation for demanding caste census in the country. Nitish not only accepted his demand but also his party JD(U) passed a resolution at its national executive meeting in Delhi in favour of a caste census and against any coercive law for birth control, as the one drafted by the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. In response to a query, Lalu said efforts were on to bring all the members of erstwhile ‘Janta pariwar’ (read Janata Dal) under one umbrella. He also advocated for a ‘third front’ to provide an alternative to the people against BJP in the country. “The exercise is already underway,” he revealed. Lalu had met UP’s former chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh Yadav on Monday before his meeting with NCP leader Sharad Powar. Lalu also hinted at a likely political understanding between Tejashwi and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan. He said what happened with Chirag recently made him a political leader. “Chahe jo bhi hua ho uske saath, wah ek leader ho gaya,” he said, rferring to the split in LJP. He wished both the young leaders should work together. However, Chirag said Lalu ji had “madhur sambandh (cordial relations) with my father and political mentor Ram Vilas Paswan. I thank him for lending credence to my leadership. But, my current priority is the ongoing ashirwad yatra”. The BJP, however, took a strong exception to Lalu’s recent activities and urged the CBI to look into the matter. “The CBI should take notice of Lalu Prasad’s political activities as he has been granted bail in a fodder scam case on health grounds,” BJP Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi tweeted. Meanwhile, RJD Mahua MLA Mukesh Kumar Raushan’s statement that the NDA government in Bihar will collapse the day Lalu visits Patna has generated much political heat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-is-close-to-my-heart-says-lalu/articleshow/85016654.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||World won’t stop if you take regular breaks from office||By M MuneerLike it or not, the pandemic-interrupted career progress and job pressures will not change anytime soon. Whether work-from-home (WFH) or hybrid, the demands on your time and skills will likely increase, and more top talent will be vying to embrace the few new roles. A recent survey of pan-India executives revealed the majority has experienced obvious signs of the stress of demanding jobs. These include difficulty in finding personal time & relaxation, stretched work hours & unfinished tasks, feeling of helplessness, and weakening physical & mental health. Managing stress is a skill too few senior leaders can display. It is not enough that you can manage stress at work — you need to be able to display the same to the leadership team and that matters. The skill to acquire for the current times is the ability to prove how well you can manage work pressures and deliver productive results effortlessly. Here are a few thoughts on how you can create an impression as a great handler of work demands and recast your career progress… * Focus on the ‘jobs to be done’: Do this whether locked down or not. The level of stress will differ on days of lockdown and otherwise, but staying focused on the to-do list will take you far in your effectiveness and delivery of responsibilities. * Lend and seek help with work: Since the majority is struggling with the situation, you will always find a few colleagues who will need assistance. If you can help them complete their tasks, that will put you on a pedestal as a leader. At the same time, seek help from them if you need it. The objective is to get things done for the company, and as a team the delivery must happen. That will vouch for your readiness for demanding roles. * Let out steam, unseen: Find avenues to do this when under pressure. The skill is in being able to hold off on your responsibilities and almost akin to masking your fear of the neighbour’s pet dog. Whatever be the demands at work, don’t let the stress show on your behaviour with colleagues. As a colleague mentioned, leave a punch bag in the cafeteria to vent. * Step back, assess reality, clear the fog: When your team is stressed and off-target, sparks are likely to fly even in remote work situations. Disagreements and ego tussles should not come in the way of work to be done. Diffuse the situation and negative thinking by focusing on the positive, post-pandemic growth — economically and for own career. Step sway from potentially inflammable situations, think of the best resolution and carry the team together. * Volunteer to lead special initiatives: Complexity of problems and growth issues currently warrant special projects, and this is beyond the call of duty. Take part in some such initiatives that are growth-driven or cost-optimisers. Volunteering to find time for such activities will project your ability to not only break out of comfort zones but also work under pressure. * Break herd mentality in taking breaks: The earth won’t shatter if you take regular breaks, if not your annual vacation. Short breaks over long weekends are probably better than long ones in managing work stress. Demonstrate your leadership qualities by delegating work in your absence and show things could be accomplished even in your absence. Insecure leaders shy away from this. * Avoid all types of addiction: If you try to combat work stress with energy drinks and caffeine, that won’t help in the long run. Quality sleep and healthy food must replace coffee and drinks. Since, once addicted, those can cause myriad issues, including migraine and acidity, adding more to your work stress. Remember, more work is also addictive. * Keep your cool, come what may: It’s difficult for most people to remain calm under mounting disruptions from supply chain issues to inaccessible team members. However, you can practise this skill and improve it. This is a great quality that will help in getting recognised for larger roles. As the pandemic will continue to bring in new business challenges, enterprises will look at executives who can get ‘jobs done’ for their customers. Career progress will then depend on some of these skills.

The BMC collects beautification cess from housing societies and properties that have water ponds, water fountains and other landscaping with water components. The proposal to hike the beautification cess by 5% was moved by the BMC administration and will be placed before the standing committee on Wednesday. According to officials, all housing societies or properties that have a swimming pool, ponds or water fountains have to take permission from the BMC’s Pest Control Officer (PCO). The PCO collects an annual fee from these properties. “This beautification cess has not been hiked for many years. From the current, Rs 6,000 per year and a deposit of Rs 20,000, the cess will go up to Rs 6,300 and the deposit will rise up to Rs 21,000. So this is only a marginal hike. The BMC will earn some more revenue from this,” the official said. The opposition BJP said the increase should be deferred as people are already reeling with income shortage due to Covid-19 lockdowns. “The BMC must not impose any hikes even if it is marginal. People don’t have money to pay maintenance bills and at such a time proposing a hike is unfair,” said BJP Corporator Vinod Mishra. The standing committee in June ‘rejected’ the BMC’s proposal to increase property tax by around 14%. With stern opposition from the BJP and the Congress, the Shiv Sena moved a motion to record the proposal, which was cleared by the standing committee. The BMC wanted to increase property tax rates by 14% by proposing to calculate it on the basis of the new Ready Reckoner (RR) rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-now-wants-beautification-cess-to-go-up-5/articleshow/85020479.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Accompanied by state’s education and parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and some senior officials, the CM began his inspection tour from Patna district. After assessing situation in some pockets in the state capital, the CM’s cavalcade reached Vaishali district via Mahatma Gandhi Setu over river Ganga. After observing situation in Hajipur town and its neighbouring areas, the CM’s cavalcade proceeded towards Samastipur town via Musrigharari. During his rapid tour, the CM tried to assess whether people were inclined to wear masks to save them from Covid pandemic. He also assessed whether social distancing norm was being maintained or not. From Samastipur, the CM went to Muzaffarpur district. From there, he went to Saran district via Rewa Ghat. From Saran district, the CM returned Patna via Garkha, Dariyapur and Sonepur.

He recently resumed duty in the same company where he was working earlier, which has come as a welcome relief for his friends and colleagues. A raging bull had ripped apart the right side of his face with its horn and Bishnoi remembers waking up four days later in a Delhi hospital. No one gave Bishnoi any chance at survival.“Nothing has changed in my life except that I have become even more careful while stepping out of the house due to my medical condition to avoid any risk of getting infected with Covid. I love travelling a lot and I like driving my car,” said Bishnoi. Recalling the incident, Bishnoi said when he and his friend reached near Kolayat at 9.30pm on that fateful day, a bull came charging and tore his face with the horn. Such was the intensity of the attack that the horn not only plunged into his face, but went right up to his brain literally scooping his right eye and leaving his right side face nose and lips and scalp in tatters.“Doctor Sunil Chaudhary of Max Saket has given me new face,” he said. The doctors repaired the brain membrane with a patch of scalp layer called pericranium, missing skull bone was repaired by splitting his right skull bone and using the outer bone. Rib cartilage was used to make framework of his nose and smile restoration was done using fascia and muscle transplant. “It has been a long journey of recovery in which my sister Kiran, my friends Pankaj, Sumit, Sourab, Deepak and Ashok helped me by kept motivating me, while managing director Deepak Aggarwal of the company, where I am working, helped me to airlift from Bikaner to Delhi for treatment. In such a medical condition, saving life is quite difficult,” said Bishnoi. He has undergone a series of major and minor surgeries over time. Though his life has been saved, he lost one of the eyes. Bishnoi is now handling sales and operations of the company in five states/UTs including Punjab, Himachal, J& K, Chandigarh and Odisha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bikaner-man-who-underwent-face-restoration-op-rejoins-same-job/articleshow/85022689.cms||---
---||Business||No error of judgment in sale of HFC arm to Carlyle: PNB||Mumbai: Punjab National Bank MD & CEO S S Mallikarjuna Rao said on Tuesday that there was “no error of judgment” concerning the decision to issue preferential shares to private equity firm Carlyle and other investors. Rao, however, added that PNB agrees that its housing finance subsidiary should adopt Sebi’s ICDR (issue of capital and disclosure requirement) norms for pricing of the preferential issue. The preferential issue had turned controversial after the share price doubled post the issue and questions were raised about the pricing. Rao said “when we took the decision.. none of us thought the price would increase so high in the subsequent days. So, there was no error of judgment.” He pointed out that for nearly two-and-a-half years, the share price had been languishing and the bank did not get investors who were willing to participate in an issue where the bank could not pick up a stake. Rao said that PNB could not meet the capital needs of the housing finance company as RBI norms required the bank to bring down its stake. Rao, however, refused to divulge whether the bank had voted in favour of the preferential issue, stating that the matter was sub-judice. Sebi had sought to stall the shareholder meeting, citing the ICDR norms for pricing, but PNB Housing went ahead with the voting following an order by Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT.) While SAT allowed the shareholders to vote, it said the outcome be kept in abeyance until the matter is disposed of. In the meantime, PNB also wrote to its arm to reconsider the subsidiary board-approved pricing. Rao said that after receiving a copy of the Sebi order, the matter was discussed by the bank board. The board decided to ask the subsidiary to adhere to Sebi norms. Rao also denied charges that there was a conflict of interest concerning some board members of PNB Housing Finance, who had links with Carlyle. “If there is any incidental linkage because of them having been a director of any company, we should not be discounting their quality and capability,” he said. Earlier, presenting the bank’s financial results for the first quarter, Rao said that the bank is expecting its net profit for the current year to more than triple to Rs 6,000 crore powered by write-back of provisions toward bad loans and reduction in cost of funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-error-of-judgment-in-sale-of-hfc-arm-to-carlyle-pnb/articleshow/85023327.cms||Mayur Shetty

However, the state water resources department (WRD) maintained that the damage caused is not serious. The Patna-protection ring bund was constructed after the 1975 floods to protect the city from the floodwaters of the Punpun river. Later, a road was constructed on it. “Unlike the north Bihar rivers, there are no embankments in south Bihar. If at all, there are only zamindari bunds. Therefore, one cannot say that any damage has been caused to an embankment in south Bihar. The ring bund is merely a protection bund meant to ward off the rushing floodwater,” a WRD source said. Meanwhile, the Ganga was flowing 1.80 metres below the danger level at Buxar on the west, but it was flowing slightly above the danger level at Gandhi Ghat in Patna and Hathidah. Otherwise, all along its downstream from Munger to Kahalgaon, the river was flowing below the danger level on Tuesday. The water discharge through the Birpur barrage across Kosi in Supaul district and through the Valmiki Nagar barrage across Gandak kept on fluctuating all through the day on Tuesday. All other rivers like Bagmati, Burhi Gandak and Mahananda were also flowing below the danger level. Only Punpun and Kamla were flowing above the danger level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/small-rivers-in-spate-in-south-bihar-districts/articleshow/85016319.cms||Abhay Singh

Chandra also said he will be starting a new venture in the digital video space “without getting into any conflicts with Zee Entertainment Enterprises (Zee)”. Chandra founded Zee, a pioneer in private broadcasting in India, in 1992 but 27 years later, had to sell his holdings in the flagship to pare his financial liabilities. Chandra currently owns 4% in Zee, which had a market value of Rs 19,609 crore on Tuesday. In an open letter, Chandra said: “We have come out of the financial stress by settling 91.2% of our total debt to 43 lenders in 110 accounts. We are making all the efforts to settle the remaining 8.8%.” He added, “I have no regrets for parting with a substantial ownership in the business and specially in the ‘jewels of the crown’. This was done to keep the family’s honour.” Chandra landed in difficulties due to aggressive bets made in infrastructure. The after-effect of the liquidity crisis triggered from the collapse of IL&FS also worsened his situation. He then sold his interests in infrastructure, financial services and print media. His other companies, Zee Learn, SITI Networks and Zee Media Corporation are currently facing a shortage of capital. Chandra’s letter comes more than two and a half years after an admission of tactical mistakes that led to a default on loans and swelled his debt to Rs 11,000 crore. Following repayments, debt has reduced to Rs 968 crore. Chandra, however, remains in dispute with one lender. “The issue is pending in the court for determination,” he wrote. On his new innings, Chandra said: “I have earned a fair experience in the video business. Hence, I am exploring new opportunities in the video in digital space as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning in the video space, without getting into any conflicts with Zee, in any manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/settled-over-90-debt-zees-chandra/articleshow/85023498.cms||Reeba Zachariah

However, according to National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5), Bihar has witnessed a drop in this category. According to the World Health Organisation, provision of mother’s breast milk to the infant within one hour of birth is referred to as early initiation of breastfeeding and this ensures that the infant receives the colostrum, or first milk rich in protective factors. As per NFHS-4 data, early initiation of breastfeeding within an hour was 34.5% in Bihar, which came down to 31.1% in NFHS-5. The state is also lagging behind national average by 10.9% in early initiation of breastfeeding, which means on an average, 42% newborns were breastfed across the country. Altogether, 22 states and Union territories were surveyed and Bihar was at the second from the bottom. However, Bihar has shown improvement in terms of exclusive breastfeeding. From 53.4% in NFHS-4, it has increased to 58.9% in NHSF-5. The state, though, is lagging behind the national average even in this category. As per NFHS-5, exclusive breastfeeding for the country was 61.96%. What is surprising is that even though the state has witnessed an increase in institutional delivery, the percentage of early initiation has dropped. Unicef communication specialist (Bihar), Nipurnh Gupta said this trend was worrying. As per NFHS-4, institutional delivery in Bihar was 63.8%, which increased to 76.2% in NHFS-5. “With increase in the institutional delivery, early initiation of breastfeeding could also be increased with little counselling of the health workers as well as the mother and her family who come for delivery,” Gupta said. She cited several reasons for drop in early initiation, including social misconception as many people consider first milk as unfit and dirty for infants. “Few people give honey to newborns and others wait for rituals to be carried out first before giving the mother’s first milk to the child,” Gupta added. Unicef nutrition specialist Rabi Narayan Parhi said the most important thing behind breastfeeding within an hour was colostrum present in the milk which has all protective factors. “Giving honey, water or substitute milk could lead to infection and even death. In breastfeeding, there is skin to skin contact between the newborn and mother, which generates natural temperature. This reduces the chances of hypothermia in children who were staying at a particular temperature in their mother’s womb,” Parhi added. He stressed on the need for awareness and efforts to be made by the service providers. Talking about the drop in percentage of early initiation as per NFHS-5, a health department official said they were working in this area and have targeted to take the figure to 80%. He added of 36 district hospitals in Bihar, 14 have been made bottle-free. “The rest of the hospitals will also be made bottle-free in two years,” he added. Even state health minister Mangal Pandey had on Sunday said the state was observing Breastfeeding Week from August 1 to 7 to create awareness in this regard. Around 92,000 Asha workers and 26,000 GNMs and ANMs have been roped in to create awareness about breastfeeding and early initiation among lactating and pregnant women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/early-initiation-of-breastfeeding-records-3-drop-in-bihar-nfhs-5/articleshow/85014985.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Business||IOB’s quarterly profits more than double||Chennai: State owned Indian Overseas Bank saw 17 fraud cases involving Rs 115.42 crore during the quarter ended June 30, for which it holds 100% provision. “This is mainly because of legacy frauds,” said its MD & CEO Partha Pratim Sengupta. This is lower than Rs 1,207 crore worth frauds reported in the same period a year ago. The PSU bank’s Q1 net profit has more than doubled to Rs 327 crore, from Rs 121 crore in the same period last year, due to lower provisioning and lower bad loans. During the quarter gross NPA (non-performing assets) ratio has improved to 11.5% from 13.9% YoY and 11.7% sequentially. The provision coverage ratio stood at 91.6%. Slippages stood at Rs 1,158 crore in this quarter. About Rs 1,125 crore cash recovery has been made in the first quarter (of the target set of Rs 4,300 crore for the entire year of recovery), as against Rs 275 crore recovery made in the same period last year. NPA sales to ARCs for this quarter stands at Rs 23.2 crore, on the back of good cash recovery. IOB has made restructuring of accounts amounting to Rs 4,300 crore. Gross Advances increased to Rs 1,38,944 crore as on June 30, 2021, as against Rs 1,31,565 crore as on June 30, 2020. The Bank said it has evolved a policy of not taking fresh exposures in stressed sectors, below hurdle rated accounts and BB and below rated accounts. It has exited from accounts in the stressed sectors due to improving the quality of assets. We have identified NPAs amounting to Rs 1,680 crore to sell to bad bank in the first phase, he said. Shares of IOB ended 2.9% lower at Rs 23.5 apiece on BSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/iobs-quarterly-profits-more-than-double/articleshow/85018100.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Using salt? You are taking a pinch of plastic||AHMEDABAD: When you season your food with salt, chances are that you are sprinkling plastic on it — an infinitesimal bit of a bag, a cup, or cutlery. Researchers have found microplastics in table salt, a ubiquitous meal ingredient, thus suggesting that Gujarat’s addiction to single-use convenience is coming back to bite it. Recently, three universities of Tamil Nadu along with the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research, Goa, studied salt samples from Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Both states are major producers of edible salt and depend on the sea to make it. Microplastics are tiny particles, as minute as 100-200 micrometres, which shred away from single-use or general plastic items. These items include packaging material, cutlery, paints used for roads, polyester textiles, beads, fishing nets, tools, and cosmetics. The total microplastic content ranged from 46-115 particles per 200g in Gujarat salt samples, according to the researchers. In Tamil Nadu’s case, it ranged from 23-101 particles per 200g. Since this is emerging research, no reference limits are available to work out the permissible levels. The most common microplastics identified in edible salt were polyethylene, polyester, and polyvinyl chloride. Assistant professor A Vidyasakar of the geology department of Tamil Nadu’s Periyar University said, “The sources of the microplastic fibers may be processing and packaging units of salt-producing companies.” Airborne particles could be another source, he said. According to Vidyasakar, 74.3% of the total microplastics found in the study were red-and-blue fibrous materials. “We want the states that produce and package salt to recognize microplastics as a problem,” Vidyasakar said. “We want the states to improve their refining processes.” Another researcher, assistant professor S Krishna Kumar of the geology department of Tamil Nadu’s Malankara Catholic College, said, “Our team carried out a baseline study on the presence of the particles in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu samples.” Kumar added, “We are yet to investigate their effects on our bodies.” It will take a decade before the detrimental consequences are fully known, he said. “But first we have to recognize the presence of microplastics,” Kumar said. Other researchers were K Suresh Kumar, P Saravanan, and K Kasilingam of University of Madras; and K Neelavannan, S Anbalagan, and S Srinivasalu of the Institute for Ocean Management, Anna University. The research team also included S Kamaraj of the biotechnology department of Periyar University; and N S Magesh of the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/using-salt-you-are-taking-a-pinch-of-plastic/articleshow/85020552.cms||Paul John

Prof Verma, who was transferred from Nalanda Open University (NOU) to MU, took charge on Monday. The post of MU registrar had been lying vacant for a long time. Prof Verma said employees’ welfare and students’ problems would be accorded priority in the university. “No work related to teachers, non-teaching staff and students will be held up in the university. I have given instructions to the office not to sit over files for petty reasons. There must be a transparency in the work, which the university badly lacked in the past,” he said, adding better coordination with administrative wing and cooperation from employees are needed to retain the past glory of the university. Welcoming the posting of an academic as the registrar, former principal of B D College, Prof B N Ojha, and former B D College teachers’ association president Prof Raghunandan Prasad Singh said at least hundred teachers of Patna and Nalanda districts, who retired before the bifurcation of Magadh University in March 2018, were running from pillar to post to get their dues from the university, but to no avail so far. Several retired teachers and non-teaching staff of the Patna-based constituent colleges have not been paid their dues since 2018 for one reason or another.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mu-to-ensure-payment-of-retirement-benefits-on-time/articleshow/85016387.cms||Kumod Verma

Now, the Bankatwa model has caught the attention of World Health Organisation (WHO), which will send a team there next week to study the working mode of administration and health workers in the vaccination exercise in the district. East Champaran DM Shirsat Kapil Ashok said the drive is underway to administer the second dose of vaccines to the entire population above 18 years of age in Bankatawa block within a week or two. “A four-day mega vaccination camp has been organized in the block from Tuesday,” he said. East Champaran district is on top in the state in administering the first dose to all the eligible population of 18+ in Bankatwa and Piprakothi blocks. Besides all the eligible population have been administered the first dose of vaccines in Motihari Nagar Nigam, Raxaul Nagar Parishad, Dhaka Nagar Parishad, Pakaridayal Nagar Panchayat, Chakia Nagar Parishad, Areraj Nagar Panchayat and Kesariya Nagar Panchayat. Motihari Nagar Nigam is the first in the country where all the eligible people have been administered the first dose of vaccines, according to state health minister Mangal Pandey. “We came across several urban and rural people who had imaginary problems and had to be convinced about the benefits of vaccination. The social workers and religious heads met men and women on their doorsteps, following which we got maximum numbers of people in mega vaccination camps in remote areas,” the DM told this newspaper. He said there was no scarcity of Covid-19 vaccines in the district, but large number of people are reaching at vaccination centres and vaccines are limited. “We are getting vaccines supply from Patna only two or three days in a week,” the DM said. Civil surgeon Dr Anjani Kumar said in the 27 blocks of the district, 16,79, 094 lakh persons have been tested for Covid-19 at testing centres through RT-PCR, TrueNat and Antigen tests from April 1 to August 2 and only 19,045 of them were found positive and 287 Covid patients died during this period. A total of 9,21,573 people were adminsietered first dose of vaccines and 1,62,239 got their second dose as well till Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/who-team-to-visit-east-champaran-study-district-vaccination-programme/articleshow/85015361.cms||Chandra Bhushan Pandey

Mabia was arrested by the Badshahi Naka police for dowry death and booked under the Anti-Dowry Act. He was also charged under the Arms Act. The court acquitted Mabia from the charges under section 498A and 304B of IPC but held him guilty under section 4 of the Anti-Dowry Act, section 302 of IPC and the Arms Act. Co-accused Chand Babu, who is brother of the accused, was acquitted of all the charges for want of evidence. According to Pradyumna Awasthi, additional district government counsel, one Zubair Ahmad, a resident of Quli Bazar lodged a report wherein he stated that he had married his daughter Safia to Mabia in 2012. Mabia, his father Rafiq Qurreshi and brother Chand Babu used to thrash Safia and asked her to bring money from her parents, he alleged.On September 13, 2015 at around 2 am, he received a message that Mabia and his family members were thrashing Safia. He and his son Danish rushed to her house and saw that Mabia had shot Safia on her head after which Mabia, Rafiq and Chand Babu ran away from the spot, the complainant said. The complainant said he immediately took his daughter to UHM hospital. The doctors referred her to LLR hospital where she succumbed to her injuries during treatment. Police had arrested Mabia on September 15, 2015 from the Cooperganj area and recovered a country-made 315 bore pistol from his possession. On the point of sentence, the ADGC submitted that since the accused had killed his wife from an illegal firearm, he should be awarded a maximum sentence. On the other hand, the defence counsel argued that the accused was unemployed and that it was his first offence, and there were possibilities that he would amend his behaviour, hence minimum punishment be given to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/court-gives-man-life-term-for-killing-his-wife-for-dowry/articleshow/85022744.cms||---

Several students TOI contacted said that the financial conditions of their families were not good during the pandemic due to which they couldn’t pay the fees. The Class X and XII board examinations were cancelled this year. The marking system for the UP board was the same as that of the CBSE. For Class XII, the marks were divided in the ratio of 50:40:10. The board considered 50% marks obtained in Class X, 40% in Class XI and 10% in pre-board. The results were declared on July 31. The girls and their parents staged a protest outside college as well as at the gate of district magistrate office on Monday, demanding action against the college. The students also demande d that they be marked as present in the exam so that their academic year is not lost. The Moradabad district administration, meanwhile, has ordered an investigation into the matter. DM Shailendra Kumar Singh said, “It was brought to the notice that around 70 students, who allegedly didn’t appear in their pre-board exams and were marked “absent”, have failed in the board exams. However, students have claimed that they have failed due to non-payment of fees. They were marked as absent in the exams. A team led by DIOS Arun Dubey will probe the case. Based on the investigation, further course of action will be decided.” One of the protesting students, Khushi Gautam, said, “Due to the pandemic, we were reeling under a difficult time. Parents of some students had incurred huge losses in businesses, while others had lost their jobs. So most of us could not pay the fees. But we still were preparing and appeared in the pre-board exam. As many as 120 students have failed in the exams. The college told us that we were marked absent due to non-payment of fees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/marked-as-absent-for-non-payment-of-school-fees-120-girls-fail-class-xii-up-board-exam/articleshow/85012767.cms||Maria Khan

The survey, titled `Future work models’, found that an overwhelming 70% companies, including small and MLVL (medium, large and very large) feel hybrid will be the future work model in line with global trends. According to HYSEA, small companies (with less than 500 employees) seem to have moved first in getting employees back to offices with nearly 20% companies having over 20% staff on work from office (WFO), as compared to just 5% WFO in the MLVL segment, which averages out to nearly 76% companies having less than 9% WFO component in the city. HYSEA said nearly 73% companies are looking to get a minimum of 10% and maximum 50% employees back in office by December 2021, with the remaining 27% companies planning to operate on less than 10% WFO. In an indication that a significant shift to WFO might happen only in 2022, nearly 79% of the companies (including MLVL) said they expect anywhere from 30% to 90% employees on WFO by March 2022, which translates to a minimum of 2 lakh and maximum of 5 lakh employees back in offices by March next year, HYSEA president Bharani Kumar Aroll said. He said the study found that one of the biggest constraints in getting employees back to offices is that a chunk of techies are on WFH outside Hyderabad. While early 91% of companies have over 25% of workforce operating from outside Hyderabad, a significant 53% have over 40% employees on WFH outside Hyderabad, which translates to over 2 lakh techies on WFH outside Hyderabad out of the city’s over 6 lakh IT/ITeS workforce. The other constraints include anxiety about a potential third wave, availability of safe accomodation and food arrangements, the fact that many employees are still not vaccinated and schools have not yet reopened, he added. While around 36% companies have at least 50% to 75% employees vaccinated with at least one dose, most are keen on a 100% vaccination coverage for WFO, which is bound to take time, pointed out HYSEA, which saw about 25% of its total member base of around 300 companies participate in the survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-techies-may-start-logging-into-offices-in-big-way-only-by-march-2022-hysea-survey/articleshow/85020517.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Mechanised sweeping scrapped, Mohali back to manual sweeping||Barinderjit.Saluja Mohali: The Municipal Corporation (MC) house on Tuesday unanimously approved adoption of manual sweeping of the city and also gave consent for scrapping of the mechanical sweeping system. To adopt manual sweeping, MC gave consent for recruitment of 1,334 sanitation workers. MC brought 12 agenda points in the house meet, which started with a condolence meeting in memory of Flying Sikh Milkha Singh, his wife Nirmal Milkha Singh and the two sewer men who lost their life while performing their duties. The meeting was chaired by mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu and MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg. The mayor said, “We will recruit 1,334 sanitation workers at district collector (DC) rates. For the past six years, Delhi-based company Lions Private Limited has been managing cleaning of the city through the mechanised sweeping project at the cost of Rs 18 crore per year. The project however, faced criticism at the hands of residents, which forced us to scrap it.” For the last six years, a Delhi-based company was responsible for mechanical sweeping of the city, which somehow failed to satisfy residents who lodged numerous complaints against the contractor. Senior deputy mayor Amrik Singh Somal said, “The company was allotted the contract in 2015, when the house was not elected. The contract was given under pressure of the then Akali government. While the original contract was for Rs 1.05 crore per month, the firm was being paid Rs 1.35 crore.” The MC house also approved reimbursement of green fodder cost to the cattle pound contractor as the MC commissioner said that due to the pandemic, the cattle pound was not receiving donations in the form of green fodder. “So we have decided to pay green fodder cost to the gaushala so that cattle are not starved. Per cattle per day maintenance has also been increased from Rs 13 per cattle per day to Rs 22 per cattle per day” he said. The house also approved increase in rough cost estimate for operation and maintenance toilet blocks situated in Zone-2 (Phase-3-A, 3B1, 3B2, 4, 7,8 and Industrial Area Phase-1,2 and 3) by 25 %. BOX MC divides city into 4 zones For systematic cleaning of the city, the MC house approved the agenda point to divide the city into four zones, including sectors and phases.

---||Kochi||Kerala: No bail for human trafficking accused||THRISSUR: The first additional district sessions judge of Thrissur PN Vinod turned down the bail plea of the accused in a human trafficking case. The accused Arjun Kilaka (24) –who is the son of Sinta Kilaka of Rayagada in Odisha –had allegedly trafficked a minor girl and four women from Odisha to Kerala. According to the police Arjun, the women and the minor girl were apprehended at Thrissur railway station on July 10. They arrived by Dhanbad-Alappuzha Express and the coordinator of the child helpdesk at the railway station Akhila sought their details after she saw them moving in a suspicious manner on the platform. Akhila alerted the police when she found the age of the girl was altered in the Aadhaar to conceal the fact that she was a minor. When police questioned them, they found that the women and the minor were brought forcibly to work as domestic helps in different houses here. The accused was fleecing money from house owners for deploying them as domestic helps, said prosecutor KD Babu. The women also had to pay him, police said. The women are being lodged at Sakhi women rescue centre while the minor was lodged at another rehabilitation centre. “At this stage, I’m satisfied that the prosecution has established a strong prima facie case against the accused. At this stage the plea of false implication cannot be upheld,” the judge said in his order. The judge pointed out that the case diary indicated that the investigation was at a preliminary stage. “The grave nature of the allegations and the stage of investigation lead me to the conclusion that granting bail to the petitioner at this stage will hamper the course of investigation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-bail-for-human-trafficking-accused/articleshow/85018136.cms||---
---||Pune||MNGL announces hike in CNG, domestic PNG prices||Pune: The Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited (MNGL) has announced a hike in the price of compressed natural gas (CNG) and domestic piped natural gas (D-PNG), effective from August 1 in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and rural areas of the district. The price of CNG has been increased by Rs0.90, per kilogram, from Rs 56.60 to Rs 57.50, while PNG price is up by Rs 1.90, per standard cubic meter (SCM), to Rs 29.10, per SCM. The gas distribution company has said that the increase in input and transportation costs of gas has resulted in the price hike and that it would lead to only a marginal impact on per-kilometre running cost of CNG vehicles. MNGL’s CNG offers savings of over 60% as compared to petrol and over 40% as compared to diesel at current price levels in Pune city, the company stated. The price of CNG has been hiked after two months. The previous hike was announced in June 2021. Officials from MNGL said that being an essential utility MNGL has been supplying uninterrupted CNG in Pune through its vast network of more than 80 CNG stations. Steps have been initiated to set up more refilling stations to cover maximum area across both cities and rural locations. Even during the pandemic, despite heavy drop in sales, MNGL continued its operations to fuel emergency vehicles and other associated vehicles running on CNG, officials said. For domestic PNG, the gas distribution company has, so far, reached up to 3 lakh connections in the entire district, including urban areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mngl-announces-hike-in-cng-domestic-png-prices/articleshow/85018175.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Complaints galore as long queues, protocol breach & technical glitches affect vaccination drive in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Overcrowding, long queues, breach of safety protocol and technical snags forced many to go back without taking the jab from several centres during the mega Covid-19 vaccination drive in the city on Tuesday. However, there were some who beat all odds to take the jab. A TOI reality check at several camps across the city found people returning without jabs, complaining about lack of crowd management, inadequate registration process and signboards, absence of Covid protocol, including use of sanitizers, and unavailability wheel-chairs and postinoculation waiting areas. Krishan Lal (65), an arthritis patient, went back from a centre in Lajpatnagar only because there was no place to sit. “I waited for two hours but cannot stand any longer. There is no place where the elderly people can sit and wait,” he said. Vidya Singh (42) returned from a centre in Balaganj when, despite several attempts, the operator could not complete her registration due to technical snag. “There is no one to tell us what is the process of registration and how long we would have to wait. I could not wait beyond four hours,” said Vipin Shukla, while returning from a centre in Chowk. Navin Mishra and Lala Ram had to return disappointed from a centre at Sarai Mali Khan following delay in registration due to a technical snag. People shouted slogans to protest the delay in vaccination at a centre in Aliganj. Kartik Singh, who had come for his first shot, said: “Many people are waiting in queues for two hours but some were allowed entry through backdoor.” Kripa Shankar Dixit (58), said: “I came at 11am but even after four hours, my turn has not arrived. My feet are swollen.” Simran Pathak (24) and Shalini Singh (23), who had come for jabs at a centre in Chinhat, said they were standing in the queue for three hours. “It’s really frustrating. There is no arrangement even for drinking water,” they said. Pankaj Maurya (31), who came for the shot at a centre in Indiranagar, said he reached the booth around 8.30am but it opened at 10am. “People carrying out registrations told us that the server is taking time to update and verify information. It took four hours before my turn came.” At a centre in Bhootnath, Vinod Kakkar (64), who suffers from a spinal disorder, said he stood for an hour in the queue but when the pain became unbearable, he called his son and asked him to stand in his place and inform him when his name is called. “I went to a nearby shop and requested for a chair. Finally, after four hours, I could get the shot,” he said.

---||Hyderabad||Protracted inquiry into encounter killings of Disha rape-murder accused irks Supreme Court||HYDERABAD: The Supreme Court Tuesday expressed surprise over the Justice Sirpurkar Commission not being able to complete the inquiry into the December 2019 encounter killings by Hyderabad police of four persons, accused of rape and murder of a veterinary doctor, and granted last extension of six months to it to complete the SC-assigned task. Appearing for the commission, headed by Justice (retd) V S Sirpurkar, advocate K Parameshwar informed the court that extensive work has been done and that the inquiry panel needed another six months to complete the probe, which was assigned to it in January 2020 when the SC had framed its terms of reference. A bench of CJI NV Ramana and Justice Surya Kant told the counsel that the inquiry into the UP encounter killings was set up much after the Telangana incident and that the commission has already submitted its report. “Why does the commission need to examine 116 witnesses? Anyway, we are granting a final six month extension to complete the inquiry,” the bench said. On November 28, 2019, a young veterinary doctor was raped, murdered and her body was burned. The incident led to huge uproar in Hyderabad as well as in other parts of the country. Four persons were arrested in connection with the crime. Immediately after their arrest, hundreds of people gathered and had demanded custody of the arrested persons to deliver justice. The SC had set up the commission of inquiry (CoI) headed by Justice Sirpurkar on December 12, 2019. In its order it had said, “We are of the considered view that an inquiry commission needs to be constituted for inquiring into the circumstances in which the four accused persons, namely, Mohammed Arif, Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu, Jolu Shiva and Jollu Naveen, were killed in Hyderabad on December 6, 2019.” The other members of the CoI were former Bombay high court judge RP Sondurbaldota and former CBI director DR Karthikeyan. SC had fixed their remunerations at Rs 1.5 lakh per sitting for Justice Sirpurkar and Rs 1 lakh for other members. In contrast, the SC had on July 22 last year set up a commission of inquiry headed by Justice (retd) BS Chauhan and comprising former Allahabad HC Judge Sashi Kant Aggarwal and former UP DGP, KL Gupta, to inquire into the killings of eight policemen and subsequent encounter killings of gangster Vikas Dubey and five of his associates. Since the encounters took place in remote rural areas, the Justice Chauhan Commission was required to visit all the places and meet the witnesses. Despite the pandemic and other impediments, the commission submitted its report to the SC and UP government in eight months (in April this year). In contrast, the Justice Sirpurkar Commission was granted its first six month extension on July 24 last year and another six month extension on January 29 this year. If the commission utilises the entirety of the six month extension granted on Tuesday, then it would complete two years to complete the inquiry assigned to it by the SC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/protracted-inquiry-into-encounter-killings-of-disha-rape-murder-accused-irks-sc/articleshow/85020578.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

This will cost around Rs 800 crore, as per today’s rate,” MbPT sources said, pointing out that HC was not keen on the Borivli land offered earlier. As per policy, MbPT is supposed to give priority to the buyers who have services attached to day-to-day port operations such as Customs and immigration besides security forces and utility services. “In case of others, the cost is to be borne at present market rates,” sources said. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte is learnt to have held a meeting to discuss this move. A proposal is yet to be made and sent to MbPT, which will then have to be sent to their ministerial head office in Delhi for final approval. The panel of judges has visited the MbPT office four times and surveyed the probable plots. “The land they have zeroed in on near Cotton Green has many houses and resettling them is a major task as policies are to be made for them,” added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-likely-to-spend-rs-800cr-for-1-acre-of-mbpt-land/articleshow/85020627.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||GST fake billing scam: Investigation reveals bogus transactions worth Rs 2,000 crore||AHMEDABAD: The proportion of fraud in the Rs 900-crore fake billing scam, involving metal trading firms in Bhavnagar, is growing bigger as investigation progresses. After inspecting accounts of fake transactions from electronic devices seized from key accused Afzal Sajwani’s residence in Juhapura, the involvement of some 200 shell companies was found, according to sources privy to the investigation. Raids, searches, arrests and probe into the case is underway since July 7, and revelation from electronic documents seized from Sajwani’s residence suggest that the scam could involve generation and distribution of bogus bills valued at Rs 2,000 crore. Sources said it could be one of the biggest fake billing scams reported in Gujarat since the new regime rolled out. So far, the department has made some nine arrests in connection with the case. The most recent one being the scam mastermind Mohammad Meghani alias MM, who was arrested from Bhavnagar on Sunday. SGST department officials launched a manhunt for Meghani as his name figured in most of the electronic accounts seized from Sajwani’s residence. Based on intelligence inputs, SGST officials learnt that he was at a hideout in Bhavnagar. A team of inspectors and SGST officials surrounded the house and nabbed the key accused. Incriminating documents reflecting fake transactions were found on several digital devices at the said hideout in Bhavnagar. “Further investigation in the case is still underway. Once the documents nabbed from Meghani’s residence are inspected, we will be able to make further headway in identifying traders who are beneficiaries of the fake bills generated and traded by Meghani and Sajwani,” the source added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/200-shell-cos-may-be-involved/articleshow/85018173.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Delhi||Collegium to finalise names of judges, HC tells petitioner on judge shortage||New Delhi: Already functioning at half its sanctioned strength and with two retirements set to take place in the next few months, the Delhi high court is battling with a severe shortage of judges. A PIL seeking judicial intervention in this regard led the Chief Justice DN Patel to disclose that the high court collegium is already considering names to recommend for appointment of judges for the high court. “At present, the meeting of the collegium is going on. There is no reason to say anything when the meeting of the collegium is going on for finalising the names,” said a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh while posting the plea for September 30. The plea argued that the high court is working at a strength that is much less than its sanctioned capacity, which had several “negative impact” on the citizens, the economy and the caseload. Filed by one Rakesh Kumar Gupta, the plea contends that when the high court has “more than sufficient” physical infrastructure and employees to function with its sanctioned strength of 60 judges, there is no reason why these vacancies should not be filled by the government. “Maximum working judges strength was 42 judges (87.5%) from April 17, 2013 to May 31, 2013, thereafter it reduced gradually. From June 30, 2014, it never crossed the limit of 67%. After December 4, 2019, utilisation remained below 59% and now at 50%,” the petition highlighted, giving details of the vacancies. Urging the Chief Justice to intervene, the petitioner submitted that more recommendations on the appointment of judges be sent by the high court collegium to achieve their maximum capacity in the next six months. The issue was also flagged last week by Union law minister Kiren Rijjiju who, in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, revealed that the pace of recruitment in the high courts has slowed down considerably—from 108 judges appointed in 2018 to 66 in 2020. The 25 high courts in the country are facing total vacancies of 454 as against a sanctioned strength of 1,098 judges. The collegiums have failed to recommend candidates to fill up judicial vacancies in the prescribed time frame, as per the ministry. “Justice delayed has a negative impact on the whole economy, not on just litigants. Delayed justice promotes corruption, crony capitalisation and denial of justice to weaker sections. The final result is that the growth of the country reduces,” the plea stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/collegium-to-finalise-names-of-judges-hc-tells-petitioner-on-judge-shortage/articleshow/85020640.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Justice PB Suresh Kumar issued a stay on publishing the results after considering a petition filed by Salvia Hussain of Kollam, Sibi Wilson of Enath, and an organization of CBSE school managements. Results of Kerala Engineering Architecture Medical (KEAM) exam is expected to be published in September. Though the court restrained publishing of results, it has allowed the exam to be held on Thursday as scheduled. The petitioners have demanded before the court that Plus Two marks should not be relied upon for admissions being done on the basis of KEAM. Plus Two exams for CBSE and ICSE were not held this year due to Covid-19. Therefore, admission to medical and engineering admissions should be conducted in Kerala without relying on Plus Two marks, the petition said. Further, the petitioners have alleged that Plus Two exams that were held this year were not done in a manner that assessed the academic levels of the students correctly. The court issued a stay after the state government informed that it would come up with a decision on the issue soon and that it will be conveyed to the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-dont-publish-keam-results/articleshow/85018185.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Forest dept, villagers cross swords||Rajkot: In a real life incident resembling scenes from Bollywood movie, ‘Sherni’, villagers of Mendarda taluka and Junagadh taluka are at loggerheads with forest officers over the issue of grazing in forest area in Girnar sanctuary in which three cows, impounded by the forest department, were killed by lions 10 days ago. While villagers blame the forest department of intentionally feeding the livestock to the lions, foresters maintained they were only discharging their duty. The forest department has ordered a probe but as the embers refuse to die down, the forest officials were forced to brief the forest minister about the clash. Several villages of Mendarda taluka remained closed on Monday protesting the forest department’s attempt to use wildlife lovers and veterinary doctors in their defence. According to case details, on July 21, 15 cows belonging to Rambhai Tapariya were grazing in Ratanpara beat of north range in Junagadh forest department — a sanctuary area where grazing is prohibited. The forest department impounded the cattle and asked Tapariya to pay fine and get the cattle released. The bovine were taken to Ranshivav forest chowki inside the jungle after Tapariya failed to collect his livestock. The forest department arranged to put the cows in a Gau Shala (cow shed) and were being kept safely inside a compound wall. However, the forest officials said they spotted a lioness a few kilometres away and while trying to divert it to save the cattle, it roared. This scared the cows which escaped in all directions breaking the tethering ropes. In the process, lion killed three cows and villagers claim one cow is missing. When contacted, Taparia said, “My cattle were not in a forest area. I had no problem paying a fine, but I was afraid they would beat me like it happened with several other cattle breeders. So, I did not go.” The issue soon snowballed into a major controversy with BJP leader and taluka panchayat member of Bhesan, Hasmukh Kathiriya, popularly known as Gandubhai, leading an agitation against the forest department. Kathiriya is demanding action against the forest officials on duty who he has alleged intentionally gave the cows to the lions as prey. He has demanded compensation for the cattle owner. Kathiriya represented his case to the forest minister and senior officials alleging that illegal lion shows are being conducted at night in this area. “The cattle breeders were relocated in 2009 after the area was declared a sanctuary. At that time it was an agreement that cattle would be allowed for grazing. But now forest officials don’t renew the passes of cattle breeders,” Kathiriya told TOI. The forest department sources, however, claimed that the cattle were found grazing outside the designated area in the forest. Again, Tapariya’s pass too was not renewed as it was originally issued in his father’s name and he did not fulfil the conditions to get it reissued in his name. Sources further alleged that Kathiriya has an axe to grind against the foresters and is deliberately fanning the issue. Deputy conservator of forest Junagadh, Sunil Berwal said, “Primary inquiry revealed that our staff was not at fault,but were discharging their duty only. But following the villagers’ grievances, the chief conservator of forest has ordered a probe and we are awaiting the report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/forest-dept-villagers-cross-swords/articleshow/85015672.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Based on the information provided by a friend of the accused, police picked him up and located the body near the railway tracks on Tuesday. The victim, who was a degree first year student of a private college in Bowenpally, left her home in Alwal at 10am on Monday and did not return. While the family members were waiting for her thinking that she might have gone to a friend’s house without informing them, a teenager, a friend of the victim’s lover, Deepak, 18, approached police disclosing that the latter had told him about killing the girl. Based on the information given by the teenager, police picked up Deepak from Secunderabad in the early hours of Tuesday. On interrogation, he confessed to have killed the victim, police said. Deepak guided police to the bushes adjacent to the railway track behind BHEL quarters near Loyola College in Alwal, where the body of the victim was found. “Deepak met the victim at 1pm on Monday and took her to an isolated spot adjacent to the railway track. After an argument, he strangulated the victim with her stole,” Alwal inspector A Gangadhar said. The accused, who is preparing for engineering entrance exams after finishing Intermediate, confessed that he was in a relationship with the victim for about a year and recently started avoiding her. “As the victim started pressurising for marriage, he killed her,” Alwal police said.

Prince Mathew, T N Murukan and S Abhilash will investigate the allegations. The probe was ordered based on a report submitted by CPI control commission.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow clocks another record as 80,000 vaccinated against Covid in a day||LUCKNOW: A record over 80,000 people rolled up their sleeves to take the jab against Covid-19 in the mega vaccination drive in the city on Tuesday. Though the inoculations were less than the target set for the day, they were almost thrice the previous record of 28,131 vaccinations in a day on June 26. The district administration, through a press communique, had said on Monday that the vaccination target was 87,000. However, on Tuesday, the administration’s press release said that the target of administering 69,000 doses had been fixed against which 80,410 people were jabbed. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Manoj Agrawal clarified, “The state government had given us the target of 69,000 vaccinations, but since we had more doses, we ourselves revised it to 87,000 vaccinations.” About 45% beneficiaries on Tuesday were people in the 18-44 years category, 35% in the 45-59 years age group and 20% were of 60 years or above. The drive was conducted at 171 centres having 373 booths. At least 81 special camps were set up at schools, places of worship, workplaces, residential colonies and markets. Tuesday’s drive came as a big boost as daily vaccinations in July were around 20,000 per day. With this, over 20 lakh doses, highest in the state, have been administered in Lucknow since the start of the campaign in January. Over 11 lakh people in Lucknow have taken at least one shot, while 4.75 lakh have been fully immunized with the two-dose course. District magistrate Abhishek Prakash also inspected several centres. Administrative and health officers claimed that the process was carried out smoothly. However, TOI reality check found mismanagement at several places, resulting in overcrowding, gross neglect of Covid safety protocol and protests due to delay in vaccinations. Technical snags in the registration process were also reported and no arrangement of wheelchairs, waiting or observation rooms and basic amenities like drinking water, was made. The CMO admitted that there were some shortcomings at a few places, which would be rectified in future campaigns. TOI found smooth vaccination at several places including gurdwaras, Eidgah, temples and missionary schools. The centre at Gurdwara Naka Hindola recorded its highest single-day vaccination with 2,000 people taking the jab. “Our volunteers ensured social distancing and arranged langar for beneficiaries,” said president of the Lucknow Gurdwara Management Committee, Rajendra Singh Bagga. Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia visited the centre at Aishbagh Eidgah and appreciated the work. At St Dominic College, Surabhi Tripathi (29), who came with her cousin, Vasundhara, said: “We brought our mothers too so that we could be inoculated together.” More than 500 people visited Aashiana Gurdwara to get themselves vaccinated. Krishna Devi (55) of Sector H, LDA Colony, said: “After getting the jab we were told to sit for 20-30 minutes. We were also provided water bottles and biscuit packets.” Vaccination process was also smooth at Bal Nikunj Inter College.

---||Hyderabad||TRS & BJP two sides of same coin, says Telangana Congress||HYDERABAD: The Congress on Tuesday said the tacit understanding between the TRS and the BJP has been exposed as the TRS MPs neither attended the Opposition parties’ meeting convened by Rahul Gandhi in Delhi nor have they questioned, in Parliament, the Narendra Modi-led BJP government about Centre taking control of Godavari and Krishna river management in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Addressing a media conference in Delhi, Telangana Congress president and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy and TPCC campaign committee chairman and ex-MP Madhu Yashki Goud said 15-days have passed but TRS MPs did not raise their voice against the Modi-government in the Parliament to protect the river water interests of Telangana. “The TRS MPs’ absence from opposition parties meeting in Delhi is a testimony to the TRS and BJP being two sides of the same coin. The Congress has been telling the people that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao-led TRS has always supported the Modi-government on demonetisation, GST and other anti-people policies. The Congress stand has been vindicated,” Revanth said. However, TRS MP G Ranjith Reddy slammed Revanth and Madhu Yashki, and said: “Also, it was our leader KCR who had called for the formation of the federal front, an umbrella of non-BJP and non-Congress led parties. In such a case, how can any one expect TRS MPs to participate in Rahul Gandhi’s breakfast meeting,” Ranjith said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-bjp-two-sides-of-same-coin-t-cong/articleshow/85022810.cms||---

This will be useful to the forest department in developing management guidelines and conservation action plan for owlets. Talking to TOI on the eve of International Owl Awareness Day which falls on August 4, Prachi Mehta, senior scientist and executive director of Wildlife Research & Conservation Society (WRCS), said, “Colour-banding is one of the widely used methods in avian research and helps in monitoring the population of the species.” Mehta, whose WRCS is implementing owlet research project since 2017 and is still going on, added, “Comparison of the ecology of the forest owlet with other co-existing owls will throw light on why the forest owlet is found in isolated populations, unlike other similar-sized owls. A final report on the research will be published soon.” “In the next phase of the project which will start in September, we shall be studying a home range and habitat use of the forest owlet and other sympatric owls. This will help us to understand which specific areas are used by owl species for various activities,” Mehta said. “Forest owlet is highly dependent on cavities for nesting and breeding success. If cavity-bearing trees are cut down, it can have serious repercussions on the future of forest owlets,” she says. The study has found that its diet consists mainly of rodents. Therefore, owlets play a key role in controlling rodents, which harm agricultural crops. It also feeds on lizards and amphibians. Though it coexists with other small owls such as spotted owlet, jungle owlet, and Scops owl, the differences in their diet allow them to coexist with other owl species. Mehta informed that WRCS work is also focusing on community-based conservation of owls and owl habitats in Melghat Tiger Reserve. With the participatory approach with the local community and support of the forest department, forest owlet and owl conservation actions will be implemented in Central India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/colour-banding-of-owlets-helps-know-movement-pattern-study/articleshow/85018209.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

A close second is his classmate Abhimanyu Mehra with 99.67%. As one scrolls down the notice board of this college, 28 students scored at least 99% and the last candidate, ranked 319, scored a poor 92%. The college’s scorecard reflects the HSC results across Maharashtra, which witnessed an over 1,000% rise in the 90% category this year. The state’s success rate in a year without exams was 99.38%—a 12% rise over last year when students’ performance was at its best since 2015. The exam in which 14 lakh students had registered was cancelled due to the pandemic. All students were declared passed and an assessment methodology was derived. “The results are totally unrealistic. A reference year, like in case of CBSE, should have been given to colleges,” said a principal. Across the state, 91,420 students secured above 90%, which is over 1,100% more than last year’s 7,344. Though the data of students who scored above 90% was not available for Mumbai, junior colleges across MMR recorded a massive jump in high scorers. That reflected in the Mumbai division climbing to the number two slot with a success rate of 98.87%. Last year, Mumbai was the last of the nine divisions with 85.83%. While Konkan, the smallest of the nine divisions, topped with 99.81% of its regular students emerging successful, it was Pune that had a success rate of 99.72% for regular and repeater students. Maharashtra is the only board that has evaluated its repeater students with regular ones. Aurangabad was at the bottom with 99.06%. For arts and commerce students, there were bumper scores with a success rate of 99.05% and 99.06%, respectively, in the Mumbai division, comprising Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Palghar. Both these screams had never entered the 90% success rates before. “How does one justify a near 100 percent success rate for an arts stream that has barely managed to touch the 80% success rate all this while,” asked a lecturer. Across the state, the arts stream saw the highest jump of 17 in the success rate. At St Xavier's College, the most sought-after institute for arts, the students fared better than their science counterparts both in terms of distinction and scoring 90% and above. “Science students focus more on NEET, JEE and other entrance exams. Our arts students are more focused on their college tests and board exams,” said Hasnain Naqvi, vice-principal of the college. A total of 158 arts and 41 science students of the college scored 90% and above. The jump in commerce in the state was 8.64%, with a high percentage of students (99.56%) emerging successful. When the state announced the 30:30:40 assessment ratio for class X, XI and XII, arts and commerce students were among those who worried about their performance in class XI. At Jai Hind College, both arts and commerce saw a 100% success rate. The science stream was at the bottom with a jump of only 3% across the state. In Mumbai, science students fared 7% better than last year. “Science students were at a disadvantage as they missed out on practicals,” said a principal. Though the customary revaluation is not there this year, a grievance redressal committee has been constituted to address issues of the HSC students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/1100-rise-in-90-scores-as-99-4-pass-hsc-in-state/articleshow/85026020.cms||Sandhya Nair

The project has been hanging fire due to unavailability of land, despite multiple cost escalations. A bench of Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh passed the order on a PIL filed by S K Singh, who pleaded that the project was kicked off without handing over land to public works department (PWD) and Rs 130 crore has been already been spent. “Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) sold 14 plots to individuals for commercial activity, but project failed to take off in the absence of land acquisition,” stated the petitioner. The petitioner further charged officials with raising the cost of project three times, even though land was unavailable and sought an inquiry. The bench observed, “It is surprising that a project was started without land clearance and after spending Rs 130 crore, it’s held up.” To sort out the dispute, the bench said, the chief secretary or an authorized officer not below the rank of secretary, LDA vice-chairman, municipal commissioner, district magistrate and managing director, UP State Bridge Corporation Ltd, should be present in the next hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-land-for-airport-flyover-hc-summons-senior-govt-officials/articleshow/85022874.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

The boy’s 19-year-old brother told police that he used to meet the woman daily and not do any work. When his parents confronted him, he admitted that he was involved with the woman. The boy’s parents asked him to cut-off all relations with the woman and never to meet him. But when he refused to obey, his parents sent him to Surat to his maternal uncle’s home. The boy found labour work at a garment stitching unit nearby but always remained depressed. “The boy used to remain sad and depressed over the separation, so on Monday morning he hanged himself from an iron beam when nobody was present at home,” said a police official. He added that a neighbour noticed from outside that he was hanging and informed the boy’s uncle. When his uncle reached home, the boy had already succumbed. Later police were informed and a case of accidental death was registered at Sachin police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/separated-from-married-woman-wb-teen-ends-life/articleshow/85015733.cms||---

Initially, localities with more complaints will be covered, corporationsaid. It has identified an NGO to supervise the process and a veterinary doctor was entrusted to carry out the surgery on a daily basis. The civic body will initially sterilise 15-20 stray dogs per day at the animal birth control (ABC) centre in Konakkarai. Although the ABC centre can sterilise more than 30 dogs per day, authorities said that they have restricted the capacity to ensure adequate space for sterilised dogs to recuperate for a period of 3-5 days post-surgery. “We identified an NGO who will carry out the sterilisation process at a cost of Rs 750 per dog,” city health officer Dr M Yazhini said. Meanwhile, the civic body is receiving requests from a section of locals empathetic to the canines to leave them at the same spot. A health official said the animals will be returned to the same spots from where they were picked. “The civic body should sterilise at least 50 dogs per day. Adequate arrangements should be made to sustain the process,” P Lenin, urban district secretary of DYFI said. The population of strays drastically increased since August 2019, due to the absence of a sterilisation process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corporation-resumes-drive-for-sterilising-stray-dogs/articleshow/85020646.cms||---

Police commissioner Amitabh Gupta directed six units of the crime branch to launch the drive after a review of criminal cases pending before various police stations revealed that large number of criminals, wanted in serious crime, were on the run since January 1, 2020. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale told TOI, “We have prepared a list of 54 criminals wanted in murder cases and 71 in attempted murder cases registered under the Indian Penal Code. We have prepared a list of 30 criminals wanted in cases registered under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act.” Morale said, “We have also prepared a list of 2,600 wanted criminals involved in crimes relating to body offence, robbery, theft, and others, in the last 10 years and we have issued instructions to 32 police stations to make serious efforts in arresting them.” “We have arrested 100 wanted criminals since January 1 this year. We had arrested 200 criminals last year,” he added. Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Shrinivas Ghadge said, “There are cases pending for investigation at the police station-level because the whereabouts of criminals involved in various crimes are not known.

---||Mumbai||Residents rescue Jawaharlal Nehru Garden, BMC takes charge||MUMBAI: In a victory for residents and the Nariman Point Churchgate Citizens’ Welfare Trust (NPCCWT), the public works department (PWD) handed over the one acre-plus Jawaharlal Nehru Garden near Mantralaya to BMC for maintenance last month. NPCCWT fought a long legal battle to save the garden from illegal encroachments, which included BJP’s state headquarters, which were partly on the recreational ground. TimesViewIt has been a long battle for residents to ensure that this open space remains encroachment-free. They even complained to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) in 2016, which sought a reply from the state chief secretary. This is a victory for the citizens’ movement, which showed its collective power to protect public spaces. The BMC should now develop and maintain the garden for locals and tourists visiting the heritage precinct.On July 22, a letter by executive engineer of PWD (city) to BMC, said plot 1621 on Madame Cama Road was being handed over to BMC for development, while its ownership will be with the state government. NPCCWT vice-president Atul Kumar said the handover had taken place after years of follow-ups with the authorities. “The garden is locked as it is unusable, with no proper walkways and debris lying around, despite the green space being in a prime area. The handing over to BMC will at least ensure proper walkways are laid out, with greening done wherever needed, so that locals and those going to the area can make use of it. It does not need anything extravagant, only a coat of paint and some sprucing up,” said Kumar. Local corporator Harshita Narwekar said on Tuesday she requested BMC to appoint an architect and develop the garden as it was in a heritage area. “The garden is in very bad condition as it was not maintained. This needs to be done immediately as it will be prestigious for BMC, being in a heritage precinct,” she said. NPCCA president Swarn Kohli said BMC should consult citizens before undertaking work in the space. “Citizens’ participation and feedback must be taken into consideration before anything is planned,” said Kohli. In 2013, NPCCA had challenged encroachments near Nehru Garden by BJP state headquarters, Janata Dal, Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation, Employment Exchange and Zunkha Bhakar Kendra. On March 2, 2016, while disposing of a PIL, Bombay high court gave BJP six months to demolish the illegal portion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-residents-rescue-nehru-garden-bmc-takes-charge/articleshow/85020652.cms||Richa Pinto

It plans to offer fresh equity shares worth Rs 525 crore and an offer for sale of up to 43 million shares. Nykaa plans to raise Rs 4,000 crore from the IPO, which would value the company at $5 billion-$5.5 billion. Nykaa, which sells online and has 70 physical stores, plans to use the proceeds from the IPO for expansion, by setting up new retail stores and establishing new warehouses. It also plans to retire some of its debt, which should bring down interest costs, and further shore up its profitability, the filing said. Founded in 2012 by Falguni Nayar, a former MD of Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, Nykaa has over 1,500 brands with a comprehensive selection of makeup, skincare, haircare, fragrances, personal care, luxury and wellness products for women and men. It has a portfolio of luxury brands including Bobbi Brown and Estee Lauder. The shareholders who are selling a part of their stake in the offering include Sanjay Nayar Family Trust, private equity firm TPG, Lighthouse, JM Financial and Sunil Kant Munjal, chairman of Hero Group. However, most of the investors are not cashing out completely, and will continue to retain some stake in the company post-IPO. The promoter and promoter group will continue to hold more than 51% of the company’s shares after the IPO. Nayar and her husband Sanjay, who is also the chairman of private equity firm KKR India, hold about 47% of the company through two family trusts. The company reported a profit of Rs 62 crore for the fiscal ended March 31, compared to a loss of Rs 16 crore in the year before. Total revenue jumped 38% to Rs 2,452 crore despite the pandemic last year. Nykaa said the contribution from tier 2 and tier 3 cities has increased to 64% in 2020-21, compared to 56.9% in the year before. Globally, there's been a rise of personalised beauty and cosmetic startups including Ipsy, Fenty Beauty, Morphe, Kylie Cosmetics and the Honest Company. Nykaa is also planning to deploy the IPO proceeds for marketing and promotional activities, and to strengthen its 13 owned brands including Nykaa Cosmetics, Nykaa Naturals and Kay Beauty. It also plans to establish and promote new brands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nykaa-files-for-rs-4000-crore-ipo/articleshow/85024693.cms||Avik Das

This GO prohibits any industrial or huge housing activities in the catchment areas spread over 84 villages and in a radius of 10 km of the twin reservoirs. Removal from the purview of this GO would mean appreciation of the real estate value in the area. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy took up an implead petition filed by Agni Agro Tech Limited which is seeking removal of its 17-acre land in Vattinagulapalli, one of the 84 villages, as its land falls outside the purview of the catchment area. The bench questioned the state government as to why landowners who fall outside the catchment area of the lakes should suffer restrictions imposed by GO 111. “It is strange that the government does not want to act on a report furnished by a committee that studied the area at the instance of the state,” the bench said. It sought to know the stand of the government on the issue by the next date of hearing and posted the case to August 9. Agni Agro Tech got itself impleaded in the petition and urged the court to keep GO 111 intact. Its counsel KS Murthy urged the court not to dilute the purpose of the GO that was aimed at protecting the environment and lakes. “If the state wants to dilute it, let it do so in tune with the laid down procedures and we do not want this court to be a party to such a decision,” he said. Appearing for the company, senior advocate K Vivek Reddy argued that land belonging to some landowners, like that of the company he is representing, was outside the catchment area of the lakes and the report of Environment Protection Training and Research Institute (EPTRI) had confirmed the same. It was the state government that instituted the EPTRI study and all the recommendations made by the institute were accepted by the state. “In fact, in one of the cases pending before the high court, the state government had even filed an application stating that areas falling outside the purview of catchment areas need to be deleted from the purview of GO 111,” he said. “We are not opposing GO 111 that protects the catchment areas. What we are seeking is the deletion from the purview of GO 111 those areas that were lying outside the catchment zone,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/why-should-all-landowners-suffer-go-111-curbs-asks-hc/articleshow/85020665.cms||---

The selected candidates, who cleared the UP PCS exam in 2019, include 31 engineers, two doctors and one architect. Encouraging the candidates to be true to their jobs, help people, work honestly and adopt the use of technology, the CM said that before his government came to power in 2017, UP was known for corruption, unemployment and favouritism in giving jobs. “Before 2017, casteism and nepotism were prevalent everywhere due to which the recruitment process was even challenged in court and a CBI investigation ordered. This frustrated the youth of the state. After coming into power, our government ended corruption in the boards and commissions, expedited the recruitment process and conducted it with transparency,” he said. The CM said that over the past more than four years, his government had given 4.5 lakh government jobs. Speaking to the new recruits, the CM said that they too should be fair and just in the course of their work, to reflect on the process of their recruitment. He said that they should use technology to help make the lives of people easier. “No one should be deprived of justice in UP, and technology should be used in solving issues. During the janata darshan programme, I have seen that most problems of the public are related to tehsil and police station level. Most of you are tech-savvy and with the use of technology, you can solve the problems of the public and save their time,” he told them. Speaking about employment generation, the CM said that due to the government’s crackdown on mafia and anti-social elements, UP had become a safe place where people were coming to invest. This had not only generated jobs in the industrial sector but also encouraged selfemployment. In his address, Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma told the new recruits to be self-confident, reflective and to work above personal interests. “The government has conducted the recruitment process with a policy of cleanliness, transparency and honesty. This process must reflect in your own way of working,” he said. Finance minister Suresh Khanna said that the recruits must focus on their work and results and prioritise the welfare of people.

The commission in its recommendations has asked the dean and medical superintendent of Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital to ensure that disability certificates and other necessary certificates of persons with disabilities are issued “only by accepting passport size photographs, showing only the face of the applicant and not the full body, in accordance with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Rules, 2017”. The three-member commission, headed by Justice U Bakre and comprising Desmond D’Costa and Pramod V Kamat, received complaints that authorities were demanding full body photographs in 4x6 or 3x4 from persons with disabilities to issue disability certificates and found that Rule 17(2)(b) of The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Rules, 2017 were “not followed and non adherence of the same amounts to violation of human rights and privacy”. Under the new Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 under Section 58 regarding issuance of disability certificate has replaced the mandatory full body photograph with “two recent passport size photographs” as per Rule 17(2), the commission found. These rules were published in the Official Gazette dated June 15, 2017 of the Central Government and extended to the whole of India including Goa. A Taleigao resident complained to the commission in December 2018 over the odd practice followed by authorities demanding full body photographs. The medical superintendent of GMC had issued a notice on December 31, 2018, directing all doctors in the department of orthopedics not to insist on full body photographs and follow the new guidelines. The chairman of the medical board of GMC had informed the dean that no personnel has asked for or insisted on full body photographs for patients with disabilities. However, the complainant, in February 2019, stated that the authorities are still compelling persons with disabilities to submit full body photographs to obtain railway concession certificate. Avelino D’Sa president of the Goa Disabilities Rights Association also submitted to the commission that many persons with disability in Goa, including him, have been issued Disability certificates exposing their affected body parts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/use-passport-photo-for-docus-of-disabled-rights-commission/articleshow/85020838.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Pingali Venkayya created India’s flag, deserves Bharat Ratna: Kin||Hyderabad: Ahead of Independence Day celebrations, the family of Pingali Venkayya, who provided the first design for the National Flag, has asked that the country’s highest honour ‘Bharat Ratna’ be bestowed upon him posthumously. Pingali Venkayya had died in 1963. “Venkayya has not got due recognition so far. In fact in the last 20 years, we held several meetings and brought up the demand that he should be given the ‘Bharat Ratna’. But this has still not happened,” said Pingali Susheela who lives in Vijayawada. Susheela is the wife of Venkayya’s late grandson Pingali Dasharatharam. Susheela said Venkayya had initially provided Mahatma Gandhi a flag with two colours — saffron and green — and a charka on them. She said that on Mahatma Gandhi’s advice, the white colour was also added. “All the colours were to represent communal and religious harmony,” she said. The flag was submitted to Mahatma Gandhi at a conference in Vijayawada in 1921. Later, the charka was replaced by the Ashoka Chakra when the flag was adopted as the National Flag. The Pingali Venkaiah Charitable Trust at Vidyanagar in Hyderabad has also written to PM Narendra Modi seeking Bharat Ratna for Venkayya. Trust CEO Srinivas Janga said that due recognition should be given to Venkayya by also declaring his birth anniversary (August 2) and death anniversary (July 4) as national holidays. The Trust has been organising programmes on March 31st and April 1st every year to commemorate the submission of the National Flag design by Pingali Venkayya. A programme was also organised on Sunday in Hyderabad to honour his memory. When NT Rama Rao was chief minister of united AP, a statue of Pingali Venkayya was installed on Tank Bund. In March this year, AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had visited the house of Venkayya’s daughter Ghantasala Seetha Mahalakshmi in Macherla in Guntur and honoured her. He also presented Rs 75 lakh to her to honour the memory of Venkayya and recognise his contribution to the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pingali-venkayya-created-indias-flag-deserves-bharat-ratna-kin/articleshow/85020711.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Police said that the five students of the Rajkot Homeopathic Medical College were returning after visiting the primary health centre (PHC) in Khirasara village. The deceased were identified as Adarsh Goswami, Nishant Davda, Forum Dhangadhariya and Simran Gilani, all aged 22 years and residents of Rajkot city. “Primary probe suggests that the car was being driven at high speed. The driver (Goswami) lost control over the vehicle at a curve on the road and crashed into Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC) bus coming from the opposite direction after jumping the road divider,” police sub-inspector K K Jadeja of Lodhika police station told TOI. While Goswami, Davda and Dhangadhariya died on the spot, Gilani succumbed to injuries later at a private hospital in Rajkot city. Their classmate Krupali Gajjar, who sustained severe injuries, was critical, said police. “The accident was so severe that no part of the sedan car was left intact. Fire officials had to first use an earthmover to remove the front portion of the car from under the bus and then use gas cutters to remove the bodies from the mangled remains of the car,” said sources. Bodies of three students who died on the spot were severely disfigured. Police said that all five students were in the last semester of their course at the Rajkot Homeopathic Medical College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/four-homeopathy-students-die-after-their-car-crashes-into-bus/articleshow/85015850.cms||---

When contacted, Singh told TOI that it was just a courtesy meeting with Rajbhar with no political agenda. “We simply met cordially and chatted,” Singh said, refusing to divulge any further details. Highly placed sources in the BJP, however, said that Rajbhar seemed to get the raw pulse of the BJP which has been deftly ignoring him despite his consistent aggressive stance to finger the saffron party and sabotage its ambition of returning to office after the 2022 state elections. The meeting between UP BJP chief and Rajbhar was catalysed by BJP state vicepresident Daya Shankar Singh. Sources said that Daya Shankar called up Rajbhar -- both happen to be residents of Ballia -- on Monday late evening asking him to meet Swatantra Dev. Rajbhar confirmed that it was at the initiative of Daya Shankar that he met Swatantra Dev and discussed activities undertaken by their respective political parties. He, too, categorically denied having any political plan behind his meeting with UP BJP chief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rajbhar-meets-up-bjp-chief-sets-off-rumours/articleshow/85022959.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Aurangabad||Ensure weight check, leak test during LPG refill, say activists||Aurangabad: Consumer rights activists have appealed to citizens to carry out weight checks and leak tests while accepting liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder refills. This advice has been issued in the wake of Satara police registering an offence in connection with the alleged theft of LPG from refill cylinders. Onkar Joshi, the regional secretary of Grahak Panchayat, which is an advocacy group for consumers rights, said ensuring pre-delivery checks is the best option to put an end to theft of LPG during cylinder transportation from the dealer to the doorsteps of consumers. “Leading oil and gas companies, as a part of their SOPs, have already made it mandatory to perform weight checks and leak tests while delivering to consumers. However, a majority of consumers are unaware of such checks. Consumers should exercise their rights and insist on such checks before accepting the cylinder delivery,” he said. As per the public advisory issued by the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, the gross weight of LPG and empty cylinder together should be 29.5 kg. It includes 14.2 kg net weight of LPG and 15.3 kg weight of a cylinder. “Check that the cylinder seal is intact. Your LPG delivery person carries a weighing scale. Always get your refill cylinder weighed in your presence before taking the delivery,” the advisory reads, requesting consumers to contact on helpline 1800-2333-555 in case of any complaints or queries. Sharing feedback from some consumers highlighting that delivery personnel often show reluctance in performing pre-delivery checks, Joshi said consumers should immediately raise such instances of non-cooperation with respective dealers and oil companies. “Some delivery personnel complain of lack of weighing scale and such issues need to be reported through official platforms,” he said. Meanwhile, Satara police have registered an offence under provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and Section 285 (Negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter) of the Indian Penal Code in connection with the alleged LPG theft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ensure-weight-check-leak-test-during-lpg-refill-say-activists/articleshow/84984608.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Agra||Heavy rains settle dust, help Uttar Pradesh breathe good air||AGRA: The incessant showers across the state have not only made the weather pleasant but also managed to wash away pollutants from the air, making it “good” to breathe. The Air Quality Index (AQI) levels across Uttar Pradesh have been oscillating for the last one week between “good” and “satisfactory” categories, in contrast to the earlier “very poor” and “severe” categories. What’s more, fivecities in the state out of the 11 monitored by the Central Pollution Control Board have maintained “good” air quality since July 28. On Tuesday, Agra recorded an AQI of 33, while Bulandshahr was at 39, Firozabad (17), Gorakhpur (18), Kanpur (30), Lucknow (45), Meerut (48) and Varanasi at 44. Baghpat, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida recorded AQI in the “satisfactory” category. Authorities said the AQI usually remains either “very poor” or “severe” across the state but thanks to the rainfall the air is comparatively pollution-free and clean. An AQI between 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor, and 401-500 severe. Since June 20, when the monsoon season officially began in the state, the actual rainfall received till Tuesday was 399 mm, slightly above the normal levels of 386.1. “Monsoon months always see an improvement in air quality across the nation as rain settles the dust particles on the ground,” said Bhuvan Yadav, regional officer of the UP Pollution Control Board in Agra. Earlier, only one air quality monitoring station was functional in Agra at Sanjay Palace to provide pollutants value live but now, four more stations have been added at different places and they will provide PM 2.5, PM 10, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and other pollutants value. “Monitoring helps in assessing the level of pollution in relation to the ambient air quality standards,” said Yadav, adding that one more station will be operational at Shahjahan garden soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/heavy-rains-settle-dust-help-up-breathe-good-air/articleshow/85015842.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Hyderabad||Venkayya remains forgotten in centenary year of National Flag draft design||Hyderabad: Freedom fighter Pingali Venkayya, whose draft flag design led to the birth of the Indian National Flag, remains unsung even in the centenary year of the first-ever official flag design. It was on March 31, 1921 that Venkayya had submitted the design of the flag for Congress at the AICC session in Bezwada (Vijayawada). Mahatma Gandhi had attended the session and on his request Venkayya had come up with the design. The draft design underwent a few changes before it was adopted as the Congress flag, and in 1947, just ahead of the Independence, the Gandhi Charkha was replaced by Ashoka Chakra for the National Flag. Venkayya’ s birthday on August 2 passed off without any major celebrations. Tweets by a couple of politicians marked the so-called celebrations and paying of tributes to the great freedom fighter, who was a polymath. Freedom fighters demand that the Union government honour Venkayya with Bharat Ratna. In fact, the Andhra Pradesh government had passed a resolution seeking the highest civilian award to Venkayya. However, the demand continues to remain on paper with the Centre sitting on the resolution. Archival data reveals AICC and CWC session at Vijayawada was a turning point in the freedom movement. The resolutions adopted at the two-day session held on March 31 and April 1, 1921, apart from the flag design gave the much needed impetus to the freedom struggle. It was at this session that the Swaraj Fund took its final shape. The idea of a flag for the freedom struggle had been haunting Venkayya right from 1916, six years before he came up with the draft design at the AICC session. In fact, Venkayya had penned a book, ‘A National Flag for India’. With help of his colleague-lecturer Evanki Venkata Sastry, a drawing master at National College, Machilipatnam, Venkayya presented the draft design. APCC president, S Sailajanath, said the state and the central government should take up the centenary celebrations of the National Flag on a largescale to inspire the younger generations. “Though it was handed over to Mahatma Gandhi at the AICC session in Vijayawada, the design was indeed the precursor of our Tricolour. It’s time we celebrated the centenary and paid tributes to Venkayya,” he said. G Narayana Rao, president of Andhra Arts Academy, regretted that except for the Indian Railways, which arranged a statue of Venkayya at the Vijayawada Railway Station, there had been no celebrations to mark the centenary of the first design of the National Flag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/venkayya-remains-forgotten-in-centenary-year-of-national-flag-draft-design/articleshow/85020759.cms||Syed Akbar

In her FIR, the woman said that she has been suffering from severe kidney ailment since 2009 after both kidneys failed. Her father later donated a kidney and now she has to undergo treatment every two months, for which she has to spend Rs 12,000 every time, the FIR stated. During the course of treatment, the woman met her husband, a resident of New Ranip area, and had told him everything about her health problems. She claimed that he was ready to marry her in spite of her disease and her parents, who live in the US, too gave their nod for marriage. The FIR state that the duo got married in 2012. But two years down the line, he began to demand money from her, she stated “He demanded Rs 10 lakh saying that we will go to the US for my treatment. As he kept forcing me to bring the money, my father managed to give Rs 9 lakh. However, we did not go to the US even after he got the money,” she said. The FIR further stated that the man started returning home late from office for the past couple of years and would always abuse her if she questioned him. She said that he again started to demand money from her and her parents refused to pay any more. He then left her and began staying at his paternal aunt’s house in Vahelal village in Daskroi taluka of Ahmedabad. The woman finally approached the police and filed a complaint of dowry harassment against her husband, said cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gota-man-seeks-rs-10l-dowry-abandons-kidney-patient-wife/articleshow/85018348.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt, oppn lock horns over Plus One seat availability||Thiruvananthapuram: The government and the opposition locked horns over the availability of Plus One seats in the state, especially in the northern districts, in the wake of high victory percentage in SSLC results this year. While the government said that it will cover up for the shortage through marginal increase of seats, the opposition countered it citing that the government should increase the batches through a policy decision. In his reply to IUML leader M K Muneer who sought leave for adjournment motion in the matter, general education minister V Sivankutty said that while the number of students who got admitted to higher secondary courses last year was 1,65,477, there are 1,40,800 seats available. With a proposed 20% marginal increase in seats in northern districts from Palakkad to Kasaragod, there would be 1,68,960 seats available which is expected to make up for the shortage. He said that the government is ready for discussions with the opposition on a district-wise basis after the first allotment to make up for the shortage. Muneer said that the government should not view the state as a whole and talk about availability of seats in this matter. In addition to the increased number, there would be a flood of students from the Gulf, and also from CBSE and ICSE that will make the situation grave. “Last year, 75,000 students had to depend on open schools. Also, the court has clearly said that marginal increase is not permissible. What we require are new batches through a policy intervention of the government. After 2015-16, no new batches have been allotted in the state,” he said. He said that the number of students eligible for Plus One courses and the actual number of seats available in Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod being cited by the education minister are untrue as it is it much higher than what is being quoted. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said that of the 3,61,000 Plus One seats available, 55,000 are in 361 unaided schools, and this further cuts down the seats available in government schools. Also, the number of students who bagged A-Plus in all subjects for SSLC has tripled from 42,000 last year to 1,12,000 this year. “The high court, while giving relief to the government last year because of Covid-19, had clearly said that the government should make the necessary arrangements by the beginning of the upcoming academic year. Till now, the government has not done anything to address this grave issue,” he said. The opposition later staged a walk-out after speaker M B Rajesh refused to admit the adjournment motion, on the basis of the explanation by the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-oppn-lock-horns-over-plus-one-seat-availability/articleshow/85018417.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Antilia case: Accused paid Rs 45 lakh to kill Mansukh Hiran, NIA tells court||MUMBAI: In extensive arguments seeking 30 more days to submit the chargesheet against the arrested accused, including dismissed policeman Sachin Waze, the National Investigation Agency told the special court on Tuesday that one of the accused had paid Rs 45 lakh to eliminate businessman Mansukh Hiran. On February 25, an explosives-laden Scorpio was found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s SoBo home, Antilia. It is alleged that on March 4, the Scorpio owner Hiran was killed. The prosecution submitted that Hiran was the “weak link” and was aware of the conspiracy. It was also submitted had he been alive, the larger plot would’ve failed. It said Hiran’s phone was switched off for long and later switched on in Palghar before it was destroyed. The prosecution said it wanted to ascertain which of the accused had done this. “It is submitted that the conspirators, in furtherance of the larger conspiracy, had placed a threat note along with gelatin sticks in the vehicle in order to threaten the Ambani family. Subsequently, a threat letter emerged demanding money by Jaish Ul Hind, which is a very serious act. It needs deeper probe regarding terrorist involvement,” the prosecution submitted. The prosecution also submitted that a team in Delhi had recorded statements in a connection with the threat letter. The involvement of Jaish Ul Hind and from where the letter was uploaded on messaging service Telegram was being looked into, the prosecution added. The prosecution said there had been extra judicial confessions made by the accused to friends. It said the accused were involved in a larger conspiracy to commit a terrorist act. It also submitted the accused are dangerous and should not be granted bail. The prosecution claimed that 4-5 witnesses were threatened and given police protection, while a few others had refused to come forward fearing for their lives. “Among the accused are police officers and they know how to dodge the investigating agency..,” the prosecution submitted. It said that so far, statements of over 150 witnesses had been recorded. The prosecution submitted that a witness, a person from a well-known family, had said they were so fearful after the incident that they cancelled a holiday they were to go on the very same day. The prosecution alleged that some of the accused had gone to Nepal and Dubai after Hiran’s murder. It said the gelatin sticks, obtained in loose form, belonged to a Nagpur-based solar company. The prosecution said the NIA now needed to speak to around 50 traders to ascertain how Waze procured it. It was alleged Waze had been misleading the NIA on this aspect. The arguments will continue on Wednesday along with a hearing on Waze’s bail plea, which was earlier rejected by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/accused-paid-rs-45l-to-kill-hiran-nia-tells-court/articleshow/85022976.cms||Rebecca Samervel

One of the victims, Vinod Chedilal Gupta (41) of Baramati, later lodged a complaint with the Talegaon Dabhade police. A case has been registered under sections 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. The two drivers were sleeping in the cabins of their vehicles when the trio arrived to steal their belongings, police said. “Gupta was headed to Pune when he decided to take a break near the food court, while the other truck driver was headed to Mumbai,” inspector Sunil Pinjan of the Talegaon Dabhade police, investigating the case, told TOI. “After parking their trucks on near the petrol pump on the shoulder lanes of the expressway, the two truck drivers fell asleep,” Pinjan said. According to the FIR, one of the three robbers came around 3am and stole a cell phone and some cash from the Mumbai-bound truck driver’s cabin. Following this, they crossed the expressway lanes and reached Gupta’s truck,” he said. Pinjan said, “Gupta was sleeping when one of the three robbers entered the cabin and picked up Gupta’s phone. But Gupta woke up and resisted when the suspect jumped off the cabin. Gupta too jumped out, but the trio picked up rocks and assaulted Gupta,” he said, adding, “Gupta sustained head injuries in the incident. The suspects then fled from the spot.” Pinjan said, “Parking trucks or other four-wheelers even on the shoulder lanes is illegal. We have repeatedly asked the truck drivers not to park their trucks there, but they continue to park and sleep in the cabins. The suspects venture onto the expressway from openings at nullahs and escape via the same route.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/truckers-robbed-of-cash-cellphones-worth-rs-37k-near-urse-food-plaza/articleshow/85018492.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Speaker: House panels empowered to summon, penalize govt officials||Thiruvananthapuram: The assembly committees are empowered to take action against secretaries and government officials who are not cooperating with the committees for their smooth functioning, said speaker M B Rajesh in a ruling on Tuesday. “The assembly committees are empowered to summon the concerned secretary before the committee if they are not providing the necessary details sought by the committee within a stipulated time or bring the matter to the attention of the chief secretary and if that also is not effective, the committees can summon the chief secretary itself,” he said, giving a ruling on a point of order raised by MLA P C Vishnunath about the non-cooperation from government officials during the functioning of the assembly committees. The speaker further said that the committees, being the miniature of the assembly, are also empowered to recommend penal action against the secretaries who are not cooperating with the committees. The speaker said that such complaints of non-cooperation have been repeatedly received on many occasions, and when the necessary details and statements are not received from the government on time, the functioning of the committees will get derailed. The chair further observed that the complaints are being raised when the committees themselves are empowered to take action but such powers are not being utilized. He said that each file pending before an assembly committee affects several lives, and those should be given attention and consideration demanded by them. The assembly committees can function smoothly only with the cooperation of government departments. By ensuring that the functioning of committees is not stalled by citing technical and illogical reasons, it can be ensured that all pending tasks before the committees (except committees relating to financial matters) be completed within 30 months, which is the stipulated period of the assembly committees, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/speaker-house-panels-empowered-to-summon-penalize-govt-officials/articleshow/85018458.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Talking to TOI after the meeting, he said that he has been meeting senior BJP leaders like deputy CMs Keshav Maurya, Dinesh Sharma and ministers Moti Singh and Mahendra Singh even after walking out of the NDA two years ago. He, however, reiterated his party would never have an alliance with BJP again. “I am telling you 100% that there will be no alliance,” he told TOI. When asked if there was nothing political in his visit to Swatantra Dev, why was he accompanied by a senior BJP leader, Rajbhar said: “The fact is that a BJP leader wants to be an MLC. Since he belongs to my district Ballia, I went to the UP BJP chief to lobby for his MLC seat. I didn’t go as a party chief but as friends from the same district.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/went-to-lobby-for-my-friend-in-bjp-rajbhar/articleshow/85023030.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Delhi||Private players to boost oxygen capacity in Delhi||NEW DELHI: With an eye on a likely third Covid-19 wave, Delhi government has been ramping up oxygen production, storage and transportation infrastructure in the city. On Tuesday, the cabinet approved the Medical Oxygen Production Promotion Policy, 2021, which aims at making the capital self-reliant in oxygen production, along with a provision for incentives. In a statement, the government said the policy was aimed at meeting any crisis or medical emergency in the future. “Medical Oxygen Production Promotion Policy, 2021 has been approved. It provides several incentives to the private sector to set up oxygen production plants, invest in tankers, and set up storage facilities. This will help improve oxygen availability in Delhi, which became a huge bottleneck in handling the last Covid wave,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted. As part of the policy objectives, production of medical oxygen would be increased through setting up either new manufacturing enterprises or expanding the production capacity of existing units for uninterrupted oxygen supply to hospitals and nursing homes during a health crisis caused by Covid-19 or any other medical emergency. The target includes setting up of liquid oxygen manufacturing facilities of minimum 50 metric tonnes capacity up to 100 MT, non-captive oxygen generation plants (PSA/ASU technology) of 10 to 50 MT capacity up to 100 MT and captive oxygen generation plants (PSA/ASU) of minimum 500 litres per minute capacity at hospitals and nursing homes with a total capacity of 200 MT. Getting cryogenic oxygen tankers of minimum 10 MT carrying capacity up to a total capacity of 500 MT and setting up of storage tanks of minimum 10 MT capacity up to 1,000 MT would be other targets. Power subsidy would be provided to the oxygen generation plants at Rs 4 per unit for the first five years. Full reimbursement of gross State Goods and Services Tax would be made within a month of commissioning of the plant. Applications for grant of subsidy or incentive shall be invited within 15 days from when the policy is notified. In case the total capacity applied for exceeds the target capacity, the selection shall be made through a draw of lots. In case the total capacity applied for is less, all applications would be considered and a 15-day window for applications would be opened every month till six months from the date of notification of the policy until the target capacity is achieved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/private-players-to-boost-oxygen-capacity/articleshow/85020884.cms||Sidharatha Roy

After a video of the incident went viral, Vashishth downplayed the incident, terming it “politically motivated”. Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Kumar Singh has, however, ordered the local police station to register an FIR in this connection. Rakesh Kumar, IT manager, on the contrary, accused the politician of high-handedness. “Vashishth, along with 30-40 supporters, had come to the toll plaza. We had just asked them to get a local FASTag pass, which is now mandatory, to promote 100% cashless payment, but the politician got angry and barged into our office. He abused us, issued death threats and even slapped our staffers. Later, he forced us to let the vehicle pass without paying the toll for at least half an hour. Everything is on record,” said Kumar. Vashishth, on the other hand, said, “On Monday afternoon, I got information that toll plaza staffers had snatched Aadhaar cards of a few locals who wanted to cross the toll plaza. When I visited there, they misbehaved with me and used improper language for our party and organisation. Even, the video is doctored. Earlier and later parts of the video were deleted so that the complete picture could not emerge and they were not exposed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/viral-video-bjps-nagar-panchayat-chairman-roughs-up-slaps-toll-staffers/articleshow/85015914.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Goa||Ready to drop ‘Bhumiputra’ from bill name, says Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Faced with widespread criticism against the hurriedly-passed Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarni Bill, 2021, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday night conceded one “demand”, and promised to drop the word ‘Bhumiputra’ from the bill.  Sawant, in a recorded statement released on Tuesday night, said the bill would be reintroduced in the winter session of the Goa legislative assembly within the next two months. Acknowledging that there has been lot of apprehension about the legislation, Sawant invited citizens to give suggestions on goaonline.gov.in from Wednesday, and said that “positive suggestions” would be accepted. “I want to clear one thing: the sentiment of the people is attached to ‘bhumiputra’, and the state government is ready to remove the (word) ‘bhumiputra’ from the bill. I give (my) assurance that (the word) bhumiputra will be removed from the bill,” he said. Sawant said that a lot of people have said that the word bhumiputra should not be used in the bill, and that they have told him to remove it. The CM added that these people have no other objection to the bill. These aggrieved persons included BJP’s ST morcha, who told Sawant their sentiments were hurt, prompting the CM to promise them to remove the word. The morcha’s national general secretary, Ramesh Tawadkar, said that the word ‘bhumiputra’ in the name of the bill will “finish” the identity and originality of the ST community in the state, and demanded dropping it. He also said the morcha is not opposing the bill and that “encroachers are Goans and this bill will give them rights”. “Most Goans are covered in the 30-year domicile clause,” he said. “Those who have come from outside must have purchased about 100-150 sq m of land; there would be rare instances where outsiders have encroached on the land.” Defending the bill against an onslaught of criticism and mockery, Sawant said that more than 1.5 lakh houses would be “benefited” through this bill. He added that the bill has been brought in the interest of Goans, and dismissed apprehensions that it would only help migrants. Reacting to the apprehension that people staying in rented houses may become owners, Sawant said those people having water, electricity or house tax in their own name only can make a claim under this bill. “Those staying in leased houses cannot claim under this law,” he said. The chief minister said that there are around 6.5 lakh houses in 191 village panchayats and 14 municipalities, that have electricity connections. “These houses belong to Goans and they have house numbers, water connections and electricity connections, but only 20% of houses are constructed by obtaining licences,” he said. Sawant said that around half of the houses in Goa don’t have the owner’s name on Form I and XIV, and that is the reason why a lot of people have filed cases. “Of the 6.5 lakh houses (in the state), if we consider 50%, then 3 lakh don’t have the owner’s name in Form I and XIV,” he said. He added that around 6,000 houses are facing demolition in villages and municipalities. “If we verify all those 6,000 houses, we come to know that most of the people are Goans, and they are not migrants. We have verified (this),” he said. Sawant said that the government has studied other acts before getting the bill passed, and even conducted a survey of the houses. He said that a related act, the Mundkar Act was notified in the state which gives the right to house, and added that there are many pending cases under that act, too. “More than 3,000 cases are pending under the Mundkar Act,” Sawant said. “The Regularisation of Houses Act was passed in 2014, and under this, 8,000 people have applied and 500 cases have been disposed, the remaining cases are pending because of amendments to the TCP act. We have also amended the TCP Act and the remaining cases would be resolved,” Sawant said. Sawant said that the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill, 2021, is brought to cover those people who do not come under the Mundkar act and Regularization of Houses Act, and who have houses on government land, comunidade land and private land. “With this bill, we can bring the name of people directly into Form I & XIV, and they can get land rights and get their house regularised,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ready-to-drop-bhumiputrafrom-bill-name-says-sawant/articleshow/85020872.cms||---

According to Sola police, A team of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) cattle nuisance control department had on the afternoon of July 30 found an ox standing on the footpath near Damru Circle in the Chanakyapuri area. The team recovered the ox and sent a notice to its owner, Ajay Patni, a vegetable vendor from Ghatlodia, for leaving his animal negligently. The AMC team later informed the cops and they began an inquiry against the owner. During the inquiry, police concluded that Patni had made his ox stand in a way which obstructed the path of commuters and violated traffic rules. Police personnel said the owner also showed cruelty to the animal by keeping it by the road and not at a safe place. Patni said he always stations his ox by the roadside in a way that it won’t obstruct traffic. He said he keeps it away from his vegetable cart so that it would does not eat his vegetables and cause him a loss. Police justified their action saying that vehicles or animals cannot be left on the roadside on footpath because they may obstruct others’ way. Police filed such cases on the basis of complaints by the AMC authorities earlier too. In September 2019, Ellisbridge police had booked a horse owner for tethering it near the flyover near Gujarat College and obstructing others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ox-at-roadside-owner-booked-for-violation/articleshow/85018451.cms||---

A cache of finished and unfinished arms and the machinery used in manufacturing the weapons were seized. Police said the preliminary investigation brought to the fore that the weapons manufactured at the unit were being sold across the Agra region. Superintendent of police Botre Rohan Pramod said, “Following a tip-off, a police team raided the illegal firearm factory on Tuesday morning. Six finished and unfinished weapons, a large stock of machinery and raw material needed for the manufacturing arms and ammunition were seized and two men operating the unit were arrested. The accused were booked under the Arms Act at Patiali police station and sent to jail.” Police identified the accused as Dev Singh and Ramkishore, residents of Kasganj district, who had a previous criminal history. Divulging the gang’s modus operandi, station house officer Ganga Prasad said it would cost them around Rs 500 to manufacture a gun. “They used to manufacture at least four guns every day. Using their contacts, they would supply the weapons for around Rs 5,000 in Agra, Etah, Firozabad, Mainpuri and other districts of Agra and Aligarh divisions. We are trying to identify their contacts and customers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/illegal-firearms-manufacturing-unit-busted-in-kasganj-two-arrested/articleshow/85015970.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Delhi||Court junks ‘publicity’ plea against use of EVMs||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday dismissed, with a cost of Rs 10,000, a plea seeking direction to the Election Commission to stop the use of electronic voting machines (EVM) and revert to ballot papers in the forthcoming polls in the country. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh termed the petition by C R Jaya Sukin a “publicity interest litigation” based on hearsay and “baseless allegations and averments”. It pointed out, “Nothing argued by the petitioner (Sukin) concretely on the working of the EVM. We see no reason to entertain the writ petition.” It noted that the petition was based on four documents, out of which one was a news item and others pertained to his representation and plea before the Supreme Court, and Sukin himself had no knowledge about EVMs at all. “The petitioner has read the news item and filed the writ petition without looking at the EVM...which is approved by the Election Commission as well as Parliament,” the court said adding that the petition “is dismissed with costs of Rs 10,000 to be deposited in four weeks towards Delhi State Legal Services Authority.” The commission said that different courts in the country have already examined and decided the issue. Sukin, who appeared in-person, argued that “democracy was in danger” by the use of EVM as the machine was prone to be hacked. He submitted that several countries, including Japan and the US, have chosen the ballot system of voting and shunned the use of EVMs for their election process. “EVM was made by other countries and even those countries are not using. USA last November held elections and even during the Covid pandemic, they used ballot,” Sukin told the court. “Article 324 of the Constitution of India states that elections conducted by Election commission need to be free and fair, and reflect the will of the voters. The EVMs must be replaced across India with traditional ballot papers. Voting through ballot papers is a more reliable and transparent method for the electoral process of any country,” the plea had argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-junks-publicity-plea-against-use-of-evms/articleshow/85020988.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||In GCET, top physics score drops by 11 marks||PANAJI: The maximum score by a student in physics at the 2021 Goa common entrance test (GCET), the results for which were declared on Tuesday, was 59 out of 75. But officials attributed the dip in score to ‘normal fluctuations’, and said that it was in no way connected to the pandemic. In 2020, 70 was the best score in physics. VN Shet, chairman of the GCET 2021 committee, said that many students had not attempted questions, probably due to confusion as exams like NEET and JEE have negative marking for wrong answers, while GCET doesn’t have the rule. However, having a combined score 131 out of 150 in physics and mathematics, Panaji resident Swatit Rau Valaulicar emerged at the top, and is eligible to seek admissions to any engineering college and stream of his choice in the state. The student of Mushtifund Aryaan Higher Secondary School, however, said that he aims to join a national institute. “I am going to answer BITSAT and JEE (Advanced), and depending on the results, I will decide on which stream I want to pursue,” said Swatit, son of civil engineer Shripad Rau Valaulicar and homemaker Shambhavi. Along with Swatit, Joshua Barreto, Sairaj Ghosarwadkar and Manali Manjarekar had the best Maths score of 73 out of 75 in GCET. Sairaj had the top score of 70 in the state in chemistry, while Aditya Bhat had the best score of 59 in physics. The GCET, the qualifying exam for entry to engineering and pharmacy degree seats in Goa, was answered by 2,829 students in all, said director of technical education Vivek Kamat. The test was held across 16 centres this year on July 29 and 30, after delay in its conduct due to the pandemic situation. “Last year, 2,954 students registered and 2,817 appeared for GCET, so there has been no impact on the numbers due to the pandemic,” said Kamat, responding to a question. He said that AICTE has permitted engineering colleges to begin classes for first year students by October 25, by which time the admission process in Goa will be complete. Kamat said that the drop in top score in physics as against last year’s was due to “normal fluctuations” and could not be linked to the pandemic in any way. “Every year, the students are different, the papers are different and the situations are different,” he said. Bhat said that at least around 100 students were seen skipping questions they were not sure of at GCET 2021, which could have affected their score. “The students need to be guided properly by teachers. At NEET and JEE, there is negative marking if you attempt a question and your answer turns out to be wrong. For GCET, there is no negative marking,” said Bhat. Chairman of the admission committee, Dipak Gaitonde, said that the process of accepting applications for admission to degree programmes is expected to start from next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-gcet-top-physics-score-drops-by-11-marks/articleshow/85020951.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh sets the bar higher with 27 lakh Covid jabs in a day||LUCKNOW: In a new record, Uttar Pradesh performed more than 27 lakh Covid-19 vaccine jabs on Tuesday. This is by far the largest number of doses given by a state in a single day in India. With this, UP became the first state to have extended more than 5 crore doses of the vaccine. So far, Madhya Pradesh held the record of maximum vaccinations in a day –16.9 lakh on June 21. Health officials say that UP's Tuesday feat has surpassed the single-day vaccination record of many countries. Tweeting about the state's achievement, CM Yogi Adityanath said: “Vaccine is the best defence against the pandemic infection which is changing its forms to attack people. It must be adequately complemented with the Covid-19 appropriate behavior.” Data from the CoWin Portal updated till midnight pm indicated that 27.34 lakh doses of the vaccine had been given between 9 am and 6 pm on Tuesday. Over two lakh health workers were engaged in the process that involved nearly 12,600 vaccination sites. In terms of total doses extended, Maharashtra is UP’s nearest contender with 4.52 crore doses so far. It is followed by Gujarat and Rajasthan where 3.44 crore and 3.36 crore vaccine doses have been given. In terms of age group, 2.44 crore persons in the 18-44 years age group have taken at least one jab while 1.63 crore persons have got a minimum of one dose in the 45-60 years age group. More than 1.05 crore elderly persons in the state have taken the jab. Health sources said that CM Yogi Adityanath was monitoring the hourly progress of the vaccination programme since morning. Health and family welfare minister Jai Pratap Singh said: “The feat speaks about the kind of hard work UP has put in towards accelerating vaccination in the state. The vision and political leadership has been aptly taken forward by the officials and field staff. ” “Given adequate supply, UP can conduct more than 20 lakh vaccinations in a day and more than three crore vaccinations in a month. With the current pace of vaccination, UP can vaccinate its entire population in a matter of 8-10 weeks,” said Dr Praful Bharadwaj, health officer, Unicef, UP. Meanwhile, 65 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours. The death toll reached 22,765 with two new additions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-sets-the-bar-higher-with-27-lakh-covid-jabs-in-a-day/articleshow/85023100.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Pune||Maharashtra: 99.63% students clear HSC exam, graduate admissions to get tougher||PUNE: As was the case with Std X and Std XII of other education boards, the results announced by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education for higher secondary certificate (HSC, Std XII) examination on Tuesday fell into the same extraordinary high scoring pattern. All nine education divisions in the state recorded over 99% pass percentage in the results announced online. The links worked well on Tuesday, unlike the fiasco for the SSC results when they were inaccessible for over six hours due to heavy traffic. The overall pass percentage for Maharashtra in the nine divisions was 99.63 with Konkan division, by virtue of having fewer students registered as compared to other divisions, topping Maharashtra with 99.81. The results this year have improved by 8.97% thereby creating a tough race in the admissions to graduate degrees where HSC marks are considered for merit. The 90s club also swelled as compared to last year. The jump in the results is also because of the increase in the pass percentage in English, which rose by 9.98%. It leapt from 89.96% in 2020 to 99.94% this year. The rise for other subjects was by about 2-3%. The highest pass percentage of 99.97 was in mathematics. The results also threw up other interesting statistics. Over 13.1 lakh students appeared for the examination and only 4,789 students failed. From 7,344 students last year who scored above 90% marks, the number rose to 91,420. Forty-six students scored a 100% while there were 12 students who managed to pass with 35%. In a first, not a single school had zero results, an indication that all the registered students passed, and among the 160 subjects for which the students were assessed, 70% subjects had cent per cent results. The pass percentage of the arts stream registered the highest improvement of 17.2% over last year. Chairman of the state board, Dinkar Patil, said, “The students were marked based on their performance in standards X, XI and XII internal marks as the offline exams could not be conducted due to the Covid-19 crisis. The recent floods in the Konkan region delayed the results by 2-3 days as the marks compilation in nine districts took a major hit. Overall, as expected, the results have been very good and we will now focus on the FYJC entrance exam scheduled on August 11.” Among the four streams, commerce had highest pass percentage of 99.91 followed by arts (99.83), science (99.45) and higher secondary vocational education (98.80). Science has the least improvement in pass percentage over last year from 96.93 to 99.45, of 2.52 % as against 2020. The number of students who had registered for Form 17 for external examination was 26,332 and their pass percentage recorded was 99.44. This year, the number of students enrolling for the exam also dipped by nearly one lakh as against last year when 14.1 lakh students appeared for the written exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/99-63-students-clear-hsc-exam-grad-admissions-to-get-tougher/articleshow/85020966.cms||Ardhra Nair

The status report mentioned that the hospital management, in replies filed before police, said that the hospital was starved of oxygen and it was a matter of record that M/s Inox supplied 3.8 MT oxygen on April 22 at 5.30pm. The refill was done by Inox at 5.30pm on April 23, which resulted in a crisis situation. It further stated that the situation was unprecedented and amounted to an acute emergency occasioned by shortage of oxygen. “This has never happened in the history of the hospital that the entire regular supply had to be switched to reserves in the form of cylinders. The refill was done around 11.45pm with 2.11 metric tonnes against the 24-hour quota of 3.6 metric tonnes,” the hospital told police. Prior to the fateful night, the hospital stated that the average mortality of Covid-19 patients in 24 hours was two and 21 deaths within a span of 7-8 hours was “an unusually high number, that too spread over different critical care areas”. “There appeared to be a linkage between the unusually high number of deaths and deficient oxygen supply. Subsequently, after the intervening night of April 23-24, the average mortality per day was three. After initial scrutiny of the reason of the death of patients, it appeared that in four cases there was drop of oxygen pressure around 9.45pm on April 23, which is an unusual occurrence. However, it is also a fact that these patients were on ventilator,” added the hospital. The hospital’s medical director stated that the committee constituted by Delhi government to ascertain the cause of deaths opined that they were due to natural reasons and couldn’t be attributed to shortage of oxygen. Police, in its status report, said, “On scrutiny of death summaries, it was revealed that no death of any patient was caused due to shortage of oxygen.” It added that as the allegations were against doctors and medical staff, the opinion regarding any medical negligence had been sought from Delhi Medical Council, which was awaited. The plea, filed through advocates Sahil Ahuja and Siddhant Sethi, on behalf of six family members of deceased patients, had alleged that the management of the hospital had committed the offences of murder, cheating, fraud, criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation and gross medical negligence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-o2-death-at-jaipur-golden-hosp-cops/articleshow/85020974.cms||Usha Das

Replying to a submission by MLA Sachin Dev in this regard, local self-government and excise minister M V Govindan Master who replied on behalf of the chief minister, said that the government has registered eight cases in this regard and they are under probe. The government is taking strong action against such anti-social elements, but there are limitations as several such platforms used for education are created outside the country. He said that the dangers about these matters can be taken to the students only through strong awareness measures. The Cyberdome, which is the nodal agency that is making crucial interventions, is already undertaking cyber patrolling, conducting security tests in government and semi-government websites, etc. There are also cases where child pornographic material is being shared on social media and platforms like darknet. It was found that these include the pictures of children from the state too. Because of this, children and their parents are being given counselling, along with removing vulgar material from such platforms. The government has also brought to the attention of service providers the need to remove several applications, including games that are misleading children while using digital equipment, and is undertaking necessary awareness campaigns against the ill-effects of those, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/probe-on-into-vulgar-posts-in-online-class-groups-says-govt/articleshow/85018506.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Patients testing -ve for chikungunya & dengue to now be tested for Zika virus||PUNE: Patients with fever testing negative for dengue and chikungunya in state will be tested for Zika virus to closely monitor and check the newly emerging cases of viral infection by expanding the scope of laboratory diagnosis across the state. A network of 57 laboratories has been readied for Zika virus detection across the country. Of these, six laboratories are in Maharashtra, including Indira Gandhi Government Medical College in Nagpur, Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai, and Haffkine Institute for Training, Research Testing in Mumbai. Three more government-designated sentinel centres will be activated for Zika virus detection.  “In addition to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) — the apex lab for Zika virus detection — six labs in Maharashtra will start testing every negative dengue/chikungunya sample for the virus. These labs are equipped to function as Zika testing centres in addition to their routine diagnostic work in vector-borne diseases,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate told TOI. For this, these labs would be supplied with the testing kits needed for conducting the RT-PCR test through the NIV in a day or two, Awate said. The mosquito that transmits the Zika virus — Aedes aegypti — also transmits dengue and chikungunya viruses, widely prevalent in Maharashtra. “The patients found negative for dengue and chikungunya will be included in testing for Zika infection. Besides, patients conforming to the case definition for probable or suspected Zika virus infection would be considered for Zika testing,” Awate said. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s Delhi-based National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) are the apex laboratories for investigation of outbreak and confirmation of laboratory diagnosis of Zika virus in India. The RT-PCR test is the standard test for the detection of Zika. As of now, there is no commercially available test for Zika virus disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-patients-testing-ve-for-chikungunya-dengue-to-now-be-tested-for-zika-virus/articleshow/85023112.cms||Umesh Isalkar

No surprise then that despite best efforts, coronavirus infection has been spreading in the state during the second wave and the most vulnerable are senior citizens with co-morbidities who more often catch infection from others at home and then end up in hospital in a critical condition. Recently, even the Covid central team that visited the state stated that 65% of infections in the state were home-based ones, and hence steps should be taken to bring them down. The online study, “A cross sectional study on geriatrics during Covid-19 pandemic” published in European Journal of Pharmaceutical and Medical Research was conducted to understand reverse quarantine (wherein the elderly remained separate from the rest of their household to avoid contracting the infection from them) followed by those aged above 60. Though all age groups are at risk of getting Covid-19, older people face significant risk of developing severe illness if they contract the disease. In Kerala, almost 97% of those studied had their own home as a centre of reverse quarantine. The study shows that in Kerala that has been promoting reverse quarantine for the elderly, everyone accepts its importance to reduce Covid risk, but only 50% agreed to be in reverse quarantine. Almost 82 % of those studied said the elderly should not come in contact with other family members who go out regularly but very few adhered to it. Though the study was conducted immediately after the first wave, it is relevant even now as home clusters remain a major concern in the state. “If during the second wave, senior citizens had strictly adhered to reverse room quarantine, the infection rate would have been controlled. Government should educate our elderly population more about the importance of reverse quarantine to control the pandemic,” said Dr Santhosh Kumar SS, deputy superintendent, Government Medical College, Trivandrum, who is also part of the study. “Reverse quarantine is very-much needed in Kerala as we have a large population aged above 60 and majority have been in reverse quarantine at home. But at home they don't maintain safe distance from those who go out of the house. With still a large vulnerable population in the state and Delta variant being the dominant, people need to strictly adhere to reverse quarantine even at home,” added Manju Nair, honorary director, Centre for Agroecology and Public Health, Kerala University and co-author of the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/study-bares-need-to-focus-on-elderly/articleshow/85018515.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Business||NITI unlikely to issue fresh list for selloff||NEW DELHI: Government think tank NITI Aayog is unlikely to recommend a fresh set of state-run companies for privatisation for the time being and is expected to wait to see progress of the companies already identified for privatisation, sources said. NITI Aayog, which has been entrusted with the job of identifying public sector units for privatisation, had wanted to undertake a regular review of the progress of the asset sales programme. But the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which manages the disinvestment programme, has pointed out to the government think tank that such a review is not possible and have cited business rules to support its argument. DIPAM has said that the core group of secretaries already undertakes a review of the disinvestment programme and the CEO of NITI Aayog is part of the process, said sources aware of the development. NITI Aayog has already submitted a list for the privatisation of two banks, one insurance company as well as other state run companies. But progress on these have been limited for a raft of reasons, including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the sale process. The government is keen to accelerate the process and NITI Aayog’s request for a review of the progress may have been triggered by the anxiety to fast track the process, which is seen as crucial for the current year to raise much needed revenues. The privatisation of the two state-run banks and an insurance company are unlikely to happen in the current financial year as several issues, including legislative changes remain to be tied up. The government’s focus right now is on the listing of state-run insurance giant LIC and there are expectations that it should be completed by the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year, which ends in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/niti-unlikely-to-issue-fresh-list-for-selloff/articleshow/85024814.cms||Surojit Gupta

On the second day of the drive, too, the officials imposed Rs 1 lakh as fine on the violators. After reaching Jawahar Nagar Camp, the teams started checking shops, most of which were grocery stores. Around 8 quintals of plastic carry-bags were seized from a shop. A challan of Rs 20,000, which is the maximum, was issued to the shopkeeper. The news of teams raiding the shops created panic in the area.The officials said there would be a crackdown on factories manufacturing plastic carry-bags, too. MC secretary Jasdev Sekhon said, “The challaning drive will continue for long. We will now devise new strategies as shopkeepers are aware of the ongoing drive. We plan to involve the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials, too, so that they could reach out to the manufacturers. This will help ensure complete check on plastic carry-bags.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/day-2-of-drive-1100kg-plastic-carry-bags-seized/articleshow/85016075.cms||---

The proposal will be sent to the state irrigation department after the approval of the general body of the PMC. Hemant Rasne, standing committee chairman, said that the civic body has been following up on the issue with the state government. Funds have been set aside in the civic budget to carry out a detailed study of the project. Rasne said, “The city was approved 11.5TMC quota of water in 2005. After that the quota had not been revised even though the city’s population went up significantly during the same period. A proposal to revise city’s water quota to 18.58 TMC had been submitted to the state irrigation department. A committee was constituted by the Devendra Fadnavis-led state government to study the proposal to fetch water from Mulshi for the city. We are following up with the state government on the committee’s report”. Flyover on Sinhagad Road The standing committee also approved a flyover on Sinhagad Road at a cost of Rs118.37 crore. Two flyover wings have been proposed to ease traffic on Sinhagad Road at Rajaram bridge chowk towards Vadgaon and another flyover wing towards Swargate. A Metro project has been proposed on Sinhagad Road. Rasne said that necessary provisions would be made for building Metro pillars and related services while constructing the flyover to avoid chaos during Metro construction work. Funds have been set aside for the project in the last two civic budgets, Rasne said. The standing committee also approved appointment of a consultant to conduct a survey of overhead and underground cables laid in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-panel-approves-proposal-seeking-5tmc-water-for-city-from-mulshi-dam/articleshow/85018532.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana government agrees for CJI’s mediation plan on Krishna water dispute||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government is ready for mediation on resolving the dispute over apportioning Krishna water with Andhra Pradesh (AP). Telangana irrigation officials will appear before Chief Justice of India (CJI) Justice NV Ramana on Wednesday and likely convey the state’s readiness for mediation on the river water dispute. CJI Ramana had on Monday suggested that the two Telugu states resolve the watersharing issue amicably through mediation and he even offered to supervise the mediation process. He asked advocates of both states to inform their decision on mediation by Wednesday. Sources in the government said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the irrigation officials to go to Delhi and submit before the apex court that the government was ready for mediation and always believes in resolving issues amicably as both states should benefit from the river water. On the CM’s direction, the irrigation officials, including special chief secretary Rajat Kumar, engineer-in-chief C Muralidhar and some legal experts, discussed the issue on Tuesday evening. Officials said the Telangana government came forward to resolve the water issues with AP and CM KCR had even invited his Andhra counterpart, YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, to Pragathi Bhavan soon after the latter assumed charge as chief minister in 2019. “The state government had proposed linking Godavari and Krishna rivers, which would benefit both the states. A committee, comprising chief engineers of both the states, was formed and two meetings were held on the proposals. But suddenly, there was no response from AP after October 2019. Apart from announcing Rayalaseema lift irrigation scheme (RLIS) unilaterally by Jagan in the AP assembly, his government had issued a GO in January 2020,” a senior official in the chief minister’s office (CMO) said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-agrees-for-cjis-mediation-plan-on-krishna-water-dispute/articleshow/85021011.cms||Koride Mahesh

Replying to a submission by MLA K N Unnikrishnan, LSG and excise minister M V Govindan who replied on behalf of the CM, said that the petroleum and natural gas regulatory board has entrusted Indian Oil-Adani Gas Pvt Ltd with distribution of natural gas in Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod. Necessary arrangements have been made in all these districts to ensure that natural gas is supplied to the company for distribution in these districts. He said that at present, there are 10 CNG stations each in Ernakulam and Thrissur, four in Kozhikode, three in Malappuram and one each in Palakkad and Kannur. The board has entrusted the company Atlantic Gulf and Pacific (AG&P) for distribution of natural gas in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Alappuzha districts which are not covered by the GAIL pipeline. The two companies have initiated necessary steps for supplying gas connections for domestic and industrial purposes in 11 districts under the city gas distribution project. Presently, 3,761 domestic connections have been provided and by 2022, as many as 54,000 gas connections for domestic purposes will be completed, he said. The Kochi-Koottanad-Bengaluru-Manguluru GAIL pipeline project has provided fillip to the state’s industrial development, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/over-600-cng-stations-will-be-set-up-in-5-yrs/articleshow/85018562.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Give elderly jab at home: Plea in Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought the Centre and Delhi government’s reply on a plea filed by an 84-year-old woman seeking door-to-door Covid vaccination for bedridden senior citizens in the city. The plea also sought direction to introduce a helpline number for registration of Covid-19 for such senior citizens. Dhiraj Aggarwal, an octogenarian, through the petition stated that the elderly and bedridden citizens were unable to physically go to the vaccination centres and, therefore, become vulnerable to the infection. “The petitioner is also suffering from arthritis and is mostly bedridden. For her to get up and go to the vaccine centre and to wait for her turn to get a vaccine is not possible. Due to her condition, she could not get any shot of the Covid vaccine till date,” said the plea. The petition highlighted that many fellow super senior and bedridden citizens, who were vulnerable to Covid-19, did not have private transport to reach the vaccination centre or even a family member, who would help them with the registration process on the CoWin application. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued notice on the petition, which argued that it was the obligation of the authorities to introduce a helpline and door-to-door vaccination, and not doing so was against the right to life. The petition said certain states, such as Jharkhand, had already begun door-to-door campaigns for vaccination. “Many countries like Singapore, Australia already have systems in place to vaccinate old age and bedridden citizens at their homes by sending a team comprising a doctor and a nurse at home to administer the vaccine shot,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/give-elderly-jab-at-home-plea-in-hc/articleshow/85021087.cms||---

Rama (65), wife of Anand Teltumbde, Minal (48), wife of Surendra Gadling and Sharad Gaikwad, friend of Sudhir Dhavale filed the petition, which is likely to be heard for the first time on August 6. They contended that the earlier superintendent allegedly breached the prison manual to make the stay of the 10 Elgar case accused lodged in Taloja on orders of the special NIA court “as irksome as possible’’ and sought to transfer them “as an act of victimization as they have demanded their rights’’. They challenged an order of April 1, 2021, permitting transfer of inmates without offering them a hearing. They contended that the former Taloja prison superintendent had been “attempting to transfer them by dividing and sending them to separate jails’’ based on “ex parte orders’’ of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) court. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wives-of-2-elgar-accused-seek-to-quash-transfer/articleshow/85023161.cms||---

Tension escalated when the Bhartiya Kisan Union members insisted on protesting at the spot against the BJP for not rolling back the farm bills and raised slogans when party’s leaders came out of the hotel after the meeting. The party workers rushed towards the farmers with sticks, but cops intervened and a clash was avoided. The BJP leaders condemned the Congress government for its failure in managing law and order situation to an extent that a political party was not allowed to hold a meeting. They said these were not farmers because farmers were working in the fields.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/confrontation-between-bjp-workers-farmers-outside-hotel/articleshow/85016041.cms||---

BJP, too, if it wanted to show its strength, could hold a protest outside someone’s house, but has refrained from doing so, he said. “Protesting outside the secretariat or even Azad Maidan is totally acceptable, but this new trend of taking a protest to someone’s residence is not proper,” Tanavade told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting with National BJP secretary Daggubati Purandeswari at the North Goa BJP office, on Monday. Also present were North Goa district president Mahanand Asnodkar, Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza and Damodar Naik, among others. “Taking a protest to the chief minister’s house in Sakhali to show your strength is undemocratic. We can also show our strength by taking out protest rallies, but we have maintained discipline in our party,” Tanavade said. Speaking on the Bhumiputra Bill, Purandeswari said that BJP passed it “only for those who are staying in Goa for 30 years to get their houses legalised and not for outsiders”. On the Benaulim gangrape case, Purandeswari said that the chief minister did not say that not only the government, but also parents should take care of their children. “BJP government is sensitive on the issue and action will be taken and justice will be delivered,” Purandeswari said. On high fuel prices, she said why is the central government being pressured over the issue and why aren't the state governments reducing the taxes on fuel. “State governments should also think about it as it is their responsibility also,” Purandeswari said. She said that many parties are coming together to defeat BJP, but the people of Goa will have to think wisely as to which party can work for them’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/trend-of-protesting-outside-cms-house-undemocratic-tanavade/articleshow/85021236.cms||---
---||Guwahati||90.54% pass CBSE Class X from Guwahati zone||GUWAHATI: The evaluation formula for the CBSE Class X results has been disappointing for the northeastern states. While most of the regions in the country scored over 99 pass percentage, the Guwahati zone was at the bottom of the region-wise tally with a success rate of 90.54%. Mostly ‘low-performance’ by state government schools in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim has pushed the Guwahati region to the bottom of the tally despite the distinctive success of the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs), Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) and independent or private schools in the region. The central government-run JNVs produced the best results in the Guwahati region with the highest 99.96 pass percentage, followed by KVs (99.95%) and private schools (99.05%). At 77.70%, government schools, mostly spread in the two NE states, had the lowest pass percentage. Arunachal and Sikkim do not have their own school education boards. Thus, all schools under the state governments are affiliated to CBSE. A total of 66,681 candidates registered for the Class X exam from the northeast and 54,860 passed. A total of 4,731 candidates have been placed in the compartment category, while 1,000 students failed. “The results have been statistically prepared this year. Maybe the students in Arunachal and Sikkim, with difficult terrains, could not perform well in internal assessment tests because of lack of online connectivity for learning during the pandemic,” KK Choudhury, director of CBSE northeast regional office told TOI. He said the two northeastern states have schools in some of the remotest parts of the country where internet connectivity is still the biggest issue. What could have also brought down the Guwahati region could be the board’s decision to decide on the fate of 6,090 students later. This accounts for 9.13% of registered candidates from the region whose results have been put on hold due to various discrepancies. These discrepancies were detected mostly in the results of students from schools which were sending students for the CBSE exams for the first time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/90-54-pass-cbse-class-x-from-guwahati-zone/articleshow/85016912.cms||---
---||Goa||New bhumiputras will deprive Goans of jobs based on cert: Cong||Panaji: Congress on Tuesday said that the controversial Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill “is not only affecting rights of persons in dwelling houses, but will also affect all Goans hopeful and waiting for jobs because these new Bhumiputras will claim and be given jobs based on these certificates”. The party charged BJP with bringing in the bill to “create a divide and start fights among Goans and divert attention from the gross failure of the Pramod Sawant government”. Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar accused the BJP government of “bulldozing various bills without discussions and murdering democracy”. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat told reporters that 13 bills were passed with no time to discuss or study them. “We believe the bills are basically a political stunt before the 2022 elections to lure people,” Kamat said. “BJP knows that if this bill becomes law, it will not stand the test of judicial scrutiny and therefore it is clear that it will only fool the people in the forthcoming elections,” stated the party’s legal cell chairman and former attorney general of Goa Adv Carlos Ferreira. The party will lead a ‘Bhumiputra Yatra’ in the chief minister’s constituency with 10,000 Goans to “protect the identity of Goa if the government doesn’t take corrective measures in the next fifteen days”, Chodankar said, adding that BJP has “mastered the act of midnight dacoity on democracy”. Congress will form the government in 2022 and bring progressive laws in the interest of the Bahujan Samaj, Kamat said. Kamat said the party lodged their written protest before the speaker on the government’s decision to curtail the assembly session and demanded that the bills be referred to the select committees, which would have allowed all stakeholders to give their opinion. The bills were not circulated 48 hours in advance, but a few hours prior to the session, Kamat said. Architect and former sarpanch of Benaulim, Royla Fernandes demanded that the BJP government come out with statistics and data of all houses that will benefit from the new legislations and said BJP is trying to overpower the rights of panchayats and municipalities. The party also placed on record that the government has failed to hold the Assembly session even for a minimum of 30 days in 2020 and 2021. “The assembly session in 2020 was held for just 7 days and this year so far the sitting of the assembly has taken place just for 11 days,” the party stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-bhumiputras-will-deprive-goans-of-jobs-based-on-cert-cong/articleshow/85021127.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida towers built on green area palpably wrong: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Raising questions on real estate company Supertech's decision to build two additional 40-storey towers in one of its housing projects in Noida, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said it was "palpably" wrong as construction was done on green area and that it would examine all aspects and options before taking a final decision. At the fag end of day-long hearing on Supertech’s plea against the Allahabad High Court order to demolish the two towers, when senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the company, contended that there was no illegality, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said, “It is palpably wrong ... Buildings were constructed on what was green area.” Singh, however, said he would prove that there was no violation of law and all rules and regulations were complied with. “It is unfortunate that Residents’ Welfare Association of the project is terrorising the builder,” he said. The demolition order was passed by the HC on RWA’s plea which alleged that the twin towers were illegal. Facing a tricky situation on how to deal with the alleged illegal construction of twin towers as their demolition may damage the adjacent smaller buildings just 8 metres away within the project and also buildings of neighbouring societies, the bench said it may also consider passing an order to take away all the profits made by the builder in the project. The towers, comprising over 900 flats, were declared illegal by the Allahabad High Court in 2017. It had directed their demolition and the builder was ordered to refund the amount to homebuyers who had booked flats in those two towers in its Emerald Court Project in Sector 93A in Noida. The builder thereafter approached the apex court which stayed the demolition of towers but directed the company to refund the amount to buyers who wanted their money back. Senior advocate Jayant Bhushan, appearing for the RWA, told the bench that there was a clear collusion between Noida authorities and the builder in allowing the illegal construction. He said construction was allowed despite the objections raised by the chief fire officer who had said that building additional towers would reduce the distance between towers which would be in violation of fire safety norms. He said that "monstrous" buildings were constructed blocking light, air circulation for the residents in adjacent towers and construction was done on their garden area which was common for all flat owners. Bhushan said fake documents were placed before the HC and both the Noida authority and builder kept changing their stand as per convenience. Advocate Gaurav Agrawal, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, said demolition of the two towers could be a very difficult task and it could also destabilize the adjacent buildings. He said it would also be difficult for homebuyers to get refund of their investment from Supertech and pleaded that all options be explored to come out of the tricky situation. "Bringing down the building would be a disaster for adjoining buildings and environment. The demolition has to be done brick by brick which is impossible," Agrawal said. He suggested that the affected flat owners could be compensated and they could also be shifted to other housing projects. But the bench said it would be difficult as consent of all 650 flat owners would be needed. The hearing remained inconclusive and would resume on Wednesday when Supertech's counsel would counter the allegations levelled by RWA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/twin-towers-on-green-area-palpably-wrong-says-sc/articleshow/85021079.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

---||Pune||Couple surrender in road rage case, with bail shield in Pune||PUNE: Hadapsar developer Sumit Tilekar (37) and his wife, Shraddha (27), surrendered before the Wanowrie police on Monday, three days after a young woman wrestler suffered a fracture on her left forearm in a road rage incident on Friday. Tilekar was accused of abusing and attacking the victim, Vaishnavi Thube (23), with a stick following a dispute over his SUV grazing the leg of her sister-in-law, Pranjal Chattar, at Fatima Nagar Chowk. Chattar was riding pillion on Thube’s scooter. Tilekar and his wife had filed a bail plea on Saturday before the Pune Cantonment court, which allowed it. “The couple surrendered at the Bhairobanala police chowkey on Monday evening. We arrested and released them according to the court’s bail order. We have seized the stick and the SUV. We have invoked charges under sections 326 and 506 (2) of the IPC after the injured victim furnished a medical certificate showing that her forearm was fractured,” said sub-inspector Bhushan Potwade. Tilekar told TOI, “The woman’s bike had grazed my car, but she picked up a dispute, accusing me of grazing her pillion rider’s leg. She intercepted my car and sat on the bonnet, misbehaved with me and pushed my wife. We pleaded with her to let us travel because my son was seriously ill, but she did not relent. I was in a hurry to meet the doctor. I hit the woman with a stick because I mistook her as a boy. We have shared details with the police. The woman has made false allegations. We shall be registering a counter-complaint against her after consulting our lawyer.” Thube said, “The car had grazed the legs of my sister-in-law. I had asked the SUV driver to drive slowly, but he abused me. My sister-in-law told him not to misbehave with a woman, but he brutally attacked me. I did not misbehave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/couple-surrender-in-road-rage-case-with-bail-shield/articleshow/85018611.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Doctor attacked at Parassala, four held||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: There is no respite for the attacks against the doctors in the state and the latest incident has been reported from Parassala in Thiruvananthapuram. Dr Sanoj, who was on duty at the Parassala taluk hospital on Monday night, was attacked by a gang of four people. All four have been arrested following protests from doctors in the hospital. The doctors stayed away from the duty in the morning and demanded the arrest of the assailants if they have to rejoin duty. “We had to boycott the duty to put the authorities under pressure which has resulted in the arrest of the four people,” said Dr Unnikrishnan, superintendent of the hospital. The incident occurred at 11pm on Monday when a group of four people came in a Maruti Alto car to the hospital. Among them one person had an injury on his hand and they wanted treatment for this. However, the security of the hospital did not allow them to enter since all the four were not wearing the mask. They assaulted the security and hearing the noise Dr Sanoj came out of the hospital to check what has happened. The doctor also made it clear that they should not enter the hospital without wearing masks and he would not attend to them if they were not ready to listen. The four member gang, who were in an inebriated condition, was not ready to listen and launched an assault on the doctor. Dr Sanoj fell on the floor in the tiff. He was the only doctor on duty in the hospital then. Doctors and the hospital staff boycotted the duty on Tuesday morning and made it clear that they will not attend duties until the attackers were arrested. ADGP Manoj Abraham later directed the Parassala police to take immediate action against the assaulters. “This is the fourth incident of attack against the doctors happening here in the past two months. Every time the issue happens during the night duty. Now, we have asked the district collector and the district medical officer to set up a police aid post at the hospital for our security,” said the hospital superintendent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/doc-attacked-at-parassala-four-held/articleshow/85018552.cms||---
---||Pune||Zika virus test for dengue, chikungunya -ve patients in Maharashtra||PUNE: Fever patients testing negative for dengue and chikungunya would be tested for Zika virus infection in Maharashtra to pick up cases by expanding the scope of laboratory diagnosis across the state. A network of 57 laboratories has been readied for Zika virus detection across the country. Of them, six laboratories are in Maharashtra, including Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, Nagpur, Kasturba Hospital, Mumbai, and Haffkine Institute for Training, Research Testing, Mumbai. Three more government-designated sentinel centres will be activated for the Zika vuris detection. “In addition to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune, the apex lab for Zika virus detection, another six labs in Maharashtra will start testing every negative dengue/chikungunya sample for the virus. These labs are equipped to function as Zika testing centres in addition to their routine diagnostic work in vector-borne diseases,” the stat’se surveillance officer Pradip Awate told TOI. For this, these labs would be supplied with the testing kits needed for conducting the RT-PCR test through the NIV in a day or two, Awate said. The mosquito that transmits the Zika virus — Aedes aegypti — also transmits dengue and chikungunya viruses, widely prevalent in the state. The Indian Council of Medical Research’s Delhi-based National Centre for Disease Control and Pune-based NIV are the apex laboratories to support the outbreak investigation and for confirmation of laboratory diagnosis of Zika virus in India. The RT-PCR test is the standard test for the detection of Zika. There is no commercially available test. Zika virus infection should be suspected in patients reporting an acute onset of fever, rash and joint pain, among those individuals who travelled to areas with ongoing transmission during the two weeks preceding the onset of illness. “During 2017, ICMR had strengthened countrywide diagnostic preparedness for Zika at 57 government-designated laboratories. They can perform tests,” said NIV’s senior scientist Pragya Yadav, one of the chief researchers for Zika virus in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zika-virus-test-for-dengue-chikungunya-ve-patients/articleshow/85018554.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Following a complaint lodged by businessman Kirit Vaghani, Umra police booked Rasila (55) and Sonu (30) who decamped with Rs two lakh cash and 510 gm gold jewellery. Vaghani, who lives in Maple Leaf Residency on Dumas Road, suspects that the women hypnotized his wife and she handed over the valuables. The theft was carried out in two-and-a-half hours on the day the women were employed on July 21. The next day, Vaghani family went to Bhavnagar and returned on July 27. On July 28, his wife noticed that the jewellery was missing from the bedroom’s cupboard. Police collected CCTV footage in which the women are seen coming and leaving the apartment. However, police claimed that it is not yet clear if they were carrying any stolen material while leaving.  The women had come to the residential apartment in search of work and were sent to Vaghani’s house by the security guard who knew that the family was searching for domestic help. Vaghani told police that his wife had a headache when the women came to work. “His wife was in the bedroom and she doesn’t know when these women stole the valuables from the room. He claims that his wife was probably hypnotized and she handed over the valuables to the women,” said a police officer in Umra police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/domestic-help-steal-on-first-day-of-job/articleshow/85016120.cms||---

The local Muslim leaders have complained to the top leaders that they felt slighted after their photographs were not included on the banners of party’s event — ‘Prabuddh Varg Vichar Gosthi’ – held in the city on Tuesday. The photograph of even the city’s mayor, Mohammad Furkan, was missing from the banners. While the mayor himself was cautious with his words while reacting to the development, BSP councillor Musharaff Hussain Mazhar said that it was “unfortunate that the party has ignored the Muslim community leaders ahead of elections”. “I felt terrible after seeing the newspaper advertisement and the banner of party’s programme which left out the mayor’s photograph,” he said claiming that Aligarh is the only city in UP that has a Muslim mayor. “If Muslims are ignored, it could be disastrous for the party,” he said, adding that he has urged the BSP chief to look into this. “At least the mayor's name and his photograph should have been included on the banner,” said party’s vidhan sabha prabhari in Aligarh, Dr Mehraj Ali. Mayor Mohammad Furkan refused to comment on the issue. “Are these people (mayor Furkan and councillor Hussain) not considered intellectual for the party? Why are they being neglected,” asked local BSP worker Mujahid Raza. BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, who was the chief guest of the occasion, said that the party stood for all communities. “We talk about connecting people, not dividing them like the ruling party does,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/muslim-leaders-resent-exclusion-from-bsps-brahmin-event-in-aligarh-say-cant-ignore-community/articleshow/85016152.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The chapter is co-written by city-based senior interventional cardiologist Dr Tejas Patel, one of the rare occasions where a doctor from India has been included in the textbook.“It’s great to be part of the textbook I studied during my DM (cardiology) course,” said Dr Patel. “My teacher studied it, and my students are doing so too. Every single cardiology fellow in this country and in all other countries goes through this book before taking the exams. The book, in circulation since 1974, is translated into several foreign languages.”The chapter on transradial procedure, popularized by Dr Patel in India and abroad, is co-written by Dr Patel, Prof Mauricio Cohen, and Prof Sunil Rao – considered the pioneers in the field of transradial approach. “This is a matter of immense academic and personal satisfaction for me,” said Dr Patel, adding that the book has had only a few academicians and practitioners from outside the US over the years.“When I started working on the technique, practically no one was following it in India. Globally, only a few countries such as the Netherlands, Canada, Japan and France had some practitioners. Today in India, about 50% of procedures are transradial,” said Dr Patel, who has trained over 2,000 doctors globally in the past three decades. “The reason is fewer complications during the procedure, and a lower mortality rate compared to other methods.”He added that the process of writing started about two years ago and the chapter is based on his experience and 309 academic publications including 3 textbooks and 19 chapters of different international textbooks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/great-to-be-part-of-the-textbook-i-studied-during-dm/articleshow/85018653.cms||---

Around 300 doctors took part in the protest. The striking doctors ensured that emergency services like gynaecology and accident trauma wings continued to function. Doctors in primary health centres to major government hospitals kept away from OP duty, swab collection and vaccinations drives.

Meanwhile, a bystander at Kayamkulam taluk hospital verbally abused a duty doctor and made an attempt to manhandle him. No complaints have been registered with the police. Dr Shyam Prasad, district President of KGMOA, termed the strike a token protest and added that the association will plan further action based on the high court’s decision on the anticipatory bail plea of the two accused persons who have been absconding according to police’s claim. If the court dismisses their plea, the police will have to arrest them, he said. The doctors have also demanded the formulation of uniformed guidelines for vaccination drive. The incident that lead to the case was on July 24 afternoon. The medical officer of Kainakary panchayath Dr Sharath Chandra Bose was assaulted by a group of CPM men lead by the panchayath president M C Prasad.

---||Surat||Gujarat: Rs 29 lakh stolen from ATM in Kadodara||SURAT: Kadodara GIDC police filed a complaint against unidentified people on Monday for damaging an automatic teller machine (ATM) of State Bank of India (SBI) and stealing Rs 29.28 lakh. The theft was carried out at around 12.13 pm on July 30 but the complaint was registered on the third day after the incident. Before decamping with the loot, thieves sprinkled some material on the machine, CCTV cameras and air conditioners in the kiosk that damaged the electronic products. Police claimed that the ATM is managed by a contract firm and they alerted police late. The complaint was lodged by Dhaval Chauhan, an employee of a company that manages the ATMs for the nationalized bank. In his complaint, Chauhan claimed that he was informed about the theft by employees of a cash management agency who had gone to load cash at the kiosk located in Tatithaiya village on Kadodara Bardoli Road. Preliminary investigation revealed that the ATM was cut open using a gas cutter. The tray in which cash is placed was missing. The theft, however, did not come to anyone’s knowledge till July 31. “There was no security guard or working alarm in the ATM booth. No CCTV monitoring as well due to which after so many hours police was alerted,” said a police officer in Kadodara police station. Police are to submit a report to the bank about the loopholes in the security and are examining CCTV footage recovered from the area. It is yet not clear how many people are involved in the theft. It is also a matter of investigation that no one in the area came to know about the theft as it takes more than an hour to cut open the ATM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/rs-29l-stolen-from-atm-in-kadodara/articleshow/85016238.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: In lion kingdom, electric train speed capped at 45kmph||AHMEDABAD: The Surendranagar-Pipavav railway line, which passes from lion dominated coastal belt outside Gir sanctuary, is now electrified and has the capacity to run goods train at 80 kilometres per hour. However, due to chequered past of the line which has reported accidental deaths of at least 20 Big Cats since 2014, forest officials have underscored that trains should not be run at speed beyond 45 kmph. On July16, the PM Narendra Modi inaugurated the Surendranagar – Pipavav Electrified section (264 KM) with High Rise Overhead Electrification completed at cost of Rs 289.47 crores. The Railway officials said usually the electric trains have an average speed of 80 km per hour for goods trains while that for the passenger train is100-110 km per hour. However, Ganpat Vasava, state minister for forest and environment said “We have already communicated to the railways to not increase speed beyond 45kmph on this wildlife sensitive line.” The death of a lion on the Rajula-Pipavav railway track in Amreli district in February had raised the debate on how lions were entering the track which has been fenced off. Experts who visited the area found that the lions were entering the fenced area of the railway track through gates made to allow access to farmers. The railways and Pipavav port trust had put up 8-foot high fencing on the 17km stretch from Pipavav to Barfkhana junction. However, some 20 big cats including 12 lions have died on the 4km stretch between Pipavav and Bherai. After a lion was killed in February, the forest department deputed officials who along with HS Singh, member of the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife, to visit the area and suggest measures to mitigate lion deaths on the track. Officials in Gandhinagar said that the team concluded that the lions were not entering the railway track area by jumping the fence but through the 150 gates on the 4km stretch which are often left open. Officials said these gates were to be closed by farmers and locked after use. However, they are being left open causing the lions to get trapped. H S Singh said, “The average lion weighs over 150kg and cannot jump an 8-foot fence. Other reasons need to be addressed.” Officials said the railways produced documents showing that the train driver had brought down the speed from 50km per hour to zero, in about 17 seconds, but despite this the animal was hit. Officials said an average of two herbivores such as neelgai or wild boar are reportedly killed every day. The carcass then remains on the track and draws lions to it and they often get trapped inside. The is also raised by about one foot and if the lion is sitting on it, it becomes difficult for it to get off as the train approaches. Lion also barely move when the train is approaching. The forest department has posted men on the stretch to ensure that lions are not inside the fenced track but there there is barely any surveillance by them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lions-entering-fenced-track-through-farmers-gates-panel/articleshow/85018714.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The rank list was to expire on Wednesday. A division bench led by Justice Alexander Thomas issued the order after considering a Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) petition which contended that KAT’s interim order goes beyond its powers. The division bench has the characteristics of a final order and directed that last-grade servant openings in all districts should be reported to PSC. The court also directed KAT to seek the views of PSC on the contentions raised by those in the rank list and dispose the case. Validity of the rank list was extended until August 4 when it was scheduled to expire on June 29.

---||Goa||Goa: Covid inspires new state policy to assess students||PANAJI: The Goa board on Tuesday released a policy document that outlines an alternative method to assess Class X and XII students for this academic year should the pandemic situation persist. It has said that the deliberations began after the 2021 public exams could not be held due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. As per the policy, during the academic year 2021-22, the board — and not the school — will conduct each of the two term-end exams. Thus, this academic year and its syllabus will be divided into two terms. One would end in November-December, and the other in March-April. In the first terminal exams, students will be assessed based on multiple choice questions. The second term will consist of assessments based on subjective questions. Marks of the first term as well as the second term examination will contribute to the final overall score of the student, the Board has stated. The Board has called for objections and suggestions up to August 10. The policy also permits schools to get ‘creative’ with its internal assessments. For Classes X and XII, as per the policy, internal assessments will be conducted throughout the year. Of the three periodic tests that schools will be required to conduct as part of the internal assessment, the third test would be required to assess students ‘creatively’, besides through practical work and other activities, the Board has said. “That will also include unit test/exploratory activities/practical projects. Schools would create a student profile for all assessments undertaken over the year, and retain the evidence in digital format. Guidelines for internal assessment for all subjects will also be released along with the rationalised term-wise divided syllabus for the session 2021-2022,” the policy reads. Additional resources like sample assessments, question banks, teacher training, etc, for more reliable and valid internal assessment, will be provided, the Board has said. The Board has also said that efforts will be made to make internal assessment, practical and project work “more credible and valid” and will have to be strictly carried out by schools as per the guidelines to be notified by the Board to ensure fair distribution of marks. The Board has said the policy was also framed due to several concerns over internet connectivity, availability of gadgets for students, etc. “The Board has also considered the concerns regarding differential availability of electronic gadgets, connectivity and effectiveness of online teaching and other socio-economic issues especially with respect to students from economically weaker sections and those residing in far-flung areas of the state,” the document states. Assessments may be carried out in the offline or online mode based on the pandemic situation. “Goa Board had to cancel Class X and Class XII board exams of 2020-2021 as it was risky to conduct them in the second wave in April 2021,” it said, explaining its rationale. “The results of both were declared on the basis of objective, flexible and valid alternative assessment policy. This, in turn, also necessitated deliberations over alternative ways to look at the learning objectives as well as the conduct of the board examinations for the academic session 2021-22 in case the situation remains unfeasible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-inspires-new-state-policy-to-assess-students/articleshow/85021092.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Faridabad||Faridabad: Radha Soami also on forest land, claim evicted villagers||NEW DELHI: Hundreds of persons, evicted out of the eco-sensitive Aravali forest land in Khori village and provided temporary shelter, food and medicines at the nearby Radha Soami Satsang premises, on Tuesday turned against the religious institution by complaining to the Supreme Court that its building had been constructed on forest land and should meet the same fate as their unauthorised houses. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari was told by Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) that many of those evicted during the SC-mandated drive to clear the forest land of unauthorised structures in Khori village were given shelter, food, medicines and even Covid-testing facilities at the Radha Soami premises. Appearing for a section of those evicted during the corporation’s drive to clear the forest of unauthorised structures, senior advocate Sanjay Parikh said that the Radha Soami premises is also on forest land and has been so identified by the National Green Tribunal. The bench which has been consistently acting against illegal construction in the forest land, said that the Radha Soami premises cannot be treated differently. “Every unauthorised construction or encroachment on Aravali forest land must go.” The bench asked senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj, appearing for the MCF, to examine whether the Radha Soami premises is located on forest land. “If it is on forest land, then that should also be demolished,” it said. The MCF informed the SC that the entire forest land in Khori village would be rid of encroachments and unauthorised constructions by August 23. It also said that it has sent the draft rehabilitation policy to the Haryana government for its approval. The earlier policy allowed rehabilitation of those Khori villagers, who could establish that they had been continuously residing at the place prior to 2003, the cutoff date for being entitled to alternative accommodation from the state government. Parikh complained that the new draft policy would not be of any help to those getting evicted from Khori village as the authorities have proposed criteria of electricity bills and other documents as proof of residence and entitlement for alternative accommodation. The new policy, if approved, will still disentitle 90% of the evicted people from rehabilitation, he said. Bhardwaj said that majority of the residents in Khori village were in rented accommodations and have encroached on the forest land in the last decade or so. The SC asked Parikh to await the finalisation of the policy and the notification bringing it into force. “Once it is notified, you can challenge it on whatever grounds,” the bench said. Parikh said that the state government should adopt a humane approach in this matter. SC asked the Haryana government to take a final decision on the rehabilitation policy before August 25, the next date of hearing in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/radha-soami-also-on-forest-land-claim-evicted-villagers/articleshow/85021213.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Pre-independence legacy to world records in education||LUCKNOW: Want to pursue oriental languages, landscape designing or animation. Name a stream and you will get an educational institute in Lucknow. The city has grown as an educational hub in the seven decades and in every decade a new chapter of academic excellence has been added that unfolds how Lucknow’s academic scenario evolved post-Independence. TOI will take you on an educational journey of the city from 1947-2021. As per ‘Review of Education’ published by the National Council of Education Research and Training, there were only five universities in UP before Independence— Banaras Hindu University, Allahabad University, Aligarh Muslim University, Lucknow University and Agra University. The city had just one state university — Lucknow University — which was established in 1920 and a minority institution, Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama, established in 1898. In the last 75 years, the city witnessed the establishment of 10 universities of which a maximum of six were established between 2000 and 2010.The only Central University Dr Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (BBAU) was set up in 1996 and four years later, the first technical university of the state Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) made the city an epicentre of engineering institutions. The journey of the city’s management education began when the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow (IIM-L) was set up in 1984-8 5. Operating out of a makeshift arrangement in the Giri Institute in Aliganj, there were 27 students who learned lessons on marketing and finance. Five years later, a sprawling campus of IIM-L came up on the Sitapur-Hardoi road. The oldest university in the city, LU, which had only 18 affiliated colleges till early 2000 now has 180 affiliated colleges in the city alone. The establishment of the only central university BBAU 1996 further strengthened higher education in the city. The first law university of the state, Dr Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University was established in 2006. Several private universities like Integral, Babu Banarasi Das, Amity also wrote a new chapter of education in the city's history. Apart from this the city also has two universities dedicated to language studies: The English and Foreign Languages University and Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Language University. Also, a university for differently-abled Dr. Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University and an Indian Institute of Information and Technology added more weight to its academic strength. The city has a historical legacy in school education. La Martiniere College and Colvin Taluqdars College have been witness to the city’s changing academic scenario for over a century. Then comes a school, City Montessori School that has the Guinness Book of World Records for being the largest school in terms of pupils. The city also has the century-old The College of Arts and Crafts and the Government Architecture college. The list of academic institutions does not end here; the city has 32 pharmacy colleges, two medical universities: King George’s Medical University and Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute and three architecture colleges at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/from-historical-legacy-to-world-records-in-knowledge/articleshow/85023227.cms||Mohita Tewari

Neeraj Kumar, who works in the sales department of Sai Ram Agritech, Rampura Phul, Bathinda, told the police that he, along with his two colleagues, was on the way to Rampura Phul in a Maruti Suzuki Swift car to attend a meeting and hand over the collection of Rs 15 lakh.He said when they reached near Pal Majra, a Hyundai i10 car intercepted them and three men with covered faces alighted. One of them pointed a gun at him, he said, adding that they snatched the bag of cash kept on the back seat and escaped after damaging one of the tyres of their car. Samrala SHO inspector Kulwant Singh said, “The workers of Sai Ram Agritech would make collections from different districts and deposit them at the office after a month. On Tuesday, there was a meeting in their office in Rampura Phul. They were on the way to attend it and deposit the money when the three unidentified accused robbed them of Rs 15 lakh at gunpoint. There is not a fixed date for depositing the entire month’s collection. So the police are finding out how the robbers knew when the cash would be taken to the office.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Vehicle registrations in July almost match pre-Covid tally||PUNE: Vehicle registrations in the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad regional transport offices (RTO) in July this year inched closer to the pre-Covid count of July 2019. Besides, the registrations at both the RTOs in July beat the previous month numbers, indicating a healthy recovery. Confirming the trend, a Pune RTO official told TOI, “The faceless vehicle registration process, which allows online submission of documents of new vehicles by showroom owners, helped in achieving the healthy growth.” The vehicle registrations in July this year increased by over 77% of what it was in June at the Pune RTO office, while the July registrations at Pimpri Chinchwad RTO increased by 82% against the previous month, data from both the RTO offices revealed. “The number of vehicles registered in July this year are 14% less than the vehicles registered in July last year at the Pune RTO office. This difference is just 4% at Pimpri Chinchwad RTO. If the registrations continue like this, the numbers will go past the pre-Covid levels by next month,” another RTO official said. Shailesh Bhandari, regional director of Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) in Pune, recently said while the overall automobile market was picking up, two-wheeler sales continued to be a concern. “Many offices as well as schools, colleges and other institutions are still closed. Hence, there is a problem in the two-wheeler market as people are not buying two-wheelers. However, the overall market has improved and the faceless registration launched in mid-June has helped,” Bhandari said. An automobile dealer said the perception of people towards buying new vehicles had changed. “Earlier, people used to wait for a special moment, an auspicious month, festival or an occasion, to buy new vehicles. This trend has changed after the pandemic,” the dealer said. VK Navrekar, a government employee who recently bought a four-wheeler, said there was no point in waiting now. “The pandemic has taught us that every positive moment is the right time. We had planned to buy the car on Ganesh Chaturthi, but were wary about the threat of restrictions,” Navrekar, a resident of Kondhwa, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/july-vehicle-registrations-at-pune-pimpri-chinchwad-rtos-beat-june-tally-almost-match-pre-covid-count/articleshow/85018741.cms||Joy Sengupta

The country is spending more than Rs 2 lakh crore on this. Our only aim is that none of our Indian brothers and sisters remain hungry,” he said. The PM-GKAY food security scheme is helping crores of poor people during the pandemic which has helped lessen the worries of the poor, Modi said in his address, marking the completion of chief minister Vijay Rupani’s five years in office. The scope and budget of cheap ration schemes rose since Independence but the effect it should have had on the poor remained limited due to ineffective delivery systems and selfish elements, the PM remarked. He added that the government used new technology to make the food grain delivery system to the poor more effective. “Today, the country is spending lakhs of crores on infrastructure, but at the same time, it is also setting new benchmarks to improve the quality of life of the common man,” the PM said. He added that schemes like the Ayushman Yojana, Mudra Yojna, Svanidhi Yojna and measures like granting reservations to the economically weaker sections, construction of roads, providing free gas and electricity connections empower the common man.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/despite-covid-crisis-govt-did-not-let-people-sleep-hungry-pm/articleshow/85018738.cms||---

The installation will not serve any purpose since the schools are unlikely to open anytime soon, they pointed out.The proposal, tabled by the education committee of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), will be discussed at the civic standing committee meeting scheduled to be held on Wednesday.Activist Maruti Bhapkar said that committee members should discuss the possibility of resuming academic activities at civic schools and then install the UV scanners. “Although the gesture may sound helpful for students, it will be just a waste of taxpayers’ money,” he said, adding that the transparency in the transactions of such deals is also a matter of concern.Education activist Matin Mujarwar said that civic bodies had invested in such machines, when the number of Swine Flu cases were on the rise. “Now, we aren’t sure when schools will reopen, so the proposal should be cancelled,” he said.Mujawar added that PCMC should first ensure that all students get access to online education. “There have been instances of students struggling in the basics of primary education, which must be addressed on priority,” he said.A parent said that the civic body should make sure that overcharging at schools is controlled. “When most schools are functioning via online classes, why should the machines be installed now?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/proposal-to-install-uv-scanners-at-civic-schools-irks-activists/articleshow/85018727.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra looking to increase charging station count||PUNE: State transport minister Anil Parab on Tuesday said the state government was planning to approach petrol pumps and individual land owners for leasing space to set up charging stations for electric vehicles, registrations of which were on a rise in the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad areas, especially. “We are in talks with vehicle manufacturers and dealers on the issue of charging stations. We are also looking at approaching petrol pump and individual land owners in cities across the state to collaborate with them for space required for setting up charging stations. The manufacturers have also been asked to take a lead and negotiate with them to secure space in exchange of revenue,” the minister said. A transport department official said the system was expected to be similar to the one adopted by the telecom sector. “Petrol pumps are the best place to set up charging stations and talks can happen with them at the government level or by vehicle manufacturer,” the official said. With the sale of e-vehicles increasing and the state government recently coming out with a policy on the same, the availability of charging stations poses a major challenge, dealers said. RTO officials in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad said July had seen the highest sale of e-vehicles in 2021. “The registrations are going up and most of the vehicles bought are either two wheelers and e-carts,” a Pune RTO official said. Amey Pawar, a dealer of electric two-wheeler, said the market for e-vehicles was growing, but limited charging stations was a concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-looking-to-increase-charging-station-count/articleshow/85018782.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||District officials expect smaller kharif crop harvest this year||PUNE: The district might get a smaller harvest of kharif crops this season — bajra, green and black gram, and groundnut — because of reduced sowing in the wake of inadequate rainfall in July, an official report indicated. The report, released by the district agriculture office, has also predicted lower cultivation of paddy. District agriculture officer Dnyaneshwar Bote said the recommended sowing period of these crops was over. “There won’t be any increase in the area under kharif sowing season. The break in the monsoon in in July has severely affected sowing. Although paddy cultivation has gained momentum in the last two weeks, we still estimate lower cultivation of paddy compared to last year; and smaller harvest of kharif crops,” Bote added. In July, the district received 186mm of rainfall — well above the normal or average of 176.2mm. In July, however, the district received 287mm of rainfall, which was less than average, the normal being 309mm, stated the report. Paddy is mainly cultivated in Bhor, Velhe, Mulshi, Maval, Khed, Ambegaon, and Junnar tehsils. Currently, it is grown on 36,415 hectares across these tehsils. “As paddy is the main crop for farmers in these tehsils, they are planting it now. The favourable or scientifically recommended period is July. Because of this factor, we fear lower production or harvest of rice this year in the district. On an average, paddy farmers get 24 quintals of harvest per hectare,” added Bote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dist-officials-expect-smaller-kharif-crop-harvest-this-year/articleshow/85018753.cms||Sandip Dighe

In a virtual address at a state government event to mark the completion of five years of Vijay Rupani as CM, the PM said, “This time, the highest number of Indian players have qualified for the Olympics. We must not forget the fact that we have achieved it while fighting the worst pandemic of the last 100 years. There are sports in which our players have qualified for the very first time.” Modi added, “Our players haven’t just qualified, they are giving their best performance too. New India’s towering self-confidence is reflecting in each game. Our Olympics players and teams are giving a tough fight to their competitors with better rankings. The conviction and confidence of Indian players are at their peak.” He said Indian players are more confident because of the transparency in the system and identification of the right talent. “This self-confidence comes naturally when the right talent is identified and promoted, when the system gets changed and transparency is brought in. This new self-confidence is now becoming the identity of ‘New India’ and is reaching every nook and corner of the country,” the PM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/indias-self-confidence-reflecting-in-olympics-says-modi/articleshow/85018773.cms||---
---||Kochi||FCI godown: HC stays order favouring headload workers||Kochi: The high court has stayed an order issued by a district labour officer allowing headload workers at a Food Corporation of India (FCI) godown to charge ‘attikash’ (stacking charge) and ‘kettukash’ (loading charge) for loading ration articles. Justice AM Badar issued a stay on the order issued by the district labour officer of Palakkad regarding the loading of ration articles at the FCI godown at Olavakkode in Palakkad. The order allowed headload workers to charge for loading ration articles to be transported to FCI’s godown at Malappuram. Seeking the views of FCI, Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation, district collector, and district labour officer of Palakkad, the court has scheduled a hearing in the case after two-and-a-half months. The court is considering a petition filed by a contractor, Central Engineering Company, alleging that headload workers at FCI godowns are not covered under the provisions of Kerala Headload Workers Act of 1978, which reserves the right to registered headload workers in an area to do loading and unloading work so as to ensure employment. The headload workers at the FCI godown are demanding additional wages in the name of ‘attikash’ and ‘kettukash’, it was alleged. When the petitioner addressed the issue to the general manager of FCI, he was directed by FCI to take necessary action against the workers demanding extra wages as such demand goes against the provisions of Model Standing Orders framed under Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946. However, the district labour officer passed an order on July 2 that the headload workers are eligible to charge ‘attikash’ and ‘kettukash’ and that the contractor is liable to pay them. The contractor contends that the Kerala Headload Workers Act is applicable to the entire state but it does not cover establishments owned and controlled by the central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fci-godown-hc-stays-order-favouring-headload-workers/articleshow/85018875.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||HC questions police’s advice on not opening gate||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday questioned the validity of Vadodara police’s advice to the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) not to open a gate in the Samarpan Cooperative Society for commutation for common people, which has been the bone of contention between two communities. While the Muslim members of the society approached the HC insisting on opening the gate, some residents of the society belonging to the Hindu community had taken exception to the demand and moved the HC citing a flaw in the Town Planning scheme. Last month, the high court permitted the VMC to remove the gate under police protection, which could not be done. The dispute arose because the residential society has been notified under the Disturbed Areas Act. During a hearing on Tuesday, Justice Sangeeta Vishen asked the state government to inform the court about the security arrangement to deal with the law and order situation. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-questions-polices-advice-on-not-opening-gate/articleshow/85018847.cms||---

The public health department recently visited 764 parks and nurseries, of which 557 parks and 135 nurseries were found positive for mosquito breeding due to intermittent rain and high humidity. As many as 136 legal notices and 48 challans were issued against caretakers and supervisors as legal measures, while officials would continue random checks considering the season was appropriate for mosquito breeding. “In view of the ongoing transmission season of vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, malaria and chikungunya, SDMC has intensified information, education activities and legal prosecution against defaulters. On July 31, we conducted a special drive to detect mosquito breeding and check control measures taken in the parks and nurseries. We found negligence at parks belonging to agencies, including SDMC, DDA and CPWD. Since the caretakers and supervisors are immediately responsible, we took strict action against them,” said an SDMC official.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rs 5-lakh power theft at Chembur colony with Rs 2.5 crore unpaid bills||MUMBAI: A case of power theft was unearthed at Siddharth Colony, a thickly populated slum pocket in Chembur which was in the news recently for unpaid electricity bills of Rs 2.5 crore, Adani Electricity officials said. Consumers, whose power supply was cut off last year, were found pilfering electricity worth around Rs 5 lakh, an official said. A team from Adani, with a couple of cops from Chembur police station, raided the colony and found cables through which power was being pilfered to homes. “We lodged a police complaint. An FIR was registered on Tuesday against 12 consumers for pilfering 33,541 units of electricity for which we lost Rs 4.9 crore,” he said. During inspection, the Adani team found that these residents had meters which were removed for non-payment of bills, but they continued to get supply from the main cables illegally. “The raid was a follow-up action to a disconnection .drive undertaken by us last month. We had issued show cause notices to 700 consumers in June-July that their supply will be disconnected for not paying Rs 2.5 crore for the past two years,” he said. Adani officials alleged that many users in this colony were ‘habitual defaulters’ and every time a team went for disconnection, there would be a protest. In 2019, power supply to the colony was cut for at least 12 hours daily for 25 days as consumers had not paid bills of Rs 77 crore for 14 years. The arrears had come down to Rs 2.5 crore in 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-5l-power-theft-at-chembur-colony-with-rs-2-5cr-unpaid-bills/articleshow/85023331.cms||Somit Sen

Nearly 3.5 crore people from Gujarat are benefiting from free ration, said Modi, while lauding the state government for giving priority to lakhs of migrant labourers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, despite most of them not having ration cards or even such cards of their native states. During his interaction with beneficiaries via videoconferencing, Modi spoke to one Narsinhbhai from Vadnagar, PM’s home town, who expressed his happiness with the scheme and said that the money that he saves on foodgrains is being used for other works. Nayanaben Joshi, a widow who works as a sweeper at a government school in Rajkot, too said she was greatly benefited. Under the scheme that will continue until Diwali, government provides 5kilos of wheat and rice in addition to the already stipulated quota of wheat provided at Rs 2 per kg, and rice at Rs 3 per kg. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-among-first-to-implement-one-nation-one-ration-card-scheme/articleshow/85018806.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Are rlys, forest dept up to speed?||Ahmedabad: The forest department has stressed that even with the electrification of the Surendranagar-Pipavav section, the speed limit will remain 45kmph for trains running through areas with lion populations. On July 16, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the 264km Surendranagar-Pipavav electrified section, with High Rise Overhead Electrification. The project was completed at the cost of Rs 289.47 crore. It had been commissioned in February 2021. Railway officials said that goods trains on electrified sections usually run at average speed of 80kmph while passenger trains travel at 100-110kmph. However, Ganpat Vasava, Gujarat’s forest and environment minister, said: “We have already communicated to the railways that the speed limit should not be above 45kmph.” He said another meeting will be held soon involving all parties concerned to emphasize the point. “Railways will not be allowed to increase the speed of trains in stretches where lions are present,” he said. Railway officials said that the track was electrified to expedite the movement of goods. Container movement can also benefit, they said. The railways wants to move double-stack containers too. Such trains cannot apply brakes suddenly. Even when the brakes come into play, the trains running at average speed of, say, 80kmph will take 25-28 seconds to come to a halt. In such circumstances, any lion on the tracks could be killed, said a forest officer in Gandhinagar. Forest officers said that even now, when the speed limit is 40kmph, trains notch up 50kmph. They said that they expect average speed to be 60kmph on the new line. An officer said that the only option is to install CCTV cameras at regular intervals along the track to alert the engine drivers about the presence of lions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/are-rlys-forest-dept-up-to-speed/articleshow/85018886.cms||---

The state police headquarters has ordered an inquiry into it. When contacted, Bhagalpur City SP Swarn Prabhat told TOI over phone on Tuesday that one round of inquiry had been completed. “A further inquiry ordered by the police headquarters is going on,” he said. Prabhat said the SDPO and her husband Roshan Krishna would be interrogated soon. Meanwhile, a senior IPS officer, preferring anonymity, said the inquiry was ordered after several pictures were posted by the SDPO on her social media profile with her husband wearing police uniform with ‘IPS’ insignia fixed on his shoulder. “This has become clear from the first round of inquiry that her husband is neither a police officer nor an IPS officer,” he said. However, no one has lodged any complaint that her husband misused the uniform or tried to influence anyone by using it. “Only the pictures have surfaced on her social media profile. That’s why no FIR has been lodged yet and further investigation is on,” he said. The officer said the serious point is that the SDPO, despite being a gazetted police officer, encouraged her husband’s act posting his pictures on social media. “Such an act may attract disciplinary action against her,” he said. He said the first round of inquiry had been conducted by Bhagalpur SSP Natasha Guria, who has submitted her report a fortnight back. TOI tried to contact the SDPO on her official cellphone number twice. A woman picked up the call and disconnected it saying she will make the officer available to talk after sometime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/probe-against-sdpo-for-posting-hubbys-photo-in-police-uniform/articleshow/85016468.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The finance ministry, on Tuesday, issued orders exempting payment of integrated tax after considering the petition by Rafeeq, the father of the child. He had sought exemption for the gene therapy medicine stating that the amount needed for the medicine ($2.1 million) was raised through crowdfunding and that they have obtained approval from DCGI for importing the lifesaving medicine from USA. As per the letter, the drug is expected to be imported as a single packet with 74.2ml dose of medicine. “In view of the exceptional circumstances, Central government in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section (2) of Section 25 of the Customs Act, 1962, hereby exempts 74.3ml of Zolgensma from the whole of the integrated tax leviable thereon under sub section (7) of section 3 of Customs Tariff Act 1975,” stated the letter issued by the undersecretary in the finance department. The letter to chief commissioner of customs, central goods and service tax, Thiruvananthapuram Zone, states that the exemption will be valid for imports to be made up to 02/11/2021. It adds that the said drug is already exempt from payment of BCD (basic customs duty). The family had hoped to collect Rs 18 crore through crowdfunding for the gene therapy treatment of Mohammed; but Rs 46.7 crore was contributed by the people. The committee formed to raise funds for Mohammed’s treatment as well as his family intends to hand over the excess amount to the treatment of other SMA-affected children. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to waive off the customs duty and IGST on the drugs imported for spinal muscular atrophy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/centre-waives-duty-for-import-of-medicine-for-mohammeds-treatment/articleshow/85018937.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Dengue afflicting kids more, rush at paediatric ICUs in Nagpur||NAGPUR: After the number of dengue cases dropped drastically last year, the viral fever is back and this time cases are more in paediatric population. Leading children hospitals in city, where paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) are available, have noted regular admissions in last three weeks. Increased numbers of children, especially of younger age groups, are getting admitted in hospitals after reporting serious dip in their platelet counts. Fortunately, dengue in kids is largely manageable in hospitals and mortality is negligible, said treating doctors. “There is an unusual surge in number of kids with dengue this year,” said senior paediatrician Dr Vasant Khalatkar. “We have also observed that platelet count is dropping fast and to a lower level than often. In case it dropped under 1 lakh, patients are advised to get admitted,” he said. Children’s ward in Government Medical College & Hospital (GMCH) is also receiving a large number of patients with dengue. According to doctors there, patients under 5 years of age are more in numbers. “It’s difficult for these kids to protect themselves from mosquito bite so, they get infected. If tested at right time, most of them recover without platelet supply,” said a senior doctor in the ward. According to doctors, poor control on mosquito breeding and neglect even at family front has resulted in the surge. The NMC action against mosquito breeding began late this time. Weather fluctuations since May-end, humidity and rains have also contributed a lot in mosquito breeding. Children are mostly indoors due to lockdown and school closures. Still, they are getting infected which indicates that family members have also neglected the pre-monsoon cleanliness measures. Air coolers are one of the most common sources of dengue mosquitoes, doctors said. Academy of Paediatricians (AOP) Nagpur president Dr Vijay Dhote said that cases are coming from all parts of the city. “The surge is not area specific. AOP members from all parts of city are seeing more patients with dengue symptoms. High grade fever for long time, stomach ache, vomiting, rashes, swelling etc are the initial signs which parents should not ignore,” he said. Doctors also observed that some parents are proactive in conducting dengue tests. “Some alert parents get their kids tested for dengue and then bring them to hospital. The Covid-19 phase has created such awareness about diagnostic tests in common people,” noted Dr Khalatkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dengue-afflicting-kids-more-rush-at-paediatric-icus-in-city/articleshow/85018922.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC grants bail to Pattalgadi movement leader||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday granted conditional bail to the leader of Pattalgadi movement, Babita Kachhap, who was arrested by Gujarat ATS from Vyara on charges of sedition and conspiring to wage a war against the nation. While ordering the release of the tribal rights activist, the HC noted that her raising a voice by interpreting the Constitution in her own manner does not show how she committed an offence of sedition or conspired to wagea war against the nation. Moreover, there was no disturbance noted in Gujarat because of her movement, especially during her stay here. Kachhap was arrested in July 2020 allegedly for instigating the followers of Sati-Pati tribal cult in Gujarat to take violent means by wrong interpretation of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution and wage a war against India. The police claimed that Kachhap’s associates and co-accused in cases lodged against her in Jharkhand had made people fight on the basis of caste and class. The police also claimed that documents and mobile phones seized from her contained incriminating material. After hearing Kachhap’s advocates Zubin Bharda and A A Zabuawala, Justice S H Vora granted bail to her on furnishing bond of Rs 20,000 with one surety of the same amount. The court observed that during Kachhap’s stay in Gujarat, no actual violence or breach of peace occurred at any point of time. The FIR was registered only on basis of the cases lodged against her in Jharkhand. The high court noticed that the literature seized from her was available on internet and the government could show any incriminating material that could lead to invocation of Section 121A and 124A of IPC. Merely because she raises her voice “in the line of her interpretation of Fifth Schedule, there is any overt act or any response from anyone in public and therefore, presence of mens rea which is essential element to make out an offence under Sections 124(A) and 153(A) of IPC is not available on record”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-hc-grants-bail-to-pattalgadi-movement-leader/articleshow/85016525.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NMC has no money to concretize 28 tar roads||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) empty coffers have led to the civic body dropping concretization of 28 of the planned 102 roads. NMC needs over Rs100 crore, which it doesn’t have, to execute the concretization of these roads. Of the three packages, the concretization work on 16 roads is going on at a snail’s pace while work is yet to start on three roads. This means motorists will have to bear with poor roads and make their way through potholed and crater-ridden roads. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B confirmed the development and said that these tar roads will be taken up for concretization after the civic body’s financial condition improves. The civic chief also said NMC will undertake repair works of the potholed roads soon. NMC had not carried out repair works on these roads, as they were to be concretized. So, today most of these roads are in a deplorable condition. “As the proposed roads were to be converted into cement, no tar work was undertaken on these roads in the last four years,” admitted a senior official from the NMC. Meanwhile, Nagpur city traffic police expressed concern over the slow pace of cement road works, which is causing inconvenience to motorists across the city. “We have apprised the divisional commissioner’s office in a joint meeting attended by NMC officials too about the situation. The NMC commissioner has been asked to ensure that incomplete work does not harm any road users,” said a senior official from the city traffic police. Traffic cops told TOI that incomplete roads, including the one near Siddheshwar Hall on Manewada Road, have been lying like this for more than a year now. The same situation is seen on the patch between Bhim Chowk and Ring Road, and Mokshadham to Imamwada, among others. During the ongoing monsoon season, these incomplete road works have also contributed to road accidents. The work on most of the cement roads started between 2016 and 2018. However, due to reasons best known to PWD, the work of converting 16 cement roads of both phase-II and phase-III is going on at a snail’s pace. The cops claimed that MahaMetro is strictly adhering to deadlines and even their way of carrying out infra works is excellent. They strictly follow terms and conditions like deploying traffic wardens, taking safety precautions etc issued by the traffic police. However, none of the contractors assigned by NMC follow safety guidelines, point out the traffic cops. To the traffic police’s concern, the civic chief said he has already issued instructions to expedite ongoing works of cement roads. According to him, all the ongoing cement road works will be completed in the city by December-end. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari too directed the civic administration to accelerate speed for completing ongoing cement road works.

---||Jaipur||Family of 1962 war hero still waiting for their dues||JAIPUR: Nearly 60 years after Major Shaitan Singh, Param Vir Chakra, was killed in action during the 1962 war, his family is yet to get their just dues despite a legal battle for many years. After Singh died, his wife, Sugan Kanwari, used to receive only the normal family pension although she was eligible for the special family pension, which is around 60% of the deceased soldier's salary. Even the gratuity amount of Rs 4,000, which was given in 1963, was recovered from the pension in 1964 and has not been given back. After a revision in 1972, the war hero’s family was supposed to get a liberalised family pension, which is applicable for the next of kin (NOK) of defence personnel who were battle casualties. But Sugan did not get this till 1996 and was deprived of the previous dues (from 1972-96) as well. Sugan passed away in 2015, but the legal process to recover the dues is going on. Her son, now a senior citizen himself, is fighting for the arrears as well as gratuity. Even now, the end of this legal battle is nowhere in sight as there is no judge in the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) in Jaipur since 2016 where the case is pending. Advocate Colonel SB Singh (retired), who is fighting the case in Jaipur AFT for the family, told TOI: “In a normal pension, the NOK is given 30% of the salary while in a special pension it is 60%. In a liberalised pension it is 100% (of the salary). However, Sugan Kanwari, wife of Major Shaitan Singh, was given only the normal pension. Moreover, she was entitled to family gratuity of Rs 9,500 as per the announcement made in 1972. But it was not paid to her till her death, or later to her son.” According to documents, the first payment of family pension to Sugan Kanwari of Rs 1,392 was made in December 1963, though her husband was killed on November 18, 1962, implying she was sanctioned a pension of only Rs 116 per month. Major Shaitan Singh was initially commissioned in the Jodhpur State Forces on August 1, 1949, after training from OTS Pune, from August 26 1947 to July 31 1949. Subsequently, he was granted Short Service Regular Commission on April 1,1951, and Permanent Regular Commission, on May 25, 1954, with the Kumaon Regiment. During the 1962 war, he was killed while defending his company locality against the Chinese army as part of the 13 Kumaon Regiment. He was awarded the Param Vir Chakra for his valour and sacrifice, posthumously. However, the apathy of the government in settling the pension and arrears forced the soldier’s family to seek legal route. Col Singh said: “The deceased Major’s wife did not realise that she was being given lesser dues than that has been authorised until an official of the Sainik Kalyan Board visited her. In 1996, she started receiving the liberalised pension. The current case is for arrears from 1972 to 1995 as well as the gratuity amount. After her death in 2015, her son should have been given the arrears. But there is no judge in Jaipur AFT since 2016 due to which the case is pending.” Major Shaitan Singh’s son Narpat Singh, who was a teenager at the time of his father’s death, said: “We did not know anything about the financial aspects. I was very young. We only came to know later and, now, I am waiting for the court’s decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/family-of-1962-war-hero-still-waiting-for-their-dues/articleshow/85021336.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

Recently, they had got water samples from their area tested. The report, received on July 30, showed all samples failed the purity test. Through NGO Mahatar Sathi Jagriti Manch, the residents, on Tuesday, complained to the Punjab State Human Rights Commission and the MC commissioner.They said, “The MC must provide clean drinking water when it is collecting the service charge. As the area is around Buddha Nullah, the water is getting contaminated.” The samples were taken from the houses of Keemti Rawal and Mukesh Kumar, a government primary school and a handloom store. These were sent to PAU for testing with the help of district health department. The results showed E coli in excess in two samples.Area resident and activist Keemti Rawal said, “The samples were collected from four different locations and all have failed the test. It means, we are being supplied contaminated water. We are suffering from various diseases. As the area is near Buddha Nullah, harmful chemicals like uranium, nickel, among others, can contaminate groundwater. We have taken up the issue with the Punjab State Human Rights Commission and officials concerned.” Another resident Sunil Bhanot said, “The groundwater of all areas near Buddha Nullah is of poor quality. Its impact is now visible on the public health. The civic body should improve the water quality by reducing pollution levels in Buddha Nullah.” MC operation and maintenance cell SDO Anshu Garcha said, “I am not aware of the samples collected from Chander Nagar. If the samples have failed purity test, there can be multiple reasons. The specifications are different for sampling. We will get the samples tested again.” As per MC, areas under risk of water contamination and outbreak of water-borne diseases are: New Shivpuri, Shivpuri, Brahmpuri, Sardar Nagar, Salem Tabri, Jalandhar Bypass, New Kartar Nagar, Daulat Colony, New Kundanpuri, Chander Nagar, Gopal Nagar, New Deep Nagar, Pavitar Nagar, Vivek Nagar, Joshi Nagar, Jawahar Nagar Camp, Labour Colony, Jawaddi Kalan, Manjit Nagar, Dr Ambedkar Nagar, Manohar Nagar, Choti Jawaddi, Punjabi Bagh, Madhopuri, New Madhopuri, Fauzi Colony, Dhandhari, Giaspura, among others. MC’s water testing lab closed The MC had set up its own lab for regular testing of water samples about five years ago. But since last year, the lab is lying closed because the finance and contracts committee failed to take a decision on a resolution to purchase testing material and hire lab technician. It seems regular water sampling is not a priority of the civic body. City receives water through tubewellsWater is supplied through tubewells in the entire city. People living in localities around Buddha Nullah are sceptical about its quality. The MC officials, however, deny Buddha Nullah as a reason for water contamination. They rather claim that during rainy season, chances of water contamination increase. In the past, several incidents have taken place wherein water-borne diseases spread in monsoon.Only 2 of 80 samples fitFor preparing project for canal-based water supply in the city, the MC had got 80 water samples, collected from across the industrial hub, tested in 2020. Of these, 29 were found unfit for consumption, 20 showed high levels of nitrate, nine had selenium beyond permissible limit of 0.1%, and 20 had nitrate between 80mg and 90mg against the permissible limit of 45mg.

The demand for vaccination increased since the government resumed inoculation of 18-44 years age group on June 23. Since then, vaccination has not happened on 22 out of the 42 days. Meanwhile, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) continued vaccination of bedridden people on Tuesday. Kicked-off with one beneficiary on Monday, the civic body has continued vaccination of bedridden people on daily basis. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “Three bedridden people were inoculated on Tuesday in three zones — Laxmi Nagar, Mangalwari and Gandhibagh zones. Our zone-wise teams will vaccinate bedridden people as soon as they get all necessary details and documents from the beneficiaries,” he said. Due to lack of Covishield doses, NMC kept 156 centres in the city closed on Tuesday. 1,265 people took the jab in NMC’s centres on Tuesday. 754 people were vaccinated in 22 private centres. Thus, 2,019 people were benefited in the city on Tuesday. Joshi said, “Vaccination will not happen in Covishield centres in the city on Wednesday as NMC yet to receive fresh stock from the government.

The researchers who recorded the findings are calling for improved refining processes to reduce microplastics in salt. Gujarat produces 76% of the country’s salt. Kharaghoda, Bhavnagar, Porbandar, and the Rann of Kutch are major salt-producing centres. The research study, published in Elsevier’s Marine Pollution Journal, has stated that of the solid microparticle pollutants separated from the samples, 90.3% were microplastic fractions and 9.7% were non-microplastic fractions. The study was carried out by a team of 10 scientists including geologists, ocean researchers, and biotechnologists TimesViewIt will take another decade of research before scientists agree on significant health risks posed by ingestion of microplastics. By then, it will be too late. One needs to improvise existing food processing methods to ensure that less microplastics enter our food chain. Our obsession with plastic is clearly polluting our seafood and sea salts with microplastics. It is time that the salt production industry and the state government together draw up standards for refining salt, a basic ingredient of our food that we cannot do without.Polyethylene (78%) was the dominant microplastic pollutant, followed by polyester (19%). Polyvinyl chloride content was found too. “The packing material of salt was primarily composed of polyethylene. A few large-sized plastic fragments which were greater than 5mm were also observed in the samples,” the study said. Approximately 16.2% and 15% of the microparticles that were analyzed in the crystal salt packets fall in the 500-1,000 micrometre and above 1mm size ranges. The 200-500 micrometre microplastic particles accounted for approximately 31.2% of the total particles, and 100-200 micrometre particles made up 37.7% of the total. “The common microplastic particles include fiber, pellet, and film,” the study said. The research involved Madras, Periyar, and Anna universities; Malankara Catholic College; and National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research. “The [finding] of the study is that edible salt is dominated by fiber-shaped microplastic materials,” the researchers said. “The microplastics in salt were primarily made up of polyethylene materials.” The researchers went on to say: “The observed polyethylene in salt most probably came from processing and packing units of salt-producing industries, followed by airborne microplastic particles.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/plastic-in-salt-study-calls-for-better-processing/articleshow/85021387.cms||---

Prior to turning up as a ‘godman’ about four years ago, he had earlier been arrested and jailed for duping several people of Rs 1 crore while operating a computer centre in Hyderabad. The accused, A Sai Viswa Chaitanya Swamy, was arrested from a charitable trust office in Ajmapur village in Nalgonda district after a woman complained of sexual harassment and extortion. “He used to collect money in the form of donations by conning devotees and selling fake herbal medicines for various ailments,” Nalgonda DIG AV Ranganath said. “After coming out of prison, he started posing as a ‘godman’ from 2017 and began exploiting gullible women,” the DIG said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/godman-held-for-harassing-women/articleshow/85023343.cms||---
---||Patna||Pegasus: State BJP says it’s a central government issue||PATNA: The stand of CM Nitish Kumar that the use of the Pegasus spyware to snoop on a wide spectrum of people in the country should be probed has put the state BJP not only on the backfoot, but also short of words. In Bihar, the BJP and JD(U), along with smaller parties Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) led by minister Mukesh Sahani, are the NDA partners. In Lok Sabha, the BJP has 17 MPs from Bihar and the JD(U) 16. On Tuesday, when reminded by mediapersons of the demand of Nitish for a probe into the use of Pegasus spyware in the country, deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad and health minister Mangal Pandey, both state BJP seniors, ducked the question and virtually looked the other way, maintaining that it was a matter related to the central government and they had no say on it. “Our position is that the central government has given its reply on the matter. The issue is outside our domain as it is related to the central government,” Prasad said. Health minister Pandey too said it is the central government’s issue. “The Union minister concerned has also explained the position of the central government. Everything has been explained. The matter does not concern me because I am a minister in the state government.” To add to the irritation of the BJP, HAM(S) founder Jitan Ram Manjhi also supported Nitish’s demand on Tuesday. “If the opposition parties are persistently affecting the functioning of Parliament on Pegasus issue, it is a serious matter. I think in view of the present circumstances, the issue should be probed so that the country is informed as to who is getting spied upon by whom,” Manjhi tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pegasus-state-bjp-says-its-a-central-government-issue/articleshow/85016530.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Delhi||SDMC salary expenses high compared to its work, not justified, points out high court||New Delhi: The expenses incurred by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on salaries of employees is abnormally high as compared to its functioning, which is not justified, Delhi High Court observed on Tuesday. It also asked the civic body to inform if the biometric attendance of staff was linked to their Aadhaar, pointing out that when the corporation was not doing that much of sanitation and development work, how it could keep paying so much of salaries to its employees. “Is biometric attendance system implemented in the corporations? Have you linked it with their Aadhaar? Is geo tagging being done to track their locations,” asked a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh asked the counsel for SDMC. Advocate Divya Prakash Pande, representing SDMC, said he will file an affidavit on the steps taken by the corporation regarding these issues. He submitted that the monthly expenses of SDMC include Rs 214 crore for salaries and Rs 30 crore for pensions. The bench said a municipal corporation’s job is not only to pay salaries but also do sanitation and other development work. “If you see your expenditure in comparison to others in the country or abroad, you are incurring abnormally high expenditure on salaries, which is not justified looking at your core functioning of sanitation. You need to see if you are overstaffed and paying salaries…,” the bench said, adding, “we want you to walk, we are giving you sticks but you should not make it a crutch”. The bench said everyone is aware of ghost employees where people are sitting at home and enjoying their salaries and called it “appaling.” HC also asked the SDMC to comply with its July 8 order to file an affidavit on the steps taken to augment their resources and its financial position which will be necessary to decide the corporation’s application seeking direction to the Delhi government not to recover certain amount of money from it during the pandemic. The court listed the plea for August 11, when various other petitions relating to non-payment of salaries and pensions to teachers, hospital staff, sanitation workers, engineers are also coming up for hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-salary-expenses-high-compared-to-its-work-not-justified-points-out-high-court/articleshow/85021577.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||MSBB gets Rs 1.19 crore as benefit sharing with BMCs||Nagpur: Defunct for a long time, the Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board (MSBB) has chalked out a four-point agenda to streamline its functioning.The four-point agenda includes restoration and eco-restoration of environmental biodiversity by 2030, in areas where huge damage has taken place. This is also one of the aims of the World Biodiversity Council.“With the help of the Agharkar Research Institute, Pune, we have identified 550 medicinal plant species out of which a district-wise list of 130 species that are endemic and endangered will be prepared and saplings of these plant species will be prepared in hi-tech nurseries,” said Pravin Srivastava, PCCF & member-secretary of the MSBB.Talking to newsmen on Tuesday, Srivastava said, “Plans are also afoot to prepare a portal of MSBB and all information related to people’s biodiversity registers (PBRs) and biodiversity management committees (BMCs) will be brought on the digital platform.”This is perhaps the maiden press conference by any member-secretary of the board in the last 9 years since the MSBB was set up. Srivastava admitted that over 28,600 PBRs, a document containing knowledge of local biological resources, were prepared in the state in a tearing hurry as the NGT, Delhi, had set a deadline of January 30, 2020, failing which every state was to impose a penalty of Rs 10 lakh per month starting February 1, 2020.“An expert committee was set up in April to look into the anomalies in the PBRs. We have set 10 parameters and only if these conditions are fulfilled, the PBRs will be considered otherwise modifications will be suggested. The task will be completed in two months,” said Srivastava.On the implementation of access and benefit-sharing (ABS), which refers to the access of biological resources and sharing of benefits with people, the MSBB member-secretary said, “Till now, the ABS has not been implemented. However, we have received Rs 57.23 lakh from 43 companies in the state while another over Rs 62 lakh has come in from the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA). The Rs 1.19 crore will be shared with select biodiversity management committees (BMCs) in the state.”Srivastava said companies are coming forward to reveal names of traders from whom they are buying resources. “We are issuing a public notice now warning that violation of the laws would lead to three years of imprisonment and Rs 10 lakh fine,” he said.As per the first option, the ABS has recovered 3% of the annual turnover for trading bio-resources and 5% from manufacturing companies. As per the second option, 0.1% is charged on finished products worth Rs 1 crore and 0.2% between Rs 1 to 3 crore and 0.5% above Rs 3 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/msbb-gets-rs-1-19-crore-as-benefit-sharing-with-bmcs/articleshow/85019015.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Aurangabad||Normalcy returns in Aurangabad, curbs continue in Beed district||AURANGABAD: Different markets and commercial areas from Aurangabad witnessed vibrancy on day one of the further easing of Covid-related curbs on Tuesday. Welcoming the government decision to allow shops to remain open till 8 pm, the local traders body has appealed to its members and public at large for strict compliance with Covid Appropriate Behaviour to avoid a resurgence of the pandemic situation. “The local business and the economy at large were suffering badly due to restricted working hours. The pandemic situation is not over yet and every member of the society has to act in a responsible manner in order to ensure Covid does not rear its ugly head again,” Jagannath Kale, president of Aurangabad Jilha Vyapari Mahasangh said. Aurangabad district on Monday reported six fresh cases of Covid-19 within the municipal limits of Aurangabad and another 14 cases from rural areas, taking the tally of active cases to 300. Meanwhile, as per the latest modified guidelines under Break The Chain order from the state government, Beed from Marathwada is among 11 districts from the state which will continue to observe Covid-related curbs in the wake of a relatively higher number of Covid cases. As reported by TOI earlier, four talukas — Ashti, Patoda, Shirur and Georai — have been reporting a higher number of fresh infections and will witness tighter curbs whereas the remaining seven talukas will observe Level III restrictions, said an official release. Beed collector Ravindra Jagtap on Tuesday said he has worked out taluka-wise Covid positivity rate to assess the pandemic situation in an effective manner. “Even if Beed district has relatively higher positivity rate, majority of patients are either showing mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, which is a silver line for us. An aggressive Covid testing, including in areas that border with neighbouring Ahmednagar district, is on to detect fresh infection early,” he said. As per the latest order, the commercial establishments from aforesaid four talukas are allowed to operate only from 7 am to 12.30 pm between Monday and Friday with complete closure on weekends. Such establishments situated in other talukas of the district can function till 4 pm with blanket shutdown during weekends. As per official data, Beed district had 1,785 active cases of Covid-19 by Monday, which is the highest among total eight districts from Marathwada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/normalcy-returns-in-aurangabad-curbs-continue-in-beed-district/articleshow/85013923.cms||---

In dollar terms, however, the growth rate comes to 28% for manufacturing goods and 15% for software. The difference is due to the exchange rate variations, explained a source.The exports in dollars stand at $192 million for manufacturing goods, and $164 million for software, according to official data shared with TOI.Sources said that the main export drivers were the pharmaceutical and aviation sectors. Lupin Pharma has a unit in the SEZ. The growth in pharmaceutical exports cannot be linked with the pandemic because the Lupin unit here mainly manufactures non-Covid drugs. Tatas’ unit TAAL, which makes aircraft parts, is also a major contributor along with Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL).The Mihan-SEZ has six types of industries which include IT/ITSES, pharmaceutical, food processing, gems & jewellery, and manufacturing. Recently, the development commissioner’s office has also approved applications of three companies for setting up a unit in Mihan-SEZ. These include M/s Persistent Systems, KS Technologies and Sony Polymers.V Sraman, the development commissioner (DC) for Mihan-SEZ told TOI that they have also received a proposal from a company to start a standalone logistics service. “The idea is to deploy a single plane and aggregate export to be flown further to the respective destinations. The proposal has come from a Malaysian business entity. The same plane can also carry domestic cargo also,” said Sraman.Sraman said the proposal is expected to materialize in due course.The development commissioner’s office is also promoting the concept of a free trade warehousing zone (FTWZ), which is a designated area where goods can be traded by the exporters. Here, the local exporters can also stock their goods and trade. Even the importers can keep their goods here. “There are FTWZs in other SEs, and it is expected to bring a major fillip to Mihan also,” said Sraman.Sraman said that the idea is being promoted because some businesses have shown interest in setting up a FTWZ.The DC office is pushing the idea of FTZW in Mihan as it would not only increase exports but also help the local exporters. Currently, Mihan has 25,000 employees directly engaged in the units here.IN A NUTSHELL- Exports of manufactured goods in 2019-20 was at Rs1,045 crore- In 2020-21, it stood at Rs1,421 crore- In dollar terms, it was $149m and $192m, respectively- In 2019-20, software exports stood at Rs997 crore- It grew by Rs1215 crore in 2020-21- It comes to $142m and $164m respectively||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mihan-sez-units-register-export-growth-amid-covid-lull/articleshow/85019074.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Goa||Candolim reports 50% less dengue cases than last year||Panaji: While Candolim primary health centre (PHC) has been reporting 10-12 cases of dengue every week since the last two months, its caseload is down by 50% as compared to the corresponding period last year. From identifying the source spots to undertaking extensive reduction measures, the PHC has succeeded in containing the spread of dengue infections in its jurisdiction that has high concentration of commercial activity. Health officer Dr Roshan Nazareth however said that they may see a rise in infections after a dry spell as stagnant water facilitates breeding of mosquitoes. “Through active surveillance, we have been able to detect houses having breeding spots. Dengue infections are under control now, but if rain activity stops, we may have more cases. Teams from the panchayat are also helping us,” Nazareth said. A total of 11 dengue cases were reported just last week. “Whenever a case is reported, a team is sent to destroy mosquito breeding sites there to stop further infections,” he said. “We have three-level supervision in Candolim. Our teams also visit source spots more than twice and that’s how we have been able to take measures faster.” These measures, he said were initiated last year, when Candolim saw large number of dengue cases. “Since those measures yielded results, we have continued with them. Efforts taken by the panchayat has also been commendable,” Nazareth said. On dengue infections, Nazareth said it spreads faster than malaria as in the case of dengue, even the eggs laid by an infected mosquito carry the virus. “New mosquitoes are born with the virus and hence, it spreads faster. Thankfully, our measures have worked,” he said. The incubation period for dengue infection is five to six days as against 10 to 15 days in for malaria. As a result, Nazareth said, reduction methods can’t be taken swiftly if a suspected dengue case is reported six days later because, by then, the infected mosquito must have bitten several people, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/candolim-reports-50-less-dengue-cases-than-last-year/articleshow/85021442.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala govt treads cautiously, IPR may replace TPR as criterion||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Covid-19 restrictions to be imposed in a panchayat or municipality/corporation ward are likely to be based on a weekly infection population ratio (IPR) rather than the test positivity ratio (TPR) hereafter. A meeting chaired by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Tuesday is learnt to have decided to review the methodology used to enforce the restrictions. The weekly IPR is calculated by multiplying the Covid-19 infections reported in the week with 1,000 and dividing it with the population of the panchayat or the urban ward. Any panchayat/ward with weekly IPR more than five will need special attention and moderate restrictions while there will be total lockdown if the figure is more than 10. Based on last week's data, there are 181 local self-government institutions in the state that need moderate restrictions and eight LSGs warranting total lockdown. The meeting is also learnt to have redefined a micro containment zone as an area that can be lesser than the area of a local body ward wherein the Covid spread potential is high due to clustering of positive cases. It could be streets, markets, harbours, shopping malls, residential areas, MSME units, offices, apartment complexes, joint family houses with over 10 members, warehouses, workshops and auction centres. Any micro area with more than five positive cases on a given day in a given location will be defined as a cluster. While notifying a street (every 100 m) as micro containment zone, the business units and residences on either side of the street will be made part of the containment without restricting it to one side of the street alone. The area will remain a micro-containment zone for seven days once it is declared by the district disaster management authority. The meeting is also learnt to have decided to impose total lockdown across the state only on Sundays, leaving all other days for shops and commercial establishments to function except shopping malls and theatres. While the coming Sunday (August 8) will be the day of total lockdown, there will not be any lockdown on August 15 and 22 in view of Independence Day and Onam. However, no public functions or meetings will be permitted on these days, it is learnt. Though shops and establishments will be permitted to function, it will be the responsibility of business establishments to ensure that their customers are either vaccinated against Covid, have been infected earlier (have developed antibodies) or have a valid RTPCR-negative certificate. For hotels and resorts in micro-containment zones, police will be asked not to enforce restrictions on customers residing in them so that domestic tourism is not adversely affected. The government has also appointed senior IAS officers for the enforcement, containment and related activities in all districts. They are Saurabh Jain (Kasargod), Biju Prabhakar (Kannur), Rajesh Kumar Sinha (Wayanad), Sanjay Kaul (Kozhikode), Anand Singh (Malappuram), K Biju (Palakkad), APM Mohammed Hanish (Thrissur), K R Jyothilal (Ernakulam), Raju Narayanaswamy (Idukki), P M Ali Asgar Pasha (Kottayam), Sharmila Mary Joseph (Alappuzha), Rani George (Pathanamthitta), Tinku Biswal (Kollam) and Mini Antony (Thiruvananthapuram).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-treads-cautiously-ipr-may-replace-tpr-as-criterion/articleshow/85019053.cms||KP Saikiran

He also charged Vijaya Sai with passing critical remarks against judges of the AP high court. Counsel for Raju S Sri Venkatesh said Vijaya Sai had been violating the conditions of the bail granted to him eight years ago in the quid pro quo case in which he was arrayed as accused number 2 in 11 chargesheets filed by the CBI. Venkatesh said Raju filed the plea bringing to the notice of the court several instances of Vijaya Sai violating the conditions of bail. The petition lists out instances of the Rajya Sabha MP meeting the central ministers and describes them as instances of attempts aimed at influencing the witnesses in the cases against them. “This is a way of showing to the witnesses the power they wield,” Raju said in his petition. Referring to the cases YSRC social media activists faced for carrying out a hate campaign, the petitioner charged Vijaya Sai with shielding the accused. “He was not appearing before the trial court and was filing applications to dispense with the requirement of being physically present before the court,” Raju said, adding that this was being done to dodge the trial in the case. The petitioner also charged Vijaya Sai with passing critical remarks against the judges who pronounced their orders in the Mansas (Maharaja Alak Narayan Society of Arts and Science) Trust case. “This amounts to contempt of court,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cancel-vijaya-sais-bail-raju/articleshow/85023354.cms||---

While Konkan, the smallest of the nine divisions, topped with 99.81% of its regular students emerging successful, it was Pune that had a success rate of 99.72% for regular and repeat students. Maharashtra is the only board that has evaluated its repeat students with regular ones. Aurangabad was at the bottom with 99.06%. For arts and commerce students, there were bumper scores with a success rate of 99.05% and 99.06%, respectively, in the Mumbai division, comprising Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Palghar. Both these streams had never entered the 90% success rates before. “How does one justify a near 100% success rate for an arts stream that has barely managed to touch the 80% success rate all this while,” asked a lecturer. Across the state, the arts stream saw the highest jump of 17% in the pass rate. At St Xavier’s College, the most sought-after institute for arts, the students fared better than their science counterparts both in terms of distinction and scoring 90% and above. “Science students focus more on NEET, JEE and other entrance exams. Our arts students are more focused on their college tests and board exams,” said Hasnain Naqvi, vice-principal of the college. A total of 158 arts and 41 science students of the college scored 90% and above. The jump in commerce in the state was 8.64%, with a high percentage of students (99.56%) emerging successful. When the state announced the 30:30:40 assessment ratio for Class X, XI and XII, arts and commerce students were among those who worried about their performance in Class XI. At Jai Hind College, both arts and commerce saw a 100% success rate. The science stream was at the bottom with a jump of only 3% across the state. In Mumbai, science students fared 7% better than last year. “Science students were at a disadvantage as they missed out on practicals,” said a principal. Though the customary revaluation is not there this year, a grievance redressal committee has been constituted to address issues of the HSC students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hsc-2021-arts-students-focus-on-boards-science-on-entrance-in-mumbai/articleshow/85023402.cms||Sandhya Nair

Citizens of half a dozen villagers reeling under its terror and forest officials pursuing the beast since nearly three weeks finally breathed a sigh of relief after it was captured. Earlier, another leopard was captured in the cage laid down for the Saoli beast, which turned out to be a female. However, soon after it was confirmed that the wrong leopard had been captured, it was released back into the wild.The problem leopardess had became intruding into the village and has attacked two women in their houses. The first victim was Gangubai Gedam from Vyhad village who was killed in front yard of her house while sleeping on July 13. Next day, the beast had mauled farmer Vithal Gedam of Samda village while he was working in his farm.Another woman, Tulsabai Mashakhetri, was mauled while she was sleeping in her house in Wagholi Buti village on July 20. Villagers of Vyhad, Samda, Wagholi Buti, Konapur, Kapsi etc had stopped going out in the fields following repeated leopard attacks.Operations were launched with a renewed vigour after the wrong leopard was trapped. Total 6 cages were laid down at the places where the leopardess was sighted. “Finally, the problem leopardess walked into the cage lured by a bait. As soon as our personnel found that the beast was caged, they moved it to a safer location,” said Sarita Jagtap, DFO, Chandrapur forest division.She claimed that the identity of the leopardess was confirmed by comparing it with camera trap images. The beast was also inspected for injuries but was found to be fit. “It was released back into the wild at an undisclosed location later in the night as per standard operating procedures in such cases,” Jagtap added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/villagers-breathe-easy-as-problem-leopardess-trapped/articleshow/85019109.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Hyderabad||Telangana has to wait for 10 years for 153 assembly seats||HYDERABAD: Telangana is likely to go to the next two elections to its legislative assembly with the existing 119 constituencies only. The number of assembly constituencies in India’s youngest state is expected to go up to 153 — increase of 34 seats — only in 2031. The next assembly election is two years away. Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai on Tuesday reiterated in Parliament that there was no immediate plan to take up delimitation of constituencies in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. As per Article 170(3) of the Constitution, the total number of seats in the assemblies of each state will be reorganised after the report is published post Census-2026. His clarification came in response to a question posed in the Lok Sabha by Malkajgiri MP and TPCC president A Revanth Reddy whether the Centre was planning to undertake a simultaneous delimitation of constituencies in Telangana along with Jammu and Kashmir. The central government had amended the Act in 2002 to go for delimitation of assembly constituencies in the country after the Census to be taken up in 2026, following which the new constituencies will come into existence in 2031. Even neighbouring AP, which is expecting the number of its assembly constituencies to go up from 175 to 225, has to wait until 2031. A senior leader in Congress said the Centre was also considering increasing the number of Lok Sabha seats in the country. The delimitation of Lok Sabha constituencies may also be taken up along with that of assembly segments post Census-2026.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-has-to-wait-for-10-yrs-for-153-assembly-seats/articleshow/85023373.cms||Roushan Ali

Eventually, the number of tests, which was down to 7,500 due to Sunday holiday, was more than doubled in 24 hours before Tuesday. This shows the districts in Vidarbha are still conducting a good number of tests. Most district collectors in the region released notifications of relaxation, applicable from Wednesday onwards. It remains to be seen how people receive these relaxations with regards to outdoor movement and business. The number of under-treatment patients reached 530, a new low, on Tuesday. Barring Nagpur, all districts now have less than 80 patients under treatment. Vidarbha’s recovery rate continued to remain above 98%, which is better than the state and national average.

The investor will have to design, build, finance and operate the premises to attract tourists. The area to be developed into a potential tourism zone is roughly 23,500 sq m around the stepwell. “No major construction activities will be allowed within 100m to 300m radius of the stepwell, except for special circumstances where one will require permissions from the National Monuments Authority,” the tourism department stated, laying out clear guidelines for investors. For instance, there will be a museum developed by TCGL to showcase history, architecture and other features of Adalaj stepwell. A theme-based park beyond the ASI-protected limits is also being suggested under the project. A copy of the project proposal is with TOI. “The developer will have to bear 30% of the project cost. Also, there is provision for letting the place for banquets, setting up multi-cuisine restaurants and holding retail activities including a crafts bazaar,” says a senior TCGL official. The department feels Adalaj has tourism potential as Gandhinagar is located along Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor that is expected to be key growth area in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/adalaj-to-be-spruced-up-as-tourism-zone-through-ppp/articleshow/85021524.cms||---

Former MP and Telangana State Planning Board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar said the Union government was not interested in taking up delimitation exercise in the two Telugu states. “The BJP government can order delimitation by amending the AP State Reorganisation Act. The word ‘subject’ can be removed and ‘notwithstanding’ word can be included in section 26 of the Act which would enable delimitation exercise in Telangana and AP,” he said. Seven mandals from Khammam district were merged with AP after amendments to the Reorganisation Act. Even law ministry officials had opined that delimitation could be taken up after amendments to the Reorgaisation Act, he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/can-order-delimitation-by-amending-ap-state-reorganisation-act-trs-says/articleshow/85023368.cms||---

The words that were stated 12 years ago by a coach proved correct in Tokyo Olympics. Chief coach, MP Women hockey Academy, Paramjeet Singh who had trained Indian women hockey players Sushila Chanu, Reena Khokkar and Monika for many years will see his girls playing semi finals on Wednesday for the country for the first time in the history of Olympics. India will play against Argentina in the semi-finals of Tokyo Olympics. Coach Paramjeet has been associated with the MP women’s hockey academy situated at Gwalior since 2006. Recalling the day when these girls were selected for the academy, Paramjeet said, “Sushila hails from Manipur while Reena belongs to Punjab and Monika from Haryana. In 2006, the hockey academy was launched which was a vision of sports minister Yashodhara Raje Scindia. She asked me to produce world class talent.” He added, “I spoke to several states to send their kids for the academy. Sushila was only 12- year-old when she joined the academy in 2006. Two other girls from Manipur also joined who later played for the India team. Sushila left the academy in 2012 when she became a national player. Reena joined the academy in 2009 and spent 9 years in the academy, while Monika came for a year in 2010.” Recalling the time spent with the players at the academy, coach Paramjeet went through several times where he was told that girls won’t do much in hockey. “Whenever I faced such sentences my only reply for them was that these girls will write history in the Olympics. Today, these girls have proved my words correct,” said coach Paramjeet. About the players, Paramjeet said, “Sushila (midfielder) and Reena (defender) have been outstanding players. My stint with Monika (midfielder) was only a year but she also has the best hockey skills. These 3 players are now pillars of the Indian team playing in the Tokyo Olympics.” He said that these players are always in touch with him. “They had left the academy after learning the best of hockey in the academy. For a coach seeing them in the Olympic semifinal is the best feeling of life,” said Paramjeet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/three-hockey-players-trained-by-mp-academy-coach-eye-oly-glory-today/articleshow/85019124.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Hyderabad||No room to walk: Hyd’s footpaths have more cars & toilets||As more elevated expressways and swank flyovers get green-lit to make Hyderabad a world-class city, an increasing number of Hyderabadis seem to ask one question: But what about our footpaths? Their grouse: Most of the city’s footpaths are either broken, turned into parking lots and dumping yards, encroached by traders or simply bulldozed to make way for a more profitable venture. In fact, some claim Hyderabad has the worst network of footpaths – when compared to other larger cities – and pays little attention to the safety of pedestrians. As TOI toured through the city recently – speaking to road users on the way -- it found that these claims weren’t baseless. Right from Charminar to Banjara Hills and Koti to Ameerpet, the state of footpaths everywhere was deplorable. Near Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University in Nampally, for instance, a bus stop has been constructed right on the footpath. "Pedestrians walking past this bus stop are risking their life as they are forced to walk on the bus bay. There is heavy rush in this area during peak hours. The bus stop needs to be shifted to a different place before it’s too late," said Ram Kumar, a resident of Nampally. In Hasthinapuram, an entire stretch of footpath on the main road has been dug up to plant trees. Sharing a video of the road, a local resident, Sandeep Reddy said, "The GHMC is destroying footpaths in the name of Pattana Pragathi. This is nothing but wastage of public money." TOI found that the condition of footpaths in Koti and Abids are among the worst in the city. Hawkers and shop owners have taken over the footpaths in these densely populated pockets where people are seen walking right in the middle of the roads for lack of option. "How can pedestrians expect to be safe on roads like these? Even on footpaths that are supposedly designated for pedestrians we are made to move for the convenience of shop owners," said T Samyukta, a local resident. In Himayatnagar, motorists were seen freely using the footpath as a parking lot. "No matter what time in the day, there are about 15 to 20 vehicles parked on this footpath. The two-wheelers should stop doing this and at the same time, the GHMC should at least install bollards on footpaths to avoid this menace," said M Dhanraj, a security guard stationed outside a garment store in the area. Pointing at a bus stop and public toilet installed on the footpath on Road Number 3 in Banjara Hills, Dr P Anusha, a medical professional asked, "A few years ago, it was only the roadside vendors who would encroach the footpaths but lately, we are seeing government departments setting up public toilets, bus stations, transformers and even taking up plantation drives on footpaths. Shouldn’t they be leaving the footpaths to pedestrians and have separate places for other facilities?" While agreeing to this issue of footpaths Sreenivasa Reddy, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), Hyderabad said, "We clear temporary encroachments on a regular basis but apart from that, if there are any permanent structures or obstructions that are causing inconvenience to the pedestrians, we coordinate with the GHMC and carry out special drives to remove them." "It is true that there are some permanent structures like toilets and bus stops on footpaths, but those problems should be addressed by the GHMC," he added. Quote Footpaths on all the main roads are under the scope of CRMP (Comprehensive Road Maintenance Programme), where private agencies have been entrusted with the job of maintenance for a particular period of time. Apart from that, we have developed quite a few footpaths since the high court order. There is also a proposal to develop new footpaths in several areas." Speaking about following the guidelines set by Indian Road Congress (IRC) while laying footpaths, Devanand said, "We make every effort to follow the guidelines but since certain footpaths are already there, we cannot go on re-modelling them. Wherever we are laying new footpaths and wherever we are widening or remodelling, in those places, we are taking every care to follow IRC guidelines." —M Devanand | chief engineer (maintenance), ghmc ................................ ‘Give hawkers an alternate biz zone’ Experts also suggest setting up public utilities only in places where necessary Moulika.KV@timesgroup.com Hyderabad: How can Hyderabad’s footpath problem be fixed? To begin with, experts suggest that the width of these footpaths be increased, as per the guidelines of the Indian Road Congress. "Even in places where footpaths exist, the width of pavements is grossly insufficient. To address this problem, the civic authorities must identify footpaths and increase the width according to the requirements of that area," said Prof Rashid Ahmed, road safety expert. As per these guidelines the minimum width of footpaths in residential areas should be 3.3 metres, with space for shop frontages and footpath furniture such as seating, garbage bins, and avenue plants. In commercial zones, it must be at least 5 metres and in high intensity commercial zones the prescribed width is 6.5 metres. This apart, Tewari highlighted another factor – the quality of footpath construction – and stressed on it being inspected after the contractor finishes the work. "This is both for maintaining the longevity of the footpath and the safety of the pedestrian," he said. Speaking about hawkers occupying footpath space, experts said that the problem will not be resolved unless the government provides an alternate place for them to do their business. "Just conducting special drives to remove these hawkers from the footpaths will not prevent them from encroaching again. The government should identify a place nearby where they can earn their living without obstructing the traffic or the movement of pedestrians," said road safety expert and founder of Indian Federation of Road Safety, Vinod Kumar Kanumala, adding, GHMC, Roads and buildings department as well as the traffic authorities should have regular convergence meetings and chalk out a plan to ensure that there are no obstructions for pedestrians walking on these footpaths. Further, in order to make pedestrians the king of the road and not the driver, experts researching urban infrastructure said that the city needs a public campaign, conducted by the government. "Conducting a public campaign is a difficult job, but it needs to be done. It is difficult because structurally, this city, like many other cities, does not care for pedestrians. That is the reason why we imagine that the road is for vehicles and that’s all the city requires," said Anant Maringanti of Hyderabad Urban Labs. Citing the example of toilets on the footpath in Banjara Hills, Road Number 3 Maringanti said, "There are no pedestrians on that road, but we have urinals for advertising. We need to get out of this dishonesty. We don’t need public toilets hiding behind billboards to grab the eyeballs of the driver. Instead, we need footpaths and toilets in places where there is a requirement." A public campaign, he added, would help in identifying locations where public utilities are needed and set them up only there so that they don’t obstruct footpaths in any way. GFX KILLER ROADS In 2021 (up to now) about 45 pedestrians have been killed in accidents while 300 have been injured. In one such case, in June, an elderly lady was killed and several others injured after a speeding car rammed into an auto and eight pedestrians In 2020, 68 pedestrians lost their lives in accidents while 500 (approx) were injured Study based on FIRs, done by the Footpath Initiative, revealed that the highest number of fatalities of pedestrians was recorded in GHMC’s Charminar and Serilingampally zones. The study, an analysis of fatal pedestrian crashes from 2017 to 2019, analysed 568 fatal pedestrian crashes in 127 wards of GHMC limits. It was conducted by transport researchers Varun Sridhar and Anusha Chitturi to bring awareness about issues connected with pedestrian safety. Quote All measures are being taken to ensure the safety of pedestrians. However, it is also the responsibility of the motorists to keep in mind the safety of pedestrians while driving. We have been conducting regular drives to clear encroachments on footpaths so that there is a safe space for people to walk. We have also identified problem areas with other departments and are immediately taking up rectification work. —Sreenivas Reddy | assistant commissioner of police (traffic), hyderabad ..................................................................

At any given point of time, it is packed with cars, bikes etc. Some shops have even put up lights on the footpath. There is no way a pedestrian can use it. -- Vinay Kapoor GANDHI HOSPITAL AREA The footpaths all around this are a mess. There are four toilets on one footpath, leaving no space for pedestrians. Worse, on all three sides of the Hanuman temple the footpaths have been occupied by stalls and motorists. This causes serious inconvenience to pedestrians since the stretch between Musheerabad X Roads and Padmaraonagar, behind Gandhi Hospital, is extremely busy. -- Vishwanath Hariharan KHAIRATABAD The footpath beside Prasad’s Imax complex is completely broken and unusable. It needs to be repaired immediately. -- Rachuri Keerthana LINGAMPALLY The entire stretch of footpath along the main road outside our house in Lingampally X Roads, Kachiguda station road has been encroached by vendors and other. There is no space left for pedestrians. -- Prashant Singh SOMAJIGUDA This is how the footpath along Kapadia Lane, near AIG, looks.

Police arrested Karan Joshi (24) who allegedly strangled his mother Geeta and then stabbed her multiple times in the abdomen. According to police, Joshi initially did not share details, but during cross questioning he confessed to the crime. A complaint was lodged by Joshi’s father Vasant Joshi with Ichhapore police station. Police said that the father-son duo performed various rituals at the residence of their clients in Damka village and neighbouring villages. Vasant alleged that his son was not serious about work or marriage. He always wanted to be with his friends and spent a lot of money on them. His parents had gradually stopped giving him money and were forcing him to get married. Joshi’s parents used to scold him over his habits of roaming with friends for long hours and that had led to frequent quarrels. Neighbours confirmed to police that heated arguments were common among the family members. On Monday morning too, Joshi had an argument with his parents before leaving the house. When Joshi returned at 9 pm, his mother refused to open the door. After an argument for 15 minutes Geeta allowed Joshi inside. Later Geeta went to sleep in the bedroom while Vasant was sleeping in another room. While Geeta was asleep, Joshi strangled her and also stabbed her several times. “Joshi was present in the house when the police arrived. Based on Vasant’s statement we arrested Joshi,” said a cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/24-year-old-priest-strangles-mother-stabs-her-multiple-times/articleshow/85016683.cms||---

The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board is planning to impose a fine of Rs 2 lakh on the school management, sources in the state education department said. The DEO and DPEO authorities summoned the school management for a hearing last week, after complaints were received that the school was illegally admitting students for the academic year 2021-22 without approvals in place. A team of officials visited the school last month to investigate the matter and ordered its immediate shutdown as it did not have a ‘no objection certificate’ (NOC) from the state education department. The Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), to which it was seeking affiliation, had set a March 31 deadline to produce the Gujarat government NOC. There are about 380 students at DPS East and their parents have refused to take school leaving certificates (SLC). They want the school to instead transfer their children to other schools run by the management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/admissions-illegal-dps-east-fined-rs-1l/articleshow/85021528.cms||---

Officials have assured to resolve all problems by November by getting all the lines underground in Mormugao constituency. Ex-councillor Krishna Salkar said, “In view of the frequent powercuts that are plaguing residents of Vasco, Khariawada, Mundvel, Belabai, Driver Hill, Mangor Hill, New Vaddem, Shantinagar and Patrong-Baina, we met assistant engineer Sanjeev Mhalsekar and apprised him of the frequent power failures inconveniencing citizens, especially students’ online education and those working remotely from home. Commercial centres are also affected due to this problem. Electric appliances are also damaged due to the power outages. We requested him to take up underground cabling work for Vasco on priority as that would solve most of these problems. He said that things would be better by November or December.” Speaking to reporters, Mhalsekar said that, “Though there are many complaints of power fluctuations, as a consumer myself, I have not faced this problem. This surprises me sometimes. However, as the department is flooded with complaints, the transformer is often shut to carry out these repair works.” He urged people to register their mobile number with the department so that via Urja Mitra they can receive messages of power cuts lasting more than half hour and power shutdown for maintenance work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vasco-locals-complain-of-frequent-power-cuts/articleshow/85021671.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Bhopal||Bhopal ‘unmasked’ again as cases decline||BHOPAL: Just before the disastrous second Coronavirus wave hit Bhopal, even those who had been adhering to Covid norms religiously ever since the breakout of Coronavirus pandemic had started saying “Enough of mask and sanitiser. Corona is gone now” and what happened a few days later is history. We are again in a situation, where people have become oblivious to masks, social distancing and use of sanitiser as the Coronavirus cases come down drastically. And, as we get complacent towards the threat of Corona pandemic, the cases have started inching up in the state again. On Saturday, 22 new Coronavirus cases were found in the state and 17 each in the next 2 days. “There is an oft-used English adage saying that those who don’t learn from history are condemned to repeat it. I was one of those who had started asking people in my office not to keep their face covered all the time and not use sanitiser every now & then because the cases had come down to 10-15 in the month of February and March. Corona is gone, we used to say and laugh. And, a few days later, almost the entire staff including me and my brothers were down with Coronavirus. Fortunately, we all recovered but the office remained closed for at least 15 to 20 days. That’s why now I insist whether Corona cases are less or more, everyone should wear masks and use sanitisers frequently, particularly when they visit somewhere and come back,” said Pankaj Sharma, who has his office in New Market. Pankaj learnt from his bitter experience but there seems to be a lot of people either not affected by the second wave or have forgotten about it. “I am a doctor. I don’t know for how many days, I have not taken my daughter to an ice cream parlour or a park because of the pandemic. But, people seem to be doing all that as if they don’t care”, said associate professor in pulmonology department at Gandhi Medical College, Dr Parag Sharma, who has treated hundreds of Coronavirus cases. “I remember when the lockdown was eased after the second wave, people seemed to be cautious. You could see people wearing double masks, N-95 masks were back in vogue. Shops had slogans exhorting people to wear masks, observe social distancing norms and get vaccinated. And, shopkeepers and customers both appeared to be doing it themselves. Slogans are still there and circles also outside the shop for customers to wait in those circles and wait for their turn but nobody seems to be concerned any more. Particularly, youngsters are being very reckless. More often than not, you will see them without masks or masks not in the right place”, said Varinder Singh, adding that he makes sure that both his young sons don’t venture out of the house without masks. Flouting of Covid protocol is not limited to markets alone, it’s all the more rampant at tourist/picnic spots, where a lot more people can be seen without masks or crowding a place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-unmasked-again-as-cases-decline/articleshow/85019167.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

---||Hyderabad||I don’t step out with out my mask, shield||The pandemic has really left us jittery. Even after getting fully vaccinated, one doesn’t feel safe. Every day we hear of different variants of Covid-19 doing the rounds all over the globe. In such a scenario, it isn’t the sole responsibility of governments to control the pandemic; every citizen too must rise to the occasion and put his/her best foot forward to thwart the spread of the infection. Taking it easy and feeling that one is immune to the infection is the biggest stumbling block. So, on my part, I make it a point to not only wear a mask but also use a face shield, since maintaining distance in marketplaces is not possible. When on the roads or in public places, I reprimand those people who do not wear masks. While most show guilt, some just blatantly walk away. Through this, I urge everybody that in addition to getting vaccinated, please wear a mask without fail and cover your nose and mouth while stepping out. Only then can we, collectively, put an end to this pandemic. (The writer is a retired private sector employee) …................................... My new mantra: Don’t waste time By Sheetal Rajesh Upadhyay The pandemic took the lives of many people. I lost my grandmother who I was very close to. It disturbed me tremendously and made me realise the importance of mental and physical well-being. So, in my new normal I decided to focus on that – something I always took for granted before the lockdown. Now, I have started to practice yoga and meditation regularly. Instead of spending hours in front of the screen I now indulge in these activities. Yoga has not only helped me cope with the Covid-19 situation, by making me adopt a healthy lifestyle, but it has also given me an engagement that allows me to use my time more judiciously. The rest of the time, I indulge in cooking, reading or signing up for online courses. The pandemic has reinforced how precious time is and that we need to manage it well. It has also made me value the importance of sharing, caring and growing, even more. Overall, it has, in some way, taught us that there is always a ray of hope at the end of the road, no matter how difficult situations in life might be at the moment. It has taught us the importance of being happy.

According to the letter submitted to the authorities, the resident doctors demanded bond period calculation as 1:2 (doubling the calculation of days of duty), benefits of Seventh Pay Commission, appointments in their own alma mater due to loss of study in the first year following the pandemic, and implementing the scheme of senior residentship along with bond on the lines of other states. While JDA office bearers could not be contacted for comment, BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital officials said that the services were disrupted as the groups announced strike from 5 pm on Tuesday. Jai Prakash Shivahare, state health commissioner, said that there was a representation from junior doctors about their demands. “The state has already extended all the benefits possible to the doctors. Some of the demands raised by the group cannot be fulfilled. For example, as there are not many Covid-19 patients, they cannot avail 1:2 bond period which was offered at the time of second wave,” he said. Sources said the state government tried to reason with representatives, but talks remained inconclusive. The state , however, is not in a mood to negotiate on several aspects of the representation including the bond and tenure, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/resident-docs-in-gujarat-to-strike-work-over-pending-demands/articleshow/85021618.cms||---

Chandrashekhar Azad, chief of Bhim Army, reached Delhi to support the family and offered them legal help. The parents suspect that she was raped too. The girl’s mother said her husband was away when her daughter was forcefully cremated and she was made to sit away from the pyre.

Read AlsoDelhi: Kin allege 9-year-old raped, cremated without their nodMystery surrounds the death of a nine-year-old girl at a crematorium in south-west Delhi’s Nangal village on Sunday night. After the final rites, the family of the girl alleged that she had been sexually assaulted and murdered. They also carried out a protest against police on Monday.“The four accused — Radhey Shyam (55), the priest, Kuldeep Kumar (63), Laxmi Narain (48) and Mohammad Salim (49) — have been arrested and sent to jail. A three-member medical board has been formed to carry out an autopsy of the remains. An ACP-rank officer will investigate the case,” said Singh, adding that the family and villagers could give their grievances in writing and police would look into them. On Tuesday morning, the girl’s family and the villagers blocked both carriageways of the road from Delhi Cantonment towards Janakpuri. The girl’s mother told TOI, “The accused should be burnt in the same way like my daughter. I want all of them to be hanged to death. I was called by the priest and reached the crematorium, where my girl was lying on a bench with her T-shirt and bloomers on. Her lips were blue and there was a burn mark on her hand.” “The priest and the employees did not ask me for any document, like Aadhaar card. They said if I told anyone, then the matter would go to court and we would suffer. I was made to sit in a corner and they started cremating her. When I protested, they stopped mid-way, but by then only her ankles remained. They wanted my husband to sign a document, but he refused. Later, the villagers reached the crematorium and thrashed the accused men and called police,” added the mother. 1/8In pics: Rahul Gandhi visits 9-year-old rape victim's family in Delhi Previous NextShow Captions<p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi met the family of the nine-year-old girl who died following an alleged sexual assault in Delhi - Twitter</p><p>Rahul Gandhi assured his support to the family of the minor girl - Twitter</p><p>"It is my job to help them," Gandhi said as he met the girl's parents - Twitter</p><p>Her parents' tears are saying only one thing - their daughter, the daughter of this country, deserves justice.

---||Bhopal||A battle of nerves for those with severe infection||BHOPAL: People who were severely ill following Covid-19 infection, need to be actively screened for adverse neurological and psychiatric disorders. “The indications to observe are if a patient is taking more time to react, inappropriate response and memory issues among others. The occurrence can be more pronounced in people who had Covid-19 related unconsciousness, admitted in ICU or hospitalization for severe Covid-19 related illness,” said AIIMS Bhopal HoD neurology and additional professor, Dr Nirendra Rai. Where there is no localized large study, indications in some patients hint at a need for better surveillance mechanisms, according to experts. In Bhopal alone an estimated 50,000 people have required higher care following Covid-19 infection. Experts are observing these outcomes based on 6-month neurological and psychiatric outcomes in 2,36,379 survivors of Covid-19, published in Lancet in April. Experts like Dr Rai avoid interlinking international studies to neurological and psychiatric outcomes being observed in a hospital like AIIMS Bhopal in recovered Covid-19 patients. That said, most baseline characteristics used in the study, is a focus point to assess relative risks of neurological and psychiatric diagnoses. “In some patients who had Covid-19 and recovered at home, adverse neurological effects have been observed. However, it is not as high as in patients who had required hospitalisation,” he added. At a time when, long term impact of the infection is yet to be fully understood, experts recommend enhanced neurological follow-up of such patients. Quantifying the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on brain health, on the workforce and social implications begins with a robust health and social care system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/a-battle-of-nerves-for-those-with-severe-infection/articleshow/85019188.cms||Jamal Ayub

He said the theft was detected during a physical verification of the seized sand by a team from state mines and geology department during its two-day visit on June 11 and 12. Gopal said only 51 lakh CFT of seized sand was there while the team found 4.33 crore CFT missing. “After that a district level joint team was formed on July 15 to cross-check the stock. The team has submitted its report recently,” Gopal said. Around 4.84 crore CFT sand was seized from different parts of the district during the last one and a half years and several FIRs were also lodged in this connection. The seized sand was handed over to the sand mining licensee for safe custody, he said. The officiating Rohtas district magistrate, Surendra kumar, however, refused to comment on the issue. SP Rohtas, Ashish Bharati, said the police have nothing to do with the seized sand. Incidentally, 17 officers, including two IPS officers, have been suspended recently for their alleged nexus with sand smugglers. Dehri-on-Sone sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Sunil Singh and ASP Sanjay Kumar were also punished for their suspected involvement in facilitating illegal sand mining under their respective jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sand-worth-rs200-crore-seized-in-rohtas-missing/articleshow/85016761.cms||Alok Chamaria

In the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exam results declared by the board on Tuesday, Nagpur division’s results witnessed a 7.97% jump while Amravati’s increased its tally by 7.28% in comparison to last year. Students were assessed on the basis of their performances in the last two years as the exams couldn’t take place due to lockdowns and restricions. Board officials termed the results as “historic” as over 99.63% students were declared successful without answering even a single question. While Nagpur slipped a notch to finish sixth with a 99.62% success rate among nine divisions as compared to last year, Amravati secured the second last position at 99.37%, just above Aurangabad. Last year, Nagpur finished fifth while Amravati secured the fourth position. In 2019, Nagpur division finished at the bottom while in 2018, it was second last. In both divisions, girls once again outperformed boys in all streams, except in the repeaters’ results. Chandrapur district topped Nagur division with 99.83% success rate followed by Gadchiroli at 99.73%, Nagpur at 99.61% and Wardha at 99.59%. Bhandara and Gondia, which usually used to top the division’s chart finished at fifth and sixth positions with pass percentage of 99.54% and 99.37% respectively. Last year, Gondia topped the division for the second year in a row with 94.13%, followed by Bhandara that retained its second position by securing 93.58% pass percentage. In Amravati division, Washim district topped the chart with 99.89% pass percentage, followed by Yavatmal at 99.77%, Buldhana at 99.47%, and Amravati at 99.29%. Akola finished at the bottom of the ladder with 99.26%. From Nagpur division, 1,40,859 students had registered for the HSC exams of which 1,40,325 were declared pass. Of them, 65,765 secured distinction, 63,899 are in first class, 10,550 in second class while just 110 are in pass class. Only 534 students are declared as failed. Even the repeater students have been promoted which led to their best ever results in the board’s history. Out of 6,501 failure students, 6,295 are declared as pass with 99.44% success rate. In Amravati division, 1,31,989 candidates had enrolled for the Std 12th exams of which 1,31,166 are declared as pass. It means just 853 are failed in the division’s five districts. About 6,090 repeaters had registered for the exam and of them, 6,081 are promoted with a pass percentage of 99.85. In both divisions, though the number of examinees enrolled is more in science stream, the commerce secured better pass percentage. In Nagpur, the commerce students lead the tally with a 99.95% success rate followed by arts at 99.86%, MCVC at 99.61 and science at 99.43%. Similarly in Amravati, 99.92% commerce students are declared as pass, followed by 99.91% arts, 99.44% MCVC and 99.82% science.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/even-without-exams-vid-fared-poorly-in-historic-hsc-results/articleshow/85019662.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Vax doses in pvt hospitals going unused: Collector||Nagpur: The Covid-19 vaccine quota for private hospitals is not being consumed entirely, said district collector R Vimala during a press meet at the Nagpur Patrakar Club on Tuesday. Out of the total supply of vaccine doses, 25% are set aside for the private hospitals where paid vaccination is carried out. However, due to “general reluctance for a paid vaccine”, the quota is not being consumed fully, the collector added. The collector appealed that those who can afford to should go for the paid vaccine. In Nagpur district, which includes areas beyond Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)’s limits, 58% of the population has been administered at least the first dose of vaccine. As for the second dose, around 22% of the target population has been covered. The programme is running as expected, she said. “The area out of municipal limits comes under the district collectorate. The officers said there is no shortage of vaccines for the district,” she added. The collector said she would be sending another proposal to the government for allowing restaurants to operate till 8pm. A similar proposal was sent earlier but was not accepted. The previous collector had also mooted a relaxation in timing norms for restaurants, said Vimala. She further said the current Covid norms were expected to prevent large gatherings, which can happen in restaurants and wedding halls. “There are curbs on restaurants because of the hygiene factor. For example, the washing happens in the same basin and the surface can remain wet despite all the care. This perhaps makes the restaurants more susceptible to spreading infection,” the collector added. On a likely third wave, she said adequate preparations were in place for managing patients. “Beds will be set aside for paediatric patients. Two to three pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants are also coming up to ensure enough supply,” Vimala stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-doses-in-pvt-hospitals-going-unused-collector/articleshow/85019264.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Proposed rules could prolong PG evaluation’||AHMEDABAD: The draft Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations 2021 could well make the evaluation process for PG studies awkward, besides leading to a month-long delay in announcement of the exam results, feel experts in the education sector. Experts in the education sector say that by the present evaluation process, where four valuators are roped in for every field of postgraduate (PG) and PG super-specialty courses in medical studies, takes about 15-20 days before declaring the results. The draft proposed by National Medical Commission aims to change the evaluation process, that could lead to a delay of one month in announcing the results, said an Ahmedabad-based expert in the medical education field. According to the existing system, two of the four evaluators are to be from within Gujarat while the remaining two are to be from other Indian states, they said. There are four exam papers for PG medical and PG super specialty courses. “All the answer scripts shall be subjected to two evaluations by the concerned university. The average of the total marks awarded by the two evaluators for the paper, rounded off to the nearest value, shall be considered for computation of the results,” according to clause 18.2 of the draft. All the answer scripts, where the difference between two evaluations is 15% and more of the total marks prescribed for the paper, shall be subjected to a third evaluation, it proposes. “The draft further proposes that the average of the best two total marks, awarded by the three evaluators for the paper, rounded off to the nearest value, shall be considered for final computation of the results. This makes the entire process very clumsy and will lead to a delay in the announcement of results,” said an academician. After the computation and declaration of the results, under no circumstances is revaluation permitted by any authority, the draft states. All health universities/institutions imparting postgraduate courses shall develop a platform for bar-coded digital evaluation, it further states. Experts said if implemented, the rules may lead to 30% decline in PG medical seats in Gujarat. About 2,000 PG medical and PG super-specialty seats in the state could be affected by the new set of rules, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/proposed-rules-could-prolong-pg-evaluation/articleshow/85021653.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Hyderabad||Right time to start reopening commercial activity, says IIT-Hyderabad professor on Sutra team||HYDERABAD: The time is right for start opening up businesses and commercial activity, according to IIT-Hyderabad professor Dr M Vidyasagar who is part of the Sutra team. Sutra is a mathematical model developed by IIT-Kanpur and IIT-Hyderabad to predict the progression of the pandemic. Dr Vidyasagar said that the government should also start thinking about opening schools in the near future. “...Daily wage workers have to work and children have to go back to school. Online is not a substitute for real classes. We need to start discussions on how to reopen, set up a taskforce to plan the process. Not opening up is not going to make the pandemic go (away) any faster,” Dr Vidyasagar said. The professor added that unless the pandemic works its way through the society, it won’t go away and cited the example of Kerala for trying to repress the pandemic by restricting its spread. Dr Vidyasagar cited the results from the latest sero-survey by ICMR and a contemporary survey by AIIMS, both of which showed that sero prevalence in children was as much as that in adults. He predicted the third wave to peak around mid to end-October. “The second wave is pretty much over in most of the country except in Kerala and Maharashtra...” the SERB National Science and Distinguished Professor said, adding that the third wave will not be as severe as the second. “The reason it won’t be as severe as the second is that most people who were infected in the second wave are still be within the 8 months period when they will have the benefit of antibodies.” The outcome of the third wave will also depend on the presence of a more virulent variant of the virus, Dr Vidyasagar said. “As per our mathematical model, in the worst case scenario too, daily average cases will be between 1.2 and 1.5 lakh in the country...the number of serious infections requiring oxygen or ICU will also be lower,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/time-right-to-start-reopening-iit-h-prof-on-sutra-team/articleshow/85021269.cms||Amrita Didyala

Many parents claimed that their wards were only awarded minimum passing marks as they had failed to clear the fee. “Even though my son does well in studies well and was always among the top scorers in the schools, he was awarded minimum marks in all theory subjects. In all subjects, he secured either a D1 or D2 grade,” said a parent, whose son registered for the class 10 exam from a school in Yosufguda. “The only thing missing was the fee. My son was awarded fewer marks as we did not clear the fee,” he said, alleging that the management did the same thing with other defaulters as well. This year, as CBSE could not conduct board exams due to the pandemic, the board has released the mode of assessment to award marks. As per the board, periodic test/unit test are given a weightage of 10 marks, half-yearly/mid-term exams were allotted 30 marks, and pre-board was given 40 marks weightage. To ensure accuracy and fairness of results, a result committee was also constituted by each school with eight members — principal, five subject teachers, and two external members. “Not just for CBSE class 10 exams but schools did the same thing to SSC, class 12 or intermediate students too. Fee defaulters are being given minimum marks,” said K Venkata Sainath from Hyderabad Schools Parents Association adding that several parents have brought this issue to their notice. Meanwhile, the CBSE announced that any candidate who is not satisfied with the marks allocated will be given an opportunity to appear in an exam as and when the conditions are conducive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wards-given-lower-score-parents-with-fee-dues/articleshow/85020333.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Hyderabad||Unesco’s tag for Ramappa an ‘answer’ to 800-yr-old prayer||Hyderabad: The Unesco inscription of Rudreshwara (Ramappa) temple as a world heritage site has fulfilled an 800-year-old prayer of Kakatiya noble, Recherla Rudra, who built the temple considered a fable in stone, in 1213 CE. While laying the foundation for the grand temple complex, Rudra, a general of the Kakatiyas, offered prayers to all deities invoking their blessings for the prosperity of the temple and the town associated with it. The stone inscription at the temple, which has 54 verses, begins with the invocation of the gods seeking their help and praying to each of them to keep the temple and its city of Atukuru (now Palampet) prosperous and flourishing. The verses also sing hymns in praise of the Kakatiya ruler and describe the locality around the temple complex, including its grandeur and magnificence, that even a “betel vine had climbed up the coconut tree” to have an aerial view of the locality. As in the case of Hyderabad, whose founding father Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah, had prayed to make the city full of people just like the sea which is full of life, Rudra sought the collective help of all deities for the prosperity of the temple and the town. Intach city convener P Anuradha Reddy said the Kakatiyas had given importance to three Ts — temple, town and tank. And, Ramappa is the best example of this synthesis of architectural, social and aquatic heritage. The inscription was translated by Dr Lionel David Barnett, a scholar in Sanskrit who was associated with the British Museum in early 20th century. The translation was recorded by eminent archaeologist Ghulam Yazdani of the princely Hyderabad state in his ‘Temples at Palampet’, the first-ever scientific document on the Ramappa temple complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/unescos-tag-for-ramappa-an-answer-to-800-yr-old-prayer/articleshow/85021299.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Hyderabad||Breastfeeding helps create unique bond between mother and baby||Breast milk is the healthiest form of milk and the best way to provide newborns with nutrients they need. Breast milk is easily digestible and breast-fed babies tend to have less constipation, fewer feeding problems compared to bottle-fed. There is evidence that fatty acids in breast milk help develop baby’s brain. Breast-fed babies have a significantly lower risk of developing sudden infant death syndrome, where typically the infant is found dead after having been put to bed. Breastfeeding helps create a unique emotional bond between mother and baby. It helps reduce incidence of post-delivery depression. It releases a hormone oxytocin which helps uterus contract and return to its normal size more quickly and thus helps in reducing excessive bleeding after delivery. It reduces risk of developing breast cancer and evidence is accumulating to suggest that breastfeeding helps reducing risk of uterine and ovarian cancer too. Myths Decoded Myth: Breast cancer does not occur during pregnancy and lactation. Fact: Breast cancer can occur during pregnancy and lactation. Being ‘breast aware’ is absolutely important even during pregnancy and lactation. Should there be any new changes, a specialist consultation is essential to rule out abnormality. Myth: Breast cancer can be transmitted through breast feeding Fact: There is no evidence to suggest that breast cancer is transmitted through the mother’s milk. However, breast milk should not be given while the mother is receiving chemotherapy as drugs can be transmitted through milk which can harm the baby. Myth: Breastfeeding should be stopped when there is breast infection Fact: Breastfeeding should not be stopped when there is breast infection (mastitis) as the infection does not harm the baby. In fact, breast feeding keeps ducts patent and may help improve breast infection. If the infection progresses to an abscess, feeding from affected side should be stopped temporarily. Myth: Mammograms can be done during pregnancy and lactation. Fact: Although radiation dose from a mammogram is small, it is best to avoid radiation exposure to foetus or infant. Myth: Breastfeeding should be avoided in HIV+ mothers Fact: Breastfeeding is a good option for HIV+ mothers, provided they commence taking Anti Retro Viral Therapy from 14th week of pregnancy Breastfeeding contributes to survival and well-being of child and mother. The powers that be must do everything possible to protect, promote this fundamental healthcare need.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/breastfeeding-helps-create-unique-bond-between-mother-and-baby/articleshow/85020462.cms||Dr P Raghu Ram

Experts in Alam designing and evolution point out that the Alam coming from Australia is different from the one stolen from Aza Khan Zehra, which is still missing. The NGA is returning the Alam of the Vijayanagar empire as part of the 14 artefacts that were stolen from India at different times. As efforts are being made by unscrupulous elements to project the Alam from NGA as the one stolen from Aza Khana Zehra in an apparent bid to close the 18-year-old theft case, experts have pointed out the subtle differences in the Alams crafted in the kingdoms of Vijayanagar and Qutub Shahis and the dominion of the Asaf Jahis. Alams crafted during these periods are unique with marked differences in craftmanship, use of metals, attachment of mythical figurines and the design of their fingers. “The Alams designed in the later part of the Asaf Jahi rule are also different from the ones popular in Vijayanagar and Qutub Shahi periods,” said Mir Murtuza Ali Moosvi, custodian of Badashahi Ashoorkhana. Murtuza Ali, who is an expert on Alams and their evolution over last 500 years in Telugu states, told TOI that the design of the Alam stolen from Aza Khana Zehra and that of NGA’s Alam do not match at all. The age difference between the two Alams is about 400 years. The NGA Alam was crafted between 1509 and 1529 CE long before the Charminar was built. The Alam stolen from Aza Khana Zehra was presented by Nizam VII, Mir Osman Ali Khan, in 1956. The Vijayanagar Alam is made of brass or possibly panchaloha, while the one from Aza Khana was crafted in silver. The Vijayanagar Alam has figurines of lions and dragons attached to them, while the Qutub Shahi ones have the mythical figures embossed or engraved. “A close observation of the NGA Alam shows an intricate chain work. This pattern was followed in Vijayanagar empire for mangalsutras too. This design, which is chain-like, is also followed by modern goldsmiths inspired by Vijayanagar designs,” Murtuza Ali said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/alam-from-oz-not-same-as-one-stolen-from-aza-khana/articleshow/85021350.cms||Syed Akbar

Therefore, for the first six months your baby should be only breastfed, after which supplemental food should be introduced along with breastfeeding for 12–24 months,” said Dr C Jayasree Reddy, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Ankura Hospital for women and children. Breast milk has a composition that is very easy to digest by babies including premature ones and helps them attain their physical milestones like sitting, walking at the right age.“With the persistent fear of the third wave of Covid-19 and vaccination for infant and young children still not in sight, it makes re-focusing on breastfeeding even more important. Ensuring implementation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth during all institutional deliveries will be an important step towards achieving the target,” says Mini Varghese, Nutrition International’s country director for India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-37-t-kids-get-moms-milk-in-first-hour-of-birth/articleshow/85020556.cms||Amrita Didyala

Accused Dimple Soni had roped in three men for the theft after doing a recce of Ranjan Gor’s house in Karelibaug over the past two months. “She (Soni) said that she was in need of money to pay house rent and other expenses. She knew every nook and corner of the bungalow and the owner’s routine. She fed all the information to the three gang members,” said R I Jadeja, Karelibaug police inspector. All the four then hatched the loot plan over the past few days and decided to strike early on Monday morning. They entered the bungalow from the first floor and first cornered Gor. One of the accused, Ritesh Godadiya then assaulted the woman and snatched all the gold jewellery she was wearing while Soni instructed another accused, Akash Raval, to look for valuables at other places in the house. Raval was nabbed by a security guard and passers-by while escaping with the three others. Cops later tracked Soni and another third accomplice, Arjun Kharva, but Godadiya is still on the run. “We have learnt that Godadiya used to visit Ahmedabad and Surat often. So we have contacted our counterparts in the respective cities to ascertain if has any crimes have been registered against him. The trio claimed that most of the jewellery is with the absconding criminal,” Jadeja said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/maid-planned-loot-at-elderly-womans-house/articleshow/85015283.cms||---

Chirag alleged that the members of Dalit community were being frequently targeted and subsequently killed in different parts of the state. The recent murder of former Katihar mayor Shivraj Paswan was a case in point. He said earlier Anil Oraon, state chief of LJP’s ST cell and his party candidate from Manihari assembly constituency, was killed. Another former Katihar mayor, Bhushan Paswan, was shot dead. “The way criminals are targeting people’s representatives suggests that no law and order exists in the state. Incidents of kidnapping, murder, extortion and loot have increased alarmingly,” the memorandum read. Chirag pointed out that since the panchayat elections were due in the state, such incidents may occur at frequent intervals. "”here is an urgent need to check criminal incidents to instil a sense of security among the people,” he added. Chirag had earlier written to DGP S K Singhal to beef up his security arrangements in the wake of frequent attacks on the members of the Dalit community in the state. He is currently visiting different districts as part of his ‘ashirvad yatra’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-submits-memo-to-guv-on-poor-law-order/articleshow/85016854.cms||Ramashankar

The 2020 pass percentage was 82.6%. However, while the government schools were ahead of the private schools in the success rate in Class XII, the positions have changed and private schools did better than government schools in Class X. In the 16 regions that CBSE has divided the country into and with regards to the performance of government schools in these regions, Delhi was at the 10th spot, ahead of Uttar Pradesh, Chandigarh, Dehradun, Noida and Guwahati. The pass percentage of girls in Delhi was above that of the boys at 98.9% against 97.4% for boys. Regarding the performance of government schools in Class X, written exams for which couldn’t be held due to the pandemic, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi, “The pass percentage of Delhi government schools is 97.52%. 186 of our children have scored more than 95%.” He congratulated the “students, parents and team education”. Citing Kejriwal’s tweet, deputy CM and education minister Manish Sisodia also tweeted in Hindi, “This is the result of Arvind Kejriwal (ji’s) governance model, that Delhi government schools are setting an example in the country.” In the two regions in the city, the pass percentage of government schools in Delhi West (98.6%) was higher than in Delhi East (96.8%). Last year too, the west region had recorded a better performance at 84.9% against 81.4% in the east, which had a bigger number of students. While CBSE could not hold written exams due to Covid, 1,008 schools held different exams, which formed the basis of the board’s final assessment. A total of 2,30,692 students sat for these school examinations. Of all the students who were in Class X, 300 were deemed not to have cleared the hurdle, while 5,419 were accorded compartmental results. Compartment result is declared when a student is unable to pass in one or two subjects. This year, 750 schools recorded 100% results, an increase from 147 last year. Also, 186 students scored more than 95%. Further, the data released by Delhi government shows the average marks, calculated as Quality Index, had improved to 278.3 from 265.31 in 2020.

---||Bhopal||Consistency clicks in Covid-hit year||BHOPAL: With 99.47% pass results, CBSE Bhopal region Class 10 results were declared on Tuesday. Three students-Vanisha Pathak (Carmel Convent), Toshika Kamble (DPS) and Mansi Manwani (St Joseph’s Convent) secured 99.8% each. This year, the CBSE Class 10 board exams were cancelled in view of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Further, the CBSE Class 10 results have been calculated using the evaluation criteria set by the board. For Class 10 students, the standard 80:20 marking criteria was followed this year, where 80% weightage was for unit tests and pre-boards while 20 per cent was for the practical and project work. School toppers said that consistency in studies helped them score such a good mark. “Disciplined approach and consistent studies was my success mantra. I am happy that the strategy paid me such dividends,” said Mansi Manwani, a student of St Joseh’s Convent, Idgah Hills. Her father Suresh Manwani is a professor in govt polytechnic. She added, “I have missed the final exams. I am confident of scoring the same even in exams also as my preparation was up to the mark.” Another topper, Vanisha Pathak said that students should never take studies casually at any point of time. “I am able to score such good marks as I was consistent. I have never taken any exam or class academics casually. I think that has helped such a good score even without exams,” said Vanisha. She was a student of Carmel Convent, BHEL. Asked about her schedule, Vanisha said, “Proper time management while preparing for exams helped me as I was scoring good marks in all unit and pre-board exams. I am thankful to my school teachers and blessings of my family who have been there in all ups and downs.” Toshika Kamble of DPS who secured 99.8% said that academics in the right direction helped her score such a mark. “I have always been attentive in online classes and never missed any kind of exams in the class. For me this was the success mantra of scoring good marks as I was consistent in class academics,” said Toshika. The board will not release the merit list year. The CBSE Class 10 exams that were scheduled to be organised on May 4 were called off due to the devastating second wave of Covid in the country. Students who are aggrieved with the results would be allowed to appear for an exam to be held by the board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/3-students-top-city-with-99-8/articleshow/85019335.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Clouds come with no silver lining of rain, dry week ahead||AHMEDABAD: Amdavadis and Gujarati at large might be feeling like residents of Champaner in Lagaan film — hopeful of good rains based on the presence of dark clouds in the sky. However, their wait for substantial rainfall is likely to continue at least for another week, according to the Met department. The India Meteorological Department predicts that Ahmedabad and Gujarat are unlikely to get get major rainfall. Other parts of Gujarat are likely to receive light to moderate rain. Manorama Mohanty, head of IMD Gujarat, said that lack of strong weather system is behind scant showers in the region. “Rainfall may reduce further from Wednesday. For at least next seven days, the state may not record significant rain. However, in pockets, the rain may continue,” she said. IMD officials said that the state is currently about 36% deficit compared to the rainfall till July 31. Experts added that it’s one of the lowest mid-season rainfalls in past one decade. But for a couple of spells, the state has received its majority of rainfall due to impact of cyclone Tauktae this year. Due to cloudy weather for the past few days, the maximum temperature has remained around 31 degrees Celsius. Across Gujarat, the maximum temperature remained in the range of 30-32 degrees Celsius. Aniket Rana, a resident of Vastrapur and travel enthusiast, said that it’s unfortunate that several parts of the country are getting excessive rainfall resulting in floods, whereas the state is rain-deficient. “We used to take a trip to the periphery of Ahmedabad to enjoy the flora after a spell of rain. We are now planning to go to Dangs one of the weekends,” he said. Several tree plantation initiatives have also been put on hold for a few days as citizens are hopeful of getting drenched in rains again. For the past three days, the daily rainfall in the city has not exceeded 1mm. On Tuesday, only Kaprada in Valsad (15 mm) and Umarpada in Surat (12 mm) received more than 10 mm rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/clouds-come-with-no-silver-lining-of-rain-dry-week-ahead/articleshow/85021706.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Black money gang lures businessmen, 3 caught||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s crime branch has seized Rs 45 lakh and arrested three members of a syndicate that was duping businessmen on the pretext of converting black money into white through systematic investments, NGOs and RTGS transfers. They had recently duped two businessmen of Rs 3 crore in separate cases. According to joint commissioner (crime) Alok Kumar, the gang had opened temporary offices in business hubs like Chandni Chowk and Sadar Bazar in Delhi and at similar places in other states to dupe businessmen. They also posed as 'angadias' and offered cash movement facility. The accused have been identified as Ravinder Shah (37) from Karawal Nagar, Nabeel Ahmed (31) from Tilak Bazar and Jobanjeet Singh (41) from Amritsar. “Shah used different aliases. In some cases, he was posing as Umesh Kanti Lal Patel. Ahmed worked as field operator and arranged office spaces for the gang. He has a dry cleaning shop in Kucha Ghasiram, Chandni Chowk. Singh is the link between these accused and other gang members. Fake IDs in the name of Deepak Govil have been seized from him,” joint CP Kumar said. The crime branch had received information about these gang members from an informer and mounted surveillance. The cops nabbed three of them from GT Karnal Road while they were heading to Punjab in a Honda City car. During interrogation, they disclosed their involvement in more than two dozen cases of cheating all over the country. The money recovered from them was found linked to two cases registered at Prem Nagar, Delhi and Bhiwadi, Rajasthan. In Prem Nagar case, the entire siphoned amount of Rs 22 lakh has been recovered. In the Bhiwadi case, Rs 2.78 crore was siphoned and 23 lakh has been recovered. “The gang comprises more than a dozen members. They used to rent offices in economic hubs on the basis of fake documents. Once their target is trapped by field operators, he is induced into handing over cash to the gang members, who then vanish after closing shop and switching off their mobile phones,” the joint commissioner added. According to police, the gang has been operating since the past one and a half years and is learnt to have invested the cheated money in purchasing hookah parlours and shops in malls all around the country. They have cheated people in almost all major cities in India like Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Kolkata and Chennai. About 6-7 months ago, the gang duped Rs 2 crore from a victim. About 2 months ago, the gang had cheated about Rs one crore from a party in Ahmedabad and the same amount from a Madhya Pradesh-based businessman. At least six other members of the gang have been identified. Efforts are being made to trace them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/black-money-gang-lures-businessmen-3-caught/articleshow/85021735.cms||---
---||Nagpur||PWD says it will plant 200 trees in every km||Nagpur: Two days after the midnight felling of over 55 trees by the public works department (PWD) on Wardha-Sewagram-Dattapur road, on Tuesday the agency claimed to have planted 4,000 saplings and said it will plant another 4,000 trees. “We will plant 200 saplings in every one km. Thus, in the 40km affected stretch, we will plant 8,000 trees. Ten-year maintenance of these trees will be with the contractor,” said executive engineer PN Boob. On Tuesday, the Wardha Vriksh Bachao Nagrik Samiti (VBNS) called the tree plantation drive by PWD as eyewash. “Last year, when PWD planted saplings, a survey found that there was 75% mortality,” said Sushma Sharma. The PWD officials and VBNS activists were at crossroads over the statement by executive engineer PN Boob that trees were felled with the consent of VBNS. However, VBNS activist Sushma Sharma in a statement released to the media said, “On July 26, a joint survey was conducted by us in the presence of public representatives Shekhar Shende and Pravin Hiwre. We had opposed the felling of trees.” “On July 30, when Boob called me on the issue, I clearly said we are against the felling of the trees. Yet, trees were felled at midnight, and now false propaganda is being made by Boob that consent of VBNS was taken before felling these trees.” Sharma said, “Boob took VBNS for granted and assumed that our participation in the survey itself was our consent, which is not true.” One of the activists, Ashok Bang said, “The whole argument that 10 times saplings will be planted in lieu of 60-year-old trees that were felled is ridiculous. The new saplings that are planted are close to the drain and in future will affect the drainage system and again will have to be cut.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pwd-says-it-will-plant-200-trees-in-every-km/articleshow/85019363.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Bhopal||‘Pandemic squeezed my savings, but not my zest for colours’||BHOPAL: This is her first solo exhibition post lockdown and Sushila Maravi is elated. “Showcasing my art at a gallery and interacting with art lovers in person and not virtually, seems surreal after almost18 months,” said Sushila as her Gond art exhibition started at Tribal Museum on Tuesday. The event will go on till August 30. Pandemic blues have affected her deeply, but like millions of people out there, she has taken the knock on the chin.  As it is, challenges have been her constant companions since childhood.  “Early on in my life, I learnt to battle poverty stoically and worked her as a construction labourer along with my husband soon after my marriage at 16. Life was one big battle, but I fought on and finally turned the instinct for my traditional art into my profession, around 11 years ago. After that, there was no looking back,” said Sushila and went on to add, “The pandemic squeezed all my savings, but not my zest for colours.” Now that she is back to her favourite turf, Sushila is also trying to motivate others to fight against the pandemic in a creative manner. “I have made a painting on Covid theme, which gives a ray of hope to people and reinforces the faith that finally we will emerge victorious,” she said. Her Gond art is a reflection of her passion for nature and its rainbow moods. Right from animals to trees, flowers and humans, her paintings dwell on hope and happiness. Her colour palette is hand-picked, seeking inspiration from nature itself, with rusts, oranges, greens, purples and blues ruling the roost. She explained her preferences thus: “These are the shades which reflect different moods of nature, that is why I happily play with them, being a child of nature.” This 35-year-old artist, who has studied till Std 2, has exhibited her works at various prestigious galleries across the country. Right now, she is busy passing on her heritage to her three children. She said, “This art is our tribal treasure and unless youngsters nurture it further, it will be lost to apathy. As an artist, it is my first responsibility to ensure that it doesn’t become extinct.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pandemic-squeezed-my-savings-but-not-my-zest-for-colours/articleshow/85019383.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

---||Delhi||Delhi: After a dip last year, private schools manage to register 99% success rate||NEW DELHI: After a slide in their Class X pass percentage last year, the private schools in Delhi recorded a larger number of their students clearing the hurdle this year. In the two regions that Delhi is divided into, the success rate of private schools in Delhi East was 99.5% this year, up from 91.3% last year and in Delhi West, it went up from 89.1% last year to 99.6% this year. When compared with their performance in CBSE’s 14 other regions across India, private schools in Delhi did better than their counterparts in Guwahati, Prayagraj, Dehradun, Bhopal and Noida regions. With the number of high scorers also spiking, private schools also had many students scoring top marks in the final assessment based on Class X school exams. At Amity International School Saket, of the 126 students, 28 scored 95% or more, while 43 had scores between 90% and 95%. At KR Mangalam World School, GK-II, 44% of the students had aggregate marks higher than 90%. Eva Tewary of The Srijan School, Model Town, who scored 98.4%, including 100 in mathematics and Spanish, said, “I am happy to be the school topper. Three of my exams were held offline and physically in school.” Many institutions had their toppers scoring 99% and above when the best in five subjects were taken, including 100 in different subjects. However, the private schools performed better in Class XII than in Class X, like most other schools in general. Principals attributed reasons for this. Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, “In Class XII, students opted for subjects of their own choice and they always do better in courses they like. Also, they have a whole year in Class XI to better their skills and work on their inadequacies.” To this, Dipti A Bhatnagar, principal of Manav Sthali School, Rajendra Nagar, added, “There are no research studies on this, but being an educationist, I believe that students in Delhi get serious about their stream of specialisation and careers and develop this focused approach their Class XII board exams rather than earlier because they realise a lot depends on how they do that year, especially with very high cuts-off marks for admission into university and in competitive exams.” Compared with government schools, the city’s private schools have fewer students on the rolls. In Delhi East, 81,451 Class X students were assessed and in Delhi West, 50,274.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-a-dip-last-year-private-schools-manage-to-register-99-success-rate/articleshow/85019344.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Delhi||Delhi cabinet clears hike in salary of legislators||NEW DELHI: A cabinet meeting on Tuesday, chaired by CM Arvind Kejriwal, cleared a hike in the salary of members of the Delhi Assembly from a monthly Rs 54,000 to Rs 90,000, which will include Rs 30,000 as salary and Rs 60,000 as allowances. The state government actually wanted to increase the salary to Rs 2.1 lakh per month but the Union home ministry capped it at Rs 90,000. Times ViewPoliticians, too, deserve a decent salary like the rest of us. The hike will hopefully enable them to focus better on their jobs.The proposed enhancement will still leave the Delhi legislators among the poorest paid MLAs in the country though the cost of living in Delhi is higher than in many states. The cabinet approved the Salaries and Allowances of Ministers of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and MLAs/Speaker-Dy Speaker/Chief Whip/Leader of Opposition of Legislative Assembly of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021. The proposals and draft bills will now go the lieutenant governor for approval before being placed in Delhi Assembly. “Restriction imposed by the Centre has forced Delhi’s MLAs to be among the lowest paid MLAs in India. MLAs of other states earn 1.5-2 times more than Delhi MLAs,” a government source said. “Salary of Delhi’s MLAs hasn’t increased since 2011. Delhi government had requested home ministry to bring their salary at par with MLAs of other states.” In Uttarakhand, an MLA gets a monthly Rs 2.04 lakh, in Telangana Rs 2.5 lakh, Karnataka Rs 1.65 lakh, Andhra Pradesh Rs 1.75 lakh, Goa Rs 1.99 lakh and Bihar Rs 1.35 lakh. The Bill proposes Rs 30,000 as salary for MLAs, Rs 25,000 as constituency allowance, Rs 15,000 as secretarial allowance, Rs 10,000 as telephone allowance and Rs 10,000 as conveyance allowance. Many states also provide other perks such as house rent, office rent and staff expenses. A government official said that the salary hike proposal had to traverse a long route before the increment was implemented. “Since the cabinet has approved the bills, it will be sent to the LG for consideration and approval. After the LG’s approval, it will be presented in the assembly as a financial bill. The salary hike will be implemented only after the assembly passes the financial bill and the LG signs it,” said the official. The salary (including allowances) of Delhi’s MLAs has not changed in the last 10 years. It was raised to Rs 54,000 in November 2011 and has remained unrevised since then though inflation has eaten into real incomes. “The proposal for an increase in salary and allowances of Delhi MLAs was pending with the Union home ministry for five years. After several discussions, the Centre decided to limit the salary to Rs 90,000 per month,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cabinet-clears-hike-in-salary-of-legislators/articleshow/85019411.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||Delhi: For quick money, MTech holder cons many, held||NEW DELHI: After completing his MTech from a university in St Petersburg, Russia, Tarun Gupta allegedly made an unusual choice of becoming a conman. He started duping people using aliases like Dr Ayushman and Dr Bakshi by claiming to be in collaboration with different Union ministries, police said. Recently, Gupta allegedly duped a Gurgaon-based firm by claiming to be a partner of Union ministry of electronics and technology, which was to distribute LED lights under a scheme, “Saubhagya”. DCP (South East) R P Meena said his teams had arrested Gupta along with an associate Hari Singh. Police have urged the public to verify the antecedents of the firms they collaborate with to avoid falling prey to crooks. Eight mobile phones, two laptops and a hard disk have been recovered along with fake government documents, the DCP said. A complaint was lodged at Sarita Vihar police station where the vice-president of a private firm alleged that he had received a mail from the director of a firm, Fin Services, claiming that it required LED bulbs and lights to be supplied in various districts across the country as part of the Centre’s scheme. The complainant, being a supplier of LED bulbs and lights, showed interest in the project. A person claiming to be Dr Ayushman called him and informed that a legal agreement should be drawn between suppliers and the government, and subsequently held a meeting at Sarita Vihar where an agreement containing stamp of the central government and ministry logo was signed. Later, the person demanded a demand draft of Rs 1,96,000 to proceed with the project, which was paid. Following this, the suspect went underground and the victim approached police. During investigation, the alleged company was found to have relocated to an unknown place. A communication with the ministry stated that no such person was employed and the agreement did not belong to its department. Finally, using technical surveillance and human information network, the cops raided a hideout in a residential society in Ghaziabad and arrested Gupta. During interrogation, Gupta disclosed that he initially started a placement agency, but faced huge losses. He wanted a lavish lifestyle, so to earn quick money, he started cheating people by creating fake government documents on pretext of providing government tenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-quick-money-mtech-holder-cons-many-held/articleshow/85021765.cms||---
---||Delhi||Plan to turn Delhi into a global city by 2047||NEW DELHI: The “Delhi@2047” initiative, which aims to facilitate partnerships with the private sector, CSR initiatives and philanthropic organisations to make the capital a global city by 2047, was launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday. Through this initiative, ideas would be sought from various organisations working in different fields and expertise to transform Delhi into a city where even the poorest of the poor would live with utmost respect and comfort and governance would be transformed and made solution-oriented. Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson, Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) attended the event along with representatives of some major corporate houses. Delhi@2047 initiative would be hosted by DDC, which is the policy think-tank of Delhi government. In the budget for 2021-22, Kejriwal had unveiled a bold vision for Delhi by 2047. It envisaged elevating per capita income to the level of Singapore, making the capital ready to bid for hosting the 2048 Olympic games, make Delhi sustainable in providing clean air and water to all residents and resilient in fighting disasters. Delhi would also transition to electric vehicles. “We have to develop Delhi as a global city. There are a lot of things we need to fix. We have to prepare a roadmap of how the city will be in 2047, when the country will complete 100 years of Independence. While some problems can be fixed in a year or two, some long-term solutions are needed till 2047. But if I say that we will supply water for 24 hours, this cannot wait till 2047 and must happen in the coming few years,” said Kejriwal. The CM added, “The AAP government has transformed education and the health sector and fixed the power supply chain. We have saved money in each project and made the government financially sustainable and accountable.” He reiterated that the AAP government would make Delhi’s roads on a par with European standards, fix the transport sector and run it on electricity. “We are clearing encroachments and reviving lakes. There are large-scale projects for making parks and gardens for which we are involving local communities and RWAs. We have to work on solid waste management. If an international tender is issued, hoards of companies would be ready to clean Delhi. In this day and age, even garbage sells. We need to get rid of air and water pollution. We need to clean the Yamuna. But we cannot do it alone. We need help from the citizens as well as the corporations,” Kejriwal said. The Delhi@2047 initiative is starting off with three focus projects, including “Khelo Dilli” that aims to build world-class playgrounds in government schools, “City of Lakes” where more than 1,000 waterbodies would be rejuvenated and bridging the digital divide in schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plan-to-turn-delhi-into-a-global-city-by-2047/articleshow/85019392.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||Homeless experienced hunger, loss of livelihood, study reveals||New Delhi: A study conducted by charitable trust Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN) has established that homeless people in Delhi experienced violation of their human rights during the recent resurgence of Covid-19 in the city. The study says that in the absence of adequate state support, the homeless suffer from severe food insecurity, loss of livelihood, adverse health impacts and other forms of deprivation and destitution. At the time of the HLRN survey, over 40% of those interviewed did not know about the Covid vaccines and almost 83% hadn’t been vaccinated. Around 82% lived outdoors, mostly on pavements, while 17% had found accommodation in the government shelters. HLRN contacted 72 homeless men and 43 women on phone from June 23 to July 1 for the study. Titled ‘Impact of the second wave of the pandemic on Delhi’s homeless population’, the study claims that 9% of those without houses were unable to have even a single meal each day of the the lockdown, while 58% of the respondents stated they were able to get a meal a day. Almost 98% of the homeless people surveyed did not have access to milk for their children. During the lockdown, only 13% of the homeless were able to have meals due to government assistance. Almost 91% of the respondents reported having no work or income during the Covid closure.Nearly 13% reported that their children had to drop out of school because of the lack of smartphones, data access and other challenges related to living without housing. About 28% of the respondents also reported facing police harassment during the lockdown. Reports received by HLRN indicate that pregnant women were unable to access healthcare when the city shut down. Based on the wishes expressed by the respondents, HLRN proposed that the central and Delhi governments adopt a ‘housing first’ approach when formulating schemes for the homeless. It also recommended developing housing options along a ‘continuum of housing’, or hostels, short-stay homes and subsidised rental and ownership housing with access to adequate financing.The study recommended, “Ensure that homeless persons have universal coverage under the public distribution system and their children have access to the Integrated Child Development Services schemes. Introduce an urban employment guarantee law and provide unemployment allowances to those who have lost their livelihood, including as a result of the pandemic. Ensure free universal Covid vaccination for homeless persons across the country.”HLRN also suggested a comprehensive survey of homeless people to determine their needs, establishment of community kitchens and making government welfare schemes accessible to homeless persons, irrespective of residence documentation. It added that the government should help such families by providing smartphones or tablets and free data cards to enable children to participate in online classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/homeless-experienced-hunger-loss-of-livelihood-study-reveals/articleshow/85019425.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Nagpur||CBSE dispute settlement gives hope to students||NAGPUR: CBSE school principals heaved a sigh of relief on Tuesday as the board announced a dispute settlement process for students who have issues with the result preparation. After Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Std XII results were announced a few days ago, parents vented their ire on principals and teachers about ‘low marks’ scored by their wards. Since the board exams were cancelled this summer due to Covid-19, a special marks tabulation policy was introduced that relied on internal assessments and were benchmarked to the schools’ previous performance. Though the details of how exactly the dispute resolution will work have not been made official, CBSE says a detailed notification about it will follow soon. Many schools in Vidarbha have seen their students being placed in compartment (not clearing one or two papers) or scoring lower marks than expected. A parent told TOI that his daughter, who could have easily scored 96-97% in board exams, now has to settle for 94%. “Every single percentage point matters. We are now thinking whether or not to appear for the physical exams starting from August 16,” said the parent. CBSE has announced that those who want to improve their scores can appear for the physical exams. However, with the announcement of a dispute settlement process, parents are likely to wait for a few days to see if the resolution can be done at this level. A senior principal said, “It is probably the best news I have heard in a long time. Ever since Std XII results were declared, parents have been hounding us for no fault of ours. It’s good to hear that CBSE will start a dispute settlement process, so now students can deal directly with the board.” Principals told TOI that the benchmarking of previous years’ performance is the reason for parents’ ire. “No doubt, CBSE’s intention was really good to create a reference year and then benchmark the assessments to it. It ensured fairness in marking, else some schools would have given cent per cent marks to all,” said a principal. “At the same time, it limited our scope to fairly reward potential high scorers because only a certain number of students could be fit into a particular marks range. The policy is a bit complicated to understand and that’s why parents are not able to grasp the finer points, thus leading to this chaos,” the principal added. Another principal said even after Std X results were announced, similar scenes erupted on the school’s WhatsApp group. “They have this parents group in which the teacher is also added. And she told me that the group is abuzz with talks of poor marking and allegations of unfair allocation of marks. So I hope this settlement process is announced in detail soon and we can be spared of the aggression from the parents,” said the principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-dispute-settlement-gives-hope-to-students/articleshow/85019500.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Madurai||Courts can’t redact name of acquitted: Madras HC||MADURAI: Madras high court on Tuesday observed that our criminal justice system is yet to reach such standards wherein courts can venture to pass orders for redaction of name of an accused on certain objective criteria prescribed by rules or regulations. Saying so, the court dismissed a plea moved by a man seeking to redact his name from a judgment of the court which acquitted him from a criminal case. Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed, “This court must take judicial notice of the fact that the criminal justice system that is prevalent in this country is far from satisfactory. In various cases involving heinous crimes, this court helplessly passes orders and judgments of acquittal due to slipshod investigation, dishonest witnesses and lack of an effective witness protection system.” The court came to the prima facie conclusion that an accused person is entitled to have his name redacted from judgments or orders and more particularly the ones that are available in the public domain and which are accessible through search engines. However, the judge said that on deeper review, he has taken cognizance of the fact that it is not as simple and straight as it sounded. There may be ramifications if such a generalised order is passed and directions are issued. During the course of deliberation, the court’s attention was drawn to various foreign judgments and relevant regulations and enactments of various countries which specifically provide for expunction, expungement, redaction or destruction of criminal records. “No such rule or regulation exists in India for the present. In the absence of any statutory backing this court cannot undertake the exercise of issuing directions when no judicially manageable standards exist in the first place. There must be a proper policy formulated in this regard by means of specific rules. In other words, some basic criteria or parameters must be fixed, failing which such an exercise will lead to utter confusion,” observed the judge. In this regard, he said it will be more appropriate to await the enactment of Data Protection Act and Rules which may provide an objective criterion while dealing with such pleas. The judge further observed that the right to be forgotten cannot exist in the sphere of administration of justice particularly in the context of judgments delivered by courts. The direction sought by the petitioner is to redact his name from an order passed by a coordinate bench of this court in a regular criminal appeal. “The point here is that since the high court is one indivisible institution, a writ cannot lie against a judgment or order passed by it for that would tantamount to the high court issuing writs against itself,” observed the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/courts-cant-venture-to-pass-orders-for-redacting-name-of-acquitted-hc/articleshow/85019432.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The bank corrected the slip on Tuesday by opening up the jobs for all graduates. An advertisement by the bank published in a Tamil daily said “2021 passed out candidates are not eligible”. The interview was to be held on Tuesday at the HDFC Bank branch opposite Fatima College on the Dindigul Road for sales officer roles in Madurai, Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga and Virudhunagar. A senior manager at the bank told TOI that it was a typographical error, wherein the word ‘also’ was replaced by ‘not’ in the first advertisement. “It was corrected and fresh ad was published on Tuesday that “2021 passed out candidates are also eligible for the interview,” she said. “This is a typo and we regret the error. Graduates can apply irrespective of the year of passing as long as they meet the age criteria. We have already issued the correct advertisement,” a spokesperson of the bank told TOI. Around 200 candidates attended the interview on Tuesday including those who graduated this year, he added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/bank-corrects-job-ad-which-omitted-2021-passouts/articleshow/85019461.cms||---

Students can register their complaint/problem at help desks set up for the purpose. These help desks have begun functioning in Prayagraj and at UP Board’s regional offices located in Meerut, Bareilly, Varanasi and Gorakhpur from Monday. Students can register their problems through online and offline modes. There will also be a facility to file complaints online at the UP Board headquarters in Prayagraj, informed Vinay Kumar Pandey, director (secondary education) and chairman of UP Board. UP Board, counted among largest examination conducting bodies in the world in terms of examinees, has also released a phone number and e-mail addresses of these help desks for the benefit of the students, he added. Although board officials have not yet specified the date till when the help desks will remain functional, it is expected that they will be active for a month. “Students having problems regarding incomplete results, errors in name, date of birth or requiring re-evaluation of answer sheets can register their complaints and request for corrections at these grievance cells from 10 am to 5 pm,” said the chairman of UP Board. If required, students may submit their representations at the regional offices concerned, he added. Each year, after the declaration of results by the board, all its offices observe holiday for three days to help the staff and officials recover from the stress involved in getting the results declared on time. Only after the holiday do the grievance cells start functioning. However, in 2019 and 2020, the board had ensured that its grievance cells start functioning from the next day of result declaration itself. Likewise, this year also, the grievance cells have started functioning from the very first working day after the declaration of results. “This is being done to cut the period of anxiety suffered by students over these errors,” said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/helpdesks-for-those-not-satisfied-with-board-results/articleshow/85021782.cms||---
---||Delhi||Allopathy and Ayush doctors must have the same pay: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that no government can discriminate between practitioners of allopathy and Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (Ayush) and directed the North Delhi Municipal Corporation to pay Ayush practitioners on par with allopathy doctors under the Central Health Scheme. A bench of Justices L N Rao and Hrishikesh Roy said if the central government has enhanced the retirement age of allopathic practitioners to 65 years and it has been implemented by NDMC, it cannot deny the Ayush practitioners employed under it the benefit of increase in the age of superannuation. NDMC contended that classification of Ayush doctors and doctors under CHS under different categories was reasonable and permissible in law. Rejecting the argument, the bench said, "This however does not appeal to us and we are inclined to agree with the findings of the Tribunal and the Delhi High Court that the classification is discriminatory and unreasonable since doctors under both segments are performing the same function of treating and healing their patients.” Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Roy said, “The only difference is that Ayush doctors are using indigenous systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Unani, etc and CHS doctors are using allopathy for tending to their patients. In our understanding, the mode of treatment by itself under the prevalent scheme of things, does not qualify as an intelligible differentia. Therefore, such unreasonable classification and discrimination based on it would surely be inconsistent with Article 14 of the Constitution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/allopathy-and-ayush-docs-must-have-the-same-pay-sc/articleshow/85019439.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

It later turned out that the news was related to four old cases of the deadly variant confirmed in the city months back. The medical college authorities later clarified that no new case of Delta variant has been detected in recent times in Sangam city. “The state government on the basis of World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and reports had asked health officials to conduct gene sequencing to find out discrepancy between Delta and Delta Plus variants of coronavirus during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic and KGMU (Lucknow), BHU (Varanasi) and IGIB (Delhi) were authorised for the purpose,” principal of MLN Medical College Dr SP Singh told TOI on Tuesday. He added, “After the detection of a few Delta Plus cases in Kerala and Maharashtra during the second wave, health authorities were asked to send samples of Covid positive patients to labs every fortnight. On May 16, the microbiology department of our medical college had sent 15 samples of Covid patients to KGMU, Lucknow but failed to get any report or response in absence of testing.” “These samples were later sent to Delhi on May 20 but we again failed to get any response as no testing was conducted. On July 1, these samples were again sent to BHU and its delayed report was received by our microbiology department on July 31 in which four samples were found infected with the Delta variant,” he added. “However, the patients who tested to be infected with the Delta variant in the BHU report, were already successfully treated in hospitals here and sent back to their homes during the second wave,” he clarified. A senior health official, meanwhile, said, “There has been a constant decline in the number of Covid cases in the Sangam city and the recovery rate is also improving.” He added, “Apart from rapid vaccination being conducted in the city, people must also wear masks and maintain social distancing to keep the virus away.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/viral-news-of-delta-variant-cases-found-in-city-foxes-health-officials/articleshow/85021833.cms||Kapil Dixit

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Private hospitals must pitch in as 9L to seek 2nd dose of Covid vaccine in August||MUMBAI: Almost 9 lakh people will become eligible for the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine through August, shows a BMC review. It means the city would need at least double that number of vaccine doses since first dose recipients too are queuing up in big numbers. However, considering the vaccine supply to the city — 9.8 lakh doses in July and 7.4 lakh in June — a major shortfall is expected unless the private sector vaccinates in a big way. But the question is whether people would opt for paid private vaccination, especially in the wake of scams. A rise in the number of second dose beneficiaries in August was expected since the vaccination of 18-44 year olds had started from May 1. Covishield recipients, the vast majority, started becoming eligible from July 26 onwards after completing 84 days. In July, around 10.5 lakh first doses and 6.9 lakh second doses were given. The BMC has done an analysis to understand how many people would be added to the second dose list every day. It showed that nearly 60,000 became eligible between July 29 and 31. Hence, these were the days when the city saw nearly 1 lakh vaccinations daily. Now, between August 1 and 15, any number between 10,600 and 22,000 will be added to the list daily. The numbers will start snowballing from August 17: more than 30,000 daily. In the last week of August, it will reach 80,000-85,000 every day. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, voiced the same concerns. “The maximum second dose beneficiaries will be eligible in August. If there is a shortfall in doses, we may have to cut down first doses as full vaccination is always the priority,” she said. The BMC has shared the daily eligibility list with the state in the hope of adequate doses. Gomare said they are hoping CSR efforts will help bridge the gap to some extent. At least 5.5 lakh doses are coming, mostly from Reliance Foundation, Godrej, Citibank, Jaslok and Cipla. Private hospitals that have seen a huge dent in demand in July are hoping for a better August. Dr Santosh Shetty, executive director of Kokilaben Hospital, said they have started getting enquiries from housing societies and corporates, where they had given the first dose, to come and deliver the second dose too. “The availability of Covishield has improved too, it appears,” he said. Another hospital head was not so optimistic and said there are more than 300 free vaccination centres now. “Why would people want to pay and get vaccinated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pvt-hosps-must-pitch-in-as-9l-to-seek-2nd-dose-in-aug/articleshow/85019556.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Temples remained shut and people were not allowed to perform rituals near river banks or water bodies. Many newly wed couples, for whom this was the first festival of ‘’thalai Aadi’’ were seen tying the knot in front of closed temples. It is the custom to change the saffron thread tied during the wedding to a new thread on the day of Aadi Perukku. In Madurai, people stood outside Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple to offer worship and performed rituals in the corridor opposite to the main entrance. ``They could have allowed us to go in small groups and offer worship, because it is important to pray on this day,’’ said K Sundaravalli. In the delta districts, since the entry of devotees in bathing ghats along the Cauvery was prohibited, people chose to celebrate the event in their households. “Even though Cauvery is flowing by touching both banks, it is unfortunate that the pandemic has held us in our homes. Still, we offered prayers to Cauvery by conducting rituals near the water taps discharging Cauvery water,” B Maragatham, a 63-year-old resident of Mahalakshmi Nagar in Trichy, said. In the evening, a group led by Vaigai Nathi Makkal Iyakkam, an organisation working for the conservation of the river, performed some rituals at a specific place on the Vaigai’s banks in Madurai. ``Making offerings to the river is important to evoke the blessing of the rain gods,’’ said M Rajan, coordinator of the organisation. Many small shops and business establishments were also inaugurated on Tuesday in view of the auspicious occasion. ``It is believed that anything started on this day would develop and flourish, so I am opening a small tea stall hoping it would bring good revenue,’’ said S Shankar of Iyer Bungalow. Police were stationed across the bathing ghats in Srirangam to stop people if they turned up. Monitoring was also intensified near Tamirabarini river in Tirunelveli and Suruli falls in Theni to ensure that people did not come in large numbers for bathing. ``Suruli falls sees hundreds of people on Aadi Perukku, but this year it was deserted,’’ said a policeman on duty. Trichy corporation sources said the event normally generates at least 6 tonnes to 10 tonnes of waste as people after taking holy bath abandon their clothes. “Ghats and religious sites including Amma Mandapam were free of plastic waste and abandoned clothes. Usually, it would take two days for us to clean the discards post Aadi Perukku,” an official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/temples-river-banks-out-of-bounds-aadi-perukku-turns-a-low-key-affair/articleshow/85019510.cms||---

Four girl students from Chennai have topscored with 498 out of 500 marks while Madurai schools have also performed well, according to the results declared on Tuesday. The toppers said consistent performance in unit tests, mid-term tests and pre-board exams enabled them to score better. “In our school, the top score is 489 marks and several students have scored over 480 marks. Some students had also scored centums. A majority had scored above 70% marks. Students are largely happy with their marks,” said Aruna M Visvessvar, senior principal and correspondent, Adhyapana School. Following the cancellation of Class X board examinations, CBSE prepared the Class X results based on weightage to periodic tests/unit tests (10 marks), half-yearly exams/mid-term exams (30) and pre-board exams (40) while computing theory marks. The remaining 20 marks were given to internal assessment and practicals. At Kendriya Vidyalaya, Thiruparankundram, the top score was 474 marks. The school also secured the highest performance index in social studies. “However, in our school, there were no centums as during the reference year taken, there were no centums scored. But, many students have secured 99 marks,” said A Jerald, principal of the school. At the same time, some CBSE schools were also a little disappointed with the results and felt students could have performed better if they had written the board exams. “Especially for CBSE schools wherein the first batch of Class X students is writing their board exams, this system was a bit unfair. Schools could have been consulted before this evaluation was finalized. But, we accept the decision of the board and this system, which had to be used only because of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said the principal of a private CBSE school. For students who are not satisfied with their declared board exam scores, a compartmental exam is set to be conducted soon by CBSE. “I didn't take online classes lightly and did every assignment and test seriously. I was getting good marks throughout the year. The teachers were also very encouraging," said Dhriti Karnani from Bhavan's Rajaji Vidyashram in Kilpauk, Chennai. She scored centum in maths, science, social science, Sanskrit and 98 in English. She wants to pursue MBA in IIM and joined commerce stream in Class XI. Three students from Chennai Public School at Thirumazhisai -- R Dhanvanyaa, Dhaksha Kalidoss and Jyositha N — have scored 498 marks. Jyositha N scored 100 marks in maths, social science and English and scored 99 in Tamil and English. “Due to the lockdown and remote mode of learning, I felt I had a lot of time to study. I got time to revise my concepts better and practise the questions,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-schools-do-well-in-cbse-class-x-results/articleshow/85019551.cms||---

A survivor of the tragedy made this revelation on Tuesday. The survivor, Sachin Sanas of Kondalkarwadi village, had spotted the ill-fated group from Taliye village waiting for their neighbour who had returned to his house on July 22, moments before the landslide struck. Sanas shouted out, telling them to move to a safe spot, said Kisan Deshmukh (75), a retired policeman. But the people chose to stay put for the man to return. Later, the bodies of the 30 were found buried under the rubble. Among them was a child found close to its mother. A little farther, a wad of torn notes of Rs 500 denomination was found near the body of Sampat Pol who had rushed into his house. The cash, said another villager, was what they hoped would help them tide over the looming uncertainty of the situation. The cash has been handed over to Pol’s son, said Dilip Rayannavar, a tehsildar. Others who had scurried out of the same place, about an hour earlier, survived, said Deshmukh. The next day, a team from National Disaster Response Force, or NDRF, trudged through a slushy 2km jungle path to reach the site. Kunal Deshmukh from Varandh village said that the NDRF team also retrieved the cellphone besides the shredded currency notes. Later, another phone was found on another dead person, said Sanjeev Kumar, sub-inspector of NDRF. “All of these have been handed over to the authorities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-raigad-man-ran-home-for-cash-he-29-waiting-for-him-died/articleshow/85021884.cms||Umesh K Parida

Nagsen Aman, 20, who was a student of international business studies at Tianjin University, had no contact with his family members in Gaya since July 23. As per the email received by the family, the embassy was communicated by the Tianjin local authorities that a suspect in Aman’s murder case had been arrested and placed under criminal detention. He is a non-Chinese male, Gaya district magistrate Abhishek Singh said, citing the email send by Ravi Raushan, ACO, consular section, embassy of India at Chaoyang. “The embassy is closely following up with Tianjin local authorities regarding handing over the body for its repatriation to India,” the email reads.

The Indian embassy at Beijing has requested Aman’s parents to send a letter regarding conducting of autopsy. The time taken in handing over of the body as per local Chinese authorities will depend upon whether autopsy is conducted or not as per his parents’ desire. The email further states that the embassy will be sending one of its officers to Tianjin on Tuesday to personally follow up the case with the authorities. When contacted, Aman’s uncle Ramkishor Paswan said on Tuesday, “Till 5pm, no official from Indian embassy had visited the place where the body is preserved.

Taking note of the fact that the investigation in the case is underway, justice G Ilangovan stayed the filing of the chargesheet in the case till the disposal of this petition. The judge also directed the state to file a counter affidavit and adjourned the case to August 31. The court was hearing a petition filed by Ranjith in 2019, seeking to quash the FIR registered against him by Thiruppananthal police in Thanjavur district. The case of the prosecution is that the petitioner, who participated in a meeting organised by Neelapuligal Movement on June 5, 2019, delivered a speech related to the land rights during the King Rajaraja Cholan period. In his petition, Ranjith stated that the crux of his speech was on how to erase casteism and how to create a casteless society. His speech was also about how the people in the delta region became landless. He stated that his intention was not to affect the sentiments of any particular community or religious group of people but was only to voice in favour of aggrieved people and bring awareness. Hence, he sought to quash the FIR against him. It maybe recalled that the court in 2019 had granted anticipatory bail to Ranjith in this case.

---||Allahabad||AU student turns banana leaf into his canvas||Prayagraj: Manoj Kumar, a fine art postgraduate student of Allahabad University and a young artist from Sangam city, has been making sincere efforts to carve a coveted niche for himself in the city of leaf painting. Hours-long hard work and assiduous trial and error method have made him a notable banana leaf painter already. The artist, however, claims that banana leaf painting is a far more difficult job than it looks. The reason, according to him, is the tenderness and unpredictability of the object itself as oil acrylic colours on the green and dry banana leaf often skids on a movable base, and it becomes really difficult for an artist to protect the banana leaf from any sort of harm during the process. “I was able to do better after trying and trying and trying to get better at it,” said Manoj Kumar. Given the holy month of Shravan and its significance to Sangam City, this is the first time when the artist is trying to sketch lord Shiva on a banana leaf. Talking about his craft and the intricate aspects of it, he says, “The biggest challenge I face with banana leaves is that image outlining with pencil is not possible on it. Moreover, oil acrylic colours also do not hold firmly on leaves and the colour skids on the leaf just as it would on a wet human body,” he added. Unlike working on other plains like canvas, paper and walls, painting on green banana leaves takes a much longer time,” said Manoj. He ensures the leaves do not break or tear by putting them in a unique solution before drying them. The artist says that he finds acrylic is the best material for this medium of artwork. “Oil and watercolours are unsuitable for this form of art,” he says. The artist signs off by saying that paintings and artworks should help create positive energy in people in the challenging times of Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-student-turns-banana-leaf-into-his-canvas/articleshow/85021903.cms||---

This is the first suspension of the drive in August. In July, there were cancellations on five days due to stockouts. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said the city is likely to receive 45,000 to 50,000 doses on Tuesday night. However, since centres will be collecting the doses only on Wednesday, no sessions have been planned for that day. A court order also mandates the announcement of vaccine timings and opening of slots a day in advance. Only the special drive at Aarey Colony will run as they have some leftover doses. On Tuesday, only 34,807 people got vaccinated, including nearly 14,000 in the public centres. The third day of the drive for bed-ridden people saw a big jump with 228 vaccinated. A total of 73.4 lakh doses have been administered in Mumbai till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-vax-drive-at-public-centres-today/articleshow/85019614.cms||---

Some teachers with whom TOI spoke to said that being the last board exam, Std XII plays a big role in gaining self-confidence. Purshottam Panchbhai, a senior academic said, “When students appear for an exam and score marks, that pride is there. It’s something they have earned. This is especially seen in meritorious students because they place a high value on every single percentage point. Already, some students are feeling that they got 2-3% less, so no doubt they would have wanted to appear for a physical exam.” While these students have appeared for SSC (X) exam already, academics say it can’t be compared to HSC. Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh), said, “Marks of Std X are slowly losing relevance because admissions to junior colleges are easily available. So while it’s their first experience of a state level exam, the biggest test does come in Std XII due to stream specialization. Appearing for Std XII board also gives them self-confidence because then at graduation level, they shift back to internal assessments till their final year/semester.” Earlier, Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association (VJUCTA) general secretary Ashok Gavhankar spoke to TOI and stressed the need for giving these students a feel of board exams. Gavhankar said, “I can understand the state’s decision but I feel bad for these kids because some level of stress is very important. The few months leading up to exams, then appearing for the tests and results create a certain level of anxiety which is needed for proper development of any student. As they progress through life, the stress levels need to keep climbing higher so that they can face failures bravely.” A coaching institute owner, who did not wish to be named, said students preparing for JEE/NEET will still get to experience that ‘thrill’, but others will be left behind. “A big part of coaching institutes is training students to handle stress and that’s why keep pushing them to their limits in exam performance. So even though HSC 2021 did not happen, they will get a similar experience in NEET or JEE. But students of commerce and arts streams will lose out and that’s not at all a good start for their future,” said the class owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/board-exam-experience-a-thrill-must-for-students-academics/articleshow/85019604.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The dams and reservoirs are over-flowing, the rivers are in spate, road connectivity cut off and hundreds of people are still trapped in the flood waters,” Nath tweeted. The former chief minister said there is possibility of more heavy showers in many areas across the state. “Apart from disruption of normal life, there has been a lot of loss and damage. I demand from the state government that rescue operations be carried out on a war-footing in view of the possibility of more rains,” Nath said. In another tweet, the senior Congress leader said, “Relief and rescue works should be expedited so that human casualties can be prevented. The affected should be provided ration, financial aid – all possible help should be provided to them. Congress stands with them in this hour of crisis.” Nath said that he has asked his party workers and leaders to extend a helping hand and serve the affected people. “I am in touch with the people’s representatives.

The former Tivim MLA was referring to the cut off date of April 1, 2019, for regularisation of structures. According to the bill, the person applying for regularisation of structure must have a domicile of 30 years in the state. He said that the government is trying to fool the people and added that the people will not tolerate such things. Kandolkar, who was addressing a public meeting at Chorao organised by the Kul-Mundkars Association, warned land developers against threatening the kul-mundkars of Chorao. Sources said that a land developer had started work on about 12,000sqm of land. Following this development involving tenants, the situation at Chorao had become tense from the last eight days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goans-will-not-tolerate-injustice-gfp/articleshow/85021990.cms||---
---||Goa||Mumbai City win battle for Apuia’s signature, pay NEUFC record transfer fee||Panaji: NorthEast United FC have reluctantly accepted a record transfer fee offer from Mumbai City FC for their prized midfielder Lalengmawia Ralte. The transfer saga involving Apuia, as the defensive midfielder is popularly known, has dragged for months with Mumbai and ATK Mohun Bagan among the leading candidates to secure his signature. That suspense ended on Tuesday night with NEUFC confirming that they have accepted the offer. The transfer fee is understood to be close to Rs 2 crore, almost double of what ATK Mohun Bagan paid to secure the release of Liston Colaco from Hyderabad FC this season. “NorthEast wanted Apuia to continue but the player had made up his mind to make a move. There was no point in keeping a player whose heart was set elsewhere,” said a source who has tracked this development. Apuia had a year left on his existing contract at NorthEast. The midfielder shot to prominence last season when he gave a wonderful account of himself in the Indian Super League. At age 20, he became the youngest player ever to captain an ISL side when he led NorthEast United against FC Goa. Nobody was surprised when he won the Emerging Player of the Year award at the end of the season. Apuia’s impressive performances, first under Gerard Nus and later Khalid Jamil, won him a place in the national team. With Apuia now leaving, NorthEast will feel the pinch. “We wanted to retain Apuia. He’s from northeast and we provided him the platform from where he could prosper. He did so well here. We wanted him to grow with us, play for some more years. We did our best,” said one official. For Apuia, the lure of joining Mumbai, owned by the influential City Football Group (CFG), was too much to resist. There were offers from ATK Mohun Bagan and initial interest from Bengaluru FC, but the ISL champions were always in the driving seat. The first Mizo player to feature in the U-17 World Cup for India, Apuia played a couple of seasons with Indian Arrows and moved to NorthEast in 2019 on a three-year contract. In his first season with NorthEast, he played 10 matches. Last season, though, he was a completely different player as he led NorthEast to the semifinals, ahead of more fancied teams. Apuia played all 22 matches for his team, making 93 tackles, 46 interceptions and 23 blocks. His stunning goal against Kerala Blasters confirmed the team’s place in the playoffs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mumbai-city-win-battle-for-apuias-signature-pay-neufc-record-transfer-fee/articleshow/85032735.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Compensation for damage of fishing boats and nets in coastal areas will be Rs 5,000 to Rs 25,000 while handicrafts artisans will receive Rs 50,000 as compensation. Vijay Wadettiwar, relief and rehab minister told the media that almost 80% of the panchnama work has been completed and the remaining 20% will be done in the next two or three days.

He said that a committee comprising experts from disaster management, national water development agency (NWDA) and administrative officers should be set up and the report submitted to the cabinet. Thackeray also asked the administration to conduct an in-depth study of deepening of Gandhari, Savitri and Vashishti rivers located in Mahad and Chiplun and improvement of river bed and construction of protection wall on basin and implement it within three years.

The civic body has collected fines to the tune of Rs 1.5 lakh in the last two days. Though the district collected over Rs one crore worth of fines in three months during the first wave, which went up to Rs 2 crore by October, the collection went down with relaxations in lockdown rules, and enforcement was also not strict. Fine collection was not intense since January. Since Monday, the city corporation intensified penalisation for non-compliance of masking rule, collecting fines to the tune of Rs 70,200 during the day and Rs 88,300 on Tuesday. Corporation staff collected fines from all four zones by intercepting pedestrians and motorists. A spot fine of Rs 200 is being slapped on ‘unmasked’ people in public places. Shops that do not ensure customers wear masks and also fail to ensure physical distancing have to pay Rs 500. Many motorists seen wearing helmets without masks were asked to pay fine. Share autos are seen carrying a large number of passengers without masks. A large textile showroom which was overcrowded was issued a warning by the authorities, asked to evacuate the crowds and down shutters on Tuesday afternoon. Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said they had started enforcing the mask rule strictly after Covid awareness week programmes were launched by commercial taxes minister P Moorthy. ``Though Madurai has seen new cases ranging between 10 and 12 in recent days, we have decided to step up precautions and impose fines strictly while also creating awareness, to prevent the third wave of Covid,’’ he said.

---||Mumbai||Colleges across Mumbai will first absorb own students, then others||MUMBAI: Colleges across the city will open their gates first to in-house candidates and the Covid-19 pandemic may see few students wanting to migrate to other degree colleges. While streams such as science will witness students branching out to engineering and health sciences, arts and commerce cut-offs could soar and only a handful of seats may open up for outsiders. Admissions thus may be tougher for candidates who completed Class XII from a high school or a junior college that does not have an attached degree college. The top autonomous colleges will not conduct their entrance test this year. These institutes, most of them among the highest rated and most popular city colleges, will probably continue with the same batch of candidates in their popular divisions. For unaided programmes, seats will open for all candidates and admissions will be conducted on the basis of their Class XII scores. “Looking forward, we will, in the first week, admit all our in-house students first. If students migrate to other institutes, we will open admission for outsiders,” said Rajendra Shinde, principal of St Xavier’s College which has 360 seats each for arts and science in HSC, as also an equal number in first-year degree college. Last year, the cut-off for arts was 98.5% and this time around, professor Shinde expects it to cross 99.5%. For the commerce stream, the past three years have seen a bit of easing. As Podar College principal Sobhana Vasudevan said, “Earlier, all our students used to stay back for degree college. But now, we see about 10-15 of them take the SAT and fly out abroad, some join the five-year law programme, and a few of them join the integrated management programme. Essentially, while many who want to pursue CA and CS stay back, there are other diversified areas in which commerce students are now going.” Mumbai University’s affiliated colleges will follow the admission schedule released (see box). “Classes will currently begin online and we will follow the state government’s instructions regarding opening up,” said the spokesperson. In case of colleges such as HR and KC which have become a state cluster university, HR College principal Pooja Ramchandani said, “Students will first opt for the BCom programme and then as they get admission and a few seats may open for outsiders.” While the HSC section has 1,034 students, the aided section has 960 seats in first-year BCom. “But students also apply for other popular courses that we offer like banking and finance, bachelors in financial markets and three BVoc courses in tourism, retail and wealth management.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-colleges-will-first-absorb-own-students-then-others/articleshow/85017139.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Man ends life after cops beat him up||NAGPUR: The alleged suicide of 38-year-old Mahesh Raut by consuming poison at New Somwaripeth at Raghuji Nagar in the early hours of Tuesday has brought a fresh wave of controversies for the city police who are yet to emerge from the shadow of the Pardi custodial death case last month. Raut’s family claimed he ended his life after being manhandled by cops for dialing 100. The police department has refuted the charges. The matter has been now transferred to the crime branch for a thorough inquiry and two cops involved in the episode have been shunted out to the headquarters from Hudkeshwar police station as of now, said CP Amitesh Kumar. Raut, father of two children, is learnt to have called up the control room on Monday evening to inform them about a neighbour, Chanda Barve, thrashing a mentally challenged family member at home in the neighbourhood. After calling the control room, police said Raut had identified himself as ‘Rajesh Shendekar’. The control room then directed Hudkeshwar police station’s bike-borne ‘commando’ cops to attend the call. Raut, an accountant with an automobile showroom, was not taking calls from the patrolling cops who had reached the locality and wanted to know the exact location of the dispute. Naik police constables Kishor Shiral and Pravin Alam was left flabbergasteds. The cops had later gone to Barve’s place and showed them the number from which some ‘Rahul Shendekar’ had informed them about the ruckus going on at her house. Barve’s son immediately went to Raut’s place to confront him. There was a verbal duel between the two families and cops had to intervene to separate them. After constables Shiral and Alam returned to the police station after settling the matter and making an entry in the station house diary, Raut’s family alleged that he was thrashed and dragged as well, leaving him humiliated. “A case of accidental death was registered at Hudkeshwar police station. Going by the initial inquiry, we don’t believe there was any misconduct or high-handedness by the police constables,” the CP said. Raut’s younger brother Shailesh blamed the police. “My brother was repeatedly slapped and humiliated by the two cops for calling ‘100’ and informing them about a neighbour torturing a mentally challenged family member,” said Shailesh. Police sources said that Raut had a tiff with his wife Pranali too following which she left the house. It was shortly after her leaving the house that Raut consumed poison. He was rushed to government medical college and hospital (GMCH) where doctors declared him brought dead. Though the post-mortem was conducted, experts could not find any injury marks on his body. The police said that Raut had made a similar call to the control room complaining about the Barve family in July and probably in May too. Angry neighbours and friends of Raut had thronged the Hudkeshwar police station to protest against the humiliation meted out to the victim which allegedly promoted him to end life. Heavy bandobast had to be deployed at the police station, GMCH mortuary and also at the Manewada cremation ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-ends-life-after-cops-beat-him-up/articleshow/85018247.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Delhi||Murder, rioting charges on seven in northeast Delhi riots case||NEW DELHI: A city court has framed charges of murder and rioting against seven people in a case related to the death of a man during the northeast Delhi riots, saying prima facie there was enough material to proceed against them. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav framed charges of murder, rioting, rioting with deadly weapon, unlawful assembly and criminal conspiracy against Aman Kashyap, Arun Kumar, Ashish, Devender Kumar, Pradeep Rai, Krishan Kant Dhiman and Rahul Bhardwaj. The case pertained to the alleged murder of one Monish, who had died after being allegedly attacked by a riotous mob in Dayalpur area while he was coming back after meeting his father and was carrying sweets. “I am of the considered opinion that prima facie, there is enough material on record to frame charges against all the accused persons under requisite sections,” the judge said in his order. The court, however, added that prosecution could not establish the material with regard to offences of disobedience to public servant's order, mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees, mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc of IPC and relevant provisions of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. The court said that though the accused persons were not seen/visible in any CCTV footage/video-clip, at this stage, it had the ocular evidence of a prosecution witness (PW). “I find substance in the submissions of Special PP that PW is not a ‘statue’ who was merely lying stationary at one place and instead his bonafide cannot be doubted at this stage because he had duly made call to the PCR, which is contemporaneous to the time of commission of incident in the matter,” it said. All the accused had claimed they were falsely implicated in the matter. With respect to the contention of the accused’s counsel that they were not seen/visible in any CCTV footage, the court said it found substance in the submissions of public prosecutor that rioters had broken down virtually every CCTV in the vicinity and had damaged the DVRs thereof as such, it was quite possible that on this account no CCTV footage was available in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/murder-rioting-charges-on-seven-in-northeast-riots-case/articleshow/85021992.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Traders relieved as extended shop hours draw higher footfall||Mumbai: Retailers and shopkeepers heaved a sigh of relief as the state permitted them to stay open for business till 10pm, a concession that was rolled back in March following the resurgence in Covid cases. Sales volumes rose perceptibly on the first day that shop timings were relaxed.A trader in Andheri said the longer hours also freed them from the pressure of bribes and police harassment.Housewives and office-goers were also pleased at being able to make purchases at their convenience, in the evening hours or after work. The earlier, tighter deadlines had caused them to compromise their schedules and, in fact, increased crowds in markets. Now buyers are likely to be dispersed over longer periods.Shopping activity picked up at Malad, with several stopping by to indulge in street food. The Bata Shoes showroom in Khar witnessed a rise of 20% in sales Tuesday. For the first time in months, Bharatkshetra sari shop and Dadar Emporium in Dadar Market welcomed customers after dusk. This market would close by 8.30pm in the pre-Covid era.In Irla, Mayur Shah, owner of Ella Garments, said, "I run a ladies' fashion store. Women have time to head out shopping only late afternoon once they complete their household chores. The authorities have done the right thing by extending timings. Employees have suffered salary cuts. Hopefully we will recover now."Shah said even if the dreaded third wave of Covid sets in, the state should explore other options rather than closing non-essential shops entirely. "We could perhaps operate till 7pm or shut on weekends. But closing very early will jeopardise us again," he said.Kishore Kulkarni, chairman of Chembur Merchants Association, reported a marginal increase in footfalls Tuesday. "Shopkeepers are ensuring that Covid appropriate behaviour is followed and each customer is wearing a mask and sanitising their hands. We wish that business continues uninterrupted now."Mahendra Chhadva of Ritz Optician in Mulund said they were elated with the 10pm deadline but were not sure whether the order was applicable from Tuesday or Wednesday. "Some shopkeepers have paid fines up to Rs 12,000 so they are worried," he said. Hardik Gori, a grocer, said some traders shut shop at 4pm fearing that police may impose a fine.Matunga corporator Nehal Shah said the decision to extend business hours was long overdue as traders were hard pressed to even manage shop rent on their meagre incomes.Meanwhile, BMC commissioner I S Chahal Tuesday clarified that night curfew will continue from 11pm to 5am. There is no restriction on public movement the rest of the day but gatherings are prohibited. BMC said shops may function till 10pm throughout the week but malls will remain shut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-traders-relieved-as-extended-shop-hours-draw-higher-footfall/articleshow/85019677.cms||---

Commissioner of police, Trichy city, A Arun has roped in traffic and other police personnel to monitor the public for non-compliance of masks, social distancing. Police have identified 27 locations including Chathiram bus stand, Anna statue, West Boulevard Road and NSB Road based on the movement of a large number of people after the lockdown relaxations. As part of their drive, the personnel would stop motorists and pedestrians who are not wearing masks and not following social distancing, and give them lessons on the necessity to wear masks and complying with social distancing norms.

---||Nagpur||Record 21 lakh students pass CBSE Std X exam||NAGPUR: For the first time in CBSE’s history, a record 21 lakh students cleared the Std X exam in one go, thanks to highest ever enrolment and passing percentage this year. Keeping with the trend in other boards, CBSE Std X results too witnessed a 99.04% passing rate and a sharp increase in number of high scorers. In Maharashtra, the passing rate was 99.92%. Due to the deadly second wave, CBSE on April 14 had announced that board exams will be cancelled and marks will be tabulated based on internal assessments done by schools. A policy for the same was determined by CBSE and it was announced that any student unhappy over the allotted marks can appear for a physical exam later. This exam will begin from August 16, though subject-wise datesheet (timetable) is yet to be declared. This year, CBSE will be issuing a combined marksheet and passing certificate to all successful students. In a normal year, students would have got those two documents separately. The biggest beneficiaries of this year’s marks tabulation policy were government-aided category schools, whose passing rate touched 95.88% as compared to 77.82% last year. Kendriya Vidyalayas witnessed a 100% passing rate, but it was on expected lines because their last year’s rate too was 99.23%. Private independent schools, the biggest category in CBSE’s ecosystem, witnessed a 99.57% passing rate as compared to last year’s 92.81%. A school principal said CBSE’s internal marks policy itself meant that maximum number of students will pass. “It’s true that the policy was a fair one but whenever it comes to internal assessments, it’s guaranteed that the child will pass. And not just CBSE, every board has thrown up similar results,” said the principal. However, the entire process was quite challenging, another principal said. “My staff and I had literally made the school campus our home. Till late night, we were involved in the process of tabulating marks and benchmarking it to the reference year so that the average median is not breached. Frankly, we would prefer checking of pen-paper board exam answersheets any day over this,” said the principal. All records will be available on DigiLocker, an academic repository initiative of the central government, regarding which details have been sent to students via SMS on the registered mobile number. Also for the first time, foreign students can get their digital marksheets on email through DigiLocker. Around 16,000 results are still being processed by CBSE, though the exact reason for the delay is not known. Similarly for Std XII, 65,000 results were still being processed when results were announced. At that time, CBSE officials said the reason was ‘lack of a reference year’ to tabulate results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/record-21-lakh-students-pass-cbse-std-x-exam/articleshow/85019681.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

All the 412 people aged above 18 years in the village located in Kannakattai panchayat have been administered with at least one dose of Covishield vaccine, district collector K Senthil Raj told TOI. Raj said that it was possible thanks to the joint efforts of the deputy director of health services, block medical officer, the elected panchayat representatives, village health nurse and anganwadi workers. The respective panchayat presidents and ward members were motivated to take the first jab in the village and this in turn motivated the villagers. The district has 1,405 villages in 403 panchayats that come under 12 blocks, 19 town panchayats, two municipalities and one corporation (Tuticorin). “We are trying to achieve 100% coverage in one village in each block in the rural areas and in each ward in the urban local bodies by Friday,” the collector said. It is aimed at making them model villages for the respective blocks and local bodies to motivate other villages to reach the mark to stay protected from the pandemic. “We have selected those villages and wards that have maximum percentage of vaccinations so far and are focused with more intensity to achieve 100%,” he added. Once block level model villages are vaccinated, efforts will be taken to make model panchayats with 100% vaccination in all the villages under the panchayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/all-eligible-get-1st-dose-jab-in-tuticorin-village/articleshow/85019688.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Shops comply with new rules, close at 5pm||Coimbatore: Most of the shopkeepers downed their shutters at 5pm, extending full cooperation to the district administration’s new Covid-19 prevention measures, which came into force on Tuesday. Police personnel ensured that the shops - be it bakeries or grocery, vegetable or tea shops - were not open after the permissible time limit. However, a few shops in residential areas were open till 5.30pm to 6pm. Meat shops and fish stalls were closed by 2pm as mandated by the district administration. Bus terminals were crowded much earlier on the day, compared to previous days, as people left home earlier because of the new guidelines. Some people, who reached tourist places in the district, were unaware of the new curbs. They left with a long face. Residents welcomed the stringent measures, which they hope would help authorities control the Covid-19 cases and avoid total lockdown. G Pazhani, a resident of Ganapathy Pudur, said he had stocked essentials and other items in view of the new restrictions. “It is better to live with stringent curbs than to face complete lockdown, which would cripple trade activities and livelihood of scores of people. Officials should ensure that the rules are followed to avert another wave.” However, the new rules did not go down well with a section of traders. In a petition to corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara, Dinesh Kumar Bhandia, a trader, said small traders didn’t have the financial backing to meet employees’ salary and building rent. At a time when online ventures had taken over the sales, he said, they were finding it difficult to survive. The city corporation commissioner, meanwhile, warned traders of strict action if they fail to comply with the restrictions at a meeting that saw participation of members from trade bodies, hoteliers, lodge owners, vegetable vendors, textile and jewellery store owners. He said it was the responsibility of the traders to ensure that their customers were wearing face masks. “Shopkeepers should compulsorily wear face masks. Hand sanitisers should be kept in front of every shops and it should be ensured that customers are using the same.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/shops-comply-with-new-rules-close-at-5pm/articleshow/85019690.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The startup has converted a microvan into a camera car that can be used in roadshows to promote the camera museum. The startup, Frigate engineering services, said an order was placed with them to manufacture a replica of a century-old rare twin-lens bellows wooden camera from the vintage camera’s museum in Kampong Glam, Singapore. While there were trailers and even houses replicating cameras, the startup claimed that the camera car was the first of its kind. Although the car does not have any camera in it to click pictures, it can be driven around like a normal vehicle. The windshield was fabricated to match the twin camera lens. “Except for the chassis, brakes and engine, other components of the microvan were removed. The superstructure was replaced with an exact replica (1:20 scale) of a vintage camera in which around 30 workers were involved,” said V Tamizhiniyan, founder and CEO of Frigate. The project was completed at a cost of Rs 4.65 lakh in eight months. “The entire camera car was designed and fabricated in Trichy using local workforce. Foldable rexin material was used to replicate the bellows of the vintage camera. “In a few weeks, we will ship the camera car in a container through Chennai port,” Tamiliniyan added. “Expert artisans in welding and fabrication helped get the work done in Trichy as per our demands,” said Solaiyappan Ramanathan, co-founder of the museum. Ramanathan and A P Shreethar have a collection of over 1,000 rare and vintage cameras and replicas in their museum in Singapore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/camera-car-made-in-trichy-on-its-way-to-singapore-museum/articleshow/85019705.cms||Deepak Karthik

BMC said that as per its revised order indoor and outdoor sports activity will be allowed, and gardens were not necessarily for sports activity. “The garden timings will be regulated by an earlier order stating they will be open from 5am-9am,” said a senior BMC official. Juhu corporator Renu Hansraj said there was no clarity about garden timings on Tuesday. “We initially thought they were being allowed to open, and then officials said that the timings were still restricted to morning. While in the case of beaches (like Juhu) we understand there could be crowds accumulating, but public gardens have many locals visiting them for walks, jogging and daily exercise. It has been too long now that people have been restricted to their homes,” said Hansraj. In Bandra, corporator Asif Zakaria said there was a lot of confusion. “People who had gathered outside Joggers’ Park on Tuesday evening were sent back,” said Zakaria. Nayana Kathpalia, trustee, OVAL Trust, said while she believes public gardens should be kept open , the question also is how to regulate large crowds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-clarifies-that-gardens-to-be-open-only-in-the-morning/articleshow/85019722.cms||---

All of them have been booked for murder, rioting and other IPC sections. The murder took place on February 25, 2020. The deceased was identified as Monis, a resident of Samaypur Badli. Police said he was killed after a mob attacked him in Brijpuri when he was going to his uncle’s house in riot-hit Mustafabad from his house. The seven men who led the mob were identified as Aman Kashyap, Arun alias Munna, Pardeep Rai, Ashish alias Goli, Devender, Krishankant and Rahul Bhardwaj. The chargesheet has also been submitted. On July 30, the court framed charges against the accused and booked them for murder, rioting, unlawful assembly, etc. A senior police officer said Monis’s death came to light after GTB Hospital informed them about a man being brought dead there with a bullet injury. “During investigation, the last mobile location of Monis was found to be in the vicinity of Bhagirath Vihar in Brijpuri. The last caller was his cousin Ibrahim. He told police that during their conversation, Monis said he had reached Yamuna Vihar bus stand and was coming via Brijpuri road. The facts suggested that while going to Mustafabad through Brijpuri, Monis must have been caught by the mob and assaulted. Many people residing in the vicinity of the main Brijpuri road were examined to reconstruct the chain of events, ascertain the exact place of occurrence and find eyewitnesses,” the officer said. An eyewitness told police that he saw a youth wearing a red T-shirt being beaten up by the mob. Due to the severe beatings, he fainted near the police barricades at Brijpuri T-point and was rescued by the cops. “The witness identified the place of occurrence and confirmed the identity of the deceased by seeing photographs. He informed that Brijpuri residents, namely Ashish Goli, Arun Munna, Aman Kashyap, Pardeep Rai and Devender Yadav were leading the mob. The records of Dayalpur police station were then checked and the staffers deployed at Brijpuri T-point on that day were examined. All of them identified the person as Monis,” said the officer. “On the basis of the investigation and evidence collected, a chargesheet was filed in this case, based on which the court framed the charges of murder and rioting against the accused,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cousins-testimony-indicates-victim-killed-by-mob-in-brijpuri-say-police/articleshow/85022117.cms||---

The state government on Monday eased the Covid-19 restrictions for the bulk of the state, but not for Pune and 10 other districts which have a relatively higher positivity rate. The traders were unanimous that essential shops, such as grocery and vegetable stores, might be able to stay afloat within the declared 7am-4pm, but the non-essential shops tend to bring in customers from noon to evenings with the 7pm-11pm being the peak hours for restaurants and eateries. They felt that the same deadline for all shops was detrimental for business and led to crowding on roads. Federation of Traders Association Pune (FTAP) president Fatehchand Ranka said, “The current timings are continuing for four months and are not working out for the traders and customers. Except for essential stores such as groceries, dairies or vegetable markets, nobody goes to shop before 10 am. To bring in some business, non-essential shops need to stay open from 11am to 7pm.” He added, “Customers are crowding the wholesale markets such as Market Yard without much social distancing. But the shopkeepers are maintaining the safety protocols right from the beginning of the pandemic.” Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Hoteliers and Restaurants Association, said, “Over 800 establishments in Pune city and Pimpri Chinchwad might permanently shut down due to the prolonged restrictions. The 4pm deadline does not work for us, neither does the extension till 7pm. We need to stay open during the 11am-3pm period and again from 7pm to 10.30-11pm, the peak business hours.” Nitin Kakde, president of the Pune Stainless Steel Merchant Association that has 700 members, said, “The current deadline allows the shops to stay open for 9 hours. We want to keep our shops open for the same duration, only during a different slot — 11 am to 7 pm. There is no point keeping the shops open when no customers visit.” Manoj Sarda, president of the Pune Wholesale Hosiery Readymade Garment Association that has 225 shopkeeper-members and distributors in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, said, “The market is dull due to the restrictions. We can expect some footfall only during the four-five days in the run-up to Diwali.” Rahul Hajare, president of the Computer and Media Dealer Association Pune with around 400 member-merchants, said, “Working professionals can go out only in the evenings, after 5-6pm, to make purchases. Keeping our shops open till 7pm on weekdays and more importantly on weekends will give the customers a chance to make the purchases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traders-seek-tweak-in-timings-to-stay-afloat/articleshow/85019718.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

With Covid-19 pandemic leading to rapid shift to online learning for students, government school teachers are to be equipped for online teaching. In a statement, district chief educational officer (CEO) R Swaminathan, said the training will be provided in a phased manner starting this week. The CEO had also urged all government school teachers to make use of the training programme and impart the skills learnt to students as well. “We have 184 high-tech labs established in various government schools in Madurai district. The aim is to equip teachers so that they’ll be able to make use of the lab and technology to teach students. There is a need for ICT to be deployed in teaching as students are learning through WhatsApp and ‘Kalvi Tholaikatchi’,” said N Thirugnanam, additional district programme officer, SSA, Madurai. The official also said that by learning the basics of use of computers, educational management information system (EMIS) and other technology, teachers will be set to undergo only virtual in-service training. From primary to higher secondary levels, all government school teachers will be taking part in the programme in phases.

But Prerna Baid is made of tougher stuff than most. Not only did she return to the classroom, she also walked out of the country’s top B-school with flying colours. Prerna recently graduated from the Indian Institute of Management -Visakhapatnam (IIM-V), where she enrolled in an executive management programme, with two gold medals - one for securing the first rank in the postgraduate certificate programme in business management for experienced professionals, and another one for her scholastic performance in the executive MBA programme. Now, she is even dreaming of having her own start-up one day. The convocation was held virtually last week. Speaking to TOI, the 44-year-old, who is one of the directors of ACN Infotech founded by her husband, says that nothing is impossible if one has all his/her thoughts into it. “Women at my age generally think that their prime of life is over,” she said. “But it might be the age to restart and relearn,” Prerna said. “It was my husband, who persuaded and convinced me to resume my education. I am academically inclined since childhood, but due to personal reasons, I could not give my JEE (Joint Entrance Exam) and I subsequently enrolled in a BBA course,” she added. “As soon as I finished my under-graduation in 1997, I got married and shifted to Visakhapatnam,” she added. “I contributed my first two to three years in helping my husband in setting up an IT company, before children entered our life. I thought I should be there for them rather than resuming my own education. My elder son, who went to the US for his under-graduate studies in 2018, came to know about the IIM-V executive management programmes around the same time. Then my family encouraged to join the course.” Prerna believes that the management programme at IIM-V has broadened her horizon and professional credentials. “The collaborative support offered by the faculty is outstanding. I have really enjoyed my two years, even though I had to work a bit more compared to my engineering peers in the programme. I want to earn some experience by working in another company. And If I get any innovative idea, I would work on venturing into start-up space,” said Prerna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/grit-inspiration-prerna-44-mom-of-2-bags-2-golds-at-iim-v/articleshow/85023486.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hotels cry ‘discrimination’ over 4pm deadline rule||Mumbai: The hospitality industry has expressed grave disappointment over alleged discrimination by the authorities in not allowing hotels to operate beyond 4pm even as all other outlets can now function till 10pm. They contend that in settings as diverse as roadside eateries and aircraft cabins, people are now being allowed to remove masks for longer periods while eating. They say there is no evidence of restaurants causing more Covid spread than other businesses. They also see a larger conspiracy to promote food delivery aggregators. In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Ahar president Shivanand Shetty said while all other businesses were functioning near normal, only restaurateurs were instructed to operate till 4pm including on weekends, which was as good as a lockdown norm. "Majority business takes place during evening time," he added. These curbs combined with cost overheads with respect to rent, salaries and other inputs have singed the industry. "Roadside vendors are working till midnight with no social distancing or Covid appropriate behaviour despite the fact that they are not allowed by Supreme Court to cook food in the open. Meanwhile, legal establishments like ours are forced to pay all taxes and license fees and then be deprived of livelihood," he said. "The number of shops in the city of Mumbai would be at least 10 times more than the number of restaurants. We fail to understand how curtailing the timings of a restaurant while not curtailing any other business activities can be justified for the purposes of prevention or mitigation of the pandemic. In fact the public interface at other outlets is far more than in restaurants. Also, there is no scientific data to point out that restaurant business jeopardises public health and is thus required to be restricted continuously," said HRAWI senior vice president Pradeep Shetty in letters sent to the municipal commissioner as well as chief secretary. "In air travel, the average transit time is 1.5 hours. People remove their masks to enjoy their meal amid full seating capacity. The arrangements in restaurants are far better as compared to air travel as restaurants can enforce 50% seating capacity and we have better ventilation as compared to aircraft. Such discrimination needs redressal," said Shivanand Shetty. "Public transport within cities and intercity is also functioning with usual crowding. Such disparities between businesses need logical answers," he said. Shetty said other states were allowing restaurants to operate with SOPs even though they had more Covid cases as compared to Maharashtra. He asked if this move was part of a conspiracy to promote food delivery aggregators. He said they had received no relief from the state government towards payment of property tax and fees either.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hotels-cry-discrimination-over-4pm-deadline-rule/articleshow/85019884.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Pune||Pune: Traders firm on defying orders, to close shops at 7pm||PUNE: The Federation of Traders’ Association Pune (FTAP) organised a protest on Tuesday, demanding extension of business hours. They said that various restrictions imposed by the authorities have forced them to incur heavy losses. Traders gathered at different locations, including Laxmi Road, Kumthekar Road, Ferguson Road, Ganesh Peth, Bohri Ali, Shivaji Road, Timber Market, Karve Road, Sinhagad Road, among other areas, rang bells in a symbolic gesture to wake up the government to the plight of businessowners inconvenienced by ‘illogical’ and ‘inconvenient’ shop timings. The shop owners said they would keep their shutters open from 11am to 7pm from Wednesday despite having received no permission from the civic authorities. “The demonstration was carried out at 27 locations across the city. Our intention was not to gather crowds, but to peacefully and safely draw attention to our concerns and demands. In Mumbai, orders were given for extension of timings of non-essential shops and restaurants on Monday. Why no such steps have been taken for Pune? Though we have still not received any intimation from the civic authorities about relaxations of timings, we will go ahead with our plan to keep our shutters open from 11am to 7pm from Wednesday,” said Mahendra Pitalia, secretary, FTAP. The largest gathering was held at Good Luck Chowk, FC Road, with over 50 members of United Hospitality Association holding placards to save the sector from financial collapse. “The restaurant industry requires a dual slot system. We should be allowed to operate from noon to 3pm and from 6pm to 11.30pm. If the authorities cannot allow it, we request the government to relieve us from the financial burden of accumulating expenses, such as excise fees, electricity bills, water and property taxes,” said Sandeep Narang, the association president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traders-firm-on-defying-orders-to-close-shops-at-7pm/articleshow/85019757.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

---||Coimbatore||RTE seats: Deadline extended to Aug 13||Coimbatore: A total of 2,470 applications were received online till Tuesday in the district seeking seats under the right to education (RTE) Act in the entry level in private schools. As many as 4,710 seats are available under the Act in the district. The directorate of matriculation schools has extended the last date for applying till August 13. Every year, 25% of seats in the entry level in private schools are reserved for admission under the RTE Act. The state government and the Centre bear the tuition fee of the students joined in schools under this Act. “But most of the parents are forced to pay the fee by the schools assuring to return the money once the government reimburse them. This has been the case as the government delays the reimbursement for schools,” MDMK state youth wing secretary V Eswaran said, who has been vocal about bringing in reforms in the way RTE seats are filled in the state. Many of the interested parents say that they could not submit their applications because of the rigid distance norm. Applicants staying within 1km radius from the school are only considered for admission. “This was unlike in New Delhi and a few other states where the distance norms are relaxed by 2-3 km in case of vacant RTE seats. Same is not the case in Tamil Nadu,” S Shanmugam, 35, a parent from Sanganur, said. Eswaran also stressed on giving advantage to the children from economically and socially backward communities. Parents belonging to SC/ST or OBC need not attach their income certificates with the application, a copy of the community certificate will be sufficient. However, those belonging to other castes must submit the online application with income not exceeding Rs 2 lakh. This has been creating competition for those who cannot afford a seat in private schools, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rte-seats-deadline-extended-to-aug-13/articleshow/85019752.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Over 1.67 lakh students from both the divisions, having jurisdiction over Marathwada, have secured more than 75% — which is a record in itself. Chairperson of Aurangabad division of MSBSHSE Sugatha Punne on Tuesday said the modified assessment pattern introduced for HSC examination this year due to the ongoing pandemic has led to heavy scoring for many candidates. “As per ad-hoc evaluation pattern adopted this year for HSC exams, 40% weightage was given to internal evaluation by junior colleges and 30% each for Class XI marks and average of the best three performing subjects in the SSC exam. Many students have obtained good score on all these three fronts and this has resulted in higher success rate as well as good scores,” she said. Besides, 54,428 HSC candidates have scored 60% and above marks from Marathwda where passing percentage of girls is slightly better than the boys in keeping with the state-level trend. Principal of SB College of Arts and Commerce Makrand Paithankar said board examinations for 2021 would be remembered for long considering the peculiar situation in which it was held.  “The pandemic situation left us with no other alternative than modifying the evaluation pattern. Students, parents and teachers were under tremendous stress throughout the year due to uncertainty over routine academic activities. Students and parents should make informed choices while choosing future career options,” he said. From Aurangabad division, a total of 1.47 lakh students had appeared for the HSC examination, out of which 1.46 lakh have been declared pass based on the modified evaluation pattern. A total of 77,916 candidates took the test from Latur division, of which 77,646 have managed to clear the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/over-1-6l-in-aurangabad-latur-divisions-secure-75/articleshow/85019731.cms||---

Chandel, which is situated in the eastern most part of the country and shares more than 100 kms of open, porous international border with Myanmar, recorded a sharp improvement from its 30th position in the February rankings to the top rank. All the five districts which have recorded the most improved performance in June have made remarkable progress from their February rankings with Firozpur jumping to third position from 107 previously and Dhubri moving to the fourth position from 103. Kiphire in Nagaland bagged the fifth spot, improving upon its February ranking of 35. Sahibganj has been showing consistent improvement for the past few months. The June rankings have been released after a gap as data collection was stalled due to the second Covid wave. The second wave affected each district differently.  In Chandel district, authorities hired local transporters to reactivate the anganwadi centre located in the remote areas along the IndoMyanmar border to help children and pregnant women meet their nutrition requirements. The local transporters are ready to face and overcome issues linked to insurgency and poor roads, seen as major obstacles by centrally hired transporters. Chandel was successful in providing support to tribals under the Van Dhan Yojana. Trifed, a national level cooperative body has augmented the ability of the tribal population to seek better prices for their minor forest produce. The aspirational districts programme was launched by the Centre in 2018 to usher in development in 112 of the country’s most backward districts . Government think tank Niti Aayog anchors the programme in collaboration with the central and state governments. The focus is on five critical sectors — healthcare, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development and basic infrastructure. The scheme has won praise from the United Nations Development Programme which has lauded it for being successful in propelling development in the backward districts of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/manipurs-chandel-top-performer-among-aspirational-districts-in-june/articleshow/85025297.cms||Surojit Gupta
---||Dehradun||Matri Sadan alleges foul play after court rejects bail plea of Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya's principal||Haridwar: Seers of the Haridwar-based Matri Sadan Ashram have alleged foul play after the district court rejected the bail plea of Niranjan Mishra, the principal of Bhagawan Das Adarsh Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya. Mishra was arrested in a case of alleged forgery on July 22. The case against Mishra was lodged after Mahavidyalaya's parent body Prachin Avdhoot Mandal Ashram officials alleged that Mishra flouted norms while securing the renewal of the Mahavidyalaya's registration in 2016. Notably, the chargesheet doesn’t mention Mishra’s name. In a letter written to the district judge on July 29, Brahmachari Dayanand, a Matri Sadan Ashram seer, has said that "the respondents influenced the decision of this court." He also requested the district judge to secure the footage of the CCTV near the chamber of Bharat Bhushan Pandey, acting sessions judge, for July 29, the day when the court heard the case. A similar letter was sent to DGP Uttarakhand on July 31. Matri Sadan has alleged that the investigating officer in Mishra's case was justifying his arrest on what he said was the Hindi version of a clause in the 2012 Manual for Adarsh Sanskrit Mahavidyalayas/Adarsh Shodh Sansthans, issued by the Central government in English in 2012. The Ashram claimed that there was no such clause in the 2012 manual. In fact, the clause being quoted by the police officer was from the Manual of Institutions under Uttarakhand Sanskrit University, Haridwar, a state university. The officials are yet to respond to the letter. As per the rule quoted by the investigating officer, the Parent Body of the mahavidyalaya, which is Prachin Avadhoot Mandal Ashram Trust, has the right to take decisions regarding renewal of registration of the institution. Matri Sadan argued that nowhere does the 2012 Manual mention that the secretary of the parent body or any other of its members has the authority to apply for renewal of the institution's registration. As the college got its registration renewed in 2016, the parent body resented it, calling it forgery. An FIR was lodged in the case against six people. Mishra was not among the accused. He had put his signatures on the renewal application documents as the senior most teacher in the college. "It is intriguing why he was framed by the police and arrested in the case," officiating principal Brajesh Kumar Devsingh told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/matri-sadan-alleges-foul-play-after-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-sanskrit-mahavidyalayas-principal/articleshow/85014737.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

The Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) Covid-19 survey — conducted to determine awareness levels and people's perception of the pandemic — was carried out by the Covid-19 Information Education Communication (IEC) Committee, formed by the Pune divisional commissioner. The five surveyed districts are part of Pune division. "One major finding of the survey is that 59% people feel the pandemic is over, which is alarming," said Mallinath Kalshetti, head of the IEC committee. "Such a perception could cause them to stop following Covid-appropriate behaviour. As part of IEC campaigns, we have devised suitable messages to be disseminated among residents of these districts - on usage of masks, importance of physical distancing, hand-washing and vaccination," he said. Another finding is that people are still relying on information generated during the first Covid wave, with newer insights not percolating fully. Nearly 3,390 out of 3,450 who were able to answer queries in this category (98%) knew Covid spreads via droplets, but 839 out of 2,613 respondents (32%) did not know the droplets can be airborne and can travel some distance. "So we need to have sufficient ventilation and open-air settings while battling the spread," Praveenkumar Pawar, a risk-governance specialist from UNICEF, who was part of the survey, told TOI. The IEC committee study was supported by UNICEF. A small percentage of respondents - 1% to 2% - also thought Covid could spread via mosquito bites, unclean water, contaminated food, sweat or blood transfusion. Many (43% or 772 out of 1,790 who answered) also said they have come across instances of discrimination against those infected with Covid-19. The surveyors also looked for vaccine hesitancy, which they found in 12.3% of the respondents. At least 3.3% said they were not ready to get themselves vaccinated. Their reasons varied from fear, doubts about the shots, lack of any identification and lack of knowledge on how to get themselves registered for the jabs. "Vaccine hesitancy is minimal, according to the survey. It will be addressed through targeted interventions”, Anuja Sankhe, a public health expert with UNICEF said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-59-of-people-believe-pandemics-over-finds-5-district-study/articleshow/85019799.cms||Neha Madaan

Unidentified assailants shot at the driver of ADO (panchayat) Baghpat, Krishnapal Singh, who had come to the collectorate for a meeting on Monday afternoon. He had left his licensed revolver in the car. The driver, Gaurav Kumar, drove the car a few meters away from the collectorate in order to park it in the shade. After the meeting, the official called his driver on his mobile but no one answered the call. While the official was wondering why his driver was not taking the call, a passer-by informed police that a man was lying in a pool of blood inside the ADO’s car. The injured man was admitted to hospital. His condition is stated to be critical. The official’s licensed revolver was missing from the car. An FIR has been registered. Ajay Sharma, Kotwali SHO, told TOI that prima facia it looks like the driver was shot at by someone due to personal enmity.“The vehicle was the ADO’s personal vehicle and it was being chauffeured by his personal driver. It looks that the assailants had some personal enmity with the driver who was hit by two bullets, one on the chest and other on the head which were removed on Tuesday by doctors,” said the SHO.

Sources close to the Padmanabhapuram MLA said that the minister receives more than 100 shawls a day when he is in the district. These are apart from shawls presented to him by party men and others in Chennai and during his visit to other districts. The price of shawls range from Rs 100 apiece and the expensive cost a few hundred rupees. Even after distributing many shawls to party cadres, there is a room filled with hundreds of shawls that lay idle, the source said. “Many libraries in Kanyakumari district need books. Usually I donate books to libraries, so it would be nice if friends meeting me avoid presenting shawls and give me books that will benefit poor students,” the minister said on social media. Sources said that some party men gift dhotis with the party flag border on them and shirt bits, which he gives away to people in need. But such gifts are very few compared to shawls. In February 2017, chief minister M K Stalin who was then working president of the party made an appeal to visitors to shun shawls and gift him books instead on his birthday (March 2). He received more than 15,000 books for his birthday that year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/gift-me-books-not-shawls-says-it-min-thangaraj/articleshow/85019784.cms||---

Rohit Kumar’s distraught mother, Bela Devi, who lives in a city slum and was somehow arranging money to pay for his stay at the de-addiction centre in hope of weaning him away from alcohol, is unconscious since the news was broken to her. Rohit had come to the centre on July 16. Police believe that the two accused were trying to flee from the centre and Rohit was against it, which led to his murder. “Who will call me mom now? Who will feed me now? He used to love me the most. He called me the day before he was killed to tell me that he will come home on Rakhi. I saw him for the last time on July 16,” said wailing Devi. Rohit’s father died when he was just 10. As Rohit got addicted to alcohol at an early age, his younger brother, Ganesh, started taking care of the family which lives in a small quarter in the city's slum. They had sent Rohit to several other rehab centres earlier too. According to police, an FIR has been registered in the matter on the basis of a complaint filed by Shivam Gurjar, the owner of the rehabilitation centre. “Shivam told us that he had started the centre three years ago. Earlier, his centre was in Kankarkhera. After the lockdown, he shifted it to the first floor of his house in TP Nagar. One of the accused, Sandeep Kumar, was in his centre since April 2020 while other accused, Anoop -- who is also wanted in a murder case -- arrived here last week,” station house officer (SHO) Raghuraj Singh said. According to Singh, police are verifying if the rehabilitation centre had the permission to operate. The SHO said that the owner should have informed police about two inmates, who had criminal records. “Prima facie, it appears that the two accused got into a pact to flee from the centre but Rohit tried to stop them. They strangled him with a scarf and stuffed the body in a box and fled,” the SHO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/alcoholic-man-30-killed-in-rehab-by-2-inmates/articleshow/85017248.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Hyderabad||31 detained under PD Act in Hyderabad after SC terms it draconian||HYDERABAD: Nearly a month after the Supreme Court said detaining suspects under the Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act (PD Act) on the presumption that an accused could disrupt law and order was 'draconian', two police commissionerates have used the age-old act to detain 31 men under various charges. Hearing an appeal challenging a detention order by Cyberabad police against a white-collar offender, the apex court had on July 9 referred to the PD Act’s indiscriminate use as 'draconian'. Despite the apex court’s remarks, both Rachakonda and Cyberabad police commissionerates have detained musclemen, burglars, peddlers, brothel operators and cyber crooks under PD Act. The act again came into limelight on Monday when the detention order of Cyberabad police against a 35-year-old law graduate-cum-trader, B Ravikanth, was quashed by the SC. While doing so, the apex court observed that to invoke PD Act against offenders it is not enough to say that the actions of the accused pose a threat to law and order, but they must also affect public order. But between July 9 and August 2, 2021 Hyderabad police have invoked PD Act against 31 people. Hyderabad city has three commissionerates — Cyberabad, Rachakonda and Hyderabad. Out of the 31 cases, Cyberabad police have invoked the act against 22 people and Rachakonda police against nine. Hyderabad police invoked a PD Act once in July 2021 prior to SC's remarks. Among the accused booked under the PD Act by city police are Kamalkant Vidyarthi of Bihar and Uttkarsh Singh of Jharkhand for cheating people by creating fake websites that appear similar to the websites of various popular brands, a habitual burglar K Laxman who was detained under the same act previously and a spurious cotton seeds seller K Murali. Others include a ganja peddler L Santosh, three men who organised a party at a farmhouse illegally and supplied drugs to participants, two chain snatchers who committed two offences, two persons for operating a brothel, nine inter-state burglars from Madhya Pradesh, a history-sheeter for involvement in 12 offences and five accused from Mailardevpally for killing a rival in public. While quashing the detention order against Ravikanth, accused in five cases booked under the IPC pertaining to various acts of cheating, the SC pointed out that a possible apprehension of breach of law and order can be said to be made out if it is apprehended that the man, if set free, will continue to cheat gullible persons. Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said that they are following a procedure to invoke PD Act. “I completely agree that the PD Act should be invoked against offenders who are a threat to public order. That is why we have been invoking the act against grave offenders,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/31-detained-under-pd-act-in-city-after-sc-terms-it-draconian/articleshow/85023504.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Nashik||Had prepared for exam, but could not prove ourselves, say students||TextEditorNashik: A record number of students have passed the HSC exams this year in the district and the Nashik division, and close to 45% of the students have scored above 75%. The results, however, evoked a mixed reaction. Most students said they were neither happy nor sad as the system of evaluation has put most of them on the same plane. Sanket Kedare, a science student who scored 82%, said: “We did not have a scope to prove ourselves. Even though we slogged hard through the year, by the beginning of February, it became clear that the exams would no longer be conducted by the Board. Some have liked the evaluation system and some have not. But we are now relieved and ready to chart for our future course.” Pranav Khule, of the Indiranagar area, scored 74%. He said, “Taking the science stream after passing SSC from a semi-English medium school was tough. Though I had secured good marks in SSC, it was a challenge to cope with the subjects in FYJC. While I gained confidence that I can do well in HSC, the pandemic struck. The cancellation of the exam was like pouring cold water on my preparations. However, there are other avenues where I can prove myself.” Prof Ajaykumar Wagh, of Wagh Tutorials, said, “All the students have done a magnificent job. The concept of online studies was new to most of them. However, despite all odds, the students prepared themselves. Unfortunately, the exams did not take place. Nonetheless, since most of the students have now scored more than 50%, they now have an opportunity to go for the JEE, NEET, MHT-CET, etc. They should make the most of it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/had-prepared-for-exam-but-could-not-prove-ourselves-say-students/articleshow/85019803.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Unable to prepare syllabus for CET, say non-state boards||MUMBAI: While the state has sought suggestions on a combined curriculum for the Common Entrance Test (CET) for Class XI admissions, the various educational boards have expressed their inability to participate in the preparation of an inclusive syllabus. Most boards are now asking the state to cancel the CET scheduled on August 21, said officials. The state’s decision to hold an optional CET by adopting the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) curriculum was challenged by an ICSE student in the Bombay high court last month. On the court’s directives, the state on July 30 sought suggestions from boards such as CBSE, CISCE, IB and IGCSE. The matter will be heard by court on Wednesday. Registration data from the state board shows of the 11.96 lakh candidates who have registered for CET, merely 1 lakh are from the other boards. Of those, only 35,814 have filled the form and submitted them; the forms are incomplete or not submitted for the rest. The registration closed on Monday night. CISCE chief executive and secretary Gerry Arathoon on Tuesday wrote to the state additional chief secretary Vandana Krishna stating the CET based on the SSC syllabus is unfair as some students may have dropped subjects such as English and Mathematics in Class X. He suggested the state do away with the CET and consider CISCE results for direct admission to Class XI. Across boards, the Class X results were near 100%. CBSE, in its letter to the state on Tuesday, said holding a CET would mean 1.5 million people coming together on the day of the exam. “It could trigger the spread of the deadly infection as students are not vaccinated and this was the prime reason for not holding the board exam in the first place,” it said. The CBSE, though, told the state all its students, except those with special needs, had no problem with the SSC syllabus. However, the board told the state that it cannot help with the curriculum as it does not have experts. IGCSE informed the state it is not in a position to engage in creating a common question paper. Mahesh Srivastava, regional director, South Asia, Cambridge Assessment, India, stated a subject-based CET will not provide a level playing field to students who have not opted for subjects like mathematics, sciences and social sciences. The IB board has informed the state it will not be able to contribute to submission of questions for the paper as its assessment team is not based in India. Responses of the boards will be shared with the court, said an education department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/non-state-boards-unable-to-prepare-syllabus-for-cet-in-maharashtra/articleshow/85017327.cms||Sandhya Nair

Currently, only around 20 new cases are being reported in the district and most hospitals have shifted focus to improving non-Covid-19 departments. According to the health department, 4,505 beds have been earmarked for Covid-19 in Madurai district, including 621 ICU beds. Currently, only about 5% of these beds are occupied by Covid-19 patients. “We have more than necessary infrastructure for now to tackle any possible rise in number of Covid-19 cases even if it rises to the peak levels of the second wave. We are equipped and prepared to handle rise in cases at any time with adequate staff,” said Dr A Rathinavel, dean, Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH). With lesser number of cases currently, non-Covid-19 departments at GRH have been able to function more normally and all surgeries are also being done. GRH doctors are hoping that other departments remain unaffected even if Covid cases rise. Meanwhile, many private hospitals have temporarily brought down their Covid bed strength. “Two-three months ago, the government held talks with private hospitals and as per their norms, we earmarked Covid-19 beds. Though we brought down bed strength to cater to non-Covid-19 patients, we are prepared to add Covid-19 beds as and when needed,” said Dr B Kannan, medical administrator, Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre. The doctor further said that since June, all surgeries for non-Covid-19 cases had resumed and doctors began facing many semi-emergency cases which were originally elective cases. “Though it seems inevitable for non-Covid-19 patients to be affected again during the third wave, we are hoping to manage with the resources at hand,” he added. Hospitals are also expecting more pediatric Covid-19 cases during the third wave and are accordingly making preparations. “Covid-19 ward has become indispensable in all hospitals. We need to regroup our resources as and when there is a spike in cases. Though currently we are having only 10 Covid-19 beds, we are making preparations anticipating the third wave in August or September. Pediatric beds are also being allotted separately,” said Dr Varun Ramamoorthy, ICU head, Velammal medical college hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hospitals-brace-for-third-covid-19-wave/articleshow/85019835.cms||---
---||Meerut||Assam MLA’s ‘fake degree’ from Meerut univ under scanner, HC hearing today||MEERUT: The Gauhati high court will on Wednesday hear a case against an Assam MLA who has been accused of providing false information in his election affidavit this year. Karim Uddin Barbhuiya, 51, is an AIUDF legislator who had written that he was an arts graduate from the Chaudhary Charan Singh University in Meerut, which the university has denied. The petitioner who took this to court, former deputy speaker from BJP Aminul Haque Laskar, is pinning his hopes on Barbhuiya’s disqualification to make a comeback in Sonai, a seat he won in 2016 but lost to him this year. “In 2016, we went up against each other and I won. In 2021... I lost,” Laskar told TOI. “In 2016, he had called himself an engineer in his affidavit. In 2021, he wrote that he was a BA graduate but didn’t write about his engineering degree. That was why I filed an RTI query and learnt that he never went to the university in Meerut as he had claimed.” Barbhuiya dismissed Laskar’s allegations. “The matter is sub judice. I have to give my reply in court on Wednesday. So, I cannot divulge details. The only thing I can say is that all allegations against me are false and fabricated,” he told TOI. In 2016, Barbhuiya’s election affidavit listed his education as “higher secondary passed from GC College in 1987 and diploma in engineering in 1990.” This year, before the Assam assembly election, his affidavit said his highest qualification was “BA passed from Ch. Charan Singh University, Meerut in the year 2019.” In response to Laskar’s RTI, the public information department of the Chaudhary Charan Singh University said, “In the academic year 2019, no student by the name of Karim Uddin Barbhuiya has appeared for BA examination either as a private or institutional candidate.” Laskar believes he could swing a victory if Barbhuiya is convicted. “There have been instances when false affidavits have led to the cancellation of assembly memberships and first runners-up have been declared MLAs to replace them,” he said. “If the court is convinced he produced fake degrees, I could be declared winner.” His case in the Gauhati high court invokes section 80 and 81 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, provisions to bring an election petition to court. But Article 191, which identifies the circumstances under which an elected representative may be disqualified doesn’t mention false affidavits. So, while legislators found guilty of falsifying information are convicted, whether they are disqualified or not is a matter of discretion. In April this year, the Manipur high court disqualified BJP’s Okram Henry Singh from the assembly for an “incomplete” affidavit. Last year, Mohd Abdullah Azam Khan’s membership of the UP assembly had been terminated for “falsifying” his age.  The HC order was later stayed by the apex court. In Gujarat, the election of Congress’s Nathabhai Patel, accused of concealing information in his affidavit, was upheld and he wasn’t disqualified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/assam-mlas-fake-degree-from-meerut-univ-under-scanner-hc-hearing-today/articleshow/85017335.cms||Sandeep Rai

The meeting, which was attended by the chief secretary, additional chief secretary (home and health), divisional commissioner, secretary (health), DMRC MD and other officials, has become another flashpoint in the relations between the LG and the Delhi government. Within a few hours, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal sent out a tweet objecting to the LG holding a meeting on an important subject without involving the elected government. In his tweet, Kejriwal said: “It is against Constitution and Supreme Court Constitution Bench judgement to hold such parallel meetings behind the back of the elected government. We are a democracy. People have elected a council of ministers. If you have any questions, please ask our ministers. Avoid holding direct meetings with officers. Let’s respect democracy, Sir”. He was quoting a tweet of the LG in which the LG had shared the outcome of the meeting. It is against Constitution n SC CB judgement to hold such parallel meetings behind the back of elected govt.We r… https://t.co/d13EbVjCG1— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) 1628082779000At the LG’s meeting, the health department was advised to ensure that all oxygen PSA plants, liquid medical oxygen storage tanks and cryogenic bottling plants were commissioned latest by August 31 and provisions for adequate buffer stocks of medicines related to Covid-19 and black fungus be made so that any surge in Covid-19 cases can be effectively mitigated and managed. At the meeting, concern was expressed about reported violations of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in metro and other means of public transport. The divisional commissioner, Delhi Police and chief of DMRC were asked to ensure that Covid-19 protocols were strictly enforced. “Advised the health department to widely disseminate the graded action plan and to undertake targeted testing in venues/sites opened up to ascertain the impact for further informed decision-making,” the LG tweeted. The elected government and the LG had recently crossed swords over similar meetings in the past. In a long letter to the LG, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said the meetings were unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court’s April 2018 ruling, adding that it was akin to the murder of democracy. The LG responded to Sisodia’s letter by calling the charges baseless. He remarked that the AAP government has attached incorrect connotations to his acts done in good faith and to facilitate coordination between the central and state government agencies to ensure effective implementation in the larger interest of welfare of the people. The LG defended the meetings and said that they were strictly within the ambit of constitutional provisions and responsibilities entrusted to the LG’s office. The LG’s office did not react to the CM’s objection to the LG’s Wednesday meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lg-holds-covid-meetingcm-tweets-his-objection/articleshow/85054022.cms||AlokKNMishra

Towering at 6.5 feet, the sculpture took over a month to make and cost Harmalkar approximately Rs 4 lakh for the material. Pending only a few touch ups, the work will go for casting in a few days which will complete the sculpture. Interestingly, Harmalkar has earlier been credited with building a 12-feet-tall statue of Lord Parshuram as well as the bust of Menezes Braganza, among others. “I was not commissioned (by anyone) to do this statue. Parrikar was my idol and I wanted to judge my own skills to see if I could do it,” he told TOI. Clay that is used for creating Ganesh idols was used in building the statue while fibre glass will be used to create a cast. For measurements and other specifications of the statue, Harmalkar referred to several pictures from the internet and borrowed hoardings carrying Parrikar’s images from the state BJP office. When word about his work reached Parrikar’s kin, the artist said that the former cheif miniter’s elder son, Utpal, reached out to him, requesting to view the creation. “I told him that I will let him know about the completion of the statue, after which he can come see it,” he said. Harmalkar now intends to present the statue for public display at his upcoming art exhibition, dates of which have not been decided yet. However, he has not yet decided on the sale of his creation. “If the government wants to keep it or if anyone else wants to purchase it, I will think it over. Until then it will be with me in my house,” he said. After completing three terms spanning nine years each at the Institute Menezes Braganza, Harmalkar has been keeping himself busy with sculpting and art. The artist was recently given the task of preparing statues of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia, TB Cunha and other leaders whose statues are being installed at the Aguada jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-artist-makes-life-size-statue-of-parrikar/articleshow/85022242.cms||Nida Sayed

The state government made it clear that it was ready to submit the details of all the projects once the gazette notification was amended by the Centre. The newly constituted coordination committees of Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) were held in Hyderabad on Tuesday. Telangana government boycotted both meetings. In fact, AP government had welcomed the issuance of the gazette notification by fixing the jurisdiction of river Boards a fortnight ago. The Centre had declared that all the projects including existing, ongoing and proposed would come under the purview of the respective river boards. The Centre had also stated that the notification would come into effect from October 14. In an attempt to finalise the action plan by the time the notification comes into effect, the river Boards have constituted separate coordination committees comprising officials from irrigation and energy departments from both AP and Telangana and officials from Jal Shakti ministry. The first meeting of the coordination committees, which was held in Jala Soudha complex in Hyderabad, had deliberated on the measures needed to be taken to manage the projects and water releases in future. The river Board authorities have requested both the states to submit comprehensive details of the projects, water allocations and withdrawals to ready the action plan. The Boards have also asked the two states to extend their cooperation in implementation of the gazette notification. But AP government raised certain objections about the notification issued by the Centre and asked the river management Boards to put off their plans to ready the blueprint till the gazette notification is amended. The AP irrigation engineer-in-chief (ENC), C Narayana Reddy, who attended the meeting, submitted the views of the state government to the boards. However, the senior officials of the Boards were reported to have told the ENC to submit the details of projects without waiting for the amendment of the gazette. “You are free to request the Centre for amendment of the gazette notification. We will also wait for the further communication from the Centre. Meanwhile, we have to ready action plan as per the timelines fixed by the Centre,” said GRMB member secretary AB Pandya. Sources said that Narayana Reddy told the committee that they would come back to the Board after consulting the state government. “We have requested the Centre to remove a few projects (Prakasam barrage/Polavaram/Pattiseema/Purushottampatnam/Sileru power project) which would not have adverse implication on the other side (Telangana) from the management control of the river Boards. We can’t submit the details of the projects until the gazette is amended,” said Narayana Reddy. AP Transco CMD Dr N Srikanth, Genco MD G Sai Prasad and other senior officials attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/river-boards-row-ap-declines-to-share-details-of-its-projects/articleshow/85023516.cms||Samdani MN

As a pilot project, KMRL in association with agency for new and renewable energy research and technology (Anert) will set up charging points in four Metro stations soon. Once found viable, the project will be extended to all the 22 Metro stations. “We have held preliminary talks with Anert officials in this regard. We will conduct a survey for handpicking the four stations where the charging points are to be installed in the first phase,” a top official with KMRL said. “It will be based on the flow of vehicles and the number of prospective owners who may buy or switch to e-vehicles at each centre that the stations will be selected,” he said. Though the number of electric vehicles is very few in Kochi, the chances are high for a steep increase soon. “There is increase in the number electric vehicles being registered in Kochi. Still, the pace in increase in the number of such vehicles is very slow. Unavailability of charging points is one of the factors which force many from not opting to buy electric vehicles. As of now, there are only a few charging points in the city and suburbs. KSEB has installed two charging points in the city, while KEL has set up one in Mamala near Tripunithura,” said P M Shabeer, regional transport officer (RTO), Ernakulam. “People complain that the performance of electric vehicles is not up to the mark. This may be another reason for low demand for electric vehicles. It is learnt some of the manufacturers have come up with improvised versions of electric vehicles. Then, the demand for electric vehicles will go up,” Shabeer said. One of the manufacturers who is set to introduce their new electric scooter in Kochi plans to install electric vehicles charging points in the city. They held discussions with various agencies, including KMRL, for installing charging points in Kochi. “They offered a revenue sharing model which can be implemented as a joint venture with KMRL. Then, KMRL should spent Rs 50,000 each for a charging machine,” an official with the Metro agency said. Moreover, KMRL itself is planning to roll out e-autos in the city as feeder service to the Metro. KMRL has invited tenders for submitting request for qualification (RFQ) for launching e-auto service. The Metro agency plans to procure 115 e-autos for the purpose in two phases. The firm or consortium which emerges successful in the tendering process should operate and maintain e-autos in the city and suburbs as a feeder service to Metro. The plan is to roll out 77 e-autos in the first phase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/e-vehicle-recharging-points-soon-at-all-metro-stations/articleshow/85017460.cms||---

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) issued an order on Monday, urging residents to follow the state government’s guidelines for the 10-day festival. The directive banned precessions on the first and the immersion days. It stated that crowd should be avoided during aarti, bhajan and other programmes. The civic administration’s order also stressed on online darshan facility for devotees. The Pune municipal commissioner, Vikram Kumar, stated in the order that the Ganesh festival should be celebrated in a simple manner, according to the instructions issued by the state government. “The Ganesh Mandals will have to seek permission from the PMC and follow the rules and the guidelines of the civic administration while erecting pandals. The festival should be celebrated in a restricted manner with simple decorations. Preference should be given to convey health and social messages through decorations and displays. It should be ensured that advertisements do not attract the crowd,” the order stated. This is the second consecutive year when the civic administration has issued instructions for a low-key Ganeshotsav in the Pune civic limits. Many Ganesh mandals had cancelled the celebrations and processions last year after the state government issued similar instructions because of the pandemic. The state government issued an order this year also in June, stating that Ganesh mandals should not install idols taller than four feet at pandals and two-foot idols were recommended for celebrations at home. It stated that residents should opt for immersion of idols at homes or at makeshift tanks set up by local civic bodies to avoid crowding. Children and senior citizens should refrain from visiting immersion ghats, it recommended. Ganeshotsav is usually celebrated in the city with great enthusiasm. Over 1,500 Ganesh mandals register every year with the civic administration and the city police for the festival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-order-stresses-on-modest-ganesh-festival-without-crowd-bans-processions/articleshow/85019948.cms||---

The cluster was identified by health department officials during their random check for influenza-like illness at Neelambur panchayat on July 25, when one of the inmates in a house complained of cold and body pain. “A four-member team was sent to the locality the next day to collect swabs from all the 54 workers on the mill campus for Covid-19 testing. And when the test results came on July 29, 15 of them from 11 houses, mostly women, were found to be positive for the virus,” a health inspector said. The officials sealed the mill on July 30 and imposed a fine of Rs5,000 for failing to adhere to the standard operating procedures (SOPs). The mill, the official said, was in an isolated location, away from residential areas. Except for a truck with workers that came from Maharashtra on July 19 to take yarn from the mill, outsides hadn’t visited the place for more than a month, he said. Dr Omar Faroque, Sulur block medical officer, said, “They (truck with workers) could have been the source of infection. The mill failed to inform the authorities about their arrival. Every individual from other states should be tested for Covid-19 on arrival and allowed to work only if results are negative. The mill failed in this front, creating a cluster. The mill was disinfected for the past three days.” The district, meanwhile, recorded 208 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, taking the case tally to 2,30,012, of which 2,043 are active cases. With 169 patients getting discharged from hospitals and Covid care centres on the day, the number of recovered patients has now touched 2,25,787. The district also reported four Covid-19 deaths on the day, pushing the toll to 2,182. Health officials said anywhere between 10,000 and 12,000 samples were being collected in the district on a daily basis for testing. Neighbouring Tirupur logged 85 fresh cases on the day, even as 124 patients were discharged from various treatment centres. While 88,072 people had tested positive for the virus till date in Tirupur, 86,335 of them have recovered. Presently, there are only 891 active cases in Tirupur, which recorded five Covid deaths on Tuesday. At least 25 patients have succumbed to the virus in Tirupur in the past five days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/spinning-mill-turns-into-covid-cluster-with-15-cases-sealed/articleshow/85019933.cms||Sampath Kumar

This will comprise 30% of the overall target as the state government plans to issue 10 lakh lease deeds across the state. According to estimates, out of 1,036 approved schemes developed on private land, the JDA plans to issue 50,396 lease deeds to plot owners. The civic body eyes to earn a target of Rs 54 crore after regularising these plots. Similarly, the authority plans to earn Rs 46 crore revenue after issuing 15,819 lease deeds to owners whose houses are situated in 142 unapproved colonies. To benefit the residents, the state government has announced to organise these camps in October. To take the stock of the preparations, a meeting was called Jaipur Development commissioner Gaurav Goyal on Tuesday. After examining the list of 990 housing schemes approved by the housing co-operative societies in JDA region, it was learnt the lease deeds were not issued to 26,275 plot owners. The lease deeds to plot owners in the approved societies will be distributed from October 2 onwards. The JDA will also seek data of 1,361 housing schemes developed by the cooperative societies before regularization. An official said, “There are approximately 1,00,832 plots falling under these colonies. Lease deeds to these plot owners will be issued after examining the data.”After organising special camps, the civic body will also distribute lease deeds to plot owners falling under the Prithvi Raj Nagar scheme. The JDA has targeted to issue 15,388 lease deeds to owners whose houses are situated in 446 approved colonies. As for the first time the camps will be organised online, a new concept of nagar mitra has also been mooted. Technical consultants for aiding public will be hired under the system. “On many occasions, problem occurs during the camps when applicants are not aware of the procedure and documents required during applying. Due to these shortcomings, civic bodies give notice to the applicants to rectify or complete these documents. This takes unnecessary time and the number of pending cases also increases. With the help of consultants, the process will be expedited,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-to-issue-3l-lease-deeds-to-plot-owners-of-colonies/articleshow/85022277.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Coimbatore||Bus passengers sans face masks raise concerns||Coimbatore: Compliance to Covid-19 precautionary measures in government buses is still poor, despite the spike in fresh cases. While most passengers of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation and State Express Transport Corporation buses throw the norms to the wind, a few people are forced to travel with the fear of getting infected. Often, bus crew is also seen without face masks, causing concerns among the public. Some people, who are concerned about the infection, said while most of the passengers were wearing face masks while boarding buses, many of them were removing the same later on. “With the conductor himself not wearing face mask properly, he is not thinking of questioning the people who violate the rule,” they said. There is scant regard for the rule in long-route buses, which connect districts. Passengers said the buses could turn into virus transmission points, if authorities don’t address the issue. P Manickaraja, a resident of Selvapuram, said, “Many people pull face masks down to their chin once they get seated in buses. They do not care to wear it properly even if someone questions them. It is the duty of bus conductors to keep an eye on it and ensure adherence to the norms. But they are not supporting us when we question the violators.” H Vijayagopal, a city resident, said he was the only one among the three passengers to comply with the mask rule on board the bus connecting Trichy and Coimbatore. “I am a marketing professional, who travels to various districts frequently. People do not have any regard for the mask etiquette. I think they will follow it only when it is strictly implemented by penalizing them. In the first place, conductors should be sensitized on the importance of wearing face masks,” he told TOI. A TNSTC bus conductor, who didn’t want to be identified, said he was fed up with insisting people to wear face masks. “Some passengers are not cooperative. Enforcement officials should carry out surprise inspections and fine the violators.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bus-passengers-sans-face-masks-raise-concerns/articleshow/85019978.cms||V Devanathan

---||Delhi||Delhi: 7,000 ICU beds at 7 temporary hospitals to fight Covid crisis||NEW DELHI: As part of the exercise of ramping up the capital’s health infrastructure for battling a likely third wave of Covid-19 cases, the Delhi government has started the process of creating semi-permanent Covid hospitals at seven different locations with nearly 7,000 ICU beds in total. The project is expected to be completed in five months at a cost of more than Rs 690 crore. The semi-permanent ICU hospitals will be set up near Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya and GTB Hospital, and in Sarita Vihar, Raghubir Nagar, Shalimar Bagh, Kirari and Sultanpuri. As these hospitals are being set up with an eye on a possible third wave of the pandemic, contractors would have to deploy sufficient manpower in three shifts to complete the work within five months or be prepared to be liable for action under the Delhi Disaster Management Act. To save time, the multi-storey hospital buildings are proposed as hollow ‘mild steel’ square or rectangular tube steel structures. The structures will have reinforced concrete cement raft or isolated foundation, which will support the entire building. The biggest of these ‘temporary’ Covid hospitals will come up at the Delhi government-run GTB Hospital complex, which is likely to be a five-storey structure spread over an area of more than 6 acres with 1,912 ICU beds. The second-largest facility in terms of ICU bed strength will be a four-storey structure at Raghubir Nagar in west Delhi, which will be built on a nine-acre plot and will boast of 1,577 ICU beds. The Covid hospital that will come up in north Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh will be a four-storey structure with 1,430 beds. Two Covid hospitals will come up nearby in northwest Delhi’s Kirari area, which will be a five-story structure with 458 beds and a four-storey structure in Sultanpuri with 525 beds. Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya will get a five-storey structure on a 2.3-acre plot nearby, which will have 596 paediatric ICU beds. A comparatively smaller Covid hospital will come up in south Delhi’s Sarita Vihar. It will be a five-storey structure with 336 ICU beds that will come up on a 2.7-acre plot. Although semi-permanent, these hospitals will have adequate general waiting area at all floors with adequate toilet facilities, bed elevators that can accommodate patients, stretcher, trolleys and equipment movement, provision for sewage treatment plant and rainwater harvesting pits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/7000-icu-beds-at-7-temp-hospitals-to-fight-crisis/articleshow/85054177.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Every year over 2,000 Class XII students from Maharashtra opt for the CIS. Chairperson of Aurangabad division of MSBSHSE Sugatha Punne on Tuesday said the affected students can either choose to proceed further with their earlier performance or can appear for the next examination. “While no board examination could take place this year due to outbreak of Covid-19, the HSC result was declared based on internal evaluation along withother parameters. As data of such internal evaluation was not possible to be compiled for candidates enrolled for CIS, they were denied from taking the February-March examinations,” she said. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad has already announced that the cancelled HSC exam of 2021 would not be counted as a missed opportunity for candidates registered for the CIS and they can still avail their eligible two attempts during the subsequent examinations. Educational activist, however, said the measure will not be of much relief to affected candidates. “The admissions for all mainstream professional and traditional courses begin after the result of HSC examination held in February-March every year. Students appearing for the supplementary examination later miss admissions to many such courses,” said Tukaram Saraf of student union Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sena .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/covid-affects-chances-of-337-students-enrolled-for-cis/articleshow/85019957.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Aurangabad||BJP spokesperson Chitra Wagh booked by Beed cops for calling NCP youth president a rapist||Aurangabad: Beed police have registered a case against BJP state vice-president and spokesperson Chitra Wagh for allegedly referring to NCP state youth president Mehbood Shaikh as rapist. The alleged statement was made by Wagh during one of her recent visits to Shirur Kasar in Beed on July 18. Following the visit to the house of zilla parishad member Shivaji Pawar, she interacted with the reporters and a video clip of her statement was widely circulated on social media. Beed superintendent of police R Raja confirmed registration of a non-cognizable offence, but refused to elaborate further. The offence has been registered by Shirur Kasar police on the basis of complaint lodged by Shaikh under IPC sections 499 for defamation and 500 (punishment for defamation). Earlier, based on the complaint lodged by a woman, Shaikh was booked on December 26, 2020 by Cidco police station on charge of rape. However, after carrying out the probe under the supervision of officers of the rank of deputy and assistant commissioners of police, police concluded there was no direct or indirect evidence against Shaikh. The complainant had also failed to corroborate her allegations with any evidence or witness. Based on the findings, police filed a B summary report in April this year before the court. Shaikh in his complaint against Wagh has stated that despite police filing a report, the BJP spokesperson publicly referred to him as rapist and also questioned the B sumary report filed in the court of law. Sources said that Shaikh lodged a complaint with the police station on July 19, but no cognizance was not taken following which he lodged a complaint with the superintendent of police. It was after carrying out a preliminary probe, an offence was registered late on Monday. When contacted, Wagh said, “Currently I am in Chiplun and not aware of the registration of offence. Whenever Beed police contacts me, I will definitely reply to them. All I would like to say is that I have been raising my voice for the victims. Even if I have to face 100 cases each day, I will continue to raise my voice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bjp-spokesperson-chitra-wagh-booked-by-beed-cops-for-calling-ncp-youth-president-a-rapist/articleshow/85019985.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Pune||Malls count mounting losses, staffers lose jobs in Pune||PUNE: Staff layoffs at malls across the city have started and nearly 400 food outlets in such facilities are now non-functional for dine-ins and home deliveries due to the months of closure since the Covid pandemic started. Mall authorities associated with the Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI) told TOI that the impact of Covid-19 restrictions has translated into losses of over Rs15,000 crore for the industry in Maharashtra. “Around 2 lakh mall employees have also been affected,” an SCAI source said. A popular mall in an affluent residential and retail neighborhood in Pune recently let go of nearly 250 contractual employees — housekeeping staffers, security guards, facade cleaners and also those involved in gardening and engineering. A mall source said, “The malls were allowed to operate at 50% capacity. So they cannot have 100% staffers in place. The third-party workforce is based on work exigency and load. The need for reduction of staffers was a fallout of revenue losses and no footfalls in the malls.” Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, chief operating officer of Amanora Mall and member of SCAI, told TOI, “Thousands of staffers have been affected due to the complete shutdown that the Pune malls have been facing due to the prolonged Covid-19 restrictions. Everybody’s jobs are at stake now. Even the majority of food courts in malls are closed, as sustaining business only on home deliveries is not viable. Only the big restaurant chains in some malls are operational.” Mukesh Kumar, CEO Infiniti Mall, Mumbai, and chairman of the board at SCAI, told TOI, “There are around 75 malls in Maharashtra, of which 50 are based in Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Navi Mumbai. The malls in Maharashtra were generating an average sales of Rs4,000 crore a month in pre-Covid times. This has been completely wiped off. The malls also generated around Rs600-700 crore GST per month. The government has lost that amount as well. The impact of Covid-19 restrictions has translated into losses of over Rs15,000 crore for the industry. Around 2 lakh mall employees have also been affected.” He said, “For every employee in a mall, there’s another involved indirectly, in divisions such as logistics and manufacturing. All have been affected. Close to 30-40% of mall employees in Maharashtra have lost their jobs. The malls and retail stores cannot afford to pay their salaries with no revenues coming in and additional overheads.” A mall representative told TOI that the lockdown due to the second wave of the pandemic was more harmful to businesses than what had happened during the restrictions last year. Arun Arora, centre director of Phoenix Marketcity, Pune, said, “Malls are much more disciplined than many other sectors in terms of ensuring Covid-appropriate norms. We fail to understand why the authorities are ignoring the rush at the local markets and targeting only some specific industries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/malls-count-mounting-losses-staffers-lose-jobs/articleshow/85020014.cms||Neha Madaan

The team is now inquiring the accused as to from where has he brought the turtles. The arrested trader has been identified as Raju Meena. Forest ranger, Janeshwar Singh said, “The forest department team contacted the smugglers to buy these turtles. After the deal was closed to purchase one turtle at Rs 10,000, the smugglers brought the turtles in a carton. The team nabbed them, once they saw the turtles.” The department was tipped off by a wildlife enthusiast, Sumit Juneja. Experts said, the Indian softshell turtle (Nilssonia Gangetica) or Ganges softshell turtle is a species of softshell turtle found in South Asia in rivers such as the Ganges, Indus and Mahanadi. This vulnerable turtle reaches a carapace length of up to 94cm (37 inch). It feeds mostly on fish, amphibians, carrion and other animal matter, but also aquatic plants. These turtles are protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, the same protection status enjoyed by the tiger. The possession of animals listed in Schedule I of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 may attract imprisonment of three to seven years. A forest official said, “The price of these turtles is not fixed in Rajasthan. These illegal traders demand money as per their whims and fancies. Rare species are sold for meat and for use in traditional medicine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/trader-arrested-for-selling-7-endangered-rare-turtles-hare/articleshow/85022291.cms||---

The move comes after the state government allegedly appointed two former Congress MLAs as independent directors. While former MLA Sajjan Katara was appointed as independent director in Udaipur smart city, Gopal Baheti was given post in Ajmer Smart city. Appointment of Rajni Gupta as independent director in Kota smart city has also come under the scanner as she is the wife of AK Gupta, who was CMD in the state electricity corporation. However, MoHUA in its letter has not mentioned the reason to keep the appointments in abeyance. A letter dated August 2 reads, “It is conveyed that the process of said appointments of independent directors is under examination by MoHUA. It is therefore requested to keep the said appointments of independent directors to the board of SPVs in abeyance till appropriate decision in the matter is arrived in at the ministry.” On July 15, the state government had appointed seven new independent directors in the smart cities of Jaipur, Kota, Udaipur and Ajmer after issuing the orders. Seven independent directors appointed in SPVs of four cities, which were registered under the companies Act, 2013. Sources said a complaint was made to central government alleging those who were appointed as independent directors in smart city did not have any special experience in matters related to town planning or urban development. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hiring-of-independent-directors-put-on-hold/articleshow/85022320.cms||---

With a fairly good weather, the day was dry without any significant rain. The sudden lightning strikes made many jolt out of their beds. According to the Met office, a cloud column had travelled to the city from Bangladesh and convection by these columns caused the lightnings. “These were the cumulonimbus cloud — around 8km tall — that lay concentrated over some parts of the city. If the cloud had spread over fairly, the kind of convection could not have happened,” said G K Das, director (weather) at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata. According to weather scientists, cumulonimbus clouds are dense, tall and vertical and are formed by water vapour carried by powerful upward air currents. Apart from lightning, these clouds can also trigger other severe weather conditions like hailstorms and tornados. There is a cyclonic circulation over northern parts of Bay of Bengal. According to Alipore weather office, the system is not as strong as a low-pressure area. The cloud formation, pushed up by a cyclonic circulation, can trigger localized thunderstorm. The city is likely to get light to moderate rain over the next few days. The city is becoming increasingly vulnerable to lightning. The phenomenon of continuous lightning that the city experienced in the early hours of Tuesday was not an isolated incident but something that the city may experience again, climate experts warned on Tuesday. The heat-island effect created in the city due to the presence of glass and concrete structures, coupled with polluting particles like carbon and sulphur, form the perfect recipe to trigger lightning flashes when low-hanging thick cumulonimbus clouds form over the city, explained Soumendu Chatterjee, geography professor at Presidency University. Many attribute the rise in the SPM count in Kolkata to the increased lightning intensity in recent years. Lightning has claimed several lives in the last few years. A young cricketer had suffered a heart attack after lightning flashed near him at Deshapriya Park in June 2018. A month later, a couple was struck by lightning near the Red Road-Mayo Road intersection. One of them died. In August 2019, one person was killed and 16 injured when lightning struck at the Victoria Memorial Hall grounds. Climatologists say improved early detection, warning and communication can save lives from lightning strikes. “Lightning (which is static electricity) is particularly dangerous for farm fields filled with water. Water being a conductor of electricity can electrify an entire field.

They will be asked to maintain the repaired roads for three years, failing which action will be taken against them. The civic authorities had recently taken up a Rs 30-crore patchwork project in which roads were repaired at several places of the township, specially on the lanes inside the blocks. “It is a waste of money if they get damaged in a short span of time. We will check the list as to which agencies had recently repaired the roads that are again filled with craters and our engineers will be inspecting the roads. We will be taking stock of the matter and ask the contractors to maintain the roads properly for three years,” said BMC board of administrators’ chairperson Krishna Chakraborty. For example, the First Avenue stretch from Tank 5 to Baisakhi Island, that was repaired a year and half back, has already developed large craters at places. Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) has been conducting patchwork of Eastern Metropolitan Bypass stretching from Hudco junction to Garia as and when craters and potholes are developing. “It is a routine work that needs to be conducted each year, specially during this time,” said a KMDA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salt-lake-patchwork-agencies-to-answer-for-cratered-roads/articleshow/85017563.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 95% plus scores flood CBSE X results, keeping with pandemic year trend||KOLKATA: Keeping with the pandemic year trend, a considerably high number of CBSE Class X students scored 95% and above — as was witnessed first in Madhyamik, the state board Class X results, and then, in ICSE. After the CBSE results were announced on Tuesday, schools in the city were not surprised because the marks remained more or less similar to what they had sent to the board after moderation. Schools, however, pointed out that there were several more students in the 95%-plus category who could not be accommodated in that bracket because of the reference year rule that the CBSE had brought in to keep institutes from awarding unbridled marks. In all, 35,212 students from Bengal enrolled for the CBSE X exam, of whom 35,034 were declared successful. Bengal is part of the Bhubaneshwar CBSE zone, where the pass percentage was calculated to be 99.6%, while the national pass percentage was 99%. Bhubaneshwar zone has ranked 8th nationally. Girls have continued to outrun boys even in this situation of formulated marks with 99.2% of them clearing the boards, compared to 99% boys. A total of 2,00,962 candidates have been placed in the 90%-95% category (9.6% of the total students) and 57,824 candidates in the 95%-plus category (2.8%). CBSE did not prepare a merit list this time but schools in the city made their own high-scorers’ chart. Many schools in the city allowed their Class X candidates to take up an additional sixth subject. In some of these schools, the highest marks went up to 100%, as many students scored full marks in five out of six subjects. South Point School stood out in this race of excellence with 11 toppers this time, all of them scoring 99.6%. The school sent out 757 students this batch; among them, 222 students were placed in the 95%-plus category. “It is not so lonely at the top after all,” laughed South Point principal R S Bhattacharjee. So many students scoring merely 2 marks short of the perfect score was a record of sorts, the school said. Shruti Bharatdwaj also scored 99.6% to top her school, BD Memorial International. “I am happy indeed. This was the score in my offline preboards, too. I lost one mark in English and Hindi each. I wish to become a doctor and am already preparing for it,” she said. The topper at DPS Ruby Park was Siya Malik with 99.6%. “I am glad to see my teachers happy. The result has given me some encouragement in these difficult times,” she said. A total of 106 students from DPS Ruby Park scored above 95% and 307 above 90%. The school average went up to 90.78%, from 88.25% last year. Lakshmipat Singhania Academy has three toppers with 99.2%. Muskan Goel, one of them, has decided to go against the “toppers’ trend” and study humanities in Plus-II. “I wish to major in English in an Ivy League college,” she said. Birla High School was happy seven of its students scored 100% in social sciences and five 100% in maths. The topper, Sarbo Sarcar, has scored 99%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/95-scores-flood-cbse-x-results-keeping-with-pandemic-year-trend/articleshow/85020084.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

This year, results were prepared on an alternative assessment scheme as board exams could not be held this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In the CBSE Dehradun region — which includes more than 800 affiliated schools in Uttarakhand and eight districts of western Uttar Pradesh — the overall pass percentage was recorded at 99.23, nearly 10% up from the 2019-20 figure of 89.72%. Out of the 13 districts of Uttarakhand, eight posted 100% results. This time too, girl students in the region outperformed their boy counterparts. While the overall pass percentage for girls was 99.24, it was 98.89 for boys. The top scorers from Dehradun district were — Niharika Kaur from Kendra Vidyalaya, Hathibarkala, and Anmol Sharma from Mount Litera Zee School — both of whom secured 99.8%. Talking to TOI, Niharika’s mother Pratibha Singh said “It’s a very proud moment for us. I am thankful to all her teachers for their constant support. Students and their parents have faced anxiety over the past year due to pandemic-related disruptions but I am glad that my daughter passed with flying colours. It's a step closer to her dream of becoming a doctor.” The other top performers from the district include — Rashi Arora (99.6%) from the DSB International School, Akshaj Singhmar (99.2%) and Juhi Sobhani (98.6%) from the Tula International School, and Bhoomika (98%) from the Doon Heritage School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cbse-class-x-results-out-99-2-students-clear-exam/articleshow/85014996.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The buildings have been declared dilapidated and unsafe by public works department.“PWD recently conducted a structural audit of the buildings and concluded that they were weak, and if there was heavy rain or bad weather with wind some of them may collapse. Hence, we served them eviction notices but some personnel approached local politicians and are making a political issue of it, refusing to vacate. We are concerned about the safety of our policemen and their families,’’ said a senior police official. He said politicians will not help if the buildings collapse and families of constables will suffer. Mumbai Police said the 220 families were mostly of constabulary rank. The buildings were built in 1962 and due to poor maintenance have become weak. There are sufficient vacant flats, said Rajkumar Watkar, joint commissioner of police (administration).S Ahmed Ali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-220-naigaum-cop-families-told-to-shift-from-old-bldgs/articleshow/85020047.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Fraudster dupes elderly citizen at ATM, steals Rs 90,000||KOLKATA: Police suspect shoulder-surfing gangs are back in Kolkata after receiving several complaints of elderly ATM users being targetted. The latest victim was a senior citizen who was duped at an ATM kiosk in the Golf Green on Sunday. According to the complaint of Sanghamitra Ghosh, 74, who had gone to the ATM on Sunday around noon, someone had managed to exchange her debit card after knowing her PIN. She lost Rs 90,000. "My septugenerian mother went to a nearby public sector bank ATM on Uday Sankar Sarani and withdrew Rs 10,000 from my account using my ATM Card. While coming out, a man called her from behind telling her that she by mistake had keyed in the amount desired twice and hence needed to cancel it. Not being suspicious, my mother did as instructed. At this point, the man asked her to take out a mini statement to double check. She checked the balance and found it in order. Later, however, when she came back home, I realized that my card got exchanged with another one. On calling up the bank immediately to block my card, I realised that this fraud person by then had made nine withdrawals, each of around Rs 10,000. This kind of crime where the aged, weak and vulnerable are being targeted needs to be addressed urgently," Bodhisatwa Ghosh, the victim's son and a senior executive at an advertising firm, wrote on Facebook. But Ghosh was not alone, several others have also fallen prey to these "shoulder-surfing gangs”. An assistant sub-inspector — hailing from Darbhanga in Bihar and in Kolkata for some work — had claimed in March this year that his debit card was cloned and Rs 40,000 withdrawn from his account through an ATM located close to Yogajog Bhawan. Bowbazar police had registered a case of cheating and fraud. In another case, again in March, Md Abdul Kalam Azad — a senior citizen residing in the Park Street area — was duped by ATM fraudsters of Rs 96,000 when he went to withdraw money from the ATM of a nationalized bank in the New Park Street area. A case was registered with the Beniapukur police. Similar incidents were recorded at Dhakuria, Lake and Naktala region before the gang slipped away from the city. In February this year, shoulder-surfing gangs had replaced the ATM card of a user at Rajabazar and withdrew Rs 60,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fraudster-dupes-elderly-citizen-at-atm-steals-rs-90k/articleshow/85017588.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Hubballi||Mandya: GPS tagging to help know lives of pelicans better||MYSURU: Kokkare Bellur in Maddur taluk of Mandya district, on the banks of river Shimsha is famous for migratory spot-billed pelicans and other nesting species. The forest department is planning to implant solar-powered GPS-GSM patagial tags on two pelicans to understand their life better. The department has also started implanting wing tags for migratory birds which are hand-raised and rehabilitated. According to the proposal, two spot-billed pelicans will be tagged with solar-powered GPS-GSM patagial tags to track their movement in this breeding season (October 2021). GSM tags will help officials get the birds’ coordinates at all times. It will reveal from where the pelicans come from, their non-breeding grounds, and their important foraging grounds. “The initiative will help us understand the life of spot-billed pelicans in a better way. Details like why they come here, from where they come, their feeding pattern and habits can be understood,” said DCF (Mysuru circle) K C Prashanth Kumar. “Tagging will help us resolve the mystery behind the migration of these birds. We get details of their migration habit, route, and other details. Initially, two birds will be tagged,” he said. The officer said six birds, which have been rehabilitated, have been implanted with wing tags. “These wing tags are implanted in birds which were rehabilitated through hand-feeding,” he said. Tanuja Rao, an avid birder, said the study is much-needed one. Authorities said in March 2021, four pelican chicks were patagial numbers tagged with codes K01, K02, K03 and K04. In April 2021, two painted stork chicks were ringed with alphanumeric codes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/gps-tagging-to-help-know-lives-of-pelicans-better/articleshow/85014959.cms||Shrinivasa M

On the last day of his two-day visit in the city, Kamal said BJP units of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka may differ in terms of names, but both are controlled by the central government. Claiming to be the only actor in the country to have acted in many films in double roles, Kamal said he can quickly identify those indulging in double acts. On the Kongunadu issue, he termed it a political slogan rather than a necessity. “We can consider if it was a request from a political party, but it was from a company,” Kamal said referring to the BJP. Earlier there was East India Company (EIC) and now a north India company is in the making. But people would not allow this, he said. “If you put your hands on our shoulders by terming the country as one nation, we will celebrate you. But if you swindle the resources by giving it to private companies, you can only be termed as a company like the EIC. No state would support such exploitation,” he said. He said the government is doing its best on the Covid outbreak, but it needs to do more. He said there was no loss to the party by the exit of former vice-president of the party R Mahendran who joined DMK.

---||Dehradun||Apple farmers lose most of their crop as rain lash Kumaon, fruit prices plummet||Nainital: Farmers from Nainital’s Ramgarh and Mukteshwar have said that apples, which used to be sold for over Rs 60-80 per kg, are now fetching them barely Rs 20 a kg at the state’s wholesale markets. The plummeting prices and entry of foreign apples have dented the farmers' income so much that many of them said they are now on the verge of bankruptcy. Speaking to TOI, the growers blamed the incessant rains for the damage. “First there were hails during the budding season, and now, for the last several weeks, incessant rains have made the situation even worse. Almost half of produce was ruined at the fruiting stage and that which survived is now barely one-third of the value,” said Rahul Singh, an apple farmer from Nainital’s Ramgarh. Farmers from several areas of Nainital depend solely on fruit farming with apples making a large chunk of it. Apart from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand is one of the major producers of apples which are even sent to other states. The growers have been complaining about severe losses due to rains this year. Farmer said that because of the poor quality of Nainital’s apples this year, the markets are now flooded with the fruit from other states and even other countries. “Those apples are being sold at over Rs 100/kg while we are even struggling to make our both ends meet. For the last couple of years, the condition has been the same. If this persists, we will be forced to leave apple farming altogether,” said Dinesh Darmwal, a farmer from Mukteshwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/apple-farmers-lose-most-of-their-crop-as-rain-lash-kumaon-fruit-prices-plummet/articleshow/85015037.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Kochi||Kochi: Using natural fibres, Cusat develops surgical materials||KOCHI: Using natural fibres, researchers from the department of polymer science, Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat), have developed biomedical material that could be used in surgical interventions. “The tissue engineering scaffold we have designed is a herbally-bred composite material made from microfibres extracted from a widely explored traditional Indian medicinal plant Changalamparanda and a biodegradable clinically relevant polymer, polycaprolactone,” said G S Sailaja, professor, polymer science, Cusat. “The material is supportive of healing bone defects holding pronounced clinical relevance. The defects could be originated by trauma, surgical procedures or infections related to the bone. When the body’s mechanism fails to rectify bone defects because the dimensions exceed the critical size, this scaffold can give adequate support to augment bone defect repair,” she said. The research team included Praseetha R Nair and Sreeja S. They said that ayurveda physicians already use this bonesetter to heal damage to bones. “They use the extract of the plant. Our fine-size fibres will reframe the mechanical properties and will slowly dissolve giving time for the bone to heal. This will be helpful in cases where metal-based and other implants are used and later need to be removed surgically. The porous structure aids easy transport of nutrients and specific cells towards the defects and accelerates the tissue regeneration process. In practice, this herbal scaffold will be a patient-friendly approach that minimizes secondary invasive procedures. Yet another research product from the department has been an X-ray visible antibacterial biodegradable surgical suture. “We are waiting for the patent,” said Sailaja whose student Sneha K Ramanathan developed it under her guidance.  “The suture is developed from natural cellulosic fibres extracted from Agave Sisalana plant leaves. It has a customized coating of a clinically relevant biodegradable polymer. Its porous structure in which antibiotics can be loaded will be released very slowly, thus giving a medical healing to the suture which later dissolves into the body naturally,” she said. Surgical sutures are biomedical implants used for wound closure. Normally sutures comprise filament, fibres or thread-like biomaterials which can be absorbable or non-absorbable by nature.  Modern suture materials demand not only chemical and biological properties but also enhanced bioactivity and controlled degradation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/using-natural-fibres-cusat-develops-surgical-materials/articleshow/85017699.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Sattar had filed an affidavit explaining his action and had tendered an unconditional apology in response to the HC’s directive on February 26 to explain his action. “We are not satisfied with the explanation given by him (Sattar),” the bench said before accepting the unconditional apology with a rider. “The minister shall henceforth observe the principles of law and refrain from interfering with the quasi-judicial orders by exercising administrative powers and shall deal with the quasi-judicial orders only in consonance with the provisions of the statute and rules therein,” the bench said. Private firm Jayesh Infra had purchased a land vide registered sale deed in October 2020 following which a person, Mirza Yusuf Baig, filed an application with the tehsildar against the mutation entry. Notices were issued to Jayesh Infra and Mirza. A hearing was held and the tehsildar ruled in favour of Jayesh Infra in February this year. Mirza, without challenging the tehsildar’s order, directly applied to the MoS revenue on February 18, objecting to the order. Jayesh Infra’s lawyer Prasad Jarare brought to the HC’s notice that though there was no proceeding before the minister, the latter issued a single line order granting a stay to the tehsildar’s order. Acting on the minister’s order, the tehsildar stayed his own order under section 256 of the MLR Code and on the very same day a note was taken in the other rights column of the 7/12 extract related to the land. Jayesh Infra had moved the HC against this for an appropriate relief. Jarare told TOI, “Prior to the final hearing of the petition on July 30, the sub-divisional officer, who is the appellate authority for challenging the tehsildar’s order, passed a final order rejecting Mirza Yusuf Baig’s appeal. The order also specifies that the changes made in the 7/12 extract in pursuance to the order of minister shall also be removed immediately.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/revenue-minister-sattar-tenders-apology-to-hc/articleshow/85020051.cms||Mohammed Akhef

It was an initiative taken up by Belle Vue Clinic after the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission directed the hospital to arrange for lunch for the residents of Little Sisters of the Poor. The ruling came after a patient who was treated at the hospital for Covid in May this year lodged a complaint with the commission against misbehaviour by some nurses. The complainant, Kasturi Ghosh, had clearly told the commission that she did not want any compensation but the hospital should feed residents of an old-age home. Accordingly, commission’s chairperson Ashim Kumar Banerjee last Wednesday asked the hospital to treat the residents of Little Sisters of the Poor on its 2 AJC Bose Road campus. Representatives of the hospital visited the home on Friday to fix the menu for Tuesday’s lunch. Accordingly, 170 residents of the home, all above sixty, were treated with basmati rice pulao, boneless chicken, fish curry, paneer preparation, dal, vegetables and fruits prepared by a caterer. “Nurses spend more hours with patients than doctors. All I wanted was a little bit of empathy and care from them,” said Ghosh, who was present at the old-age home. Ghosh was treated for Covid for 21 days at the hospital between May and June this year. On Tuesday, the hospital took all the nurses who were posted on the floor where Ghosh got the treatment along with other senior nurses, including the super. The nurses even apologised to Ghosh. All the nurses said that they were under huge pressure during the peak of the pandemic. “It was during the peak Covid time. Some of the nurses may have been fatigued and unintentionally misbehaved with the patient. This is not desirable. And everyone is apologetic. This goes against what we have been taught and trained for. We have also apologised to her (Ghosh). And she is an extremely nice person and took the trouble to be with all of us today,” said a nurse. “The patient is a very well-behaved person and comes from a good background. This was an eye-opener for our nurses who have pledged never to misbehave with patients,” said Belle Vue CEO Pradip Tondon, who himself was present at the home. From the commission, doctors Maityree Banerjee and Madhavi Das made it to the home on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/misbehaviour-penalty-nurses-treat-for-seniors/articleshow/85017685.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Instead, the CBSE prepared the 2021 results of class 10 and 12 students on the basis of internal assessment. However, the meritorious students told TOI that it would have been better had the board conducted exams and that they were fully prepared to appear in the same. The students who scored well showed satisfaction towards the exam results. Three girl students of Sir Padampat Singhania Education Centre scored 99.8%. Navya Agarwal, Shweta Agarwal and Tavishi Agarwal scored 499 marks each. School principal, Bhawna Gupta congrtulated all the students.

The court gave this order on the contempt petition of temple priest Bhagwati Prasad Sharma. Sharma claimed in court that his ancestors used to do service (puja) in Jamwa Mata temple. After the dispute regarding performing puja, Sharma filed a claim in the court and requested not to obstruct the service worship of the temple as per the turn. The court had allowed the petitioner to perform puja according to his turn on October 4, 2017. It was said in the contempt application that from May 4 this year he had started performing service in the temple but the condemners did not allow him to enter the temple. The condemners said that this was done on the direction of Diya Kumari. They threatened to kill him and his son if the diktat was not followed. It was said in application that many times in the past too the condemners prevented him from entering the temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/notices-to-diya-kumari-11-others-over-temple-row/articleshow/85022362.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Shortage of Covishield continues in Aurangabad||Aurangabad: On Monday, due to shortage, no Covishield vaccine doses were administered within the municipal limits of Aurangabad, and the situation is unlikely to change on Tuesday. Dr Smita Nalgirkar, the immunization officer of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said a fresh supply of Covishield vaccines is unlikely to reach the city before Tuesday night. “Covaxin doses were administered at only a few centres on Monday due to the unavailability of Covishield stock. A similar practice would be adopted on Tuesday too — till Covishield doses are made available,” she said. The health authorities said they were solely dependant on the state government for the supply of vaccines, which, they said, is allotted to different states by the Centre. Many beneficiaries awaiting their first or second doses have expressed displeasure as the vaccination programme was set to witness a lean phase for the third consecutive day — given that Sunday is the official holiday for the immunization programme. “I had contracted Covid during the second half of March and am now waiting for my first dose. I had tried to get the vaccine in the recent past, but could not due to the rush at the vaccination sites and the shortage,” said Neeta Kulkarni, a homemaker. About nine private hospitals had undertaken the vaccination drive on Monday, but did not report significant footfall considering the pricing issue when compared to state-run vaccination sites where the doses are available for free. The total number of vaccinations in Aurangabad city had touched 5,90,205 by Monday. The number includes only 1,72,070 beneficiaries who are fully vaccinated, revealed official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/shortage-of-covishield-continues-in-aurangabad/articleshow/84983906.cms||---

The state government has been asking both GRMB and KRMB to hold full board meeting before organising the coordination committee meeting to decide further measures to take over all major and medium irrigation projects as per the notification issued by the ministry of Jal Shakti on July 15. Irrigation officials from AP attended the meetings. The coordination committee meetings are being organised by the GRMB and KRMB with members from both Telangana and AP irrigation officials, Transco and Genco officials, representatives from ministry of Jal Shakti and Boards. Succumbing to the pressure from the Telangana government, both the Boards, especially KRMB, reportedly agreed to hold a full board meeting in the second week of August. Telangana engineer-in-chief C Muralidhar in his letter to KRMB on Tuesday said the matter related to notification of jurisdiction of projects in Krishna basin was an issue having serious consequences on the states and must be decided in a full board meeting. Sources said, the AP officials have raised some concerns over the recent gazette notification on jurisdiction of both Krishna River Management Board and Godavari River Management Board||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/upset-t-skips-1st-co-ordination-meet-over-godavari-krishna-boards-row/articleshow/85022415.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Chandigarh||UT goes online to speed up vaccination drive||Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: The UT health department has started using an online platform to connect with organisations who want vaccination drives in their areas. “We will leave no stone unturned to reach 100% coverage this August 15. Therefore, we have started reaching out to people and organisations through online applications,” said director, health services, UT, Dr Amandeep Kang. More than 95% of the eligible population has been given the first dose. “Before the third wave, we would have covered all. We are using all resources, including ward-wise section of people, RWAs for group societies and NGOs to reach out to the specially-abled and those without any identity documents,” she said. The DHS also operates a social media handle. “Anyone who is interested in getting vaccination camps organised, can write and after details, we will arrange things,” said the DHS. “The UT health department has been claiming negative vaccine wastage. “We have been getting allocation of vaccines on time as we have minimum wastage and upload information on time in the portal,” she said. Kang claimed that good management had led to better results. “The UT health department has hardly faced a vaccine crisis where the sites had to be closed. We followed age-wise and category-wise beneficiaries’ schedule as announced from time to time. That is the reason why despite some initial hiccups, we were able to cover more as compared to the adjoining districts and are closer to our target,” said the DHS. Area councillors are also being involved in gathering people from their areas for vaccination. “This is on the pattern of election campaign as we want the city to lead in vaccination coverage,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-goes-online-to-speed-up-vaccination-drive/articleshow/85017729.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The department has already identified eight hectares of land along the Ganga in the Kankhal area of the holy town for the purpose. According to the plan, the forest will have a seven-kilometre-long track for joggers, a park for kids, and a herbal medicine garden, among others. For the past few months, the forest department has been conducting a massive plantation drive in the area. Elaborating on the department's plans for the city forest, Neeraj Sharma, divisional forest officer, Haridwar division, told TOI, “It will be the first such project in Haridwar. The city forest will spread awareness regarding the Ganga eco-system and the biodiversity of the region among locals and tourists. The tender process for the fencing of the identified land has been completed and construction work will start soon.” He added, “The location of the city forest has been chosen strategically. It will not take much time for the locals to reach here and the forest will also be easily accessible to the tourists using the Haridwar-Delhi highway.” Entry to the city forest will be free of charge, according to the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/haridwar-to-get-its-first-city-forest-along-ganga/articleshow/85015086.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Dehradun||Wildlife enthusiasts up in arms over elimination of two man-eaters in a week||Dehradun: The elimination of two man-eater leopards — one in Tehri Garhwal and one in Rudraprayag — within a week and the subsequent celebratory social media posts, comprising clips and images, have drawn the ire of wildlife enthusiasts in the state. Gauri Maulekhi, an animal rights activist, has sent a letter to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) on Tuesday, accusing the Uttarakhand forest department of displaying an ‘utter disregard’ towards the tenets of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and the SOP issued by the NTCA for termination of the man-eaters. The five-page letter includes the Facebook post by a local representative who not only took credit for getting the leopard eliminated swiftly but also showered praises upon the forest department-appointed hunter. Another such post, comprising images of a dead big cat, has also found space in Maulekhi’s letter. The activist has questioned the entire exercise of leopard elimination while adding that an appropriate number of experts and veterinarians were not involved. Maulekhi has sought a probe into the killing of the three man-eaters. Meanwhile, JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department, told TOI, “Our priority is to tranquilise such animals with the support of all the experts. However, in these two cases, we have concrete evidence that the big cats had turned man-eaters. During the autopsy, human hairs were found in their belly.” He added, “As for the celebratory posts, there are strict guidelines to not upload photos of the neutralised animal or the firearm used to eliminate them to social media platforms. For instance, if a forest department-appointed hunter flaunts his killing on social media, we blacklist him.” So far, seven man-eater leopards have been eliminated this year. In the most recent case, a man-eater leopard, who had killed a toddler, was neutralised in Rudraprayag’s Silla Baman village on July 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/wildlife-enthusiasts-up-in-arms-over-elimination-of-two-man-eaters-in-a-week/articleshow/85015057.cms||Shivani Azad

The booking for these slots, at five vaccination centres, were opened at 12 noon. Vaccination for younger population will now resume from Wednesday. For the last three months, inoculation drive for those in the age group of 18 to 44 was stopped due to shortage of doses and preference was given to fully vaccinate the elderly population. Meanwhile, slots for vaccination at 14 centres identified in rural areas of the district were not opened on Tuesday. Health officials claim vaccination for younger population in rural district is also expected to start from Wednesday. “The booking of slots was opened on the CoWin protal for the first dose of Covishield. This time, no in-person registration was allowed,” Amol Mane, Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s vaccination nodal officer, said. “We have made 200 doses available at each of the five centres in the city. On Thursday, the slots for all 11 centres in the city will be opened for 18 to 44 years age group,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vax-slots-for-18-44-age-group-booked-in-10-mins/articleshow/85020086.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Jump in monsoon-related ailments like malaria, lepto in July, compared to June||MUMBAI: Torrential rain in July saw a host of monsoon-related ailments like malaria, leptospirosis, gastroenteritis, dengue and influenza H1N1 register a spurt, compared to June. Malaria cases jumped from 357 in June to 557 in July. Many hospitals in the city marked a jump in hospitalisation due to malaria and dengue in the past month. Wards like E (Byculla, Mazgaon), G south (Prabhadevi) and pockets in western suburbs that have been hotspots reported most cases. Civic officials said accumulation of rain water at Metro construction sites contributed to increased breeding. Dengue, caused by aedes aegypti mosquitoes, saw confirmed cases rise from 12 in June to 28 in July. But the city typically sees a higher incidence in August-September. “Citizens should watch for symptoms such as sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, muscle and joint pains and retro orbital pain or pain on eye movements, abdominal pain and skin rash,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, adding that people should consult a doctor quickly if the symptoms appear. Around 21 cases of influenza H1N1, previously called swine flu, were detected in July. In June, six cases of the viral disease were detected. Last July, when the city started dealing with the pandemic, there was no case of H1N1. Doctors believe few patients were recommended for H1N1 test as all services were catering to testing and tracking Covid cases. Gastroenteritis too saw a jump, as 294 cases were recorded in July, up from 180 in June. The enteric disease that had traditionally filled up wards in city hospitals had all but disappeared from Mumbai last July, when only 56 cases were reported. In a non-pandemic year like 2019, the city had 994 cases. A civic official said the lockdown was more stringent last July, when no street food stalls operated. The only monsoon disease to have claimed a life this year is leptospirosis. BMC said one person succumbed to the bacterial disease. Cases rose to 31 in July, from 15 in June. Wading through water-logged areas makes one vulnerable to this infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jump-in-monsoon-related-ailments-like-malaria-lepto-in-july-compared-to-june/articleshow/85020126.cms||---

---||Mumbai||CBSE X success rate in Maharashtra almost perfect 99.9%, 58,000 join 90% club||MUMBAI: CBSE Class X students in Maharashtra bettered their performance in the pandemic with a 99.92% success rate — higher than 99.04% nationally. The results declared on Monday brought cheer to Mumbai students, who did not attend a single day in school. Their counterparts in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), including Thane, Raigad and Palghar, were lucky to enjoy some school days early this year. Most schools in the MMR had 45-55% students securing over 90% marks. Across Maharashtra, 57,826 students got above 90%, a 38% jump compared to last year. Out of the 308 children in R N Podar School, 116 scored over 95% and 192 between 90% and 95%. “Our results are in line with the reference year. We had 35 more students than the reference year. Though the results are really good, we could not accommodate the additional candidates in the 95%-plus bracket. Had there been a written exam, we could have probably scored better,” said Suman Samarth, headmistress of the school. As scaling down of marks to fit into the reference year was a requirement of the assessment methodology adopted, schools in MMR could not give a 100% to students. “In some states, students have got 100% if they have done exceptionally well. In Mumbai, though we had students whose performance was exceedingly good, the board link did not allow us to touch 100%,” said a principal. At Orchids International School, Thane, Goral Mashru secured 498/500 (99.6%) with perfect 100 in four subjects. Principal Madhuri Sagale said the student was consistent throughout and the scores are a testimony to that.” Over 44% of her students scored 90% and above. Pune region, in which Maharashtra falls, retained its fourth position with 99.92% success rate. Last year, it was 98.1%. Thiruvananthapuram stayed on top for the second consecutive year with a success rate of 99.99%. Last year, CBSE had conducted all Class X exams, except for students in north-east Delhi. “If you compare last year’s results with this year, it can be safely said that the scores would have been similar had there been an exam this year,” said a principal. She said despite evaluation being done by schools, the jump in success rate in Maharashtra was only 2%. On the other hand, in Maharashtra, over 900 students had secured a perfect 100%, which is unrealistic, she added. Vibgyor School has five students who got over 95%. At Bal Bharati Public School, 100 of the 191 students got 90% and above. This, said principal Kalpana Dwivedi, would have been the case even in case of exams. In Maharashtra, a good chunk of the 82,504 students who passed have already begun their Class XI studies in their respective schools. “Last year, around 30% students merged into the state board for Class XI. With uncertainty over admissions, parents wanted children to continue in their schools,” said a principal. Ryan International School, Sanpada, has 95 students who scored more than 90% and at its Panvel campus, 94 of the total 281. The results of two Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) in the Maharashtra zone, KV, Powai, and Bosco KV1, Goa, were not declared. Overall, KV schools had a pass percentage of 100% followed by Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas with 99.99%. Over 17,000 or 0.84% students have been placed in the compartment. They can take physical exam from August 16 with 36,841 private students.

The backlog for Covaxin second shots had built up to close to 2.5 lakh doses, which was cleared after the state received about 5.3 lakh doses of the Indian vaccine last week. “The second dose backlog was mainly for Covaxin. Now with better stock in our hands, vaccination centres have been told to offer the first jab of this vaccine as well. That backlog is now almost clear,” said a state health department official. Some sites offering Covaxin had to be shut for a few days two weeks ago as the state ran out of the vials after two scheduled deliveries failed. Even after the supply resumed, the vaccination centres were told to keep the shots aside only for the pending second doses till further notice. KMC health officials pointed out that the overall rate of second dose vaccination had significantly improved in the past two weeks. “We were lagging behind in administering the second doses of both Covishield and Covaxin due to an acute shortage even a month ago. The scene was particularly bad for Covaxin recipients as the stocks had dried up as a result of which we had to shut some centres. Now, the supply has improved significantly and we have sent considerable number of Covaxin vials to our clinics to compensate for the loss,” a civic health official said. He added that even three weeks ago, Covaxin second dose backlog stood at 50,000. The KMC health data showed the civic body had enhanced the supply of Covaxin second doses to its vaccination centres from 100 earlier to 250 a day. KMC-run mega vaccination centres, too, are receiving heightened Covaxin supply, that of 300 to 400 doses a day. Among the192 KMCrun Covid vaccination clinics across 144 wards, 38 administer Covaxin only. This apart, 10 mega centres administer Covaxin doses exclusively. In case of Covishied second doses, the renewed push by the KMC health department is fast bridging the backlog gap. The allocation for 155 KMC vaccination clinics administering Covishield only has been augmented. “We are now getting a steady supply of 200 doses daily. A month ago, the supply had dipped to 100. Sometimes, it varied between100 and150. Now, we hope to clear the backlog by the middle of next month if the supply remains steady,” said a KMC executive health officer. KMC administers Covishield from several mega centres, too. On Tuesday morning, the state had 21 lakh Covishield doses in its hands, while another 3.72 lakh shots arrived during the day. “We should be able to vaccinated about 3 lakh doses comfortably for the next four to five days,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. The next lot of vaccine is supposed to arrive on August 8. On Monday, 4 lakh-plus doses were administered. On Tuesday, too, the state had logged 4 lakh-plus doses for the day till reports last came in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-clears-most-of-2-5l-covaxin-2nd-dose-backlog-after-5-3l-shots-arrive/articleshow/85020173.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The facility is to store the biospecimens include blood, serum, tissue samples obtained during open-heart surgery and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and genomic DNA collected from heart failure patients for research purposes. Heart failure (HF) is emerging as a major health problem in the country, with a reported mortality of nearly 60%, which is higher than many common cancers. Indian patients are younger by 10 years and have more co-morbidities, said the principal investigator of the project, Dr Harikrishnan S. The HF field needs more research, and this prompted the ICMR to initiate the National Center for Advanced Research and Excellence in HF, (CARE-HF) at SCTIMST with a funding of Rs 5 Crores. One of the major components of the project is the development of the Heart Failure Biobank. With a fund allocation of Rs 85 lakhs, many state-of-the-art storage facilities are set up in the HF Biobank at SCTIMST, he said. The storage facilities include -4, -20, -80-degree freezers and a liquid nitrogen storage system which can store bio-samples at – 140 degrees for years. Currently, there is a facility to store nearly 25,000 biosamples. The biobank activity is supervised by a Technical Advisory Committee with a member from ICMR. "The biobanks are an important resource containing collections of high-quality biological human samples that can be used to understand molecular pathways, and to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of heart failure,’’ said Prof Ajitkumar V K, director SCTIMST. Prof Balram Bhargava, secretary DHR and DG, ICMR, will virtually inaugurate the biobank on Thursday, along with messages from Prof Ashutosh Sharma, secretary department of science and technology, and Dr V K Saraswat, president of SCTIMST and member-NITI Aayog. The bio-specimens will be collected after taking consent from patients. The de-identified samples stored and catalogued will be linked to clinical data such as physiological measures, imaging data like ECG, Echocardiography MRI and follow-up data. Researchers and clinicians interested in research related to HF can join collaborative research programmes with the HF programme at the SCTIMST. The research proposal has to follow all the ethical guidelines and should be approved by the TAC and Ethics Committee of SCTIMST.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sree-chitra-to-have-indias-first-heart-failure-biobank/articleshow/85017757.cms||---

Major problems are being faced in centres where authorities are not uploading data on the spot. Later, it causes mismatch with original data. Data is not uploaded due to overcrowding, shortage of staff, network failures and technical glitches etc. Authorities have appealed to residents to bring the same identity card and provide the same mobile number which was given at the time of their first dose. Officials said a dedicated team is working to motivate people who are not coming forward for their second dose. The team makes around 500 calls to such persons every day. Team members said some of these people are vaccinated but accurate data has not been uploaded while many have changed their registered mobile numbers and are unable to connect. To boost the vaccination drive, senior health department officials said they have prepared a roster of employees for next month in advance and have enough vaccine stock to cater to beneficiaries. Officials said they have 18,430 Covishield and 12,510 Covaxin vials available with them at present. Box: Shift timing extended To slot time for beneficiaries on COWIN portal, urban health facilities in Panchkula, which were operating a single shift of 12 noon to 3pm will now function from 9am to 3pm. No beneficiary visiting a Covid vaccination centre would be refused vaccination. Other facilities working in shifts round the clock will continue with the existing routine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pkl-health-dept-struggles-to-maintain-accurate-vaccination-data/articleshow/85017749.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

The winger joined Churchill Bros from Sesa Football Academy in 2009 and went on to win the I-League in 2012-13 and later the IFA Shield. Last season, he came close to adding another I-League title, but Churchill were forced to settle for the runnersup spot on the final matchday. “Israil is such a good player,” Churchill Brothers CEO Valanka Alemao told TOI on Wednesday. “Words will fall short to describe him. His dedication and contribution to the club is immense. He was very loyal to the club, standing by thick and thin. He won everything on offer here.” Israil made a name for himself with his runs and sharp crosses from the flanks. He was good at set pieces too. In between, Israil did have stints at other clubs, and it were his performances with Pune City FC in the Indian Super League that made everyone take notice. He did join Portuguese second division side Vitoria de Guimaraes B on loan from Pune during the 2015 winter transfer window, but injury and delay in visa meant he lost valuable time to impress in Europe. After his two-year stint at Pune he joined DSK Shivajians for a season in 2015-16 and later rejoined Churchill where he remained an integral part for the next four editions. “He was a role model for the youngsters and groomed them well. Some players often score goals and think they have become stars overnight. But Israil was different and continued to work hard. He takes good care of his diet and fitness. That's why age is just a number for him,” said Valanka. The 32-year-old had made up his mind at the start of last season to look for a new challenge and is now weighing up his options. “Churchill is always in my heart. It is the club I love the most and I am always there for them in future. I’m looking at offers where I will feel comfortable, just as I did at Churchill,” Israil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/israil-quits-churchill-for-new-challenge/articleshow/85052163.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

---||Kolkata||Police extend helping hand to New Town locals||Kolkata: From meeting residents to know about encroachment and illegal parking woes near their houses to seeking their opinions on enhancing the safety and security in the township following the recent cases of snatching and thefts, Bidhannagar police have taken outreach programmes to a more personal level by calling locals for discussions on all major issues in their areas. Senior police officers meet the representatives of different residents’ associations at least twice every week, apart from responding to their queries over WhatsApp or phone calls — a gesture unheard in most parts of the city, according to the residents. “At places like Nagerbazar, where I had spent a long time, we could never imagine that we would be able to talk to the police over the issues like illegal parking, excessive honking or blaring of loudspeakers till late evening. But after coming over here, we have seen how cops are empathetic to these issues. It is extremely appreciative,” said Ankur Roy Chowdhury, a New Town resident and a functionary of a local NGO that deals with residents’ issues. New Town has three police stations — New Town, Eco Park and Techno City. The officers of all three police stations are part of multiple residents’ WhatsApp groups and they regularly interact with them as well. “In other parts of the city, residents think twice before approaching cops for something even when it comes to reporting the loss of a mobile phone. But here, several issues get solved simply over WhatsApp texts. We can also call the officers at different odd hours and they respond promptly,” said Subrata Saha, the joint secretary of Rail Vihar Complex Residents association. A joint effort by the residents of this complex and cops had helped a UK- based backpacker, apparently untraced by her family, to get reunited with them again. Bishop Sarkar, the deputy commissioner, New Town division of Bidhannagar Police, however, attributed the change in approach to the residents rather than the cops themselves. “The residents are more proactive in approaching us. We are happy to help,” said Sarkar, a former corporate official-turned-IPS officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-extend-helping-hand-to-new-town-locals/articleshow/85017760.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

It coincided with the centenary celebrations of the state legislature. While AIADMK boycotted the event alleging “distortion” of history, saying it was not the centenary year, its allies, the BJP represented by TN chief K Annamalai, the PMK and TMC participated. The President credited the Tamil Nadu legislature with nurturing the roots of democracy by focusing on governance to uplift the poor and purge the social evils. He showered encomiums on the late DMK patriarch Karunanidhi saying his “entire life was devoted to the cause of people in the state” and that he had left a defining stamp on Tamil Nadu.  “It would not be wrong to say that this legislature became the fountainhead of many progressive legislations which were subsequently replicated across the country to empower the weaker sections of society and strengthen democracy,” said Kovind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/karunanidhi-left-a-defining-stamp-on-tn-says-president/articleshow/85025288.cms||---

Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC said the opening has been postponed by about two weeks’ time since the completion of a road providing access to the station from a part of the nearby localities is pending. “A portion of a vital road link connecting Khaira Mor with Gopal Nagar had to be blocked for heavy vehicles due to the construction work on the reversal facility beyond Dhansa Bus Stand station,” Dayal said. “However, following the completion of tunnelling work in the reversal area, the road is now being restored and will be ready soon,” he added. The DMRC spokesperson said the date of inauguration of the Najafgarh-Dhansa Bus Stand section would be intimated shortly following completion of the pending work.
