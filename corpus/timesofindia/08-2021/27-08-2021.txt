The high court had issued the order while hearing a PIL pertaining to OFC cables and other wires dangling dangerously. In a notification dated August 23, BBMP said if any cable TV operator or internet service provider fails to remove the illegally drawn wires and cables, the civic agency will remove them without prior notice and initiate legal action. Over the past nine years, BBMP has granted permission for installing a 12,274-km length of OFC cables across the city. It has levied a penalty of Rs 37.7 crore for illegal installation of cables during the same period. Mahadevapura zone accounts for the highest quantity of illegal cables removed and they span a length of 312km. In the west zone, illegal cables of 182km length have been removed. “Hanging OFC cables and wires are a big threat to people, as they can be hazardous if they come in contact with live wires. Many times, OFC cable operators take permission for a certain distance and later violate it, which we are not aware of until citizens point that out,” a BBMP official said. The official denied that permission has been granted to cable TV operators. “Cable TV operators never reach out to BBMP for help. They do things according to their whims and fancies. This order will now help us crack down on them,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bbmp-sets-1-month-deadline-to-remove-illegal-cables-wires/articleshow/85668257.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Notably, three saroop of SGGS were flown in from Kabul in an evacuation flight along with stranded Afghan Sikhs and Hindus on August 24. The saroop were carried from the aircraft by Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan and senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader RP Singh on their heads as par Sikh rehat maryada (Sikh code of religious conduct) He said the central government would not only evacuate the remaining Afghan Hindu and Sikhs from Afghanistan but would also bring back other saroop of SGGS as well as idols of Hindu deities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-offered-thanksgiving-prayer-for-safely-bringing-saroop-of-sri-guru-granth-sahib-from-afghanistan/articleshow/85667848.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||World||Explainer: How dangerous is Afghanistan's Islamic State?||NEW DELHI: The US and other western nations helping to evacuate Afghans desperate to flee Taliban rule are bracing for more attacks after Islamic State struck the crowded gates of Kabul airport on Thursday, killing scores of civilians and at least 13 American troops. Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), an affiliate of militants who previously battled US forces in Syria and Iraq, claimed responsibility for the attack. Islamic State (ISIS) said one of its suicide bombers targeted "translators and collaborators with the American army". President Joe Biden, his voice breaking with emotion, vowed on Thursday the United States would hunt down those responsible for twin explosions at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan and said he had asked the Pentagon to develop plans to strike back at them. "We will not forgive, we will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay," Biden said in remarks at the White House. Biden promised US evacuations would continue. Here is all you need to know about the Islamic State in Afghanistan: What is Islamic State Khorasan?Months after the Islamic State declared a caliphate in Iraq and Syria in 2014, breakaway fighters from the Pakistani Taliban joined militants in Afghanistan to form a regional chapter, pledging allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The Afghanistan affiliate takes its name from the Khorasan Province, a region that covered much of Afghanistan, Iran and central Asia in the Middle Ages. ISIS-K was officially founded in January 2015. Who are the Islamic State Khorasan fighters?The group started as several hundred Pakistani Taliban fighters, who took refuge across the border in Afghanistan after military operations drove them out of their home country. Other, like-minded extremists joined them there, including disgruntled Afghan Taliban fighters unhappy with what they - unlike the West - saw as the Taliban's overly moderate and peaceful ways. As the Taliban pursued peace talks with the United States in recent years, discontented Taliban increasingly moved to the more extremist Islamic State, swelling its numbers. Most were frustrated that the Taliban was pursuing negotiations with the US at a time when they thought the movement was on the march to a military win. The group also has attracted a significant cadre from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, from a neighboring country; fighters from Iran's only Sunni Muslim majority province; and members of the Turkistan Islamic Party comprising Uighurs from China's northeast. Many were attracted to the Islamic State's violent and extreme ideology, including promises of a caliphate to unite the Islamic world, a goal never espoused by the Taliban. What makes them a leading threat?The Islamic State group in Afghanistan and Pakistan has embraced the Islamic State's call for a worldwide jihad against non-Muslims. The Center for International and Strategic Studies counts dozens of attacks that Islamic State fighters have launched against civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including minority Shia Muslims, as well as hundreds of clashes with Afghan, Pakistani and US-led coalition forces since January 2017. The group has yet to conduct attacks against the US homeland, the US government believes it represents a chronic threat to US and allied interests in South and Central Asia. Beyond bombings and massacres, IS-Khorasan has failed to hold any territory in the region, suffering huge losses because of Taliban and US-led military operations. According to UN and US military assessments, after the phase of heavy defeats IS-Khorasan now operates largely through covert cells based in or near cities to carry out high-profile attacks. Latest estimates of its strength vary from several thousand active fighters to as low as 500, according to a UN Security Council report released last month. What is ISIS-K's relationship with Taliban?The ISIS-K and Taliban are enemies. While intelligence officials believe al-Qaida fighters are integrated among the Taliban, the Taliban, by contrast, have waged major, coordinated offensives against the Islamic State group in Afghanistan. Taliban insurgents at times joined with both the US and US-backed Afghan government forces to rout the Islamic State from parts of Afghanistan's northeast. Islamic State had been highly critical of the deal last year between Washington and the Taliban that led to the agreement for withdrawing foreign troops, accusing the latter of abandoning the jihadist cause. In a sign of the enmity between the two jihadist groups, IS statements have referred to the Taliban as apostates. ISIS-K brands the Afghan Taliban as "filthy nationalists" with ambitions only to form a government confined to the boundaries of Afghanistan. This contradicts the Islamic State movement's goal of establishing a global caliphate. Following the Taliban's lightning takeover of Afghanistan, a number of jihadist groups around the world congratulated them -- but not Islamic State. One IS commentary published after the fall of Kabul accused the Taliban of betraying jihadists with the US withdrawal deal and vowed to continue its fight, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors militant communications. A US defense department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was working covertly, said previously that the Trump administration had sought its 2020 withdrawal deal with the Taliban partly in hopes of joining forces with them against the Islamic State affiliate. The administration saw that group as the real threat to the American homeland. What is the risk now?Even when the United States had combat troops, aircraft and armed drones stationed on the ground in Afghanistan to monitor and strike the Islamic State, Islamic State militants were able to keep up attacks despite suffering thousands of casualties, Amira Jadoon and Andrew Mines note in a report for West Point's Combating Terrorism Center. In the short term, ISIS-K will likely continue its efforts to sow panic and chaos, disrupt the withdrawal process and demonstrate that the Afghan Taliban are incapable of providing security to the population. If the group is able to reconstitute some level of territorial control in the longer term and recruit more fighters, it will most likely be poised to make a comeback and pose threats on the national, regional and international levels. The withdrawal is depriving the United States of its on-the-ground strike capacity in Afghanistan, and threatens to weaken its ability to track the Islamic State and its attack planning as well. Biden officials say the Islamic State group is only one of many terror threats it is dealing with globally. They insist they can manage it with so-called over-the-horizon military and intelligence assets, based in Gulf states, on aircraft carriers, or other more distant sites.

These are findings of a recent study conducted by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).  According to the study “Water Inefficient Power”, even after six years, the water-guzzling coal-powered industry is ignoring the 2015 water-consumption regulations with a high degree of non-compliance.  Counted amongst the most water-intensive industries in the country, the coal power sector is responsible for about 70% of the total freshwater withdrawal by all industries. Indian power plants with cooling towers consume twice as much water as their global counterparts, says the report.  According to the 2015 norms (revised again in 2018), plants installed before January 1, 2017, are required to meet a specific water-consumption limit of 3.5 cubic metres of water per MWh; while those installed after have to meet the norm of 3 cubic metres of water per MWh, apart from adopting zero-liquid discharge.  Additionally, all freshwater-based plants are required to install cooling towers and subsequently achieve the norm of 3.5 cubic metres of water per MWh. All sea water-based plants were exempted from meeting the norms.  The deadline to meet the water norms was December 2017, which has long passed. The water norms for coal power plants were introduced in 2015, along with the emission norms. Though the emission-norm timelines for the sector were revised twice by the ministry, once in 2017 and more recently in 2021, the issue of compliance and implementation of water norms has been completely overlooked.  Nivit Kumar Yadav, programme director, Industrial Pollution unit of CSE, says this is happening at a time when many power producing regions of the country are facing acute water shortages. “Also, there is huge water pollution due to the power plants’ effluent discharge.”  The CSE surveyed over 154 GW of total coal power capacity and found about 50% of the freshwater-based plants to be non-complying. Most of these plants belong to state-owned companies.  The CSE survey has found that old and inefficient once-through cooling water-based plants in India continue to operate without installing cooling towers. These plants are not just flouting the water norms, but also the emission norms, says the survey.  Built before 1999, all once-through-based power plants in India are old and polluting. Many of these plants were identified for retirement, but have not yet retired. They continue to operate, with no plans to upgrade or install either emission control equipment or cooling towers.  “Allowing these old plants to continue to pollute water cannot be an option. Plants identified for retirement must be closed down immediately if they have no plans to retrofit or to install emission-control technologies and/or cooling towers,” says Sugandha Arora, deputy programme manager of the Industrial Pollution unit of CSE.  The CSE survey has also found several loopholes in the self-reported data and data formats being followed across states to report specific water consumption.  As per CSE’s recent estimates, about 48% of India’s existing coal power fleet is located in water-scarce districts like Barmer and Baran in Rajasthan.  Yadav says this sector has a massive water footprint and therefore, all efforts must be made to mitigate this impact. “There is huge scope of reducing the sector’s water demand by ensuring implementation of the 2015 standards and addressing the challenges related to accurate reporting of data, old inefficient once-through cooling plants and implementing zero discharge in newer plants. If implemented rigorously, the standards can drastically reduce overall water consumption of the sector and will make Indian plants water-efficient.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/50-of-countrys-freshwater-based-coal-powered-plants-flout-consumption-emission-norms-study/articleshow/85670095.cms||Neel Kamal

At least 60 Afghans and 13 US troops were killed, Afghan and the United States officials said. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack outside the Kabul airport, the group's Amaq News Agency said on its Telegram channel. The IS affiliate in Afghanistan is far more radical than the Taliban who recently took control of the country in a lightning blitz and condemned the attack. The US officials said 11 Marines and one Navy medic were among those who died. They said another 12 service members were wounded and warned the toll could grow. More than 140 Afghans were wounded, an Afghan official said.  One of the bombers struck people standing knee-deep in a wastewater canal under the sweltering sun, throwing bodies into the fetid water. Those who moments earlier had hoped to get on flights out could be seen carrying the wounded to ambulances in a daze, their own clothes darkened with blood. Western officials had warned of a major attack, urging people to leave the airport, but that advice went largely unheeded by Afghans desperate to escape the country in the last few days of an American-led evacuation before the US officially ends its 20-year presence on August 31.  Emergency, an Italian charity that operates hospitals in Afghanistan, said it had received at least 60 patients wounded in the airport attack, in addition to 10 who were dead when they arrived.  "Surgeons will be working into the night," said Marco Puntin, the charity's manager in Afghanistan. The wounded overflowed the triage zone into the physiotherapy area and more beds were being added, he said.  The Afghan official who confirmed the overall Afghan toll spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief media.  Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said one explosion was near an airport entrance and another was a short distance away by a hotel.  Even as the area was hit, evacuation flights continued to take off from Kabul airport.  Adam Khan was waiting nearby when he saw the first explosion outside what's known as the Abbey gate. He said several people appeared to have been killed or wounded, including some who were maimed.  The second blast was at or near Baron Hotel, where many people, including Afghans, Britons and Americans, were told to gather in recent days before heading to the airport for evacuation.  A former Royal Marine who runs an animal shelter in Afghanistan says he and his staff were caught up in the aftermath of the blast near the airport.  "All of a sudden we heard gunshots and our vehicle was targeted, had our driver not turned around he would have been shot in the head by a man with an AK-47," Paul "Pen" Farthing told Britain's Press Association news agency.  Farthing is trying to get staff of his Nowzad charity out of Afghanistan, along with the group's rescued animals.  He is among thousands trying to flee. Over the last week, the airport has been the scene of some of the most searing images of the chaotic end of America's longest war and the Taliban's takeover, as flight after flight took off carrying those who fear a return to the militants' brutal rule. When the Taliban were last in power, they confined women largely to their home and widely imposed draconian restrictions.  Already, some countries have ended their evacuations and begun to withdraw their soldiers and diplomats, signaling the beginning of the end of one of history's largest airlifts. The Taliban have insisted foreign troops must be out by America's self-imposed deadline of Aug. 31 - and the evacuations must end then, too.  In Washington, US President Joe Biden spent much of the morning in the secure White House Situation Room where he was briefed on the explosions and conferred with his national security team and commanders on the ground in Kabul.  Overnight, warnings emerged from Western capitals about a threat from IS, which has seen its ranks boosted by the Taliban's freeing of prisoners during its advance through Afghanistan.  Shortly before the attack, the acting U.S. ambassador to Kabul, Ross Wilson, said the security threat at the Kabul airport overnight was "clearly regarded as credible, as imminent, as compelling." But in an interview with ABC News, he would not give details.  Late Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy warned citizens at three airport gates to leave immediately due to an unspecified security threat. Australia, Britain and New Zealand also advised their citizens Thursday not to go to the airport.  Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied that any attack was imminent at the airport, where the group's fighters have deployed and occasionally used heavy-handed tactics to control the crowds. After the attack, he appeared to shirk blame, noting the airport is controlled by U.S. troops.  Before the blast, the Taliban sprayed a water cannon at those gathered at one airport gate to try to drive the crowd away, as someone launched tear gas canisters elsewhere.  Nadia Sadat, a 27-year-old Afghan, carried her 2-year-old daughter with her outside the airport. She and her husband, who had worked with coalition forces, missed a call from a number they believed was the State Department and were trying to get into the airport without any luck. Her husband had pressed ahead in the crowd to try to get them inside.  "We have to find a way to evacuate because our lives are in danger," Sadat said. "My husband received several threatening messages from unknown sources. We have no chance except escaping."  Aman Karimi, 50, escorted his daughter and her family to the airport, fearful the Taliban would target her because of her husband's work with NATO.  "The Taliban have already begun seeking those who have worked with NATO," he said. "They are looking for them house-by-house at night."  The Sunni extremists of IS, with links to the group's more well-known affiliate in Syria and Iraq, have carried out a series of brutal attacks, mainly targeting Afghanistan's Shiite Muslim minority, including a 2020 assault on a maternity hospital in Kabul in which they killed women and infants.  The Taliban have fought against Islamic State militants in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have wrested back control nearly 20 years after they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion. The Americans went in following the 9/11 attacks, which al-Qaida orchestrated while being sheltered by the group.  Amid the warnings and the pending American withdrawal, Canada ended its evacuations, and European nations halted or prepared to stop their own operations.  "The reality on the ground is the perimeter of the airport is closed. The Taliban have tightened the noose. It's very, very difficult for anybody to get through at this point," Canadian General Wayne Eyre, the country's acting Chief of Defense Staff, said ahead of the attack.  Lt. Col. Georges Eiden, Luxembourg's army representative in neighboring Pakistan, said that Friday would mark the official end for U.S. allies. But two Biden administration officials denied that was the case.  A third official said that the US worked with its allies to coordinate each country's departure, and some nations asked for more time and were granted it.  "Most depart later in the week," he said, while adding that some were stopping operations Thursday. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the information publicly.  Danish Defense Minister Trine Bramsen bluntly warned earlier: "It is no longer safe to fly in or out of Kabul."  Denmark's last flight has already departed, and Poland and Belgium have also announced the end of their evacuations. The Dutch government said it had been told by the U.S. to leave Thursday.  But Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said some planes would continue to fly.  "Evacuation operations in Kabul will not be wrapping up in 36 hours. We will continue to evacuate as many people as we can until the end of the mission," he said in a tweet.  The Taliban have said they'll allow Afghans to leave via commercial flights after the deadline next week, but it remains unclear which airlines would return to an airport controlled by the militants. Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said talks were underway between his country and the Taliban about allowing Turkish civilian experts to help run the facility.

Children also died in the attack, believed to have been carried out by Isis (Islamic State) when two suicide bombers detonated their devices. One went off near Abbey Gate where US and British forces are stationed. A second blast went off at the Baron hotel. This was followed by other attackers opening gunfire on civilians and the military. More than 140 people are said to have been injured including 15 US service members. UK Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab said: “This evening I called US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, to express our sorrow that US troops lost their lives in Kabul today and that more have been injured. They paid the ultimate sacrifice while helping others reach safety. I also want to extend my condolences to the families of all those Afghans killed or injured. It is tragic that as they sought safety they have suffered at the hands of terrorists. " He said the attack was a "stark reminder" of the dangerous situation in which UK military and civilian personnel have been working to evacuate people. "We should be proud of their bravery and what they have achieved. The UK and US remain resolute in our mission to get as many people out as possible. It is testament to the remarkable courage of our personnel that they continue to do so while under fire. We will not let the cowardly acts of terrorists stop us.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-foreign-secretary-dominic-raab-expresses-sorrow-over-loss-of-us-troops-in-kabul/articleshow/85670980.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||Hours after terror attack warning, blasts outside Kabul airport kill 25||Two explosions, suspected to be the handiwork of suicide bombers, took place outside Kabul airport late Thursday evening, killing at least 20, including a few US Marines, and wounding many other people. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby described the bombings as a “complex attack that resulted in a number of US and civilian casualties”. The explosions, one of them outside Hamid Karzai Airport’s Abbey Gate, took place while efforts by Western forces to evacuate as many people as possible ahead of an August 31 deadline were underway. Some estimates put the toll as high as 40 dead. Four US Marines were killed, The Wall Street Journal reported. The target was a sea of people desperate to catch a flight out of Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. According to the US and UK authorities, there had been an an imminent threat of a terrorist attack by the Islamic State affiliate IS-K (Islamic State of Khorasan). A hospital in Kabul said more than 60 wounded had been brought there for treatment. US embassy sources and other witnesses said the explosions had been followed by gunfire. The Taliban, who quickly condemned the attacks and said they had occurred in an area controlled by the US military, added that at least 13 people, including children and Taliban guards, had been killed in the explosions. Hours before the suicide bombing, the UK, US and Australian governments had updated their travel advice to avoid Kabul airport due to an ongoing and high threat of terrorist attack. Fifteen hours after the UK travel advisory, a suicide bomber blew himself up in the sewage canal at the Abbey Gate of Kabul airport. The Russian foreign ministry as well as the Pentagon spokesman placed the second explosion near the Baron Hotel, a short distance from the airport. The majority of people waiting outside the airport for the last six or seven days, in sizzling heat and dust, have no travel documents. Having no realistic chance of boarding evacuation flights, they still hope to be airlifted following the departure of those with proper documentation. Observers said those without passports have made it difficult for a handful of people with proper documents, or those who are foreign nationals, to make their way through the crowd. According to US and UK authorities, almost 100,000 people have now been evacuated from Afghanistan. The evacuees include the country’s educated and professional classes of men and women, part of a generation raised and groomed in the past two decades under the shield of the US military. "Educated and professional Afghans had heard nightmarish stories about the previous Taliban regime. For them, it was a dark and barbaric phase in the country’s history. They had not imagined that the ones they and their elders had despised so much would take over again," Nur Rehman Sherzad, a prominent Sweden-based Afghan journalist who had left the country a few years ago due to the Taliban threat, told TOI. Many Afghan politicians and ex-Afghan officials blame the chaos on exiled president Ashraf Ghani. They said that a peaceful transition could have taken place if he had not escaped along with his cohorts when the Taliban arrived at the gates of Kabul. The Taliban, according to them, had announced they would take over the capital in a peaceful manner through negotiations. Jawed Ludin, Afghanistan’s former ambassador and ex-president Hamid Karzai’s spokesperson, blamed Ghani for selling out and bringing shame to Afghanistan. "His failure would be pardonable if only he was authentic and had good intentions. The reality is that he was a third-rate academic and a wreck of a leader. Popularity and naked ambition got him to the top and he pulled down Afghanistan with him when he fell," Ludin said. Republican members of the US House Committee on Oversight have stressed that Ghani must be brought to justice and face criminal charges of embezzlement if he had indeed fled with duffle bags full of cash intended for the Afghan people. "It is critical that this investigation happens. US authorities will have their own reason to do this inquiry, but it is also important that it is pursued by other relevant stakeholders," Ludin said in response to the US committee’s call for an investigation. Meanwhile, Fahim Dashty, a member of the Panjshir-based National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, an anti-Taliban armed movement led by Ahmad Massoud, the son of the slain Afghan warlord and politician Ahmed Shah Massoud, said on Thursday that talks with the Taliban continue in Charikar, the capital of Parwan province in northern Afghanistan. He said the negotiations have so far helped prevent further fighting. The Taliban delegation for eh talks is led by Maulvi Amir Khan Mottaqi, while the delegation from neighbouring Panjshir includes former ministers and lawmakers from several provinces. Panjshir is a narrow valley in the Hindu Kush mountains around 80 km north of Kabul. It is confronted by the Taliban from three sides but conquering it is considered extremely difficult. The valley has limited entry points and its geography offers a natural military advantage for defending forces who can effectively target invading forces. Dashty vowed that if war was imposed on them, they would not only defend Panjshir but would fight from Panjshir for the rest of Afghanistan. In Kabul, senior Afghan leaders, including former president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan’s reconciliation council, continued to engage the Taliban and other stakeholders. There are also reports that Karzai and Abdullah have proposed to shift their talks with the Taliban from Kabul to Doha. Another pro-Pakistan Afghan warlord and politician, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, has insisted on continuation of talks in Kabul.

---||India||Half of India’s adults have now got at least one dose of vaccine||NEW DELHI: Half of the country's adult population eligible for Covid vaccines has received at least one dose, which includes 99% coverage among healthcare workers and 100% front-line workers for the first dose. A little more than 60% of the over-60 population has also been covered by at least a first dose of the vaccine. The average daily vaccinations during August so far also increased to 52.16 lakh doses from 43.41 lakh and 39.38 lakh in July and June respectively. The government said supply situation of vaccines appears satisfactory as in the past few weeks there have been no reports from any state on vaccine shortages. “In last three weeks, balanced unutilised vaccine doses count in the country has never gone below 2.5 crore,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, underlining that the Centre takes stock of the supply and availability situation from states and UTs every morning. Bhushan also highlighted that the Centre has urged states to ramp up vaccination, particularly coverage of second dose of the jabs, with better availability of vaccines. He said the real concern remains the high incidence of the disease in states like Kerala which give rise to fears that a ready host of vulnerable persons may see the emergence of new mutant strain. While only 14.6% of the 94 crore adult population is fully vaccinated so far, 83% of healthcare workers and 79% of front-line workers eligible for the second shot have been covered with both the doses, official data show. Vaccine supplies are also likely to improve further from October as Zydus Cadila has indicated to the government that its DNA-based anti-Covid jab, ZyCoV-D, will be available from the first week of October. The government is still negotiating with the company on terms and price of procurement, Bhushan said. While ZyCoV-D has been given emergency use authorisation for use in all above 12 years, the final decision regarding starting vaccination of children of 12-18 years will be based on National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation’s recommendations, which are yet to be submitted to the health ministry.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/half-of-indias-adults-have-now-got-at-least-one-dose-of-vaccine/articleshow/85672694.cms||Sushmi Dey

The Associated Press reported that at least 72 people were killed and scores wounded in the twin suicide bombings. The Pentagon said at least 12 US "service members" were killed in the "complex attack" at the Kabul airport. "Today's attacks reinforce the need for the world to stand unitedly against terrorism and all those who provide sanctuaries to terrorists," the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a late night statement. It extended condolences to families of the victims of the attacks. "India strongly condemns the bomb blasts in Kabul today. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of this terrorist attack," the MEA said in a statement. "Our thoughts and prayers also go out to the injured," it said. The explosions took place amid a scramble by various countries to evacuate their citizens and Afghan partners from Kabul before the August 31 deadline for the withdrawal of American troops. Thousands of Afghans were crowding around the Kabul airport for over a week, in a desperate attempt to flee the country fearing the Taliban's brutality.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-condemns-bomb-attacks-near-kabul-airport/articleshow/85672804.cms||---

---||India||Chhattisgarh Congress crisis deepens, brass summons CM for second time||NEW DELHI: Congress has again summoned Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel for discussions a day after he returned to Raipur after a marathon session with Rahul Gandhi on the power tussle with state health minister T S Singh Deo. Baghel’s likely meeting with Rahul on Friday has set off speculation as the CM, on returning to Raipur, had made a few triumphalist comments. Singh Deo, who also met Rahul on Tuesday alongside Baghel, is camping in the capital but is not part of the meeting, sources said. Congress MLAs and some ministers are also rushing to the capital in what looks like a show of strength. AICC leaders claimed they were doing it on their own to back their respective camps, mostly Baghel, and were not called by the leadership. The development comes even as rebels against Punjab CM Amarinder Singh are also headed for the capital and uneasy equations in Rajasthan are yet to be settled. Singh Deo continues to pitch his claim for chief ministership on the argument that a rotational term was promised to him and Baghel, when the party came to power in December 2018. Sources said it was a phase of assessing the situation but speculations also raged if Baghel may resign on Friday or soon. The events are a challenge for Congress with the impression of an implosion on its badly shrunk power turfs. While infighting in Punjab appears to be only intensifying when it was felt that appointment of Navjot Sidhu as PCC president had settled the issue, it is also simmering in Rajasthan where a ministerial reshuffle is hanging fire amid a continuing clash between Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot. What has complicated the matter in Chhattisgarh is that Singh Deo is not relenting on his claim to the CM’s post and is said to have told the leadership that he would quit politics if his demand was not accepted. On the other hand, Baghel is a strong OBC leader in a state that has a Mandal profile, which also forms the basis of Congress support. Tinkering with the settled equation in such a situation could be politically risky despite a big majority in the assembly. Baghel has repeatedly said he would “quit the post the moment he is asked by Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi”. However, on returning to Raipur on Wednesday, he said those who were talking of a split term were sowing instability, in what was a direct jibe at Singh Deo. A large number of MLAs and ministers also gathered at the Raipur airport to receive him while he also held a meeting with some of his MLAs later in the evening. Congress has a brute majority in the Chhattisgarh assembly and it has been one of its stable states that it has projected as a model. For the party to be gripped by uncertainty, there is a cause of serious concern.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chhattisgarh-congress-crisis-deepens-brass-summons-cm-for-second-time/articleshow/85672805.cms||---

Around 136 schoolchildren were taken from the school in Tegina town in May, but on Monday the school's owner said that six had died of illness.  The releases were confirmed by an official who asked not to be named because the government planned to issue a statement once they have the children.  One parent, Mallam Saidu Tegina, said over phone the students have been released. He did not confirm how many students were released.  Armed groups carrying out kidnapping for ransom are blamed for a series of raids on schools in northern Nigeria in recent months, abducting more than 1,000 students since December. Abubakar Garba Alhasan, whose seven children are held by the gang, said the students were on their way to the capital city in Minna. "They are released now," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/gunmen-release-abducted-islamic-students-in-north-central-nigeria-parents/articleshow/85672869.cms||---
---||India||Government unveils liberal rules for drones, may pave way for air taxis||NEW DELHI: India on Thursday notified a new set of liberal drone rules that could pave the way for these unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) soon carrying both goods for e-commerce and transporting people on air taxis. Following the intervention of the PMO, the aviation ministry junked the rules it had put in place just this March that had shackled drones in a plethora of clearances and went against ease of doing business. “This (new) policy has been put in place under careful monitoring directly by the PM with trust (in users) as its basis and (to ensure) economic welfare of people,” K Vijay Raghavan, principal scientific advisor to the government, told TOI. India will have three airspace zones for drones — green, where they can be flown; yellow, where permission needed and red like airports where their use is barred unless specifically allowed. This map is expected within 30 days on the Digital Sky single-window drone platform. “Approvals, compliance requirements and entry barriers have been significantly reduced… will tremendously help start-ups and our youth working in this sector (and) help leverage India’s strengths in innovation, technology and engineering to make India a drone hub,” Modi Tweeted on Thursday. The new Drone Rules usher in a landmark moment for this sector in India. The rules are based on the premise of trus… https://t.co/WFXL7RCrK1— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1629963291000Compared to the previous rules, the liberalised Drone Rules, 2021, abolished several approvals and reduces the number of forms to be filled by users from 25 to five. The maximum penalty for violations has been reduced to Rs 1 lakh. Fee amounts have also been reduced with the charge for a remote pilot license cut from Rs 3,000 (for a large drone) to Rs 100 for all categories and valid for 10 years. No remote pilot licence will be required for micro drones for non-commercial use and nano drones. The new rules increase maximum payload for drones from 300 kg to 500 kg, paving the way for drone taxis. “Air taxis are being researched and invented globally and many start-ups are coming up. That time is not far when taxis, like the ones of Uber that you see on roads, you will see in the air under the new drone policy,” aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said. The drone sector has already seen about 200 start-ups and new rules will help create more economic activity and jobs. Arc Ventures MD Arjun Aggarwal said the new “rules will allow India to realise the true potential of this revolutionary industry, enabling substantial job creation and attracting FDI for the sector to not just ‘make-in-India’, but to ‘make-in-India-for-the-world’”. Importantly, based on negative feedback from the industry, Modi got the red tape-ridden old UAS rules changed after the recent Jammu airport attack that used drones. Scindia said the government is working on to quickly develop a technology to counter rogue drones and will not allow security fears to hamper growth. “It’s like automobiles which can be used for routine work and all sorts of things, 99.99% are for valuable purposes. We do not and should not stop automobiles because some people might misuse them. Security agencies will look at rogue automobiles, rogue aircraft and rogue drones. Our security agencies will ensure any violators (the misusing drones) are dealt with,” Vijay Raghavan said. Terming the new rules “fearless,” the Drone Federation of India (DFI), which represents 200 drone companies, said: “The issuance of these rules marks a new era in the Indian drone ecosystem which has a market potential of more than Rs 50,000 crore and can create 5,00,000 professional jobs in the next 5 years.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-unveils-liberal-rules-for-drones-may-pave-way-for-air-taxis/articleshow/85672857.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Raipur||Sexual act by husband not rape, even if it’s by force: Chhattisgarh high court||RAIPUR: Sexual intercourse or sexual act by a man with his wife, who is not under 18 years of age, is “not rape even if it is by force or against her wish,” observed the Chhattisgarh high court while discharging a man of rape charges. The complainant had alleged that her husband had made “unnatural physical relation” with her several times. In her complaint to the police, filed after efforts to settle their dispute went in vain, the woman also alleged that her husband and two of his relatives began harassing her for dowry within days of marriage. On January 22 this year, the Bemetara additional sessions judge ordered framing of charges under IPC Sections 376 (rape), 498A (dowry harassment), 377 (unnatural offence) and 34 (common intention) against the husband, and under Section 498-A against his two relatives. When the accused moved high court, Justice NK Chandravanshi passed his verdict on August 23, upholding the other charges but discharging the husband of rape charge. Times ViewThe judgement upholds the existing law. But it also highlights how flawed and archaic the law is. It is about time that it is changed. Marriage cannot nullify a woman’s right over her own body.“The complainant is the legally wedded wife… therefore, sexual intercourse or any sexual act with her by the husband would not constitute an offence of rape, even if it was by force or against her wish,” the order said, adding that framing of charge under Section 376 of IPC is thus “erroneous and illegal”. The court, however, upheld charges against the husband under Section 377 IPC, observing that if the “dominant intention of the offender is to derive sexual satisfaction in an unnatural way”, it would attract the relevant section of IPC that deals with unnatural offence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/hc-sexual-act-by-husband-not-rape-even-if-its-by-force/articleshow/85672893.cms||---
---||Delhi||Supreme Court declines bail to 16-year-old rape accused||NEW DELHI: In what could trigger a debate on the need for restricting the statute mandated leniency of criminal law towards juveniles in the 16-18 age group, the Supreme Court on Thursday declined to grant bail to a 16 year-old boy who is accused of sexually assaulting a 14 year-old girl. Though the medical reports prima facie appeared in favour of the boy, a bench of CJI N V Ramana and Justice Surya Kant felt that given the serious nature of the offence, it would be prudent to wait till the trial court recorded the testimony of the minor rape survivor. Appearing for the minor in conflict with law, advocate Manu Yadav told the bench that the HC ignored the statutory mandate in the Juvenile Justice Act to release a minor in conflict with law on bail irrespective of whether he has committed a cognisable or non-cognisable offence. “It is a mandatory provision. He is a school going boy and is entitled to bail,” he argued. The bench said it was aware of the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act but the nature of the alleged crime is such that it would be imprudent to grant bail to the boy at this stage. “You wait till the rape survivor is examined by the trial court. You can renew your bail plea after she has been examined by the trial court,” the bench said. When Yadav said that the trial could take a long time to get completed as most trial courts are closed for physical hearing because of pandemic, the CJI-led bench said the HC has fixed a time-frame for the completion of the trial. The SC directed the trial court to strictly adhere to the one-year time schedule fixed by the HC for completing the trial. Section 12 of the JJ Act provided that “(1) When any person, who is apparently a child and is alleged to have committed a bailable or non-bailable offence, is apprehended or detained by the police or appears or brought before a (Juvenile Justice) Board, such person shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or in any other law for the time being in force, be released on bail with or without surety or placed under the supervision of a probation officer or under the care of any fit person: Provided that such person shall not be so released if there appears reasonable grounds for believing that the release is likely to bring that person into association with any known criminal or expose the said person to moral, physical or psychological danger or the person's release would defeat the ends of justice, and the Board shall record the reasons for denying the bail and circumstances that led to such a decision.” Section 12(2) said, “When such person having been apprehended is not released on bail under subsection (1) by the officer-in-charge of the police station, such officer shall cause the person to be kept only in an observation home in such manner as may be prescribed until the person can be brought before a Board.” Section 12(4) said, “When a child in conflict with law is unable to fulfil the conditions of bail order within seven days of the bail order, such child shall be produced before the Board for modification of the conditions of bail.” The debate over apparent negative societal impact of leniency towards juveniles in the age group of 16-18 was triggered by the involvement of a minor, who was just short of 18 years, in the Nirbhaya case that rocked the country and brought about changes in the criminal laws dealing with sexual assault cases. But, the minor got away with light punishment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/supreme-court-declines-bail-to-16-year-old-rape-accused/articleshow/85672979.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||India||SC: Cops cosy up to netas, file flimsy charges against opposition||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday deprecated the malady which has taken root in the police administration across the country, resulting in certain officers currying favours with governing dispensations by proactively registering flimsy or frivolous cases against political opponents, only to get targeted by other police officers of similar bent after the government changes. "It is a disturbing feature across the country. To be in the good books of politicians in power, they commit hara-kiri. First, they actively register cases against political opponents of those at the helm of power. They face the music at the hands of other police officers when the previously targeted politicians come to power," said a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice Surya Kant. "This is a clear misuse of the system. The police officers have to apportion blame on themselves for this sorry state of affairs," the CJI-led bench said while granting interim protection from arrest to top Chhattisgarh police officer Gurjinder Pal Singh, much to the annoyance of the Bhupesh Baghel government. Singh alleged that he is being politically victimised for not registering cases against former CM Raman Singh in an alleged scam in the Nagrik Apurti Nigam. A raid by the economic offences wing had in 2015 turned up a diary which allegedly mentioned payments to "CM sir" and "CM madam". On February 12, 2015, Singh's predecessors conducted raids at multiple locations and headquarters of Nagrik Aapurti Nigam and an FIR was registered at the police station (ACB/EOW), Raipur. In the raid, two diaries were seized in which alleged gratification paid to various functionaries of state, have been mentioned and the diary contained entries "CM Sir" and "CM Madam", which later became the centre of a political controversy, he said. Singh's counsel, senior advocate Fali S Nariman, told the bench that "he was being victimised as he did not carry out the midnight instructions of the CM to register cases against the former CM". This was refuted by the state government which, through senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Rakesh Dwivedi, said there had been two FIRs registered against Singh, one under Section 124A (sedition) for attempting to destabilise the elected government headed by Baghel and the other for amassing wealth allegedly nine times his known sources of income. Appearing for Singh in the disproportionate assets case, senior advocate Vikas Singh said the police officer has explained every property and himself demanded a CBI inquiry for an independent investigation into the charges against him. Both Nariman and Singh pleaded for protection from arrest. Rohatgi and Dwivedi said as a top police officer, Singh should have surrendered instead of absconding and cooperated with the ongoing investigation. "The chargesheet in the sedition case has been filed and this petition seeking quashing for the FIR has become infructuous. Moreover an absconding police officer does not need protection from arrest," Rohatgi said. Dwivedi said both the income tax department and the CBI are against the police officer as there is a prima facie disproportionate assets case against him. However, the bench of CJI Ramana and Justice Kant sought the Chhattisgarh government's response within four weeks on the two SLPs filed by the police officer and protected him from arrest till the next date of hearing. In its order, the SC said, "In the meantime, the state is directed not to arrest the petitioner in both the matters (sedition case and the disproportionate assets case) until further orders. The petitioner is directed to participate in the inquiry/investigation and fully cooperate with the investigating agency without fail."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-cops-cosy-up-to-netas-file-flimsy-charges-against-opposition/articleshow/85673734.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Delhi||Jailer shameless, Tihar haven for criminals: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Reprimanding Tihar jail authorities in the severest possible terms for allegedly conniving with Unitech promoters Sanjay and Ajay Chandra to allow them to operate from inside the prison to scuttle the ongoing probe against them and "dissipate" their properties before the ED could seize them, the Supreme Court said the "maximum security prison" in the capital has become a safe haven for criminals and that the jail superintendent is "shameless". "Tihar jail officials acted in connivance with them. We will take the officials to task... Tihar has become a safe haven for criminals and the jail superintendent is shameless as it is happening in national capital. We will deal with the jail authorities separately," remarked an indignant bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah, who ordered that the Chandra brothers be shifted to Mumbai and lodged separately in Arthur Road and Taloja jails. The bench was furious after going through a sealed envelope report, submitted by the Enforcement Directorate, containing details on how the Chandras allegedly threatened witnesses and had managed to operate with a free communications network and were sending instructions from inside the jail. As per ED report, the accused were engaging in illegal activities by flouting the jail manual; and also making transfer of assets and dissipating the proceeds of crime. Although the bench's anger was provoked by the subversion of law enforcement by jail authorities in the Chandra case, it trained the spotlight on the nexus between criminals and jail authorities, which has seen the prison complex acquiring the notoriety, as the two judges said, of being a "safe haven for criminals". The jail administration has been for decades been accused of facilitating criminals, gang leaders wanted for multiple heinous crimes as well as high-profile accused of white-collar offences, for hefty considerations. Gangsters have been ordering hits and extorting "protection fee" from businessmen using smartphones, which they can procure with remarkable ease. Additional solicitor general Madhavi Divan, appearing for the Enforcement Directorate, told the bench that the Chandras' custody has become "useless" with what they are doing from inside jail and sought immediate intervention from the court. She also told the bench that the probe so far done by the ED revealed that the promoters created many shell companies with dummy directors to do illegal "multilayer transactions'' for diverting money to overseas destinations. She pleaded that immediate steps needed to be taken to stop the Chandras from interfering in the probe. The bench then went through the report and said that the allegations against the Chandras were "disturbing and very serious" and attempts were made by them to undermine the jurisdiction of the apex court. The bench also said details of the report could not be disclosed as the probe is still going on. The court also pulled up the Delhi Police commissioner after being told that ED had written to him on August 16 on the issue but it seemed that no action was taken by him. "It has been 10 days now. Why no probe was initiated. He ought not to have waited for a single day after receiving the communication," the bench said and directed the Delhi Police chief to conduct the investigation personally and not by his officer. It directed him to file a report in two weeks. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the Chandra brothers, tried to convince the bench that the accused were not provided any special facilities and they are entitled to communicate through letters. He pleaded with the bench not to be "carried away" by the report. But the bench said the Chandras had to shifted out of Tihar in view of the allegations. Giving a brief details of the probe done by the ED, Divan said the agency has attached properties worth of Rs 650 crore spread across the country as well as one the Chandras own overseas. She told the bench that the agency had located an "underground" office of the Chandras in South Delhi and the documents recovered from there included 400 original sale deeds. The court said the ED probe was going at a tardy pace and directed the agency to speed up and conclude it expeditiously. The court brought the anti-money laundering agency into the case after a forensic audit of the company revealed that the promoters had siphoned off thousands of crores of homebuyers’ money and bank loans by diverting them to overseas tax havens. Unitech took Rs 14,270 crore as deposits from 29,800 homebuyers and secured a loan of Rs 1,805.86 crore from six financial institutions for 74 housing projects. After examining the account books of Unitech Group and its subsidiaries, the auditor in its interim report said Rs 5,063 crore, or 40% of the collections from homebuyers, were not used for the housing projects they were meant for. Outflows worth another Rs 2,389 crore are still being probed. The report said nearly 40% of the money raised from financial institutions amounting to Rs 763 crore had not been utilised for construction. The auditor filed the report after examining 51 projects and the rest 23 projects have not yet been analysed as the company failed to provide relevant data. Giving details of potential diversion of funds, the interim audit report said high value investments were made in offshore tax havens, which were later written off. "Between 2007-2010, three subsidiaries of Unitech made investments of Rs 1,745.81 crore in 10 companies in Cyprus. Between 2016- 2018, an amount of Rs 1,406.33 crore or 80% of the total investment value was written off while the remaining amount of Rs 339 crore is appearing as equity investments in the books of accounts," the report said. "Similarly, in 2007-2008, Unitech Global Limited, a company registered in Jersey and a subsidiary of Nuwell Limited, another subsidiary, advanced a loan of Rs 294.47 crore to Kortel Limited, another step-down subsidiary of Unitech. Kortel made investments of Rs 292.99 crore in three foreign entities based in Cyprus during 2015-2016.

Charan Singh, an Afghan Sikh currently living in Moscow who has been in constant touch with Afghan Hindus and Sikhs, told TOI that due to the imposition of stricter rules by the Taliban, the evacuation of these people was becoming increasingly difficult. “They had reached Kabul airport around 8am on Wednesday, but unfortunately on Thursday, around 4am, they were forced to return to the gurdwara after the Taliban started shooting and took control of one of the gates of Kabul airport,” he said. Singh said tension between Taliban and anti-Taliban forces was growing, and those sheltered in the gurdwara feared getting caught in the crossfire. “The group was scheduled to attend a function organised to commemorate the 400th birth anniversary of Sri Guru Teg Bahadur,” said Partap Singh, president of Gurdwara Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji in Delhi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/taliban-stop-140-afghanistan-sikhs-hindus-from-leaving-troubled-nation/articleshow/85673934.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||World||We will hunt you down and make you pay: Biden to Kabul airport attackers||WASHINGTON: Terming the United States service members who were killed in attacks outside the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Thursday “heroes”, President Joe Biden warned the attackers that America will make them “pay” for it. “We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,” Biden, apparently close to tears, warned the attackers while addressing the nation from White House on Thursday (local time). Biden said US troops were “engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others”. At least a dozen US service members were killed, besides around 60 Afghans, while scores were injured in Thursday's twin suicide bombings. The Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan has claimed responsibility for the attacks. Biden said the US in Afghanistan would “respond with force and precision”. “If military needs additional force, I'll grant it,” he said. He, however, added there was no sign of “collusion” between the Taliban and Islamic State in the attack. On the other hand he acknowledged that Taliban “are not good guys”, adding it was in their interest that the US leaves on time and on target. Biden also reaffirmed the August 31 troop pullout deadline from Afghanistan. “We'll rescue the American citizens from Afghanistan. We'll get our Afghan allies out and our mission will go on,” the US President said. Two suicide bombers and gunmen attacked crowds flocking to Kabul's airport Thursday. One of the bombers struck people standing knee-deep in a wastewater canal under the sweltering sun, throwing bodies into the fetid water.

---||India||Kabul scene critical, airlift priority: External affairs minister||NEW DELHI: Evacuation of Indians from Afghanistan is the government’s priority and it is keen to convey that India has a strong “national position” on Afghanistan as all parties have a similar view that friendship with the Afghan people matters to us, foreign minister S Jaishankar told a meeting of about 37 MPs from different parties on Thursday. At a three-and-half-hour briefing, Jaishankar described the situation in Kabul as “critical”, hours before an explosion rocked the airport causing multiple casualties. He hinted the relatively smooth movement of Indians through Kabul would not have happened without some coordination with “local authorities”, in this case, the Taliban. On whether India would recognise the Taliban government, Jaishankar said the government was adopting a “wait and watch” policy. Congress expressed concern over the possible rise in terrorism and urged the government to take strong measures in Jammu and Kashmir while raising the issue resuming the political process and restoring statehood. The government replied that the bifurcation of the state had strengthened the security situation. A PDP member is reported to have raised a controversial issue and Jaishankar cut him short by saying that “it was not a discussion on Kashmir, but on Afghanistan”. Congress also raised the issue of deportation of a woman Afghan MP, and party leader Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters that the government accepted it was a mistake and would look into the matter. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said India had been preparing for its drawdown after the US-Taliban agreement of February 2020. In April 2020, India withdrew all India-based personnel from its Herat and Jalalabad consulates as “pre-emptive measures”. The Kabul embassy itself was scaled down in June 2021, an old chancery was closed and everyone moved into the new one in the Green Zone. On July 11, India sent a special IAF flight to evacuate its people from the Kandahar consulate. A month later, India closed down its consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif. So far, India has evacuated 565 Indians, including 175 embassy personnel, 112 Afghans, mainly Hindus and Sikhs, and 15 third-country citizens, Shringla said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kabul-scene-critical-airlift-priority-external-affairs-minister/articleshow/85674052.cms||---
---||Patna||Owners heave sigh of relief as shops get green light to operate on all days in Bihar||PATNA: With the government lifting almost all the Covid-induced restrictions in the state from Thursday, the owners of non-essential shops, super markets and shopping malls heaved a sigh of relief. While most of them hailed the decision, some pointed out that this step could have been taken a little earlier because many shopkeepers endured heavy financial losses during the lockdown. Ratan Singh, the general manager of a mall in Patliputra Colony, told this reporter on Thursday that all the shopkeepers were extremely happy and had decided to follow Covid safety protocols strictly. “The multiplex on the top floor of the mall has witnessed increased footfalls during the last few days. The other shopkeepers also hope to attract a large number of customers soon,” he added. Ratan also claimed that investors had incurred losses worth Rs 85 lakh per month during the lockdown when the multiplex, shops, parking lots, and restaurants on the premises of the mall were shut. Now, the mall will remain open for visitors from 10am to 9pm every day. The president of the Bihar Industries Association, Ram Lal Khetan, urged the district administration to “take action against the people who flout Covid safety protocols”, instead of forcing shops to open on alternate days. “You can see that less than 10% of the Patnaites wear masks now. If the administration takes strict action against 10 of them, the remaining people will follow the safety norms. No more lockdowns will happen,” he said. Dinesh Agarwal, the president of the Bihar Electric Trade Association, also hailed the new government order, saying it had given the owners of non-essential shops much needed respite. Meanwhile, quite a few shopkeepers claimed that the number of customers had dipped considerably. They attributed the poor footfalls to a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the people in general. Gautam Kumar and Saraj Kumar, who own shops in areas like Kankerbagh and Boring Canal Road, rued, “Although we are adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour, the footfalls are quite low. Customers are still not visiting our shops, but we hope the situation will improve.” The manager of a restaurant on Fraser Road, Sunil Kumar, also said, “Despite the fact that we follow Covid safety norms, very few customers are visiting us. It seems they are still scared of stepping out of their houses.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/owners-heave-sigh-of-relief-as-shops-get-green-light-to-operate-on-all-days-in-bihar/articleshow/85669684.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Business||Lenovo expands manufacturing in India to meet rising demand||Chennai: Lenovo on Thursday said it is significantly expanding its local manufacturing activities in India to help meet increasing domestic customer demand. The company’s in-house PC manufacturing plant in Puducherry has been expanded to include a third manufacturing line, thereby doubling capacity to two million units, Lenovo said. It has also launched local manufacturing of its tablet computers, in partnership with Wingtech Technology, at a plant in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. Additionally, smartphones for Motorola (a Lenovo group company) are now locally manufactured in partnership with Dixon Technologies in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Lenovo employs more than 1,500 direct and indirect employees in these three manufacturing plants. While historically the company was meeting around 15%-20% of domestic demand through local manufacturing, in the near term, it is estimated to cross the 30%-35% mark, Lenovo said. Lenovo Group’s total revenue in India was approximately $462 million for the quarter ended June 30, representing year-on-year growth of 31%. The company said it is expanding in India across all business lines, including PC and smart devices, smartphones, infrastructure solutions, and newly established services and solutions group. The Lenovo Puducherry plant, which has been operational since 1999, had previously been expanded to include Lenovo’s IdeaPad notebook computers from its consumer portfolio. Now, with the addition of a third production line, the facility has begun manufacturing products across Lenovo’s full consumer and commercial range including desktops, notebooks, and workstations. The company said it has invested significantly in automating and digitizing the facility. In Tirupati, Lenovo recently began manufacturing tablet computers with its global partner Wingtech. Production began with a small number of models and has expanded since then. Motorola has partnered with Dixon to manufacture nearly 100% of its smartphones for customers in India and has also begun exporting to selected nearby markets.“With various initiatives launched by the government to promote ‘Make in India’, the industry is more encouraged to support the needs of local customers through local manufacturing. In line with our sincere commitment to manufacture locally, the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in India will help us offer innovative devices of highest quality, produced here and rapidly brought to market,” Shailendra Katyal, MD, Lenovo India, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lenovo-expands-manufacturing-in-india-to-meet-rising-demand/articleshow/85668001.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

---||Kolkata||Academics enraged at Mahasweta story removal from DU syllabus||Kolkata: Delhi University’s decision to delete Mahasweta Devi’s short story ‘Draupadi’ and works of two Dalit authors, Bama and Sukhartharini, from the English honours syllabus has created ripples among English literature teachers and authors here. They have criticised the decision, calling it “deliberately political”, something that is against the inclusive approach to which scholars are introduced at the undergraduate level. ‘Draupadi’ talks about a Santhal woman’s (Dopdi Mejhen) protest against torture by the police on the ground that she was a Naxal. She was gang-raped, after which she marches naked towards the perpetrators of the crime. The story was written in 1978 and was later translated by post-colonial critic and theoretician Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. Teachers said removal of three texts of the same genre indicated the fact that the authorities were trying to blindfold students against harsh realities of the marginalised sections of the society. They felt this was a sign of regression and politicisation of education. Since such a change has been brought into the English syllabus of a leading university, the “intent” is clear. Academics felt this is the beginning of a skewed approach to education and will lead to insensitivity among students, who will not be able to appreciate the country’s realities. “Deletion of texts from the syllabus suggests a larger agenda. Students will be kept away from the diversity of the Indian society and will not be taught to be just and inclusive,” said Supriya Chaudhuri, professor emerita, Jadavpur University, while Ananda Lal, theatre critic and former professor of English, called the deletions, “ridiculous and politically motivated.” “Translated texts that are representative of Dalit voices are very important, just like queer literature and writings of protest. Such deletions are unfortunate,” said Sonia Sahoo, head of the department of English at JU. “Are we creating the right kind of space for young scholars to appreciate Dalit literature?” asked author Samaresh Majumdar. Author Amar Mitra said, “This will only help to alienate today’s scholars towards the marginalised as they become pawns in the hands of corporate groups.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/academics-enraged-at-mahasweta-story-removal-from-du-syllabus/articleshow/85667872.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

This is the single largest infusion made since inception — the last large investment was Rs 540 crore in 2009-10. With this investment, the bank’s total capital deployed in the country increases to Rs 8,300 crore. “We have ambitious growth aspirations, and the investment will help accelerate that as we look to leverage the attractive opportunities that the present situation offers,” said Jaideep Khanna, head of Barclays Asia-Pacific and country CEO. “As economic activity gathers momentum, there is increased demand for capital from clients. We are well placed to support their objectives and remain committed to working closely with them,” added Khanna. According to a spokesperson, the money is for the growth of the corporate investment bank and wealth management business. The British bank has four branches and a presence across six cities. As part of its expansion plans in the country, Barclays Bank Plc also inaugurated its international banking unit (IBU) branch at GIFT City in Gujarat in February this year. The spokesperson added that the 55% jump in capital base will enable the lender to significantly expand its exposure to Indian clients. RBI rules cap a bank’s exposure to a single borrower, a business group and capital markets at 20%, 25% and 40% of their capital respectively. In 2019, the RBI came out with a large exposure framework, which made it difficult for foreign banks to have back-to-back arrangements with their head office for exposures in India as these too came under the ceiling.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/barclays-pumps-rs-3000cr-in-india-to-expand-biz/articleshow/85670677.cms||---

Around 41 medals were also handed over to the students for their excellent academic performance during the virtual ceremony. Eight engineering students were conferred with gold medals. Ashutosh Mishra of BTech (mechanical engineering) and Umang Jain of computer science and engineering (CSE) department received President’s Gold Medal, Anushree Jain and Vatsal Singhal from CSE got Director’s Gold Medal, Subhadip Bhandari (material science engineering) and Divya Grover (civil and infrastructure engineering) of MTech branch got Chairman’s Gold Medal. Arindam Basak and Saswata Jana of MSc (mathematics) received Aryabhatta Gold Medal. The chief guest for this virtual convocation was Prabhakar Raghavan, senior vice-president at Google and an alumnus of IIT-Madras. Addressing the graduating students from California, he said the IITs are world-renowned in producing the incredible technologists and engineers and one of the most remarkable things about studying at IITs is being surrounded with India’s most brilliant minds. Raghavan shared his experience in working in academia as well as in industry, scientific community and product and businesses. “Sometimes, we impose limitations on ourselves as we think we can do one thing – academia or startups. Never think that just because you got degree in a certain field today or taken your first job in a particular industry or company, that it defines you for a lifetime. I have seen along my journey that people can do multiple things. You will evolve and adapt things over the time. So, the first choice you make is not the end of all. The future is not limited by all this,” he said. Raghavan added, “As a graduating student, you are heading for the next chapter of your life. Pursue every evolving and unsolvable problems. When you do that in pursuit of changing the world, you will change it for the better.” Anand Deshpande, chairman, board of governors, IIT-Patna, congratulated the institute for setting up an incubation centre for innovations in ‘electronics system design and manufacturing’ and encouraged entrepreneurial endeavours of students. He said IIT-Patna was in the process of launching courses like BTech with a specialisation in artificial intelligence, BS in mathematics and computing, BTech in engineering physics, MBA and BS in economics. IIT-P director Pramod Kumar Jain highlighted the progress institute in different spheres like academic, infrastructure and mentioned notable achievements of faculties and students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/850-students-walk-away-with-degrees-at-iit-patna-convocation/articleshow/85669445.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: KMC units see spike in second-dose demand||KOLKATA: Thousands turned up, despite sporadic drizzles, at the KMC-run vaccination clinics and mega centres on Thursday morning to get their jabs. Some of the clinics based in the Garia-Tollygunge and Jadavpur-Kasba belts saw serpentine queues and some units in Jadavpur-Kasba areas had people from faroff places, like Mograhat, Joynagar and Dakshin Barasat, queueing up at the crack of dawn. A good number of the vaccination clinics on Thursday also recorded a rise in the number of second dose recipients. Going by vaccination data at the end of the day, the mega centre at Bhawanipur Education Society recorded around 550 recipients of both doses combined, of which over 200 had come from three districts — Howrah, and South and North 24 Parganas. “A sizeable portion of the recipients had come from districts and they reached early in the morning. We assured all that their vaccination needs would be taken care of,” said a KMC health department official. With the demand high, a single queue and time slot had put some second-dose recipients in trouble.According to a KMC medical officer overseeing a vaccination clinic in Tollygunge, of the 200 doses administered, around 45% was to second-dose recipients. “We didn’t realize that a sizeable portion of the crowd that had gathered at our clinic since morning would turn out to be recipients of the second dose,” the official said. According to a civic official, the civic body will be in a position to allocate more vaccines to its Covishield clinics and mega centres from Friday as the state health department on Thursday received 13 lakh doses of the vaccine. “If we get a portion of the consignment, we shall increase daily allocation of Covishield doses to our clinics and mega centres,” said a civic official. The official said while the allocation on Thursday for each of the 144 vaccination clinics stood at 200 doses, the mega centres got around 550 doses. “We hope to increase the doses by 10% if we receive fresh supply from the state,” the civic official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-units-see-spike-in-2nd-dose-demand/articleshow/85667797.cms||Saikat Ray

The HC was hearing a petition by Ashav Advisory, a Delhi-based consultancy firm that had taken Patanjali Ayurved, Ruchi Soya and three other entities to court claiming it owns 11% in the FMCG company. The promoters have contested Ashav Advisory’s claim. As the name suggests, an FPO is an offer by an already-listed company to sell its shares to the public. Industry sources said that the latest development has been communicated to Sebi, which had given its go-ahead for the NFO last week. The merchant bankers, led by SBI Capital Markets, are expected to launch the FPO soon. Ruchi Soya had filed its offer document with the regulator on June 14. One of the main reasons for the FPO is to bring down the promoter shareholding in the company. Currently, Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Group, the promoters of the company, together hold nearly 99% in it after it changed hands following NCLT’s order under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC). In a recent interview, Baba Ramdev had said that he was looking at an attractive price for Ruchi Soya FPO. Since November 2019 when the resolution plan for the company was cleared by the Supreme Court, the stock had gained nearly 450 times to Rs 1,455 in late June 2020 from about Rs 3 in early November 2019. On Thursday, the stock on the BSE closed at Rs 1,093. Currently, it has a market cap of Rs 32,300 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ruchi-soya-fpo-clears-hc-hurdle/articleshow/85670618.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The officials identified pots used to keep indoor plants as one of the main reasons for the spread of dengue. “Residents overlook the fact that water accumulates beneath the flower pots where mosquito larvae thrive. This is particularly true in dwellings with the habit of placing saucers beneath the flower pots,” officials said. This pattern was observed more in Jubilee Hills and Kondapur, among other affluent areas. Dengue is caused by mosquitoes that breed in clear water, they said. Officials said Telangana recorded 1,666 cases in the last 45 days with Hyderabad alone accounting for 537. This season, a total of 4,771 samples, including 1,725 from the city, were collected for testing. “Thankfully, no one in the state has succumbed to the fever this year, but the incidence of fevers has increased when compared to the last year,” officials said. Cases were less than 1,000 at this time in 2020. Private hospitals in the city are also seeing an upsurge in dengue cases caused by mosquito breeding in flower pots at independent houses, flats as well as gated communities. “Many posh locations have vegetation and landscaping where stagnant water is common. It is a perfect ground for mosquito breeding. We are suggesting to people to venture into green spaces after properly covering their hands and feet and to avoid such places in the morning,” said Dr Y Sridhar, critical care consultant, Apollo Hospitals. He said the dengue-carrying mosquito is active in the morning. Dr KV Rao, a physician from Secunderabad, said the cases were less last year thanks to lockdown and vigorous sanitisation among people. “We are now witnessing a situation similar to 2018 season which reported a very high number of dengue cases. Overhead water tanks are another major spots where dengue mosquitoes breed. Cleaning of water tanks is a must,” he said. Water also accumulates in the water bowls people set out for birds and pets in the homes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dengue-breeds-in-flower-pots-pattern-common-in-posh-areas/articleshow/85670340.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Patna||‘Bihar will need 17k ICU beds if third Covid wave hits state’||PATNA: A task force headed by NITI Aayog member V K Paul has projected that Bihar will need at least 17,480 ICU beds if the third Covid wave hits the state. The task force had been assigned by the Centre to formulate the nation’s pandemic emergency strategy. In its recommendation submitted to the Centre last month, the group pointed out that 23% of positive cases might need hospitalisation in the next wave. This means at least 23 of 100 Covid positive people will have to be hospitalised. It also projected maximum 33,000 ICU beds will be needed in Uttar Pradesh, 17,865 in Maharashtra and 17,480 in Bihar. If the third wave actually strikes the country, it would become difficult for Bihar to deal with the situation as it has just 1,500 ICU beds and 800 beds with ventilators roughly. Maharashtra has done its estimation and is preparing accordingly. As per their estimation, 60 lakh people will get infected in the next wave and 4.51 lakh will need hospital care. Of those admitted, 72,532 will need oxygen and 9,066 ventilator support. Asked about the preparation for the third wave keeping the projection of the task force in mind, state health minister Mangal Pandey said the state government was following all the instructions of the Centre. “Overall preparation for the third wave is going on, such as training of healthcare workers, oxygen availability in hospitals and strengthening infrastructure, especially for children. The Centre has given us Rs 900 crore and this money will be used in making paediatric intensive care units and increasing beds in hospitals. By March next year, we will have 5,000 to 6,000 additional beds,” the minister added He added Bihar managed the first and second waves of Covid well. “We have just 104 active cases now. This was not predicted by anyone that active cases will fall so low in Bihar. We are hopeful of tackling any future challenge in a better way,” Pandey said. State health department additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit said the department was working on all the possibilities. Regarding Paul’s projection, he said, “These are just calculations. However, such figures help us in making better arrangements.” Meanwhile, health experts have advised people of Bihar to maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour even though the number of cases has been falling. AIIMS-Patna nodal incharge for Covid-19 Dr Sanjeev Kumar said they were studying about the upcoming wave and it was difficult to speak much at the moment. “Third wave will depend on the number of vaccinations done and the number of people who have already been infected. However, how long the immunity remains is also a factor along with the kind of strain which will come,” Dr Kumar added. He said just increasing the number of beds would not work. “There should be proper infrastructure at the hospitals. Trained healthcare workers will have to be deployed at the hospitals to handle different equipment.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bihar-will-need-17k-icu-beds-if-third-covid-wave-hits-state/articleshow/85669511.cms||Sheezan Nezami

He was stumped when the results tested him positive adding to the tally of Covid-l9 cases in the city! The case is not isolated as the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has come across such cases frequently. Officials point out that the number of persons who test positive after falling ill has gone down significantly. The testing, at the other end, has remained consistent over a period of time. A VMC official said that in most such ‘positive’ cases, there was no travel history. He added that this could be an indication that the virus was still around. Asymptomatic persons testing positive was also an indication of the same. VMC’s medical officer (health), Dr Devesh Patel said that a majority of persons who tested positive were either contacts of asymptomatic positive persons or those who were getting tested for other purposes. Several persons are undergoing tests as negative RT-PCR reports are mandatory for travel, surgeries or even jobs. Patel said that only a minor portion of the positive cases were those who had some symptoms and got tested. “This is also reflected in the hospitalization data. Since most of those who test positive hardly have any symptoms, the hospitalization is much lower than the number of active cases,” said Patel. Sources said that a major reason for positive cases not having symptoms may be that they have been vaccinated. The city has been leading in the number of vaccinated persons since quite some time now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/new-asymptomatic-cases-add-to-positive-tally/articleshow/85665179.cms||Sachin Sharma

According to PIB, Scindia has written to Nitish, underscoring the land requirements of 49.5 acres at Patna airport for runway extension, parallel taxi track, doppler very high frequency omni range (DVOR) equipment, isolation bay and glide path. “About 50 acres of land are required at Purnia airport for development of new civil enclave, 121 acres at Raxaul to develop the airport for ATR-72 type aircraft, 475 acres at Muzaffarpur airport to develop it for operation of A-320 type aircraft, 78 acres at Darbhanga for development of new civil enclave along with CAT I approach light system,” the minister wrote in his letter to the CM. Bihar should also take into consideration the scope for international connectivity and consequently viability of operation of a wide body aircraft, it added. The Union civil aviation ministry has also requested the state government to consider the provision of 100% VGF support for commencing international UDAN operations from Patna and Gaya (Gaya-Bangkok, Gaya-Kathmandu, Gaya-Yangon, Patna-Kathmandu and Patna-Dubai). On receipt of the consent of Bihar government for 100% VGF support, routes will be put for bidding for the airlines. Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary of state cabinet secretariat department, said the letter has not been received yet. “As far as Patna airport is concerned, the state government has given 15.5-acre land for an isolation bay and for installing the DVOR. That has already been made available to them in an expression of formal transfer and they want another 20 acres of land for parallel taxi track. The land belongs to 2-3 different departments, including transport. There is also government land which has been given to ICAR on lease,” he said. Kumar added Raxual has an old airport and that land belongs to Airports Authority of India (AAI). “I am not aware whether they are asking for more land. The AAI has been asking for 78 acres of land in Darbhanga, including 54 acres for new civil enclave (terminal building, cargo, multi-level car parking, fire station and other auxiliary buildings) and 24 acres for the installation of category I (CAT I) approach light. For this, the state government has given in-principle approval. The proposal will be tabled in the state cabinet for the approval following which other formalities will be done,” Kumar said. Earlier, the AAI had asked for 31 acres of land and the state government had sanctioned it and sent the money to the district magistrate of Darbhanga for land acquisition. However, the AAI has made changes in its programme after the survey of land in February and asked for more land.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/centre-seeks-nitishs-help-for-expansion-of-airports-in-bihar/articleshow/85669162.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Ahmedabad||Strict rules put snake rescuers in a spot||Rajkot: Spotted a snake in your backyard? You have two options — either let it slither away or you stay well out of its reach as rescue operation now may take more time than earlier. Thanks to the forest department, its new guidelines issued on March 30 this year for snake catching is restraining volunteers from doing their work. In fact, the department’s intention to save the snakes has only bitten the volunteers as well as general people. There are around 2,000 volunteers engaged in these activities all over the state and many of them are part of NGOs. In any such situation earlier, whenever a call goes to an NGO, the volunteers rush to the spot and successfully rescue the reptile within minimum time so as to avoid confrontation with human or cause harm to its own safety. However, the new guidelines mandate that calls will have to go through the taluka forest wildlife warden, who will send a bona fide rescuer to do the job, thus taking a lot of time in the process and endangering lives. According to the new rules, volunteers will have to register first, their names will be scrutinized by the respective circles of forest department and thereafter undergo a 15-day training by GEER foundation before they get a photo ID card which they will have to carry in rescue operations. They will also need to have a life insurance cover of Rs 10 lakh. Sources said the execution of these new guideline is very slow, and that except in Ahmedabad, no training has been started anywhere. Again, even if the forest department starts training in all the districts immediately, it will take a minimum of over a year to train all the people. Snakes are found around human habitation in areas like Jamnagar, Porbandar, Junagadh, Amreli, Bhavnagar and in most parts of south Gujarat. Of the snakes that get rescued, 40 percent are poisonous, rescuers claim. Cobra, Indian krait, Russell’s viper, bamboo pit viper are some of the venomous species found commonly in Gujarat. For the past three decades and more, Lakhota Nature Club in Jamnagar has been engaged in rescuing snakes and its team of 42 rescuers save around 300 snakes in a month. These activities are done in coordination with the forest department and the NGO also provides the rescue data to the department every year. However, recently the NGO gave an advertisement in a local newspaper stating that rescue work of snakes have been stopped owing to the new guidelines of the government. “If any of our (NGO’s) members is found doing this work, it will be considered an activity going against the organization and their membership may be cancelled,” the ad stated. It also furnished an address of a local forest office for the general public to contact in case of need. Earlier, the NGO had a WhatsApp group where people could place a call and get help within minutes. President Suresh Bhatt tld TOI, “We did this to avoid any controversy and clash with new guidelines. We want the forest department to execute this guideline immediately and start training rescuers as soon as possible.” “It’s not possible for the forest department to attend to every call and rescue snakes. General public calls us, not the forest department,” said Vikram Gadhvi, founder of Gujarat snake conservation society. “If a person has to inform the department first and it will then inform us, the entire procedure will consume precious time which will increase possibility of a snakebite or the reptile being killed out of panic,” explained Gadhvi, adding that many individual rescuers are still doing the risky job despite the guidelines. These wildlife lovers are doing this to save the reptiles from harm even at the risk of being prosecuted while waiting to get authorisation, he stated. Gadhvi also sent a letter to the chief minister last year demanding compensation for family members of rescuers in case of death from snakebite and also for providing free government treatment for volunteers who get injured in such rescue operations. “The government, without asking me, made a wrong interpretation of my suggestions. They (authorities) have made the Rs 10 lakh life insurance cover mandatory for rescuers. Volunteers put their lives into risk and no insurance company has policy to cover such risks,” Gadhvi added. Talking to TOI, principal chief conservator of forest, Shyamal Tikadar, said, “There are certain confusions with the guidelines. We will work it out.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/strict-rules-put-snake-rescuers-in-a-spot/articleshow/85669391.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Allahabad||HC sets aside chargesheet against Dr Khan in inflammatory speech case||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Thursday set aside the chargesheet and its cognizance order passed against Dr Kafeel Khan by chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Aligarh in a criminal case alleging that Dr Khan had delivered an inflammatory speech during protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) /National Register of Citizens (NRC) at Aligarh Muslim University in 2019. The court set aside the chargesheet and its cognizance order, observing that before filing the chargesheet the police authorities concerned had not taken the requisite sanction from the Centre or the state government or the district magistrate under section 196 (a) of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) as required in such cases (inflammatory speech offences). However, while giving this judgment, Justice Gautam Chaudhari made it clear that the chargesheet and its cognizance order may be taken up by the court after the mandatory sanction granted under section 196 (a) of CrPC from the Centre or the state government or the district magistrate. Earlier, an FIR was lodged against Dr Khan in this connection under section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 505 (2) (statement creating or promoting, enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) and 109 (abetment of offence) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). Consequently, he was arrested and sent to jail. Later, the police submitted the chargesheet before an Aligarh court on March 16, 2020. The chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Aligarh took its cognizance on July 28, 2020. Hence, the present petition was filed by Dr Khan challenging it. At another stage, he was booked under National Security Act (NSA) in this connection, which was later set aside by the high court. Dr Khan, a paediatrician of BRD Medical College of Gorakhpur, was suspended from service on August 22, 2017, following the death of about 60 infants in the BRD Medical College hospital due to lack of oxygen. According to section 196 (a) of CrPC, no court shall take cognizance of any offence under section 153A of IPC except with the previous sanction of the Centre or the state government or the district magistrate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/hc-sets-aside-chargesheet-against-dr-khan-in-inflammatory-speech-case/articleshow/85670075.cms||---

Patna Meteorological Centre has issued a yellow alert for thunderstorm with lightning in most districts in the state on Friday and heavy rainfall at one or two places in West Champaran, East Champaran, Sitamarhi and Madhubani districts on Saturday. The intensity of showers is likely to be comparatively more in eastern parts of the state. Districts in south-central parts of the state, including Patna, Gaya and Nalanda are very likely to receive rainfall at many places on Friday and at a few places on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The IMD has also issued an orange alert for heavy to very rainfall at isolated places along with thunderstorm and lightning in Bihar on Friday and yellow alert for heavy rainfall on Saturday. The yellow warning by IMD asks the authorities to be watchful for extreme weather developments and orange alert to be alert for such weather conditions. The rainy spell in the region has been attributed to favourable position of monsoon trough line and moist southerly winds coming from Bay of Bengal. The IMD stated that western end of monsoon trough line was passing along the foothill of Himalayas on Thursday evening and it is likely to shift gradually southwards from August 28. The eastern end of monsoon trough line, on the other hand, was passing through Hardoi, Varanasi, Daltonganj, Digha and north Bay of Bengal. It further stated that strong southerly and south- westerly winds are likely to continue to blow from Bay of Bengal to northeast India till Friday. Due to the weather systems in the region, the IMD stated in its all-India evening bulletin that isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall would occur in Bihar till Saturday. Meanwhile, Bihar has received 16% surplus rainfall in the monsoon season till date. As per data available on the website of IMD, Bihar has received 883.9mm rainfall from June 1 till August 26, while the normal rainfall during the same period is 763.5mm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/expect-fairly-widespread-rainfall-till-saturday-met/articleshow/85669080.cms||---

The minister set an ambitious export and employment target for the auto component industry asking it to double its exports to $30 billion in the next 5 years and increase employment in the industry from 50 lakh right now to 75 lakh by 2025. The government also exhorted the auto industry to localise and cut down Chinese import-dependence particularly of electronic, electrical and semiconductor components. “The auto component industry should indigenise the making of electric vehicle components and India should not become a major importer of electric vehicle (EV) components like it is with the solar industry,” said Amitabh Kant, CEO, Niti Aayog. “As global auto companies diversify their supply chain they are looking for sourcing hubs outside China and India has a huge opportunity there,” he added. Even as he stressed the EV transition, he also highlighted the importance of reducing China dependence on internal combustion engine vehicles as well. “As auto companies ramp up production, they need to boost localisation and reduce dependence on imports particularly from China of parts like catalytic converters, electronic and electrical parts, semiconductor and other critical components,” he added. For its part, auto companies stressed the need for consolidated investments in critical areas like semiconductors. SIAM president Kenichi Ayukama said: “The semiconductor shortage has impacted our industry last year and continues to be a big challenge this year. Semiconductor manufacture requires huge investment. Indian auto industry alone cannot ensure the viability of such a huge investment. Hence there is a need for consolidation across sectors.” “The localisation road map made by SIAM and ACMA can succeed only with full support from the government,” he added. Hyundai Motor India MD & CEO SS Kim outlined his company’s manufacturing plans saying that Hyundai's India specific operations will focus on zero emissions vehicles, maximum customisation, market relevant and human centric technology and prepare for uncertainties due to dynamic business conditions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-to-announce-pli-scheme-for-automobile-sector-allocate-rs-57000-cr/articleshow/85667936.cms||---

As against this, home loan requests have registered an increase of 26% in the first half. According to a Magicbricks Home Loans Consumer Study, the balance transfer requests have increased because of a dip in interest rates. “The soaring demand has been triggered largely by the fact that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept the repo rate unchanged at a constant 4%, allowing many banks to offer interest rates of less than 7% for home loans. This has also been a key driver in augmenting the demand for home buying,” the report said. In terms of the demand for balance transfers, New Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad were the top five tier-1 cities. Among tier-2 cities, Ghaziabad, Mohali, Noida, Indore and Visakhapatnam were the top five. Borrowers opt for a balance transfer when they feel that they can bring down their interest rates by switching to a new contract. An increase in the number of balance transfer requests also reflects a growing level of awareness. Magicbricks is part of the Times Group, which publishes the TOI. “Almost 50% of the borrowers opt for tenures less than 15 years. With factors like low interest rates, stable prices and attractive payment plans, we are hopeful that the pent-up demand would soon translate into sales,” said Magicbricks CEO Sudhir Pai. In addition to growth in loans for new home purchases and balance transfers, loans against property has also seen a growth of 20% because of the low rates. For loans against property, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, New Delhi and Pune saw the most demand across tier-1 cities, and Gurgaon, Jamshedpur, Patna, Faridabad and Lucknow for tier-2 cities. Another finding from the report is Bank of Baroda, Indian Bank, SBI, HDFC and ICICI Bank are the most searched lenders on Magicbricks’ home loans platform.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/home-loan-transfers-up-42-in-jan-june-over-prior-6-mths/articleshow/85671010.cms||---

Police on Thursday morning recovered the bodies of the deceased who were identified as Chatur alias Chapoy Hembram (60) and his son Arjun Hembram (28). Hand written pamphlets in which the banned outfit warned of a similar action against others working as police informers, were also found. Chatur’s wife Nanhaki Marandi said that 10-15 heavily armed men reached their house after 10 pm when they were asleep. They entered after breaking the door and forced her husband to accompany them. Another group barged into a room and held her son Arjun captive. Both father and son were brutally assaulted with wooden sticks before they were gunned down by the armed squad members, she told police. Jamui SP (in-charge) Rakesh Kumar said police have launched a combing operation in the area. The village Barjor Tola is located on the hilly terrain and close to Jharkhand border. One live cartridge and a few used cartridges were recovered from the spot. The reason behind the incident is yet to be ascertained. “The bodies were handed over to the family after postmortem,” the SP added. The deceased's family had earlier been associated with the Maoist outfit operating in the district. Chatur's two other sons-- Ainus Hembram and Sunil Hembram--were earlier arrested by the police for their involvement in Maoist activities. The locals said that while Sunil was released on bail recently, his elder brother Ainus is still languishing in jail. The murder of the father-son duo has sent shock waves among the residents of the area. Jamui, which shares its border with Jharkhand, is still considered to be one of the worst Red-hit districts in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/maoists-kill-father-son-duo-in-jamui/articleshow/85669024.cms||Ramashankar

Mobile phones export for the period stood at Rs 4,600 crore compared to Rs 1,300 crore in the same period last year, as per the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), the apex body for mobile and electronics industry. Sequentially mobile phone exports fell from Rs 8,636 crore in the January to March 2021 period. Electronic goods exports doubled in April-June crossing the Rs 20,000 crore mark. “Despite the second wave of Covid-19, prudent policy of GoI to continue the manufacturing and backed by the PLI scheme, industry has made significant progress in manufacturing and exports,” Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman, India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) said, noting that India still has a long way to go as a global exporter. Imports of mobile phones were also at an all-time low since 2014-15 as the quarter’s imports stood at Rs 600 crore compared to Rs 3,100 crore for the similar period last year. However, given the rising demand for computers (desktops, tablets and laptops), imports in laptops and tablet categories recorded over 50% growth in the period at Rs 10,000 crore. In January to March too, import value of laptops and tablets stood at Rs 9,597 crore, as per ICEA data. “Our endeavor is to replicate the success of mobile phone manufacturing in India to ‘IT hardware’ (Desktops, Laptops and Tablets). We are working with the Government to create suitable policy intervention to support and create an ecosystem to build large scale manufacturing of these products in India and cater to at-least 25% of the global requirement,” Mohindroo said. Sasikumar Gendham, India MD for electronics maker Salcomp said demand is robust and production is back to normal. The shortage of materials like ICs (integrated circuits) in China and the availability and cost of containers for exports are some factors still hampering exports, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mobile-exports-grew-250-yoy-in-apr-june/articleshow/85668047.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

On Wednesday, the state’s crisis management committee had allowed reopening of educational institutions, including coaching centres, at full strength from August 26. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary had told this newspaper that in view of a major decline in number Covid cases in the state, the government finally decided to allow the educational institutions to run with 100% attendance on all working days. “Due to 50% attendance, the progress in course work and syllabus completion had slowed down as teachers had to teach one topic for two consecutive days. With full strength in classroom on all six days, the schools and colleges will be able to cover up the academic losses and complete the syllabus on time,” he had said. “As per our finding, 30-35% attendance was being registered in schools because the parents were reluctant to let their kids join offline classes. The ICMR’s recent finding showed children are safer than adults as far as corona infection in concerned. It had suggested that the primary schools be opened first. However, we are doing it in a reverse way. Parents are being encouraged to send their kids to schools,” the minister said. Association of Independent Schools-Bihar, comprising all CBSE and CISCE-affiliated schools, will chart out the plan for regular classes from next week. Rajiv Ranjan Sinha, general secretary of the association, said a plan would be prepared to run schools with full attendance by ensuring safety of kids and staff. “Reopening of educational institutions in full strength is a good move, but providing safe environment to the students and staff is also the responsibility of the schools. We will hold a meeting with heads of all the schools this week and take their suggestions,” he said. G K Choudhary, vice-chancellor of Patna University, said offline classes would run simultaneously for those students who are unable to attend regular classes. “Exams are being held in all colleges for the final-year students,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/schools-colleges-gear-up-to-hold-classes-at-full-strength/articleshow/85669549.cms||Faryal Rumi

In this case, three persons – Trilokchand Sharma, Biharilal Sharma and Ramsnehi Subedar – were booked by Shaherkotda police in 1968 under sections 407, 414 and 114 of IPC, for criminal breach of trust after being entrusted with property as carriers and for assisting in concealment of stolen property and abetment. They were granted bail by the court. In 1969, when the court summoned them for the trial, only Trilokchand turned up. There was no information about the whereabouts of Sharma and Subedar. In absence of two accused, the court separated Trilokchand’s case and it came to an end the same year on June 2, 1969. On the other hand, the court continued to issue non-bailable warrants and even declared the other accused as absconders. However, they remained untraceable and the case went into the section of ‘dormant case’ file in 2002. As more than 50 years passed after filing of the case, principal sessions judge Shubhada Baxi initiated the process for disposal. She asked the public prosecutor to raise the issue of this long pending case and for its disposal. Accordingly, public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt on August 5 wrote to Ahmedabad district magistrate and requested him to use the government’s powers under section 321 of the CrPC to withdraw the case. The prosecutor told the district magistrate that enough efforts were made to secure the presence of both the accused in court, but they did not yield any result. There is no possibility of any fruitful result even in future also, particularly when the accused persons were absconding for more than half a century. Moreover, the criminal charges levelled in the case entail punishment up to seven years only. The district collector accepted the proposal to withdraw the case on August 12. The public prosecutor’s office accordingly filed an application in the court for withdrawal of the case. On August 17, the principal sessions judge accepted the proposal for withdrawal of the case and disposed of the sessions case. The court recorded that there is no possibility of tracing the accused persons in future and there was no point in continuing with the criminal proceedings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/53-years-later-abads-oldest-pending-criminal-case-disposed/articleshow/85669297.cms||Saeed Khan

The visitors, however, were told to follow all the safety guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus. More than 25,000 devotees flocked to Mahavir Temple near the Patna Junction on Day 1. All of them wore masks and underwent thermal screening. “We expect the footfalls to increase in the next few days,” Acharya Kishore Kunal, the secretary of the Mahavir Mandir Trust, told this newspaper on Thursday. The Khajpura Shiv Mandir also opened its gates for visitors from 6am to 12pm and 2.30pm to 9pm on Day 1. Everyone was seen following Covid safety norms on the premises of the temple. A devotee, Sangeeta Singh, said, “I was eagerly waiting for the temple to reopen. It was quite satisfying to see that all the devotees wore masks and maintained social distancing.” With a view to avoiding huge gatherings, the ISKCON Temple on Budh Marg allowed devotees to enter the campus one by one. They were all wearing masks and properly sanitised. “Although we organise a grand event on the occasion of Krishna Janmashtami every year, we are planning to keep the celebrations simple this time,” Mohan Prabhu, a member of the temple, claimed. The entry of devotees was also restricted at a Hanuman temple in Nepali Nagar. Its priest, Sunil Tiwari, pointed out, “We asked everyone to stick to the Covid safety norms.” The Harihar Nath Temple in Sonepur, however, witnessed low footfalls on the first day. It remained open from 5am to 12pm and 2pm to 9pm. Baba Bambam, the temple’s head priest, said, “Only a few devotees came to the temple on Day 1.” A local, Shraddha Singh, was excited to visit the Harihar Nath Temple after months. She said, “I had been waiting for the temple to reopen.” The Jama Masjid near the Patna Junction along with 250 other mosques in the city also reopened on Thursday. Maulana Mohd Alam Quasmi, the convenor of Tanzeem Tehreek Aiemma Masjid (an association of Imams in Bihar), pointed out that all the 105 mosques, which are part of the association, had opened and were following Covid safety protocols. “Mats, curtains, and carpets were removed from all the mosques so that the devotees could offer namaz on the floor. Their premises were also sanitised properly,” he added.

Speaking at the ninth convocation ceremony of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, the President said: “During my visit to the state, I got an opportunity to know more on the initiatives taken to implement the new education policy. The dedicated and intensive efforts taken by the government for the betterment of the education system in the state is commendable.” As education is the most effective means to establish social justice and for personal growth of an individual, it is important to strengthen this sector for any place to progress, he stated. “The efforts of the UP government to enhance the standard of education in the state are ‘exemplary’. I would like to express my deepest appreciation to the governor, the CM as well as his team,” Kovind said. The President, who arrived on Thursday on a four-day visit, also praised the UP government for 'working with a development-oriented approach for welfare of people and bringing in the rule of law in the state'. Taking pride in laying the foundation stone of a girl’s hostel named after social-reformer Savitribai Phule, who is regarded as the country's first female teacher, the President said, “Nearly 175 years ago, the revolutionary steps Savitribai took to improve women’s rights are bearing fruits. The performance of daughters in the Tokyo Olympics has instilled a sense of pride in the entire country. They proved that if given an opportunity, they will leave behind boys.” Kovind further stated, “Our daughters are excelling in every field. The fact that the number of daughters is more than the sons among the promising medal winners in the convocation shows that the state is moving towards growth and development. With the success of daughters, I can now see Babasaheb’s dream of providing equal opportunities to all coming true,” Kovind said. Urging the graduating students to draw inspiration from social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar, Kovind said only a great personality like him could stand tall facing oppositions for his initiatives for women in all sectors. “We can’t even imagine how societal concerns were in those times when thinking of women rights and other issues he raised was no less than a crime. Only through his concerted approach, he changed the nation’s fate,” Kovind said. Exhorting students to lead from the front when India celebrates its 100 years of Independence in 2047, the President said, “Youth play a vital role in nation building and can take the nation to great heights. I wish to see India a developed country, free from all biases in 2047.” Earlier, the President appreciated the various steps taken by BBAU to highlight social concerns and provide access to the disadvantaged. “By awarding medals to meritorious students from marginalised sections is applaudable,” said Kovind. 'Become a job giver': The President also called upon the students to turn entrepreneurs and become job creators rather than job-seekers. Stating figures, he said India today has 100 unicorns which are startups valued over $1 billion each, and that the estimated market capitalization of these unicorns cross the 19 lakh crore-mark. India today is among the top three countries in start-ups, most of which are established by the youth.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/prez-lauds-yogi-govt-efforts-to-strengthen-ups-education-sector/articleshow/85672332.cms||Isha Jain

Of the 717 new cases across the state on Thursday, 118 were from the city — a jump of 29 from that of Wednesday. The last time Kolkata had fresh cases in three digits was on July 4, with 111 cases and 3 deaths. On Thursday, however, the city recorded only one death. North 24 Parganas on Thursday logged 97 cases, only three short of hitting the century. On Wednesday the district reported 89 new cases. Kolkata currently has 1,013 active cases and North 24 Parganas has 1,133, the highest for any district. Health experts said the rise in number is a matter of concern, but added they need to see if the trend persists to conclude anything significant. However, they stressed on the importance of following Covid-appropriate behaviour to stay protected.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kol-fresh-cases-in-3-digits-after-nearly-8-weeks/articleshow/85667836.cms||---

Incidentally, Prasad is also the state’s finance, commercial taxes and urban development minister, besides being the minister incharge of Bhagalpur district. State JD(U) president Umesh Kushwaha said he has served a show-cause notice on Mandal and sought an explanation from him on his conduct. Last Saturday, Mandal had slammed Prasad for not inviting him to the “review” meetings he had held at Naugachhia, Nathnagar and Bhagalpur. Mandal also alleged that Prasad, while at Naugachhia and Bhagalpur, had not only moved around with the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leaders from Bhagalpur, but also attended to a luncheon meet hosted by one of them. Mandal took the names of about six such local LJP leaders. In fact, Gopal, while displaying his anger against Prasad at the press conference at Bhagalpur, crossed the boundary, when he accused him of coming to Bhagalpur for “extorting money” from the traditional business-class people and traders. “It is not justifiable for him (Prasad) to remain deputy CM in the NDA government. He should resign. The senior leaders should remove him from the government,” Mandal had said. Ironically, Mandal had made the accusations two days before an 11-member delegation of 10 political parties, including the BJP and JD(U) led by Nitish, was to meet PM Narendra Modi in Delhi on August 23 on their demand regarding caste-based census in the country. “In his display of anger in the public domain against deputy CM, Mandal also touched on a host of issues that have bearing on the relations between the NDA partners in the state. For, the two parties, at present, are also engaged in rebuilding and strengthening their organisations. It has resulted in inner tension between the two major parties in the Bihar NDA. The fresh problem between them erupted because of that,” an observer said. The BJP has mounted a concerted attack on Mandal, demanding action against him. The BJP had earlier taken action against its MLC Tunna Pandey for making “undignified” remarks against CM Nitish Kumar. Among those who demanded action against Madal was the party’s state president Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal and ministers in the Nitish-led NDA government – Mangal Pandey, Nitin Navin, Neeraj Kumar Singh Babloo and Samrat Choudhary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/jdu-seeks-explanation-from-its-mla-for-remarks-against-bihars-deputy-cm/articleshow/85669316.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Business||PhonePe gets nod as account aggregator||MUMBAI: Walmart-owned PhonePe has said that its wholly owned subsidiary has received an in-principle approval to operate as an account aggregator. The RBI has introduced the concept of account aggregator, or AA, in 2016. This enables one set of financial entities to obtain customer information residing with another set through the AA platform, once the customer provides consent. This improves the availability of financial services and competition as the customer is no longer tied to one provider. The entities where the customer already holds an account are financial information providers (FIPs) and they can be banks, insurance companies and mutual funds. The GST department is also expected to participate as an FIP. These entities can also act as financial information users (FIUs). According to ‘Sahmati’, a collective of the AA system, the aggregator acts as a conduit between FIUs and FIPs and does not process the data. An AA is ‘data-blind’ as the information that flows through it is encrypted and can be processed only by the FIU for whom the data is intended. Also, an AA does not and cannot store any user’s data. Thus, the potential for leakage and misuse of user’s data is prevented. Commenting on the development, PhonePe CTO & co-founder Rahul Chari said, “Our AA technology stack will enable any FIU to instantly retrieve financial information with customer consent from the FIP. We are looking forward to working closely with all the industry stakeholders to take forward RBI’s vision of driving deeper financial inclusion across the country.” Other entities that have already received an AA licence from the RBI are Cookiejar Technologies, FinSec AA Technologies, NESL Asset Data, and CAMSfinserv.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/phonepe-gets-nod-as-a/c-aggregator/articleshow/85670717.cms||---
---||Patna||Arwal among 10 districts sans PG teaching centres||PATNA: The state government has decided to extend the facility of postgraduate (PG) teaching in every district. At present, no higher education institute in 10 of the 38 districts imparts PG teaching in any subject. A decision in this regard was taken at a high-level meeting of the state education department held under the chairmanship of education minister, Vijay Kumar Choudhary, on Thursday. The participants discussed ways to enhance higher education opportunities for the youths with a view to increasing the state’s gross enrolment ratio (GER). Later, the minister told this reporter that Supaul, Gopalganj, Kaimur, Kishanganj, Lakhisarai, Jamui, Arwal, Banka, Nawada, and Sheohar districts did not have a single college offering PG courses. “A number of institutions and people’s representatives have been urging the education department to introduce PG teaching in the existing degree colleges. If such a demand is made by a college located in any of these 10 districts, it will be okayed by the government on a priority basis. The proposal should, however, be duly forwarded by a competent authority,” he said. Choudhary also claimed that the proposals received from B S S College in Supaul and K K M College in Jamui had already been cleared and a notification for starting PG teaching would be issued soon. “In the remaining districts, an approval for running PG programmes will be granted as soon as a proposal is received,” he added. The government has already decided to open at least one degree college in each subdivision. “There are altogether 11 subdivisions without any degree college yet. Hence, suitable plots of land are being procured,” said Choudhary. Besides, at least one Plus II school has been established in each of the 8,386 panchayats. Steps have also been initiated to upgrade the existing Plus II schools as degree colleges.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/arwal-among-10-districts-sans-pg-teaching-centres/articleshow/85669377.cms||B K Mishra

Resident nuns of Missionaries of Charity held mass and thanksgiving at the saint’s tomb, but public participation was largely online, with Catholic Association of Bengal (CAB) organizing and streaming an hour-long programme from Mother House in the afternoon. A special morning mass was held at the Archbishop House on Park Street. Dominic Gomes, vicar general of the Archdiocese of Calcutta, said. “We prayed to her to make us her agents of peace. We need her blessings and love in this broken world.” Later, priests and staff of the Archbishop House sang Mother’s favourite hymns, starting with Channel of Peace, while Gomes played the accordion. “The public took part from afar, on the CAB Facebook page, as we prayed for safety and peace around the world, especially Afghanistan,” CAB president Angelina Mantosh Jasnani said. Last year, too, CAB had made arrangements for online participation of the mass held at St Thomas’ Church. Only 30 had physically attended the mass last year. Fr Moloy DeCosta, Dean of Kolkata, Fr Orson Wells, Fr Devraj Fernandes, CAB member Colin Fitzgerald and Harish Mergaramani, president, Sindhi Panchayat were present at Thursday’s event at Mother House. Mother Teresa is the CAB’s patron saint. CAB will organize an interfaith prayer at Allen Park on her Feast Day on September 5, the day she passed away in 1997.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/prayer-for-peace-on-st-teresa-birth-anniv/articleshow/85667904.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

He also criticised the Congress for not conducting caste census in the country when it was in power. Kushwaha, who recently merged his RLSP with JD(U), said all the political parties in Bihar were united on the issue of caste census. “This is a people’s issue and all parties in the state have batted for it,” he added. While interacting with mediapersons here before leaving for Muzaffarpur, Kushwaha said, “Majority in BJP were in favour of caste-based census. The party should resolve its inner conflict. There is no technical issue in carrying out caste-based census. Nothing is difficult in today’s digital era. Just one extra column has to be added to facilitate holding of caste census.” Criticising the Congress, Kushwaha said, “Today Congress is in favour of caste census, which is good. However, when a consensus in this regard had evolved in 2010 in the Parliament, the Congress failed to initiate the process.” Meanwhile, the BJP advised Kushwaha not to interfere on this issue as talks are on between two senior leaders – PM Narendra Modi and CM Nitish. BJP state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel said, “When two senior leaders are holding parleys over the issue, others should stop commenting on it. There is no conflict in the BJP on this issue and the PM is capable enough to take a decision.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/kushwaha-bjp-must-resolve-inner-conflict-on-caste-census/articleshow/85669199.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Chandigarh||Haryana govt to change its GST rules, software after Panipat scam||CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government has decided to amend its rules and software to prevent people from claiming undue GST input tax credit (ITC) on the basis of bills generated without any actual movement of goods. The state’s revenue loss in a recent goods and services tax scam in Panipat district exceeded Rs 100 crore. A formal statement about rule amendment came from excise department additional chief secretary Anurag Rastogi, who submitted it in the Punjab and Haryana high court during the hearing of a petition related to the Panipat GST scam. Rastogi stated that besides changing rules and software for preventing ITC frauds, the state will also recover the stolen tax or attach properties for its realization, for any amount of more than Rs 8 crore. The high court had sought the assistance of all concerned departments and agencies the on the issue. Representing the state police, DGP (crime) Mohammad Akil had submitted that evidence and supplementary police report were being prepared. In the Panipat scam status report, superintendent of police Shashank Kumar Sawan submitted that a special investigation team (SIT) of Panipat’s special detective unit was on job under the supervision of Samalkha ASP Pooja Vashishth. The status report cites Panipat excise and taxation department’s finding that 46 firms did business with Ganesh Trading Company, raising invoices for a total of Rs 1,29,52,83,371 (Rs 129.5 crore), resulting in a total tax consideration of Rs 9,68,67,081 (Rs 9.68 crore). Till July 27 this year, 26 of those 46 firms had deposited Rs 6,43,16,298 (Rs 6.43 crore) in lieu of the ITC claimed, while ITC of Rs 1,14,51,151 (Rs 1.14 crore) was blocked for 14 firms because of suspicious transactions. However, the balance Rs 2,10,99,632 (Rs 2.10 crore) is yet to be recovered. The case was registered in March 2019 on a written complaint from the excise and taxation officer (state tax) of Panipat’s ward 6. Ganesh Trading was accused of showing big sales to different dealers and using those fake bills to claim undue input tax credit. No firm of this name existed at the given address. The fake bills were for Rs 119 crore and the mentioned dealers were in Panipat, Rewari, Sirsa, Maharashtra, and Delhi. Tax worth crores of rupees was evaded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/hry-to-change-its-gst-rules-software-after-panipat-scam/articleshow/85670309.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Business||No GST on nominal sum companies deduct for canteen||MUMBAI: In a ruling given to Tata Motors, the Gujarat bench of the Authority of Advance Rulings (AAR) has held that no goods and services tax (GST) will be levied on the nominal amount recovered from employees for canteen facilities, which is passed on by the company to the third-party caterer. To cater to the needs of employees, corporate entities typically arrange for canteen services, where the meals are served by a third-party caterer. A part of the amount (albeit, a very nominal sum) is recovered from the employees and issues relating to levy of GST often arise. Tata Motors explained in its submission that it was recovering this nominal amount on a monthly basis, by way of a salary deduction, to ensure that the canteen is used only by its employees. It added that a press release issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (CBIC) had clarified that supply by the employer to the employee in terms of contractual agreements of employment (part of cost to company) is not subject to GST. As it was not in the business of providing canteen services, recovery of this nominal amount should not constitute a taxable ‘supply’. While factories and offices providing essential services are humming with activity, other workplaces are also gearing up to open their doors to employees, even if under a hybrid model. No doubt, office canteens will again buzz with activity — perhaps with social distancing norms. Thus, this ruling will be of great help to corporate entities facing a similar situation. While advance rulings do not set a judicial precedent, they have persuasive value in assessments. This AAR ruling is consistent with the stand taken by the Maharashtra AAR in another case. On the flip side, as regards the query on whether input tax credit is available to the company on GST charged by the third-party caterer, the AAR held that it is blocked credit and is inadmissible.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-gst-on-nominal-sum-cos-deduct-for-canteen/articleshow/85670577.cms||---

Later, a police party led by superintendent of police Prashant Verma rushed to the spot under the Chhibramau Kotwali police station limits on receiving information that the police team, which along with Nagar Palika staff and revenue department officials had gone to remove a statue of Lord Buddha installed by a group of people at Saurikh tri-section without permission, was attacked. Local residents had installed the statue late on Tuesday night. When the police team, along with Nagar Palika squad and revenue officials, attempted to remove the statue, the mob that had been objecting to the statue removal suddenly started to pelt stones on them. “The mob had attacked police personnel from atop roofs of the nearby markets,” a police officer said. Making use of the high-rise markets, the mob pelted stones on the police force. Though the police managed to control the mob, by resorting to force, by then the inspector Chhibramau and a few other police personnel had suffered injuries. Inspector, Chhibramau, Vinod Kumar Mishra, sustained injuries. He has been admitted to a hospital. Superintendent of police Prashant Verma said that the statue has been kept at Saurikh Tiraha without permission. “Trouble- makers have pelted stones. We are in the process of identifying them with the help of CCTV footage. Information about the injured police personnel is being sought. Strict action will be taken against the problem makers,” said SP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/police-inspector-other-cops-injured-in-stone-pelting-by-mob-in-kannauj/articleshow/85669730.cms||---

While the water discharge through Valmiki Nagar barrage across the Gandak kept on fluctuating on Thursday from the low of 1.63 lakh cusecs at 6am to 2.05 lakh cusecs at noon, it settled at 1.97 lakh cusecs by the afternoon. On the other hand, the water discharge through the Birpur barrage in Supaul district rose slightly from 1.50 lakh cusecs in the morning to 1.58 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. However, even as the Bagmati was flowing below the danger level all along its downstream, its water level showed a rising trend. In contrast, the Kamla was flowing 25cm above the danger mark at Jainagar and 1.50 metres above the danger level at Jhanjharpur. Punpun was also flowing 25cm above the red sign on the eastern outskirts of Patna. Otherwise, all the other rivers, like the Burhi Gandak and the Mahananda were flowing below the danger level, while the Ganga was also flowing below the red sign at all places along its downstream, barring at Hathidah, Kahalgaon and Farakka.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/flood-scare-as-downpour-leads-to-rise-in-water-level-of-rivers-in-bihar/articleshow/85668978.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Chief secretary led panel gets 3 weeks to file report on GO 111||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Thursday gave three weeks’ time to the chief secretary-led bureaucrats’ committee to finalise and furnish its report on GO 111 issues pertaining to the catchment and non-catchment areas of Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar. The state government was directed to take a decision on the recommendations of this committee by the end of September. “The report of the CS committee must be kept in the public domain,” a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said after hearing an implead plea in a batch of petitions pertaining to GO 111. The petition was filed by Agni Agro Tech Limited, which has 17 acres of land at Vatti Nagulapalli village and wants the land parcel to be removed from the purview of GO 111 on the grounds that it was located outside the catchment areas defined by the GO. Finding fault with the state for not prescribing any outer time limit for the CS committee for furnishing its report, the bench said: “This committee stands disbanded if it fails to furnish its report by September 13. Since the authorities sought four weeks’ time on August 13 for the committee to enable it to complete its task, we are giving four weeks from August 13.” Noting that the CS committee did not have in its terms of reference the issue of non-catchment areas, the bench included them in the agenda before the CS-led committee. “You have to keep in view the report furnished by the EPTRI in May 2006 which spoke about 948 acres of non-catchment areas at Vatti Nagulapalli that could be removed from GO 111,” the bench said. KS Murthy, counsel for environmentalist S Jeevanand Reddy, described the current implead petition as a handiwork of realtors who are hell-bent on seeing GO 111 scrapped. “If the government is interested in diluting the GO, let it take a call. But, this court should not be seen as responsible for the same,” he said. Jeevanand wants the GO to remain intact to protect the twin reservoirs. Though additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao began his argument seeking more time for the state to act, he succeeded in securing a month’s time for the state. His argument that the report of the EPTRI 13 years ago was irrelevant now did not go down well with the bench. The bench asked the CS to file an affidavit, conveying the state’s action plan to complete the task.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cs-panel-gets-3-weeks-to-file-report-on-go-111/articleshow/85670353.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Business||Pharma to hit $60bn mkt size in 2 yrs on generics||Mumbai: The domestic pharma industry is expected to grow about 11% over the next two years to cross $60 billion in market size, driven by generic opportunities available globally, according to a study. With an existing market size of around $45 billion in FY21, the industry ranks third globally in terms of volume, and 13th in terms of value. The main drivers, said the study by CARE Ratings, include ability to leverage the opportunity available for Indian pharma companies due to patent expiries of drugs globally, ebbing of regulatory risks and de-risking strategies from dependency on China for key raw materials. The solid fundamentals of the industry and increasing trend of PE investments will also contribute to the growth, it adds. Exploiting these opportunities, CARE Ratings expects the credit risk profiles of its rated entities to remain stable to positive during FY22 and FY23. The domestic pharma market, which was about $18 billion during FY17, has exhibited a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5% to reach $21 billion during FY21. Further, pharma exports, which totalled $17 billion during FY17, have reported a CAGR of 10% to touch $24 billion during FY21. Especially during the last fiscal, on account of the increase in the demand for Covid-related drugs, exports have grown by 18%. Thus, on account of better export growth rate, the contribution of domestic to exports has changed from 52:48 during FY17 to 47:53 during FY21. CARE Ratings expects that with better prospects in regulated and semi-regulated markets, the contribution of domestic to exports would widen to 45:55 by FY23.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pharma-to-hit-60bn-mkt-size-in-2-yrs-on-generics/articleshow/85670963.cms||---

Ghosh (83), sister of actor Robin Majumdar, is survived by her husband, elocutionist Partha Ghosh, and son Ayan. Known for her work on Tagore poems, like ‘Karna Kunti Sangbad’, ‘Shesher Kabita’ and ‘Bisarjan’, Ghosh started off in the All-India Radio as a selection-grade announcer and enthralled the audience for decades. Critically acclaimed for her pronunciation and voice, Ghosh’s death marks the end of an era in Bengali recitation. A student of Bengali literature, Ghosh’s renditions of classical and contemporary Bengali poetry shot her to prominence. “Her pronunciation and art of phonetics have inspired generations,” said singer Lopamudra Mitra. “She had been a mother figure to the elocutionist community,” said artist Bratati Bandyopadhyay. Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said: “Her unique recitals will always be remembered by the countless listeners, poetry enthusiasts.” In 2018, Ghosh was bestowed with the state’s Kazi Sabyasachi Samman. She was an AIR announcer and broadcaster during the Bangladesh Liberation War, and wrote features on war and genocide, and was awarded the Friends of Liberation War Honour by Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina. She also acted in Rituparno Ghosh’s movie ‘Asukh’ and Nabyendu Ghosh’s ‘Atmaja’. Ghosh’s mortal remains were taken to her Dum Dum home and then to the Academy to allow people to pay their respects.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/end-of-an-era-in-recitation-as-gouri-ghosh-passes-away/articleshow/85667972.cms||Rohit Khanna

Kolkata woke up to a cloudy sky, but barring a few spells of drizzles, it remained relatively dry till evening when the showers intensified. A ‘secondary monsoon trough’, that now passes through Bihar, Odisha and south Bengal, triggered the rain, said the Met office. Kolkata received 3.5mm rain till 5.30pm. The city will get light to moderate rain on Friday, but heavy showers were ruled out. The temperature, too, could drop. “The rain has lowered the temperature and humidity. It will now be pleasant,” said RMC director G K Das. Some areas, like Maniktala, Beliaghata, Muktarambabu Street, Camac Street, Bhowanipore, Behala, and pockets off Bypass and CR Avenue, became waterlogged. Districts like Nadia, Murshidabad, North and South 24 Parganas, East and West Burdwan and Birbhum also received heavy showers on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/heavy-evening-rain-lashes-city-leaves-pockets-waterlogged/articleshow/85667937.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: Prakash Velip opts out of Quepem race, says time for ‘full stop’||MARGAO: In what could come as a welcome breather for deputy chief minister and Quepem MLA Chandrakant Kavlekar ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, senior BJP functionary and former minister Prakash Velip has veered towards taking a decision against contesting the elections from Quepem constituency this time. “I have contested eight elections – won four and lost four. This sets me thinking, I have been in politics for a very long time already, how much longer should I continue with politics? Sometimes you need to give a full stop,” Velip said while speaking to reporters. TOI was the first to report about the indication given by Velip about his reluctance to contest the 2022 elections earlier this month after he had remained evasive over whether he would stake claim for the party ticket from Quepem constituency, even while stressing that he would support any candidate finaliSed by the party. “I contested my first election when I was 31. Now I have completed 68 years of my life. How many more years should one be in politics?” Velip had then said in a cryptic reply to a query. Nevertheless, Velip said he was being constantly persuaded by his supporters to contest the elections. “I myself find this puzzling. People tend to forget a candidate after he loses a single election. However, despite my loss in four elections, people haven’t forgotten me. I am getting at least 10 calls everyday from my supporters asking me to contest and pledging their support to me,” he said. However, careful enough not to render himself out of reckoning already, Velip said, “If we do decide to contest, I can give a very good fight. People of Quepem are with me.” Velip has been a four-time MGP MLA since 1984 before joining BJP. However, he quit BJP and contested the 2012 assembly elections as an independent but lost to Congress candidate Chandrakant Kavlekar. He rejoined BJP in 2016 at the behest of former chief minister Manohar Parrikar and contested the 2017 assembly elections on BJP ticket, only to lose once again to Kavlekar. With Kavlekar who has so far won the Quepem seat for four terms on a trot, likely to contest the 2022 assembly elections on the BJP ticket for the first time, opposition forces have been bracing themselves up to challenge him. Under these circumstances, the task would have been tougher for BJP had Velip decided to stake claim for the party ticket, or in the event of denial, rebelled and fought against Kavlekar. Velip’s change of heart was all the more apparent over the last few days when he – once a bête noire of Kavlekar - was being seen together with Kavlekar at many public functions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/velip-opts-out-of-quepem-race-says-time-for-full-stop/articleshow/85670366.cms||---

Whatever was constructed by the Congress, you people are destroying them. This should be stopped immediately,” Sardinha said. Referring to shortage of sand in the state, Sardinha urged chief minister Pramod Sawant to take steps to identify and earmark sites for legal mining of sand. “Identify sites away from bridges and bunds so that environment is protected and sand available at controlled prices. Rates of sand have soared tremendously,” Sardinha said. Stating that law and order situation in the state has declined steeply, Sardinha demanded that culprits involved in criminal activities be dealt with an iron hand. Referring to allegations about government jobs being sold, Sardinha urged the chief minister to “see to it that people get jobs on merit”. “Unemployment in the state has grown. The government should give permanent jobs to people,” Sardinha said. With regards to the Major Ports Bill, Sardinha urged the chief minister to pass a resolution in the state legislative assembly expressing its objections over the extension of jurisdiction of Mormugao Port Trust beyond the port limits. “Let’s have an all-party meeting with the prime minister,” he said. Speaking on mining and tourism, the two sectors that were the backbone of the state’s economy, Sardinha urged the chief minister to take immediate steps for their resumption. “In the interest of the state if I can be of any help in the Parliament, I am there with you. Resume mining as early as possible,” he said. Replying to a query over his meeting with Congress observer P Chidambaram who was on a two-day Goa visit, Sardinha said, “I have told the leadership whatever I had to say. It is now upto them to take the decisions.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/centres-asset-monetisation-will-destroy-psus-sardinha/articleshow/85670400.cms||---

Retailers, though, are not ready to pass on the benefit to consumers. In the retail market, the kitchen staple is being sold at Rs 25-30 a kg. Wholesale traders are unhappy about the diminishing prices, so are farmers as it becomes unviable to even send the produce to the market. Sunil Sanas, a wholesaler from Vashi APMC, said: “Prices were Rs 8 to Rs 10 a week ago, which dropped to Rs 3 to Rs 6 on Thursday. It was the lowest this season due to robust production in Narayangaon, Junnar, Nashi and Pune. The government should regulate retail prices.” Over 70 truckloads of tomatoes, out of 650 of all vegetables, arrived at the APMC market on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-tomato-crashes-to-rs-3-6-a-kg-in-wholesale-mkt-but-retails-at-rs-25/articleshow/85670430.cms||B B Nayak

Nodal officer and additional chief medical officer Dr Teerath Lal told TOI, “We have set a target to administer as many as 88,000 doses to eligible recipients in the district on Friday under the mega drive. Jabs will be given to beneficiaries at 315 sites on Friday.” Notably, Prayagraj district had already set a record for administering highest number of jabs in the state. As many as 90,483 jabs were given to recipients of all age groups in the district on August 5 under a special single-day immunization drive in the state. Lal, meanwhile, said that the department aimed to cover maximum number of recipients in a single-day mega campaign. As many as 16,21,005 jabs have been administered to beneficiaries of all age groups till August 25, including 12,89,130 recipients of first dose and 3,31,875 recipients of second dose. Moreover, officials of the district health department have set a target of administering the Covid vaccine to around 42.39 lakh people, including 29 lakh recipients aged between 18 and 44 years and 12.87 lakh above 45 years of age. Men are still outnumbering women in Covid-19 vaccination drive in Prayagraj. Figures claimed that out of 16,21,005 people vaccinated among all age groups, only 41% (6,64,104) were women against 58% (9,56,303) were men. Health officials found many reasons behind this gender slant such as lack of intervention and inability of many rural women to reach a vaccination site on their own. However, a series of awareness camps and promotional drives were taken up in rural areas to promote vaccination among women. Moreover, women population in Prayagraj district stands at around 49% of the total 42.39 lakh recipients who are to be vaccinated. Efforts are on to encourage women in rural pockets, particularly those aged above 45 years, who show lesser interest in vaccination. Health workers are running from pillar to post to convince them to take jabs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/88000-recipients-to-be-covered-under-mega-drive-today/articleshow/85670018.cms||---
---||Delhi||'Bikini' hip surgery at AIIMS-Delhi boon for patients||NEW DELHI: At least 20 patients, mostly women in their late 20s and 30s, have undergone hip replacement surgery at AIIMS using a modified technique in which the incision is made within the skin fold of the bikini line or the frontal groin crease. The surgery is often referred to as “bikini hip replacement surgery”. Dr Rajesh Malhotra, professor and head of orthopaedics at AIIMS, told TOI that unlike the conventional approach for conducting hip replacement, which leaves behind a noticeable scar, the modified technique is done in a manner that few can tell surgery has been done even if the patient wears a bikini. “Very few centres in the world do this surgery. It’s challenging and takes longer than usual, but we decided to adopt it to help young women who are hesitant to undergo the procedure for fear of the residual scar,” added Malhotra. There are three main approaches for a hip replacement surgery. In the posterior approach, the surgeon makes an incision on the back of the hip joint and cuts the gluteus maximus muscle to remove the damaged joint and replaces it with artificial parts. In the anterolateral approach, the incision is made on the outer side of the thigh. In the anterior approach, a vertical incision is made on the front of the hip to replace the joints without cutting or splitting the muscles. The bikini surgery is a modified version of the anterior approach where the surgeons make a horizontal incision along the bikini line to ensure minimal scar. Further, special cosmetic stitches are used to minimise the noticeability of the scar. Malhotra said the operation through the bikini incision, which is only 6-8cm in width, was more challenging than the other approaches because the field of vision and operation was less. “It needs a lot of experience and the right selection of patients to succeed,” he added. AIIMS conducted the first such surgery last year. Till date, 20 surgeries have been performed. Nine patients suffered from avascular necrosis of the head of the femur, six patients had a history of damage to the hip joints due to rheumatoid arthritis, two others suffered from arthritis caused due to lupus and bone damage due to tuberculosis, and one patient developed avascular necrosis of the hip and extreme pain post-Covid. Most of the patients were young women. A mini-review on the psychology of scars published in the journal Psychiatria Danubina in 2018 stated that scarring may be skin deep, but psychological impact went deeper. “The evidence is decisive; the presence of scars can result in clear markers of mental disturbance in patients with associated symptoms of depression, anger, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. A scar creates physical, emotional and psychological marks. Identity is called into question and individuals must integrate the scar with their sense of self to achieve psychological acceptance. This process causes a change of behaviour and reduced functioning, socially and psychologically, driven by the fear of being singled out. Hiding the scars relieves maladaptive behaviour and often leads to a return to normal functioning.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/a-bikini-masks-hip-surgery-scar-at-aiims/articleshow/85668130.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Do not allow this temple vicinity to be crowded by private buildings as was done in the case of Golconda Fort and Qutub Shahi tombs in Hyderabad, said a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy while resuming the hearing in a PIL that was seeking immediate steps to protect the temple and precincts in tune with the world heritage norms to secure and retain the world heritage tag for the temple. The high court, it may be recalled, converted a news item published by the Times of India into a PIL and called for immediate steps for preserving and showcasing the pristine beauty of the temple. Assistant Solicitor General Namavarapu Rajeswara Rao informed the court that the committee set up by the high court for the purpose had met on August 4 under the leadership of superintendent archeologist of the archeological survey of India and acquired 14 acres of the land around Ramappa temple along with two smaller temples in the area. We fixed the boundaries, he said. Unesco’s first suggestion was met this way, he added. He also said that the remaining steps suggested by World Heritage Committee in its comprehensive conservation and management plan need to be completed by December 2022 and not by December 2021 as was thought earlier. The state’s special counsel Harender Pershad informed the bench that the chief secretary convened a meeting with the relevant authorities and all steps are being taken with the required urgency keeping in view the fact that this is a prestigious achievement for the state and the country. The ASG placed the minutes of the meeting of the joint conservation committee before the court. The bench, while asking the authorities to ensure that no ecological damage is caused in course of promoting tourism in the area, adjourned the case to September 29.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-do-not-allow-ramappa-precincts-to-go-golconda-fort-way/articleshow/85670361.cms||---

The HC shared a link on its website for people who want to witness the farewell online. The ceremony will be held at the first court at 2.30pm. The Centre on Thursday notified her elevation as an SC judge and her assent would come into force the date she assumes office. While the SC itself created a record of sorts by filling nine vacancies at a stretch and by including three women judges in them, the short tenure of Justice Kohli at Telangana HC too did not lag behind in this area. She made use of the increased strength of judges at the high court and recommended names of 6 district judges to be promoted as HC judges. This, is in addition to the names of seven practising advocates for selection as HC judges. This is over and above the seven names of district judges sent by her predecessor. If all these appointments materialise even in a phased manner, the strength of judges at Telangana HC alone will touch 32, a figure even the composite high court could hardly achieve. Justice Kohli is likely to be sworn in as an SC judge next week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/farewell-to-justice-hima-kohli-today/articleshow/85670397.cms||---

In comparison, 2020 and 2019 had reported 543mm and 400mm rainfall respectively. In fact, the data of GSDMA reveal that it is the weakest monsoon in the past five years for the state. In all, the state is over 50% deficient in its seasonal rainfall. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast has already indicated that there are slim chances of good rainfall till the end of the month. Even in south Gujarat, that generally records good rainfall, all the districts are deficient this year.  Five districts – Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad, Aravalli, Surendranagar and Banaskantha – have 60% or more rain deficit. IMD statistics reveal that Saurashtra and Kutch have 50% rain deficit against long-term average till August 26, whereas the figure is 46% for the rest of the state. State deputy CM Nitin Patel in Ahmedabad said that after many years, the state has experienced a deficient monsoon.  “Majority of the districts have received much less than their average rainfall at this time of the year. The200-odd dams meant for irrigation purposes have very less water at present,” he said. Patel however assured that the Narmada dam would provide adequate water for drinking. “The Sardar Sarovar dam has much less water this year as compared to the previous year. But as Narmada minister, I can definitely say that the amount of water in the Narmada dam is enough to provide drinking water for the next whole year for over four crore people of Gujarat,” he said. Commenting on water being diverted from dams for irrigation purposes, Patel said that after reserving water for drinking purposes, all additional water is being given for crops. “The state government has been providing water for irrigation from dams that are connected to the Narmada canal network,” Patel said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/weakest-august-monsoon-in-5-years/articleshow/85672413.cms||---

The lab will have the capacity of 180 Covid-19 tests each day. So far, the civic body was sending samples to other government labs for testing and the results were often getting delayed. North corporation mayor Raja Iqbal Singh said that the civic body was strengthening its resources in view of the probable third wave of Covid-19. “Developing the Covid-19 RT-PCR laboratory is part of that effort. During the corona pandemic, all the doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and other employees of the north corporation worked day and night to serve the citizens. And now, we are making all arrangements to provide facilities to the citizens even in adverse circumstances,” he said. Standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said that earlier, about 50 samples on average were collected at Hindu Rao Hospital daily. They were sent outside for testing. “But now, approximately 180 samples can be tested daily here.” “Since majority of patients coming to the hospital are from economically vulnerable backgrounds, the facility will provide a major relief to such patients. Apart from RT-PCR, we have facilities for doing other tests at the hospital as well,” said Jain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hindu-rao-gets-lab-for-rt-pcr-tests/articleshow/85668187.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Container shortage, high freight dent ceramic exports||AHMEDABAD: Container shortage and high ocean freight charges have started pinching ceramic tile manufacturers in Morbi, India’s largest cluster of ceramic industry. The twin blows have already eroded exports, and exporters fear more losses as new orders are drying up. Ocean freights have jumped two to three times in past few months and tile makers are not getting containers in required numbers to make shipments. This has hit exports from Morbi by 20-40%, said industry players. “Ceramic tile exports have gone down by 40% due to high freight rates and container shortage,” said Mukesh Ughreja, president, vitrified tiles division, Morbi Ceramic Association. Exports account for 30% of Rs 45,000 crore worth ceramic tile production in Morbi. Pegging the decline in exports at 20%, KG Kundariya, chairman of Morbi-based Wintel Ceramics Private Limited, added that the exports provided a much-needed breathing space to ceramic tile makers when the domestic demand slowed down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “That breathing space is gone now,” he said. Even after making provision for the exorbitant freights, exporters are unable to arrange for containers in time. Hence, exporters are not getting new orders. “New order bookings from the export market have taken hit due to container shortage. Manufacturers are not able to load stocks lying in their warehouses due to container shortage. Costing has also gone up due to the surge in freight rate,” added Nilesh Jetpariya, president, wall tiles division, Morbi Ceramics Association (MCA). Ceramic tile makers say that countries such as Italy and Spain will gain from India’s disadvantageous situation. While exports have shrunk, domestic offtake too has been impacted as tile makers are trying to pass on increased production cost by raising prices. “In order to ensure that there is no excess supply in the market and existing stock goods is absorbed at desired price levels, the ceramic tile makers are temporarily shutting their plants,” added Jetpariya. So far 115 tile manufacturing units have halted production and250 more will stop production for a month from September 1, said ceramic tile industry players.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/container-shortage-high-freight-dent-ceramic-exports/articleshow/85668159.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Hyderabad||Dengue menace reaches new heights as mosquitoes invade high-rise buildings in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Climbing slowly but steadily to higher altitudes with each passing year, the dengue-spreading Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes are increasingly invading high-rise buildings in the city. According to health experts, this has become more apparent now with a large number of tall buildings coming up in the city. Unlike earlier when dengue cases were generally reported among people living on lower (ground specifically) floors, experts say that many living on the eighth or tenth floor too are now contracting dengue. The fact that some of these households get patients on consecutive years hints at these mosquitoes having infested the household. “Earlier, we hardly had patients living on the seventh or eighth floor, but now this is increasingly becoming common. Although mosquitoes can fly only up to a certain height (up to eight metres), they can breed on one specific floor and slowly breed on higher floors. In the process, they can go up to very high levels,” said Dr Rahul Agarwal, senior consultant physician, Care Hospitals, adding that nearly 30% of the cases are now being reported from those staying in high-rises. Vertical breeding is also been confirmed by entomologists from the GHMC. Experts, however, do not find this unusual and look at it as the normal evolutionary process. “As they evolve, mosquitoes too learn new tricks and go farther and higher in search of nutrition. Now, with an increasing number of high-rises — and many with home gardens and common garbage dumping areas — there are more opportunities for mosquitoes to breed,” said Dr Ranga Reddy Burri, professor, School of Medical Sciences, University of Hyderabad. He added: “They can even travel to higher floors through lifts and with goods. Once they are stabilised on a particular floor, they start exploring further. This invasion, however, can increase transmission of dengue when there is little or no effort to control the spread.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dengue-menace-reaches-new-heights-as-mosquitoes-invade-high-rise-buildings/articleshow/85670417.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Delhi||Overuse of steroid to treat Covid causing damage, say experts||NEW DELHI: A woman in her early 50s recently underwent hip replacement surgery at AIIMS. Doctors suspect the woman, a resident of Delhi, suffered from hip joint damage due to overuse of steroids while being treated for Covid-19. “The patient came with pernicious pain in the hip joints following recovery from Covid-19. She did not have any history of fall or accident or other common problems known to damage the hip joints,” said Dr Rajesh Malhotra, head of orthopaedics at AIIMS. He added that several tests, including a biopsy of the soft tissue of the hip, were conducted and they confirmed inflammation in the joints. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a common cause of pain in the hip. However, Dr Malhotra said it rarely caused unbearable pain and acute inflammation as was seen in the 52-year-old patient. “Covid-19 itself can cause avascular necrosis due to blood clots in the joints. Also, steroid use is known to affect blood supply in the head of the femur,” he added. Doctors said steroid use was necessary in Covid-19 management, but it should be used judiciously to reduce the risk of side-effects in patients. “Earlier, we used to see 5-6 cases of avascular necrosis of the hip joints in a year. Now, post the pandemic, we are seeing 5-6 cases in a month. Covid-19 and the use of steroids may have contributed to it,” said Dr Yash Gulati, senior consultant and orthopaedic surgeon at Apollo Hospital. Even at PD Hinduja National Hospital in Mumbai, doctors said they anticipated a resurgence in cases of avascular necrosis due to large-scale use of steroids in Covid-19 cases. In a case report published in British Medical Journal, a series of three cases were described in which patients developed avascular necrosis of the femoral head after being treated for Covid-19 infection. “Patients were symptomatic and developed early avascular necrosis presentation at a mean of 58 days after Covid-19 diagnosis compared with literature which shows that it generally takes six months to a year to develop avascular necrosis post steroid exposure,” it added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/overuse-of-steroid-to-treat-covid-causing-damage-say-experts/articleshow/85668164.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Overall storage in the 206 dams barring the Sardar Sarovar is 51.08% of their capacity of 15,784 MCM. Of the 206 dams in the state, only seven dams storage of 90% of capacity or more, eight have between 80% and 90%. Only 11% of dams have more than 70% storage. Officials said one of every four dams in the state has less than 10% of their storage. The data shows that 61 dams have storage between 30% and 10%, and 185 dams in the state have less than 70% water. The officer said the state will have to depend heavily on the Sardar Sarovar to meet its drinking water needs as other dams hardly have water that can be used for drinking. Officials said the water situation is bad in North Gujarat, as 15 dams only have 24% storage while the 20 dams in Kutch have only 21% storage. Saurashtra, which has 141 dams, only has 40% storage which is about half of the level of 2020.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/states-dam-storage-levels-at-51/articleshow/85672417.cms||---

The samples of the infected students have also been sent to Delhi for genome sequencing to ascertain if they have the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus. The decision to send the samples for genome sequencing was taken as the virus spreads fast among the students. As a precautionary measure, classes have been suspended till August 29 in the medical college. Till then, the facility will be sanitised. The classes had begun on August 12 after procuring consent letters from the parents of the students and inspecting their vaccination certificates. However, on August 24, a female student complained of fever and cold. Later, she was tested positive for Covid-19. Within two days, seven more students developed similar symptoms and tested Covid-19 positive. To prevent further transmission of the virus, the hostel wing where students reside has been shut and the infected students have been put in isolation. “The students were allowed to join classes only after taking the consent of their parents. All the students had claimed to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. They had also presented their negative RT-PCR reports,” said Nandan Kandpal, epidemiologist, integrated disease surveillance programme officer, Nainital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/16-mbbs-students-found-covid-positive-samples-sent-for-delta-variant-testing/articleshow/85665398.cms||Shivani Azad

The submission was made before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat during the hearing of her bail plea in the case. During the hearing, special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, claimed that the bail plea was not maintainable as it was filed under the wrong provision. Prasad said that the bail plea was filed under Section 439 (special powers of high court or court of session regarding bail) of the CrPC, whereas a special court, as this, can only hear cases filed under Section 437 CrPC (when bail may be taken in case of non-bailable offence). To this, advocate Pradeep Teotia, appearing for Jahan, said that the prosecution knew it earlier that the bail plea was filed under section 439 CrPc but did not point it out. “Rule of practice and rule of law are different. The prosecution just wants to derive sadistic pleasure that I will continue to be in custody? This is not a big thing. I can file a new application. The court has already heard the application on merit… This is torture on me also. After taking so much of court’s time….,” Teotia claimed. When the court asked Prasad if the counsel filed a new plea, won’t the arguments on merit remain the same, the public prosecutor said that arguments would change and by invoking a wrong provision of law, remedy can’t be sought. “The plea on the basis of which the bail is granted is in itself not maintainable,” Prasad submitted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/prosecution-getting-sadistic-pleasure-by-keeping-me-in-custody-says-ishrat/articleshow/85670463.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CCTV footage nails man who raped 8-yr-old; gets 5 yrs’ RI||Mumbai: In a detailed judgement, sentencing a 42-year-old man to five years’ rigorous imprisonment for kidnapping and sexually assaulting an 8-year-old girl, a special POCSO court observed that medical reports showed that earlier too she was sexual assaulted but the offence went unreported. The medical reports showed an old healed hymen tear. In the latest case, the conviction came despite the child and her mother, both pavement dwellers, turning hostile in court. “One shudders to think what the accused could have done with the victim if she was not able to return safely. From such incidents the court finds that children boys and girls sleeping on pavements are vulnerable to sexual exploitation. No doubt there are CCTV cameras, but they help in punishment, not protection,” the court said. It said unless such a “vulnerable lot of children” are protected, they will keep suffering. Special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma had examined three witnesses, including the mother, child and a cop. The court relied on CCTV footage, which showed the accused taking the girl away. The court said the footage did not reflect that when the accused picked up the child she was awake and she asked for help. It said the accused was not seen making an effort to wake up her parents, to tell them he was taking her with him. “CCTV footage falsifies the contention of accused that he took the victim on being asked by her and after urination he brought her back,” the court said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-cctv-footage-nails-man-who-raped-8-yr-old-gets-5-yrs-ri/articleshow/85672442.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Ahmedabad||Krishna temples in Gujarat gear up for Janmashtami||AHMEDABAD: The state government announcing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the coming festivals of Janmashtami and Ganeshotsav have given reason for cheer to lakhs of devotees who visit the famous temple shrines in the state during this period. Night curfew will be imposed on Janmashtami (August 30) from 1am in the eight major cities of the state according to the new guidelines from the state government. The renowned temples of Lord Krishna at Dwarka, Dakor and Shamalji witness about 2.5 lakh to 3 lakh visitors a day during the Janmashtami period and this year too a sizeable number are expected, as the number of Covid-19 cases has remained low for some time now. Last year, these temples were closed during Janmashtami due to the high number of Covid cases. The Dwarkadhish temple in Devbhumi Dwarka district gets about 1.5 lakh visitors a day during the festive period, said Mukesh Pandya, district collector of Devbhumi Dwarka. “Janmashtami is a big day. Last year, the temple was closed for darshan so many devotees will be looking forward to this day. We have also made arrangements for live darshan,” said Pandya. He said SOPs are being strictly followed. Circles have been drawn along the darshan lines and barricades have been placed to prevent overcrowding, said Kanu Patel, manager of the Shamalaji temple trust. The temple in Aravalli district, also dedicated to Lord Krishna, expects 50,000 to 60,000 devotees during the Janmashtami festival. Some of the measures in place at the temples are mandatory face masks, single entry and exit points, steel rods on both sides, placement of sanitizers, thermal scanners and adequate security to maintain distancing among devotees. Lokmela and Makti Fod are not allowed this year, according to the guidelines. Ravindra Upadhyay, manager of the Dakor temple trust, said only 200 people are allowed to visit at a time and they have put barricades and other measures to avoid overcrowding. Usually locals visit the temple at midnight for darshan, so following the rules to avoid overcrowding will not be a challenge, he said. About 60,000 visitors are expected during Janmashtami at Dakor temple. The state government was earlier considering closing the three Krishna temples in the state to check the spread of Covid-19 but given the low number of cases in the state over the last two months it decided to keep them open, said source privy to the development. “This is also the time when devotees donate generously to the temples,” a source added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/krishna-temples-in-state-gear-up-for-janmashtami/articleshow/85668237.cms||---
---||Mumbai||In a 1st, IIT-Bombay alumni to plan & build hostel on campus, will raise Rs 135 crore||MUMBAI: IIT-Bombay’s alumni will be launching a drive to raise Rs 120-135 crore to design and build a world-class hostel complex with 1,000-1,500 rooms. The institute has collaborated with its alumni organisations — IIT-B Alumni Association (IITBAA) and IIT-B Heritage Foundation — for the hostel that will replace hostels 7 and 8 and have a separate wing for the increasing numbers of girl students on campus. In the past two decades, the student strength has grown almost four times and infrastructural constraints have been a concern. The challenge is made harder by the limited funding available to the institute and the fact that many of the hostels are old and face structural issues, said the institute’s statement. Revamping older hostels and building new ones have become a necessity, and so the institute reached out to its alumni. The proposed hostel will be closer to Powai lake. For the first time on an Indian campus, the alumni will not only raise funds, but also take lead roles in project planning and implementation. An MoU was signed by the institute and the alumni organisations. The alumni have been supporting the institute on various projects. Recently, around 170 residents of hostel 5 donated around Rs 5.5 crore for its upgradation. Last year, when the pandemic set in, around Rs 2.5 crore was raised by the US-based alumni to provide laptops and broadband services to needy students. In 2020-21, around Rs 80 crore donation was received by the institute from its corporates and alumni networks. Sudhir Nikam, a resident of hospital 7 from the class of 1993, said: “Thousands of alumni have called H7, H8, H10 and H11 their home. We plan to reach out to all of them.” Director Subhasis Chaudhuri said the institute is grateful to their alumni for taking the stewardship role in building the new hostel complex, which is the need of the hour.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-in-a-1st-iit-b-alumni-to-plan-build-hostel-on-campus-will-raise-rs-135cr/articleshow/85670494.cms||---
---||Delhi||Plea against reserving hotel rooms for govt officials dismissed: HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Thursday dismissed a plea challenging the AAP government’s notifications reserving rooms in four hotels linked to two hospitals for treatment of officials of various public authorities and their families.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh rejected the argument that resources of the state remained unutilised due to the exclusive reservation of facilities for Covid-19 treatment of government officials and their families. It said the submission of petitioner’s counsel did not take into account the ground reality of the second wave of the pandemic.The court passed the order on a plea by a Delhi-based doctor who challenged the notifications.According to Delhi government’s April 27 notification, 70 rooms at Hotel Ginger in Vivek Vihar, 50 rooms at Hotel Park Plaza in Shahdara, and 50 rooms at Hotel Leela Ambience in Karkardooma (linked to Rajiv Gandhi Hospital) and all the rooms at Hotel Golden Tulip in Hari Nagar (linked to DDU Hospital) are reserved for the treatment of officials of Delhi government, autonomous bodies, corporations, local bodies and their families.“There was such a shortage of facilities, including oxygen, medicines, hospital beds, oxygenated beds, ICUs, doctors and paramedical staff that there was no question of any facilities remaining unutilised,” the bench had observed earlier.It pointed out that when there was a massive dearth of medical infrastructure during the second wave, government officials were risking their lives on the streets to manage the situation. The bench said during the lockdown, while the common citizenry were in their homes, it was the government officers who were out on the streets to manage the situation and if such officers were to fall sick and were not to receive treatment of Covid-19, not only they but the entire citizenry of Delhi would have suffered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/plea-against-reserving-hotel-rooms-for-govt-officials-dismissed-hc/articleshow/85668222.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Gunrunners supplying weapons to Khalistanis held||NEW DELHI: Two arms traffickers who were allegedly selling weapons online to Khalistani operatives and gangsters in several states have been arrested by Special Cell of Delhi Police. A large cache of weapons has been seized from them. DCP Sanjeev Yadav said the suspects had created a Facebook page and were uploading pictures via mobile numbers procured through fake IDs to ask people to place orders. Cops posed as Khalistani operatives to contact the sellers and infiltrated their private page. Simultaneously, they obtained and analysed the technical logs of the FB page and busted them, sources said. The arrested men, Rajender Singh Barnala (22) and Bablu Singh (30), are from Madhya Pradesh. “Police seized 18 semi-automatic pistols and 60 live cartridges from them. Mobile handsets and SIM cards used in the illegal supply of weapons were also seized. Their links are being scanned to find who bought from them in the past one year,” said Yadav. The Northern Range of Special Cell had been collecting information and keeping a watch over pro-Khalistani entities and their associates active in Punjab and Delhi-NCR. In the last one year, different modules of Khalistani militants were busted, dozens of activists and supporters were arrested and semi-automatic pistols and live cartridges seized from them. “A probe indicated that Khalistani operatives were in touch with illegal firearms suppliers from Madhya Pradesh. The suppliers were operating on social media platforms and Khalistani groups and gangsters were procuring weapons from them,” said the DCP. A team led by ACP Jasbir Singh mounted surveillance and after around three months stumbled upon a Facebook page dedicated to the Khalistan movement. Access to this page was denied as it was marked as private. “Using social engineering and algorithms, access was gained to the page and surveillance was kept on the activities. It was noticed that one person was posting photos and videos of firearms for sale using a fake ID. Snapshots of those posts were taken and technical analysis was started to decipher the fake ID. A virtual number was also posted for communication,” Yadav said. Technical analysis and human intelligence used to identify the users of these numbers revealed that the module was supplying illegal firearms to people in Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi-NCR. On August 25, a tip-off was received about the presence of the accused in Rohini. They were arrested along with weapons and cartridges. During interrogation, the accused disclosed that they manufactured firearms in Barwani, Burhanpur, Dhar and Khargone districts of MP. “Several people residing in the villages are engaged in making illegal weapons by melting brass in furnaces and using moulds to give the shape. Rajender Singh said his brother, Narender, and he had been supplying the illegal arms in various parts of the country, including Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi for the past several years,” added the DCP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/gunrunners-supplying-weapons-to-khalistanis-held/articleshow/85668250.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Haunted by Rai’s men after rape FIR, woman’s family lived in constant fear||Varanasi: Such was the fear of jailed Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) member of Parliament (MP) from Ghosi (Mau) Atul Rai that the family of the woman complainant, who had lodged a case of rape against the parliamentarian on May 1, 2019, with the Lanka police in Varanasi, lived in a state of constant fear owing to the intimidation and threats issued regularly by Rai’s goons. Furthermore, the woman complainant who died on Tuesday after setting herself on fire outside the Supreme Court in New Delhi on August 16, did not visit her parental village even once after lodging the FIR. If her grandfather in their parental village under the limits of Narahi police station in Ballia district is to be believed, Rai’s goons regularly frequented their place and threatened them of dire consequences. “This was the reason her mother did not allow the younger brother and sister of the complainant to go anywhere alone,” said her relatives at their parental home. Except the complainant’s grandfather and younger sister, only some relatives were present there and were waiting for the return of her mother and brother from Delhi, where they had received and cremated her body on Tuesday. The complainant’s grandfather recalled, “Two years ago she had lodged the case against Rai. After that she never visited the village and only spoke to her mother over phone on a few occasions. However, after the case was lodged, police had come to confirm her parental home.” The problem for the family members of the complainant had started a few weeks after she lodged the rape case. Initially, in June 2019, she had raised the alarm that she, her family members and prime witness were being coerced and threatened to withdraw the case by MP and his goons. People at her home recalled that in August 2019, a station officer (SO) of Narahi police station had taken her brother to the police station after registering a cross-case case, although the SO was transferred to another district within a few days after the superior authorities came to know about the development. The complainant had also mentioned the name of the SO during her live streaming on her Facebook page before committing self-immolation along with the prime witness of the case outside the apex court on August 16. The prime witness had died on August 21. Her grandfather said, “Rai’s goons regularly visited us and threatened us with dire consequences. Even in the absence of any male member, they used to enter the house and threaten the women and children. Later, police force was deployed at our house for several months.” The villagers said that the complainant was from an agrarian background. Her father had died five years ago due to an ailment and her aged grandfather was looking after the family, including her mother, brother and a sister. The eldest among the three siblings, she had left the village for Varanasi after passing class VIII examination for further studies while her brother and sister stayed in the village. While studying in Varanasi, she had taken admission in a college and came in contact of the former vice-president of the student’s union, who was then associated with Rai and later turned prime witness in the rape case. This student leader backed her to contest the student union poll in 2015, but she lost. People at her parental home said that while studying in Varanasi, she rarely visited her village. However, after she lodged the rape case against Rai, she never visited her home in the village. As threats from the MP’s men grew, her mother used to take the complainant’s siblings along whenever she left her home. The struggle of the complainant and the prime witness against Rai came to an end with their death. However, her family members were not sure whether threats from Rai’s men would stop. Rai emerged victorious as a BSP-SP alliance candidate and an absconder from Ghosi seat in 2019 despite increased differences between him and his ‘boss’, the jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari as Mau is considered a citadel of the latter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/haunted-by-rais-men-after-rape-fir-womans-family-lived-in-constant-fear/articleshow/85669906.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Coimbatore||Rail users: Increase stoppages, trips of Mettupalayam train||Coimbatore: With the easing of lockdown norms, there is a growing demand to halt Coimbatore-Mettupalayam passenger train at Periyanaickenpalayam railway station.The train used to make four trips a day with stoppages at Karamadai, Periyanaickenpalayam and Coimbatore North.The train was stopped in March 2020 following the lockdown, but the services were resumed after a year on March 15, 2021, as a special train with just a round-trip for six days a week. The train fare was also hiked as it was introduced as a special train without a stoppage at Periyanaickenpalayam.The mainline electric multiple unit (MEMU) leaves Mettupalayam at 8.20am and reaches Coimbatore at 9.05am with stoppages at Karamadai and Coimbatore North. It then departs from Coimbatore at 5.55pm and reaches Mettupalayam at 6.40pmThe rail users had made several representations to halt the train at Periyanaickenpalayam, but to no avail. With the state government relaxing Covid restrictions significantly and education institutions getting ready to reopen from September 1, the call to increase the stoppages as well as trips is growing louder.There are 17 educational institutions at Periyanaickenpalayam, where industrial units are also housed. According to M Jai Kumar, member, Mettupalayam Railway Consultative Committee, more than 400 people commute between Mettupalayam and Periyanaickenpalayam daily, while another 200 people travel to Coimbatore for educational and occupational purposes.Pointing out that the train used to stop at Periyanaickenpalayam for 60 seconds, he said cancelling the same would cause huge losses to the railway.S Ramanathan, a member of Periyanaickenpalayam Train Passenger Welfare Association, said the railway station was revamped at a cost of more than Rs 1 crore in 2016-17. “But it remains unused.”Referring to the flyover work at four places on Mettupalayam Road, he said the travel time to the city had gone up considerably. “People are forced to take crowded buses, risking Covid infection.” A senior southern railway official said it was a temporary arrangement. “We will resume normal services soon with more trips and stoppage at Periyanaickenpalayam.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/rail-users-increase-stoppages-trips-of-mettupalayam-train/articleshow/85668258.cms||---

As per the 1903 Unnao gazetteer, Miyaganj town was built in 1771 by Miyan Almas Ali Khan, a finance minister under Asaf-ud-Daulah and Sadat Ali Khan. The village was formerly called Bhopatpur. The proposal for the name change was first raised in a letter by Bamba Lal Diwakar, BJP MLA from Safipur seat in Unnao, on July 31 and was passed by the local bodies. The DM said that he had sent a letter to the additional chief secretary Panchayati Raj on August 24 seeking action by the government on the name change. Miyanganj population as per 2011 census is 8,948. Besides, total households as of 2011 is 1,575. At present there are 370 houses here.

We have already invited tenders to commence the project at an estimated cost of Rs 53 crore. The project is expected to be completed in four years,” said MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar, adding that the project will solve the garbage crisis at Pachanady. A landslide at the city’s landfill in August 2019 had damaged nearly 14 acres of horticultural and private land, and nearly 27 families were evacuated. According to an estimate done by experts, the landfill at Pachanady, that is spread across 78 acres, has nearly 10 lakh tonnes of legacy waste. A 50-metre-high heap of waste covers about two sq km of the landfill. After the garbage sliding tragedy, the high court had also taken the MCC to task for not clearing the waste at the landfill. Following this, the city corporation discussed various methods to clear the legacy waste accumulated at the landfill, and finalised bio-mining technology. Meanwhile, the city corporation has built a seven-metre-high concrete wall to prevent the sliding of garbage, constructed a tank to prevent the flow of leachate into the river, and has also proposed a leachate treatment plant. Akshy Sridhar said the proposed bio-mining project to clear the legacy waste from Pachanady is in the tender stage. Official sources said that through the bio-mining process, the garbage is treated with biological organisms after segregation. While biodegradable waste is converted into organic manure, reusable materials are separated for recycling. The project is expected to yield an additional revenue of nearly Rs 23 crore per year, through the sale of manure, sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/10l-tonnes-of-legacy-waste-to-be-cleared-using-bio-mining/articleshow/85665472.cms||---

The Union ministry of home affairs has already cleared the name of Nitin Kumar Yadav, a 2000-batch IAS officer of Haryana cadre, for the post of UT home secretary. Recently, the Haryana government had sent a panel of three IAS officers to succeed Gupta. The three-year tenure of Gupta, a Haryana-cadre IAS officer of 1992 batch, had ended in May, but he was given an extension till August. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet is yet to issue orders of Yadav as the new UT home secretary.Meanwhile, reshuffling of departments of IAS, PCS and HCS officers is also on the cards. Sources said UT adviser Dharam Pal reviewed the functioning of these officials and discussed it with UT administrator VP Singh Badnore. “The UT administration will give more departments to officials who have delivered results. There are several officials who are handling many departments and there are some who have only one or two departments,” sources added.  “In the coming days there will be many new officials joining the Chandigarh administration, with some repatriating to their parent cadre. As the pandemic has delayed many projects, reshuffling of departments will be done to speed up the pace of development in the city. The UT will continue to review the functioning of departments and their heads and accordingly reshuffling will be done,” a senior UT official said.  Recently, Anindita Mitra had joined as the MC commissioner. PCS officer Palika Arora will join the UT in the coming days.Key focusSources said, “Key focus in reshuffling of departments will be on important sectors like education, parking, health and transport.

---||Mumbai||Not Rs 20 crore, BMC’s boardwalk-cum-cycle track to cost Rs 168 crore||MUMBAI: After strong opposition from the BJP and a group of residents, now the Congress has raised objection to the boardwalk-cum-cycle track connceting Mahim and Bandra forts. The Congress has claimed that the original cost of the project as planned by urban planners and citizens was only Rs 20 crore which the BMC has now hiked to Rs 168 crore. Opposing the massive hike in the project cost, the Congress has demanded a detailed rate analysis of the project, along with a peer review by engineers from institutes like the IIT-Bombay and Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI). TimesViewThe BMC’s plan to construct a walkway cum cycle track from Mahim Fort to Bandra Fort is welcome but the cost of Rs 168 core is not justified at a time when the BMC is facing a financial crisis. Local resident groups and citizens have opposed the plan over high cost. The BMC must carry out a rate analysis of the project and take it forward only if it can be constructed at a reasonable cost.“The plan was drafted after suggestions from local urban planners with a view to increase open spaces. The project cost as per the initial drawing and designs submitted to the BMC by urban planners was just Rs 20 crore. The cost of Rs 168 crore seems inflated, and for the sake of transparency, a rate analysis and peer review through a recognised agency is needed,” Congress corporator Asif Zakaria said in a letter to BMC chief Iqbal Chahal. “This was our plan. It was also presented to and accepted by the then BMC Chief Praveen Pardeshi back in March 2020. Concerned officials were all present as well. The cost was nowhere near Rs 168 crore. This has been taken forward and the tendering process is unknown to us. However we suggested a low-cost, existing connector, to keep the seaside accessible and available to all the citizens. Most of the infra already exists, except for the bridge we proposed,” said noted urban planner and architect Alan Abraham who had first pitched the plan. Last week, Resident Associations and Citizens Groups of Bandra, along with BJP MLA from Bandra (West) Ashish Shelar, opposed the BMC’s project.

---||Dehradun||House briefly adjourned as Cong MLAs oppose location of medical college in Haridwar||Dehradun: Opposition Congress MLAs questioned the government move to come up with a medical college in Kankhal area of Haridwar during the assembly session on Thursday. The Congress legislators claimed that the medical college was initially planned for Bhagwanpur area – which is represented by an opposition party MLA – and was shifted to another location in a “politically driven decision”. The protesting Congress MLAs entered the well of the House and refused to return to their seats. Following this, speaker Prem Chand Aggarwal adjourned the House at 12:10 pm for 20 minutes. Two-time MLA from Bhagwanpur, Mamta Rakesh, pointed out that her husband Surendra Rakesh was the social welfare minister in the previous Congress government. “In his tenure in 2015, he had announced a medical college to be named after Dr BR Ambedkar at Bhagwanpur. The government order had been issued,” she said. The legislator further said that if a medical college has to be opened, “It should be at Bhagwanpur as it had been decided in the last government.” Replying to Mamta Rakesh, health minister Dhan Singh Rawat said, “The government has decided to come up with one medical college in a district and she should be happy that her district is getting a medical college. She should welcome the decision.The government has already given its share of Rs 75 crore for the project.” He further added, “If the legislator wants, we can set up a medical college in her constituency on a PPP mode.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/house-briefly-adjourned-as-cong-mlas-oppose-location-of-medical-college-in-haridwar/articleshow/85665469.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Cannot extern citizen for protesting against govt: HC||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Thursday quashed an externment order passed by Ahmedabad police against a social activist, Kaleem Siddiqui, and observed that a citizen cannot be subjected to externment for raising a grievance against the government. Siddiqui was one of the organizers of a protest at Ajit Mill Compound against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens. The protest lasted three months until the movement was wound up on the streets due to the Covid-19 pandemic. City police had in 2019 lodged an FIR against an unknown crowd for staging a protest against CAA/NRC. Siddiqui’s name was not even in the FIR. While quashing the externment order, Justice Paresh Upadhyay noted, “A citizen cannot be subjected to externment for raising his grievance against the government. On this count also, the externment order needs to be set aside.” Siddiqui was issued a notice for externment in July 2020 and in November last year, the ACP ‘A’ division, Ahmedabad City, passed a final order prohibiting Siddiqui’s entry into Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Kheda and Gandhinagar districts. The HC had stayed the order. Siddiqui was externed on the basis of four FIRs lodged against him, but the externment notice mentioned only two FIRs. One FIR was filed in 2018, in which he has been acquitted. The second FIR mentioned in the order was for protesting against the CAA/NRC. For not mentioning the two other FIRs, the police told the HC that it was a typographical mistake in the order. The HC said the externment order was liable to be quashed only on this ground alone.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cannot-extern-citizen-for-protesting-against-govt-hc/articleshow/85668315.cms||---

The new system will help traffic police personnel to move freely and catch people who jump red light and violate other traffic rules. Earlier, they used sit under traffic umbrella and operate the signal via switch.As many as 52 traffic signals are functioning within the city police limits. The switch system was introduced about five years ago. The new traffic signal is maintained by Roots Industries. Police installed new technology at a cost of Rs 45,000. A traffic cop can operate the signal from a distance of 50m-100m away from it. S R Senthilkumar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said to prevent the traffic violations, the remotely operated traffic signal system was introduced near Textool Bridge. The cop doesn’t need to sit under the umbrella and he could move freely to catch traffic violators, he said.

The G South ward, which comprises areas such as Lower Parel, Prabhadevi, Worli and Mahalaxmi, has many mills that are inaccessible due to their height or their dilapidated condition. The ward had emerged as a hotspot for malaria and dengue in recent years as a result. This prompted ward officer Sharad Ughade to use funds gathered through corporate social responsibility (CSR) to buy a drone that would spray anti-larval oil over inaccessible spots. The equipment costs around Rs 7 lakh, said BMC officials. “As we focused on Covid last year, we could not use the equipment enough last year, but we have been using it since the start of monsoon this year,’’ Ugade told TOI. The use of the drone, which has a 10-litre tank, saves time and also allows BMC to cover a large area in 15 minutes. “As the drone has a camera, we plan to use it for disaster management as well in future,” said Ughade. He said the drone had helped control mosquito breeding. While the ward saw 900 malaria cases in the June-August 2020 period, only 407 cases have been registered in the corresponding period this year. BMC’s insecticide officer Rajan Naringrekar said the drone has been used to put insecticides in clean waters gathered on rooftops of inaccessible buildings in G South ward. “The clean water is the breeding spot for mosquitoes that cause dengue and malaria,’’ he said. He said while the equipment had been donated through CSR, the entire operation is being managed by BMC pesticide officers. BMC officials have taken an NoC from the police for using the drone.

---||Delhi||Court warns north corpn over delay in paying salary||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Thursday warned North Delhi Municipal Corporation that any delay in payment of salaries and pensions to staff might lead it to attach assets of the commissioner and corporators and sell those. The high court also frowned upon the delay by the civic body in discussing the issue regarding its six hospitals that can be handed over to the Centre or Delhi government, as these are facing financial issues. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the corporation is not showing any sense of urgency that the issue demands and added that from now, it will not tolerate any delay in payment of salaries and pensions to the employees and retired staff. It added that if there is any delay, it will not hesitate in ordering attachment of assets and sale of properties of the corporation. The high court had earlier directed the civic body to take a decision on the issue of the six hospitals. But it was informed by the counsel for the north corporation that the commissioner of the corporation took steps but the issue was pending before the corporators and it was earlier rejected by the House. To this, the bench said the corporation can’t keep insisting to retain the hospitals that are not generating revenue. “Henceforth, whenever you say you don’t have funds, we know what we have to do. We are going to attach your properties and will start with attaching your commissioner’s office,” the bench said. The court was informed by the corporation’s counsel that pensions have been paid till June and salaries have been paid till July. Meanwhile, Delhi government said the second instalment of grant-in-aid and basic tax assignment has been released to the three corporations. But north corporation submitted that some of the remittance made by the government has not been credited yet and assured that as soon as the amount is received, arrears of pensions for July will also be cleared.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/court-warns-north-corpn-over-delay-in-paying-salary/articleshow/85670508.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Aged between 18-35 years, the youths were from socially marginalized or economically weaker section of Ettimadai village near the campus. Prema Pillai, operational lead for PMKVY – special projects, Ammachi Labs, said the project has helped socially marginalized and economically disadvantaged youths to develop skill free of cost. Some have got jobs with industries and micro-enterprises, while some others have started their own business. Youth in rural areas lack resources and face poor career prospects due to absence of quality education. If they migrate to cities, they get only unskilled jobs . Lack of certified courses reduce their chances to negotiate better salaries.

Apart from expanding its fleet of sewage treatment plants, the SMC has also started reusing the treated water. City municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani represented SMC at the online penal discussion held on Thursday. “By 2030 we will be reusing 100% of sewage water after treatment. “Owing to the progress that SMC has made in this field we were the only city from India to be invited at the prestigious event. We have developed our capacities for future requirement in this particular area,” Pani told TOI. WWW is a leading annual event on global water issues, organized by SIWI since 1991. The week attracts over 4,000 participants from more than 135 countries. This year the WWW is being held online from August 23 to 27 with the theme being ‘Building Resilience Faster’. Among other panelists at the event were Rajiv Mishra, director general, National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), Jeremy Bird, Senior Water Expert, GIZ (India EU Partnership), Nupur Bahadur, fellow and area convener TERI and Sumouleendra Ghosh, global water lead KPMG.

The 11-day Ganeshotsav will begin on September 10. The BMC has received applications from 1,273 Ganpati mandals, of which 519 have been granted permission so far. This figure is expected to rise considering that last year, during the first wave of the Covid pandemic, 1,700 mandals were allowed to erect pandals. In pre-Covid times, there were 2,000-plus pandals across the city with BMC approval. This year, civic officials said, before granting pandal permission, the organisers are being asked to ensure that all Covid-appropriate preventive measures are in place. BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that all 244 testing centres will be activated and organisers and volunteers will be encouraged to undertake the tests. “In every ward, the field staff too would be asked to encourage organisers and visitors at pandals to undertake a Covid test at the nearest centre so that in case anyone tests positive they could be isolated and treated quickly,” said Kakani. This year too, Ganpati celebrations are low-key. Mandals have to restrict the height of idols to 4ft, while idols worshipped at homes should not be more than 2ft high. Large gatherings have been banned, most mandals will provide online darshan and not more than five people will be allowed inside the pandal at a time. “These five people need to have taken both vaccine doses and completed a 14-day period thereafter,” said an official. “During immersio-ns, no procession will be allowed and a limited number of full vaccinated people can participate. We are also asking ma-ndals to create awareness about Covid-appropriate behaviour through online darshan.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-1k-requests-for-ganpati-pandals-bmc-says-follow-covid-protocols/articleshow/85670564.cms||Richa Pinto

The resolution for renaming was taken up for voting in a bid to raise funds and deal with the massive financial crisis owing to the pandemic.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Two cops among three booked for extortion and intimidation||MUMBAI: Amboli police have registered a case of extortion, criminal intimidation, disappearance of evidence and forgery, among other charges, against three, including a deputy police commissioner and a dismissed policeman, based on a complaint by a property dealer and financier from Andheri. The FIR has been registered against deputy police commissioner Akbar Pathan, inspector Chimaji Adhav and dismissed police inspector Sunil Mane. Pathan is already an accused, along with former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh, in an extortion case while Mane is in police custody in the explosives case where gelatine sticks were planted in a vehicle outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s bungalow. The FIR was registered following the directions of the magistrate’s court after businessman Guruvharan Singh alias Raja Chouhan lodged a private complaint in the court alleging that the policemen demanded Rs 17 lakh for not registering a false case against him.  Chouhan alleged that despite paying the amount, he was arrested in March 2020 by the crime branch unit-10 based on a case registered with MIDC police station then. He said the harassment happened between November 2019 and February 2020. Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said the case was registered on an order of the magistrate’s court. Mumbai police PRO DCP S Chaitanya said a case under the Indian Penal Code sections for criminal conspiracy, public servant framing an incorrect document, disappearance of evidence, causing hurt, extortion, forgery, insult and criminal intimidation has been registered with the Amboli police. They will submit an inquiry report to the magistrate’s court. Pathan was not available for comment. Adhav said Chouhan’s arrest was genuine as he was part of the ‘rice-puller gang’. “He was arrested for duping many investors of crores of rupees,” Adhav told TOI. He said they had filed a chargesheet in the case in 2020, and since then Chouhan had been trying frame them. Chouhan had moved the Bombay high court but in vain. A police officer said, “Even the inquiry conducted by the then joint commissioner Vinoy Choubey and the report submitted to the HC mentioned that Chouhan’s allegation was baseless and Chouhan’s plea for filing FIR was rejected.” Police said Chouhan was part of the four-member gang involved in cheating people on the pretext of selling “rice puller” metal devices. They sold the metal made of copper iridium to gullible people, claiming it was highly valuable and made lakhs of rupees in the process. The gang members had told investors that around Rs 39,000 crore has been collected in the Reserve Bank of India from the sale of the metal, and they were required to pay at least Rs 20 crore as tax to get the amount.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-2-cops-among-3-booked-for-extortion-and-intimidation/articleshow/85670690.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Chandigarh||All 40 traffic light-points in Chandigarh to be synchronised by December 31||CHANDIGARH: To improve signal timing and ease traffic snarls, all 40 traffic light-points in the city will be synchronised by December 31, the UT administration told the administrator’s advisory council on transport. The light-points will be equipped with adaptive traffic control system (ATCS), which automatically gives priority to the direction with heavy traffic, while allowing maximum green signal. In a recent meeting, the officials submitted that Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) was carrying out the project of implementation of integrated command and control centre (ICCC) in Chandigarh and as per its technical proposal, artificial intelligence-based ATCS will be installed in the city. BEL will first implement the pilot project then replicate it in the entire city, the officials said in the meeting chaired by UT adviser Dharam Pal. TimesViewIn a city where there is a traffic signal after over a kilometre, this will help ease traffic flow, increase motorists' average speed and reduce choke points. When the traffic signals over a series of intersections are synchronized, it will enable a maximum number of vehicles to pass through, thereby reducing delays. If this system is successful, it will also benefit the commuters by saving on time, cut the fuel wasted by vehicles idling at traffic junctions and also bring down vehicle emissions and improve air qualityThe Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) had, in June last year, signed a contract of Rs 295 crore with BEL for the construction of ICCC complex, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for all utility services and police command centre. A senior UT officer, who is part of this project, said the work was being carried out under the Smart City project and at least 80 dynamic messaging sign (DMS) screens along with security cameras were being installed at 40 traffic light junctions. The project would be functional by December 31, he added. The DMS screens being installed will alert commuters about traffic chaos, blockage of roads ahead and any ongoing road repair work along with the suggestion from where to divert. Besides this, DMS screens will also highlight public interest messages conveyed by the local authorities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/all-40-traffic-light-points-to-be-synchronised-by-dec-31/articleshow/85668410.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin demands reinstatement of works by dalit women writers in DU syllabus||COIMBATORE: Chief minister M K Stalin on Thursday condemned the removal of literary works by Tamil feminist writers Bama and Sukirtharani from the syllabus of Delhi University and demanded the university to include the works in the syllabus again. In a statement, Stalin said that the literary works of writer Bama and poet Sukirtharani should not be seen through the prism of politics and religion. “The removal at the behest of the oversight committee without the knowledge of department professors is arbitrary. It cannot be accepted on any count,’’ he said. “The practice of looking at the writings of Bama and Sukirtharani which talk about women’s rights, liberation of the oppression and human dignity through the prism of party politics and religion should be dropped. I urge the Union government and Delhi University to include their works again in the syllabus,” he said. The writers Bama and Sukirtharani who have expressed their displeasure for the removal, however, said that blacking out the voices of the oppressed has been happening regularly and hence the removal was not surprising. “The removal of our works from the syllabus of Delhi University is saddening. I feel removing these writings is not right. But I am not surprised – because this kind of blacking out has been happening regularly,’’ Sukirtharani said. The academic council of Delhi University which met on Tuesday removed Bama’s writing titled ‘Sangati’ and Sukirtharani’s works ‘Kaimmaru’ and ‘En Udal,’ from the syllabus of BA English (Honours) on the recommendations of its Oversight Committee despite opposition from many of council members. While Sukirtha Rani’s poems Kaimmaru and En Udal are about manual scavengers and about body of a woman respectively, Bama’s Sangati is about the travails of dalit women. Short story titled Draupati written by Bengali writer Mahesweta Devi was also removed by the council. “There is certainly politics in it. If our works are replaced by the writing of another dalit writer, then its fine. But that has not happened. We learn that writings of an upper caste writer have been included. So, I feel caste and Hindutva were at play behind the removal of our works,’’ she said. The writers said that none from the University informed them about the removal and they came to know about Academic Council decision only through media reports. The works of the two writers including those that have been removed by Delhi University are part of the syllabus of several universities across India and have been translated in various languages outside the country as well. “It is shocking,” said Sahitya Akademi winner and Madurai MP Su Venkatesan. “The writings of the two who created a strong impact on society through their works should be included again.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/reinstate-tn-feminists-works-cm-to-du/articleshow/85668364.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, celebs join students demanding PU senate elections||Chandigarh: PU, which has been in turmoil over repeated delay in Senate elections, witnessed another protest on Thursday. This time, members of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) and celebrities such as actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu and singer Anmol Gagan Maan joined various student unions demanding holding of Senate elections. Panjab University is being run without a democratic structure for the past year. The varsity is functioning on the orders of the vice-chancellor (VC). As of now, PU has no Senate, Syndicate or dean, all considered essential components of the university’s democratic structure. There has been no permanent appointment of any officer on any post except for the VC. According to the protesting student unions, kisan morchas and graduate constituency candidates, VC professor Raj Kumar is a supporter of the BJP and RSS, which do not want Senate elections. They said he also wants to make changes in the PU Senate. A committee has been made by the chancellor’s office to decrease the number of Senate members from 91 to 47. After four meetings of the committee, the report regarding PU Senate reforms has been sent to the chancellor of the university. Recently, a few PU senators moved Punjab and Haryana high court and after a rap from the court, the PU administration prepared a schedule for Senate elections. In the elections held for the PU Senate so far, BJP has not been able to get as many seats as it expected. In such a situation, it will not be easy for the VC to handle the new Senate. D P S Randhawa, one of the contestants from the graduate constituency said, “Why is the administration playing around and not giving us a specific date? We have been protesting for the last two weeks and no one has come forward. All we want is a date to hold the elections.” Voting for 15 seats in the graduate constituency was to be held on August 18. On Wednesday, PU again issued a notice saying that on September 19 or September 26, if permission was received from Delhi and Uttarakhand, elections of the graduate constituency would be held. One of the protesting student leaders from SUI said, “The university’s vice-chancellor has made the campus a political arena, which is also affecting studies. ” Deep Sidhu said, “I am here to support the democratic structure of the university. People who are in authority in the university are run by people sitting in Delhi. The reason behind delaying and postponing elections is political propaganda. They want to take our university, which is our legacy, away from us.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/sanyukt-kisan-morcha-celebs-join-students-demanding-pu-senate-elections/articleshow/85668481.cms||---

Independent MLA from Bhimtal Ram Singh Kaida raised the issue of inflated electricity bills saying that there have been instances when a person using two bulbs got a bill equivalent to a consumer using 10 bulbs. In his reply, Rawat said that in the ongoing financial year, a total of 15,344 complaints have been received. “In the previous two years, we received 64,914 complaints out of which 58,584 have been resolved,” the minister added. He pointed out that strict action would be taken against those issuing inflated bills. At present, the meter reading is done by the department or through 58 agencies, hired for the purpose. “In case of first and second complaint, we get the meter reading done again and check if the bill is correct or inflated. In case of a third complaint of inflated bill, the agency concerned will be blacklisted,” he said, adding that a total fine of Rs 18.77 lakh has been slapped on the agencies for wrong meter reading. To check the meter reading, the department is preparing a detailed project report for the master smart meter. “I am confident that the state will soon get master meters,” the minister added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/no-bill-payment-or-power-disconnection-of-faulty-meter-reading-till-matter-is-resolved-says-minister/articleshow/85665669.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Goa||Panaji MLA’s aides meet Congress netas, say keen on ghar wapsi||PANAJI: Cracks in the BJP camp in the state capital widened on Thursday with two of Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate’s close aides expressing their intention to join Congress. Former Panaji mayors Uday Madkaikar and Tony Rodrigues met with senior party officials and office bearers and conveyed their interest to return to the party fold. Madkaikar and Rodrigues said that they are keen to contest the 2022 assembly elections from Panaji and Taleigao if given the Congress ticket. State party president Girish Chodankar said that the two would be inducted in the party in a bid to strengthen Congress, but made no assurance of a party ticket. Chodankar said that Congress was working on a strategy to dethrone BJP from Panaji and Taleigao for several months and the efforts were bearing fruit. “Both the constituencies have to be taken together. We were working on a strategy for a long time on how to recapture Taleigao and Panaji. Although we have the voters in Panaji, we were waiting for a dashing leader. Our work was going on silently,” Chodankar said. “We have been following Babush from one party to the next, but before that I was continuously in Congress. This will be my re-entry,” Madkaikar said. Madkaikar, who followed the Panaji MLA into BJP, appears to have had a fallout with Monserrate during the recent reorganisation of the Panaji BJP mandal. “Babush has started reconstituting the Panaji and Taleigao mandal and neither my supporters nor I have been accommodated in the mandals. Indirectly, it seems that those people who worked hard to get Babush elected, who went door-to-door to campaign, he has pushed to the side,” Madkaikar said. Madkaikar had met AICC’s Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao a few days earlier where he had conveyed his willingness to join Congress. For Rodrigues, this will not be the first time that he is parting ways with Monserrate. In 2012, he broke away from Monserrate’s panel in the CCP council and supported BJP. In 2016, he aligned with Congress for the CCP polls against Monserrate, but pulled out at the last minute in favour of Monserrate. “I have come to strengthen Congress. Many from Taleigao were coming to me and asking me to contest from Taleigao. I am interested in contesting, but I am not joining because I am getting a ticket,” Rodrigues said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/panaji-mlas-aides-meet-cong-netas-say-keen-on-ghar-wapsi/articleshow/85672437.cms||---
---||Delhi||Control room and 465 CCTV cameras to monitor Delhi zoo||NEW DELHI: A CCTV central control room has been created at Delhi zoo, which will monitor 465 high-definition cameras that have been installed across the zoo premises to not only keep an eye on visitors but to also observe animal behaviour. The control room was inaugurated on Wednesday by chief guest Soumitra Dasgupta (ADG wildlife) and guest of honour SP Yadav (member secretary of Central Zoo Authority). Zoo officials said while CCTV cameras had been used in the past, they were temporary installations that would be shifted from location to location depending on their usage. In 2019, CCTV cameras were used to carry out a census of all deer species present at the zoo, with some of them installed in enclosures of nocturnal animals to observe their behaviour as well. Officials say this is the first time the entire zoo premises has been covered with permanent CCTV cameras. “A total of 465 new cameras have been installed. The new cameras, which are HD cameras and will be running 24x7, will be monitored from the central control room. We, however, still have 12 old cameras available with us, which can be installed at different locations depending on the requirement,” said a zoo official. The newly installed cameras include 20 zoom-in cameras and have a 360-degree rotation option available. A zoo official said the control room would be manned 24x7 and if visitors tried to cross the fenced barriers or throw items in enclosures, the nearest guard would immediately be alerted to take action. “The cameras have also been installed to monitor the health and welfare of animals in captivity and to take action if there is a fight between two animals, or if an animal gets injured,” said the official. The zoo reopened for visitors from August 1 onwards and has been running in two shifts of four hours each. Prior to the last lockdown, the zoo had added a number of new bird and animal species, taking the total species count from 83 to 88. At present, it has over 90 species.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/control-room-and-465-cctv-cameras-to-monitor-city-zoo/articleshow/85670726.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Goa||Goa illegal mining: Only Rs 100 crore recovered from notices for Rs 300 crore||PANAJI: Even after issuing recovery notices for the sum of Rs 300 crore to those involved in illegal mining in the state, the state government has been able to recover only around 35% of the amount in the last three months. While around Rs 100 crore has been recovered so far, some mining companies have challenged the recovery order and the remaining process for recovery is on, a senior officer said. The state government had issued recovery notices to mining companies in April, this year. In October 2020, the mines department had started the final hearing, based on the audit report, to recover money lost to illegal mining. Earlier, it had evaluated the replies filed by holders of 118 mining leases to the audit report submitted by the team of chartered accountants. In 2015, the state government had appointed 15 chartered accountants to undertake a comprehensive audit of leaseholders and traders of mineral ore in Goa during the past five years, when exports touched peak figures. The accountants had submitted an audit report of 118 mining leases to the mines department. Subsequently, the department analysed the report to ascertain the exact loss to the state due to illegal mining. The high court of Bombay at Goa had directed the mines department to decide on the showcause notices issued to mining companies for recovery. Goa Foundation had approached the court through a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking directions to the state government to recover Rs 3,431 crore from mining companies within a time-bound period. It had filed the PIL when it became apparent that the government was not pursuing the recovery with zeal. Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares had said that the demand notices worth Rs 1,580 crore were issued in 2016 on the basis of a report by a team of chartered accountants. Notices pursuant to the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) report were issued in 2017 and were worth Rs 1,922 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/illegal-mining-only-rs-100cr-recovered-from-notices-for-rs-300cr/articleshow/85672687.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Mangaluru||Rise in NRI students admitted in M’luru schools||Mangaluru: Private schools across Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts have registered an upturn in admission of NRI children, who would otherwise have enrolled in educational institutions in the Gulf. The uptick in enrolment in the schools across coastal districts has been attributed to unemployment and the downturn in the economy. Sylvia Fernandes (name changed), relocated to Mangaluru from Dubai with her two children after she lost her job in the Gulf. “My husband is still in Dubai. I lost my job owing to the financial crisis. So, I decided to return to India to educate my children. Education is much more affordable here; we are spending on two kids what we would have spent on one child’s education in Dubai,” she said. Principal of Lourdes Central School in Bejai, Mangaluru Father Robert D’Souza admitted to a spurt in the number of NRIs enrolling their children in schools in Dakshina Kannada. “Admission of children of NRI parents has been steadily increasing for the past few years, but it has witnessed a spurt in the aftermath of the pandemic, largely owing to loss of jobs,” he said. Although it was common for NRI students to come to India to pursue education after class X, or undergraduation, the trend is changing. “We are enrolling students for class five now. Most parents prefer to admit their children to CBSE or ICSE schools. This year alone, we have admitted 40 NRI students,” said Sister Melissa, principal of Mount Carmel Central School. She admitted to schools being forced to refuse admission to students since most of the seats were already filled. “CBSE allows for intake of only 40 students per class. Children who have studied the UK syllabus or the ‘O’ levels, find it hard to cope with the change in the curriculum. Learning Kannada, which is a mandatory subject, is also a challenge. We help them tide over the crisis by offering special classes. When we admit children who have studied in the UK curriculum, we enlist their parents’ support in the initial years,” Sister Melissa said. Representatives of the management of Presidency School in Neermarga, Mangaluru said that around 10 NRI students had been enrolled at the institution for the 2021-22 academic year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/rise-in-nri-students-admitted-in-mluru-schools/articleshow/85665671.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

I sincerely request you to settle them in Rampur district. There will be no inconvenience,” Aulakh, who represents Bilaspur in the UP assembly, wrote to Shah on Wednesday. “The residents of Bilaspur tehsil in Rampur (where most are from the Sikh community) are ready to give land to the displaced brothers and sisters.” Aulakh said he took this up with the Centre after talking to his constituents. “During Partition, people were given shelter in the state’s Terai region (now Uttarakhand). They worked hard. Now the region is the state’s rice bowl,” he told TOI. “I have spoken to the people of Bilaspur. They are happy to accept Sikh and Hindu families who have been displaced from Afghanistan because of the Taliban. The families can be given agricultural land on contract by the state to ensure their life is back on track.” The community is also setting up three Guru Granth Sahibs at Gurdwaras in Bilaspur. “We consider the Guru Granth Sahib as a living Guru. Its daily recitation is mandatory,” said Aulakh. “After our initiative, I am sure other states will also offer to help re-establish our brothers and sisters from Afghanistan.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/resettle-sikhs-hindus-from-af-in-ups-rampur-well-help-them-start-afresh-state-minister-to-shah/articleshow/85665708.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The committee has decided to hold the show in December. But the final decision will be taken while keeping in view the probability of the third wave of Covid. However, the department of horticulture of MC’s engineering department has started preparations. The chrysanthemum show is the city’s most popular after the Rose Festival, but due to the pandemic it could not be organised last year. To facilitate the women shopkeepers in Sector 47 booth market, the finance and contract committee also approved the construction of a public toilet block at a cost of Rs 27.01 lakh. Besides, the F&CC also accorded approval for providing and fixing of 80mm-thick interlocking paver blocks along the green belt of Kajheri for parking in Sector 52 at an estimated cost of Rs 31.48 lakh. The committee members also discussed the issue of parking lots throughout the city and asked the officers concerned to submit a detailed report within two days with a checklist of facilities to be provided by the contractors as per the norms finalised in the tender document. The meeting was chaired by mayor Ravikant Sharma and attended by new commissioner Anindita Mitra and officers of the engineering department among others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/chrysanthemum-show-to-be-held-in-dec-fcc-okays-rs-10-45-lakh/articleshow/85668548.cms||---

Also, at a private event related to industries, CM Uddhav Thackeray said without naming Rane that “apart from the coronavirus, the state has to tackle a few old viruses too.” “The Thackeray government should begin a new probe to find those who were responsible for destroying the lives of Shridhar Naik, Ramesh Govekar, Satyavijay Bhise and Ankush Rane (all from Sindhudurg),” Saamna wrote in its second consecutive editorial on the former Sena CM who was arrested by the Thackeray government for his “slap CM” remark on Tuesday and released on bail by Mahad court the same night. Rashmi, wife of CM Uddhav Thackeray, is editor of Saamna, while Sena leader and MP Sanjay Raut is executive editor who usually writes the editorials. In 1991, Shridhar Naik, a Congress youth leader, was brutally murdered in Kankavli. Rane was one of the accused in the case and was acquitted in 1997 when he was minister in the then Sena-BJP alliance government in Maharashtra. Satyavijay Bhise, an NCP worker, was killed in Kankavli in 2002, while Sena man Ramesh Govekar went missing in 2005 and Ankush Rane’s body was found in Sindhudurg in 2009. The Saamna editorial further stated, “Since Rane is not a ‘normal’ man, he has undermined the pride and prestige of Maharashtra” more than any enemy of the state. “At least, now the BJP should learn,” it added. The paper also said that Rane was a “guest” for the few days in the Modi cabinet as Modi considered himself as ‘fakir’, while Rane looks at himself as ‘mahaan’ (great). Meanwhile, CM Thackeray said at an event on Thursday that the Covid crisis has still not been cleared. “Some old virus has come back and without reason is creating side-effects. So we have to tackle both the viruses during the current window period,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-rakes-up-4-past-cases-to-target-rane-cm-says-old-virus-is-back/articleshow/85670890.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

There will also be a flight simulator. Vintage aircraft like Dakota and Spitfire will also be exhibited. There will also be audio-video galleries and a space for showcasing documentaries related to the IAF history, a senior UT official said. The IAF will design the museum, for which it will hire a consultant. The number and type of vintage aircraft will be selected by the air force depending upon the space and design, added the UT official.  The museum will bring greater awareness in the region, particularly among children, about the role and contribution of the IAF. After closing down the building in 2019, the UT administration had decided to set up a vintage car museum there. After it failed to get any response even after floating tenders twice, it was decided to convert the building into an IAF vintage museum.No takers for vintage car museumAfter shutting down the government printing press in 2019, the UT had decided to house a vintage car museum there, a dream project of administrator VP Singh Badnore.

Apart from severe waterlogging in low-lying areas, there were instances of rain-related mishaps as well. A labourer working at a Smart City project site on Parade Ground fell into an open ditch during the rain and sustained injuries. He was rescued by others working at the site and provided medical care. In another incident, a safety wall at Rajiv Gandhi football ground collapsed. The wall had been re-constructed two months ago. Sanjeev Dobhal, a resident, said, "The wall was spread around the area near IT park, Sahastradhara Road, and was repaired recently. The officials should look into it so that these safety walls are built with utmost care and don’t collapse during the rains." Some of the people in Keval Vihar, too, faced problems after rain water entered their homes. Teams from district administration and municipal corporation later helped them in removing the water. Dehradun district magistrate, R Rajesh Kumar, visited the rain-affected areas, particularly the slums along the river. The DM instructed the officials to keep a track on water levels, relocate affected families and ensure immediate help to house owners.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/rains-continue-roads-become-rivers-in-dehradun/articleshow/85665719.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Authorities heaved a sigh of relief, after they found that the source of infection was contaminated water being supplied to the hostel. The hostel houses about 468 postgraduate students. Close to 100 students have been tested till date, and 60 students have tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The results of the rest are yet to come. Hostel warden Govindaraju B M said that from the past week, many of the PG students who were taking exams had fallen sick with cold, mild fever and cough, which are also found in those afflicted with Covid-19. “We had to conduct mass tests of the sick students, as well as their primary contacts. We suspected that many of them were infected with the virus. We were wrong. All the reports that have come in so far are negative. We later checked the water tanks in our hostel, and learnt that it caused the infection in the students. It was cleaned thoroughly, after which the number of inmates developing such symptoms stopped. The hostel was closed for months, and the tanks were not cleaned,” he said, adding that testing will continue whenever inmates show Covid-like symptoms. Sources from MU’s Konaje campus said that all those who have been tested and have symptoms, were made to appear for the PG examinations in separate rooms. In March, for about a month, the men’s hostel was declared as a containment zone. Govindaraju said that more than 25 inmates had tested positive for Covid-19. It was one of the prime reasons to postpone PG examinations. “The exams are on. We don’t want to take any risk this time, and are watching and testing inmates.” When hostel inmates returned to appear for examinations, only one student from Kerala had tested positive for Covid-19. He was shifted to MU’s guest house for 18 days. “We have also asked students from Kerala not to return home till the PG examinations are over,” said Govindaraju.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/contaminated-water-causes-covid-like-symptoms-in-mu-hostel-inmates/articleshow/85665745.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Chandigarh||After Speaker’s request, CM sets ball rolling to make Pkl a pharma hub||Panchkula: After passing of PMDA (Panchkula Metropolitan Development Authority) bill in Haryana Assembly, Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta requested chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to provide special privileges to industrialists to set up a pharmaceutical hub in the district. Gupta said that a few pharmaceutical firm owners who had their units in Baddi and Parwanoo area of the Himachal Pradesh, live in Panchkula. He said a few of them contacted him and expressed an interest in setting up their business in Panchkula soon after the announcement of PMDA. According to Gupta, the industrialists told him that if provided with facilities on the lines of Himachal Pradesh, they would like to shift to Panchkula. “I have requested the Haryana CM to provide facilities to these industrialists on the pattern of HP so that they can start their industries here in Panchkula near their homes,” he said. Gupta pointed out that pharmaceutical companies hardly produce any waste which is dangerous to the environment. The CM instructed officials of the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (HSIIDC) to complete all processes for setting up of the Pharma industry in Barwala soon. He said that since this is an important project of the state government, the process of plot auction should be implemented after negotiations with investors as soon as possible. He said dedicated efforts should be made towards setting up of industrial clusters and developing Barwala as an industrial township. The Centre has also shown interest in setting up the Technology Park in Panchkula, for which 10 acres of land will be given. National Institute of Fashion Technology, (NIFT) will also be inaugurated in Sector 23 soon. On the status of Railway Over Bridge (ROB) in Sector 19, Gupta said bridges have been constructed on both sides and the structure would now be connected with pillars made by the Railways. The ROB will be opened for the public before Diwali. The Central government under ‘Prasad Yojna’ has given Rs 50 crore including Rs 25 crore each to the Nada Sahib Gurudwara and Mata Mansa Devi Shrine Board for various development works to be done under both the boards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/after-speakers-request-cm-sets-ball-rolling-to-make-pkl-a-pharma-hub/articleshow/85668608.cms||Arvind Bishnoi
---||Dehradun||Himachal hotels offer up to 75% discount as tourists avoid hills||NAINITAL: Heavy rain and recurring landslides in Uttarakhand are keeping tourists away from the popular hill station of Nainital, with special discounts for the upcoming Janmashtmi long weekend also failing to boost footfall. According to several hoteliers in Nainital, occupancy for the long weekend is very low even as cancellations have seen a spike due to bad weather. “Many of us are offering discounts, yet tourists are not willing to travel amid the threat of landslides. Most hotels have only 20% occupancy for the upcoming long weekend,” a hotelier told TOI. The hotelier added that most hotels had up to 80% occupancy just a few weeks ago. “Even if the bookings were to pick up now, it is unlikely that most properties would be booked beyond 50% of their capacity,” said Ved Sah, secretary of Nainital hotels and restaurants association. Sah added that the images of collapsed roads, blocked bridges and landslides on social media and in media reports have scared away tourists. “This is the third consecutive weekend when the tourist numbers are expected to remain low,” he said. Just last month, a portion of the road leading to the Governor’s House had collapsed while cracks had appeared on the Bhowali-Nainital highway. Several other roads have also caved in in the recent past. The Bhowali national highway was opened to traffic on Tuesday, but heavy rainfall blocked it again on Wednesday night. Neeraj Kumar, another hotelier from Nainital, said the third wave of the pandemic is also expected to hurt business. “Many hotels have lowered their prices and websites are offering discounts yet bookings are low compared with July and early August. There are predictions of a third wave as well which is likely to cause a decline in tourist numbers again.” Hoteliers in Mussoorie, meanwhile, had better luck. Several of them said they have “good occupancy” for the long weekend. “Hotels are expected to have 70% to 80% occupancy this weekend,” said a hotelier.

---||Chandigarh||MC house approves junior asst’s dismissal||Mohali: The municipal corporation house, on Thursday, unanimously approved junior assistant Kesar Singh’s dismissal from services. The junior assistant was indicted of dereliction of duty after it was found that he connived with dairy owners, letting them release their cattle in the city parks and roads. The agenda was tabled in the house meeting and unanimously approved without any opposition even by SAD councillors. An inquiry committee was formed to probe the allegations against the junior assistant of being lenient in catching stray cattle of dairy farm owners. The report of the committee, which had indicted him of dereliction of duty, was tabled Thursday. His dismissal has been forwarded to the local bodies department for approval. Mayor Amarjit Singh Jeeti Sidhu said, “We have zero tolerance for corruption. Employees found guilty will not be spared.” The action came after three years of investigation, as the committee—led by former Judge B C Gupta and comprising three councillors Rajinder Singh Rana, Jasvir Singh Mankoo and Baljit Kaur—was constituted in February 2018 after MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu raided a park and found stray cattle tied there and grazing. In September 2017, Kesar was heading the MC’s stray cattle catching team when he was accused of being hand in glove with dairy owners. During his visit to inspect the Sector 71 park, Sidhu had found six cattle heads tied there. Thereafter, Kesar called up the cattle owner, who removed the animals from the spot.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mc-house-approves-junior-assts-dismissal/articleshow/85668674.cms||---

Action was initiated against Dr Arjun Singh Sengar, the then Kumbh mela officer (health), and Dr N K Tyagi, who was deployed as the charge officer (health) during the festival, after Haridwar DM Vinay Shankar Pandey submitted a report to the government which highlighted their alleged involvement in the scam. Nearly 1 lakh fake Covid-19 tests were conducted during the mela in Haridwar in April. The report was prepared by a committee headed by the chief development officer of Haridwar, Saurabh Gaharwar, which found the two officials guilty of “indiscipline at work” and being “hand-in-glove with private agencies involved in the scam”. DG health, Dr Tripti Bahuguna, told TOI “an investigation is on against both doctors”.

---||Delhi||Yet another blow to Tihar as SC shifts Chandras out after ED info||New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate's revelations that the Unitech promoters were operating from jail and the Supreme Court subsequently ordering their shift to a jail in Mumbai is being seen as yet another blow to the Tihar administration. The prison has been in the news for all the wrong reasons lately — from murders within the walls to mobile phone usage by inmates. On numerous occasions, Delhi Police has stumbled on evidence of organised extortion rackets being run from inside the prison by incarcerated gangsters. The menace has become a bigger headache after all top gangsters of Delhi were arrested and imprisoned. In leaked videos, several inmates have been heard saying they have been asked for hefty amounts by jail officials to retain a mobile phone or use the internet inside the prison. Recently, Delhi high court questioned the prison authorities for not carrying out a proper investigation into the alleged murder of Shrikant Rama Swami on the day he was to be released. It asked CBI to take over the probe and an FIR has now been filed. Before the dust settled, the murder of gangster Ankit Gujjar rocked the prison. In mounting trouble for the Tihar administration, a video surfaced amid the investigation in this case in which an inmate claimed to be a witness to Gujjar’s murder. The inmate accused around 30 jail officials and guards of having assaulted the gangster in jail on August 3 and feared for his own life. The latest controversy is the Rs 200 crore extortion case carried out by imprisoned conman Sukesh Chandrasekhar. TOI first reported on August 9 on how Chandrasekhar used an iPhone and spoofing software from inside his cell in Rohini jail. Two jail officials have been arrested and others reshuffled in the aftermath of police action in the case. The Tihar administration claimed it was taking all actions possible under its jail manual and was fully cooperating with the investigating agencies. "We have taken action in every instance that has come to our notice," a jail official insisted. Recently, Sandeep Goel, DG, Tihar, reshuffled the jail staff after several instances of in-jail murders, mobile phone usage and leakage of inmates’ videos. At least 23 officials were transferred in a move aimed at breaking the connivance of jail superintendents with inmates. The prison administration is also learnt to be in the process of strengthening the security, which involves personnel from the Tamil Nadu special police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/yet-another-blow-to-tihar-as-sc-shifts-chandras-out-after-ed-info/articleshow/85670860.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai, Delhi make it to global 60 safe cities list||MUMBAI: Two Indian cities —New Delhi and Mumbai— figure on the Safe City Index issued by the Economist Intelligence Unit, the research and analysis division of The Economist Group. The report ranks Mumbai 50 out of 60 cities surveyed. Delhi ranks 48. Copenhagen in Denmark crowns the list. The Safe Cities Index 2021 report ranks 60 cities across 76 indicators, covering digital, health, infrastructure, personal and environmental security. Overall, Mumbai ranks 50 with a score of 54.4 out of 100. On the digital security front, the city ranks 53 with 45.4 points. In terms of health security during the pandemic, Mumbai is at 44 with 60.8 points. On infrastructure security, the city comes in at 48 with 57.3 points. Cyber security expert Ritesh Bhatia analysed the findings and said, “The cybersecurity maturity of private and public organisations, as well as their preparedness, is decently high in Mumbai. The infrastructure, such as internet servers, is also well secured. However, what we really lack is the digital awareness of threats for which public-private partnership is very essential. This needs to be on a continuous basis as cybercrimes are evolving faster than technology and cybersecurity.” According to the EIU index Mumbai fares worse than New Delhi on the personal security quotient. Mumbai earns 48.2 points out of 100 and ranks 50 among the 60 cities surveyed. Delhi is at 41. Mumbai still ranks higher than Dhaka and Karachi though. Dr Nandita Shah, co-director, NGO Akshara Centre, said, “It is sad that Mumbai’s experience of personal safety is so low. The biggest challenge around safety we have found in our work is around accessing and using public transport where women have to navigate lonely subways, foot over bridges or crowded markets outside railway stations. Moreover, infrastructure works around Metro and coastal road have created barricades.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-delhi-make-it-to-global-60-safe-cities-list/articleshow/85665905.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

The MCC decided to set up the project at its dumping yard in Pachanady in November last year, but after a feasibility report of KPC Gas Power Corporation, a subsidiary of Karnataka Power Corporation Limited, put the estimated cost at Rs 150 crore, the corporation thought of alternatives. MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar told TOI that the city corporation has been planning to adopt an alternative, since the waste to energy project needs a large investment, and the city’s waste generation is not sufficient for the project. “A feasibility report prepared by KPCL estimated the cost of the project at Rs 150 crore, which was submitted to the government. However, since it is a huge investment, we have been trying other options. We have been asked to find other methods of waste management that are feasible. Hence, we are trying the black soldier fly composting method at Pachanady,’’ he said. He said that the MCC has not dropped the project. “First of all, it is not practical when it comes to the quantity of garbage generated in the city. It requires an average 400-500 tonnes of waste per day ,to make the waste to energy unit functional, whereas garbage generation in the city is less than 400 tonnes per day,” he said. MCC council opposition leader A C Vinayaraj said the ruling BJP in the council should convince the government to set up a waste to energy project for the city. “The KPCL has already come up with a feasibility report, and it is up to the ruling party in the council to get the project approved by the government. It is the right time to commence the work on the project, since the existing contract of waste management in the city ends in January,’’ Vinayaraj said, adding that the issue will be raised in the next council meeting to be held on August 27.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/waste-to-energy-project-at-pachanady-in-limbo-due-to-high-cost/articleshow/85665844.cms||---

While 87% of the total villages have been successful in containing the spread of the disease, the authorities concerned have stressed on the need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and speedy mass vaccination in order to ensure a sustained battle against the pandemic. Deputy director of health (Aurangabad division) Dr Swapnil Lale said any pandemic disease hits the society in a pattern of periodic waves before assuming the status of endemic disease. “We have seen two devastating waves of Covid-19 in recent past and, therefore , should not lower our guards. Even though most villages in Aurangabad district have not reported fresh cases, we cannot ignore the official warning of the possible third wave,” he said. As per official data, Aurangabad district has 172 villages with active cases of Covid-19 with Vaijapur on top with 62 cases, followed by Paithan (37), Gangapur (35), Aurangabad (14), Kannad, Sillod (both 9), Phulambri (5), Khuldabad (1).

The plea was filed by advocate Bharat Malhotra on behalf of minor siblings, who lost their father due to alleged oxygen shortage at Jaipur Golden Hospital during the second wave of Covid-19 in April-May. The two children, through their mother, have sought compensation for the untimely and preventable death of their father. During the hearing, Malhotra urged the court to grant relief and ensure that there should not be any kind of prejudice to the right of petitioners’ education in the respondent school on account of non-payment of fees. He said the government can step in to pay the fee, but the court pointed out that “free education can’t be in every school, they can provide free education in their schools not in private ones.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-says-covid-orphans-can-get-free-education-in-govt-schools/articleshow/85668724.cms||---

Upon questioning, the cops realised that he was involved in an alleged cyber fraud worth Rs 80 lakh. The man has been staying in Dwarka, Delhi, without a valid visa and passport and is now being interrogated by intelligence agencies, Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan said. He had transferred "duped money" into the bank accounts of four Bareilly residents and was in the city to meet them as they had "cheated" him. He was later arrested on Wednesday night. On Thursday, additional SP (Rural) Rajkumar Agarwal told TOI, “Robert Otujeme, a resident of Lagos city in Nigeria, had approached the cops at Faridpur police station on Wednesday to lodge a complaint against one Harpal, a city resident, for cheating. We found that he was without a passport and he was restless. Suspecting foul play, cops started questioning him." The ASP said, "Upon investigation, we unearthed a larger racket. Harpal’s actual name is Mehandi Hasan and he had opened bank accounts on fake ID proofs. There were transactions of over Rs 80 lakh in the four accounts and the money was transferred from other accounts in the country.” He added, “We are trying to verify if this racket is linked to any Hawala or drug peddling or if it is a case of cyber fraud. The bank transactions are being thoroughly scanned by experts." For years now, Otujeme was allegedly misusing the bank accounts of several individuals by "transferring the money duped from others and sharing 20% with the real account holder". He has been booked under sections of Passports Act, the Foreigners Act and the IT Act along with relevant IPC sections of forgery while Hasan and his son Arbaaz Khan have been booked for forgery. They are still at large. Two of Hasan's aides are also under police scanner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/nigerian-man-held-for-cyber-fraud-staying-without-valid-visa-since-2011/articleshow/85663642.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Delhi||Bus row: Gahlot takes BJP’s Gupta to court||New Delhi: Criminal and civil defamation suits have been filed by transport minister Kailash Gahlot against BJP MLA Vijender Gupta for making “scandalous allegations” in the purchase of low-floor buses. In a statement, Delhi government said, “A civil suit and a criminal complaint were filed against Vijender Gupta after he intentionally defamed and tarnished the reputation of the transport minister for mala fide purposes and to gain political mileage.” Gahlot sought Rs 5 crore as damages in the civil defamation suit from Gupta and action against him under relevant sections in the criminal defamation case. The minister further sought removal of all defamatory content posted by Gupta on Twitter and Facebook. The minister moved the court after Gupta circulated “defamatory material” on social media alleging corruption and scam in the purchase of 1,000 low-floor buses as well as their maintenance for life. “Without verifying the facts, Gupta intentionally and with malice called the transport minister corrupt and involved in open loot,” the civil defamation suit stated. It was further stated that the transport department had successfully inducted around 1,500 new buses since 2017. The move brought relief and joy to people dependent on public transport. The criminal defamation case stated that the purchase of the 1,000 buses for the benefit of Delhiites did not go down well with Gupta. He did not tolerate that Delhi government was successfully undertaking one project after another, thereby developing the city and making the lives of people comfortable. “Due to the public spirited work being undertaken by Delhi government, the BJP MLA has gotten petrified and finds his future in politics bleak,” it added. Alleging a scam in the purchase and maintenance of buses, Gupta had approached the Anti Corruption Bureau and LG Anil Baijal. The LG ordered formation of a committee, which gave a clean chit to Gahlot after no case of corruption was made out. “Vijender Gupta has been intentionally putting up content on Twitter and Facebook against the minister despite the fact that his queries were cleared in the Delhi legislative assembly,” the government said. The civil defamation suit said that the BJP MLA had raised a star question in Delhi assembly in July seeking a response and clarification on the procurement and maintenance of buses and he was provided all answers to his satisfaction.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bus-row-gahlot-takes-bjps-gupta-to-court/articleshow/85668836.cms||---

Development of Kanpur as a tourist and industrial hub, replication of the Indore swachh model have been proposed in the scope of the MoU established by the department of higher education, ministry of human resource development and Central government. “We are drafting a plan to turn street vendors into a more organized sector,” director IIM-Indore, Prof Himanshu Rai told TOI. He said, IIM-Indore is designing a platform for online real-time monitoring of civil infrastructure and preparing a traffic management plan, besides drafting a plan for implementing information, education and communication (IEC) as per Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) programme. “Also, we are defining new areas of collaboration that can be beneficial to institutions," said Rai. He added, “Highly trained personnel prefer to move to places with better standards of research, higher salaries and access to advanced technology. Such an initiative will reduce brain drain and provide quality infrastructure to encourage people to return to their roots,” he said. He said, modalities are being planned to establish industrial units, particularly leather industry in the city. “Meetings would be organised with district officials, local industrialists, businessmen and local representatives. Surveys would be conducted to get a first-hand information on problems faced by local industrialists and modalities for making Kanpur region an industrial hub. We will identify problem areas in industrial growth and remove bottlenecks," he said. Rai said, there was immense potential for establishing the leather sector and for which Kanpur is globally known. “And such a step will bring socio-economic changes in lives of people." The MoU will be effective from the date of signing by institutions for a period of three years and may be subject to extension through mutual consent of institutions, he said. Any institution can terminate the MoU with a three-month notice. Provisions of the MoU may be amended at any time with mutual consent of institutions in writing. Amendment, termination and expiration of the MoU will not affect terms of activity at the time of notification, termination and expiration unless otherwise agreed upon by institutions. The MoU riders include that no action would be undertaken to diminish autonomy of any institution, nor any party shall impose constraints to carry out the agreement. Rai further said, special provisions in the MoU entail that every institution will consult and take approval of other institutions to use names of officials/faculty members and logo for activities and dissemination of results on a case-by-case basis. Detailed modalities of individual forms of collaboration, activities associated with them and financial aspects of each shall be mutually agreed upon on a case-by-case basis and specified with necessary details in separate agreements. This MoU will not be legally and financially binding to any of the institutions. The four institutions will consult with each other and attempt to resolve disputes or misunderstanding. All Institutions will designate persons who will have responsibility for coordination and implementation of this agreement. The intellectual property rights (IPR) that arise as a result of joint research and collaborative activity under the agreement will be worked out on a case-to-case basis and will be consistent with officially laid-down IPR policies of the four institutions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/mou-with-iim-indore-civic-bodies-to-turn-kanpur-into-industrial-tourist-hub/articleshow/85669927.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Nashik||Nashik, Jalgaon districts lead in planned vaccination drive in north Maharashtra||NASHIK: Nashik and Jalgaon are leading the five districts in north Maharashtra in executing the planned Covid-19 vaccination sessions since January this year. Currently, Nashik is at top having organised over 98% of the 22,441 vaccination sessions it had planned. Next, Jalgaon has held over 97% of the 11,938 sessions that the district had planned. Cumulatively, over 94% of the total 69,415 sessions planned in Nashik, Jalgaon, Dhule, Ahmednagar and Nandurbar have been held so far. Deputy director of health (Nashik division) Dr P D Gandal told TOI, “We are confident that this trend will improve as the vaccine supplies have been stepped up.” Both Nashik and Jalgaon authorities said that under the guidance of Nashik district collector Suraj Mandhare and his Jalgaon counterpart Abhijit Raut, they were able to plan and implement the vaccination programme meticulously. “In Nashik, there is real-time monitoring of the daily progress of vaccination in over 300 government centres in the district, including Nashik and Malegaon cities. Our healthcare workers are doing a fantastic job in inoculating the beneficiaries,” said Nashik district’s vaccination coordinator and deputy collector, Ganesh Misal. Misal said that the distribution of vaccines is done in a judicious manner to ensure vaccination sessions are held as planned. “If any centre has sufficient leftover stock, we refrain from supplying any more vaccine,” he added. Jalgaon civil surgeon Dr N S Chavan said that Raut has been taking daily feedback in the evening about the response at each of the over 153 session sites. “Such deliberations have led to better coordination. We have also set up health teams that conduct surprise checks at the sites,” added Chavan. The region’s health authorities said that execution of sessions in tribal dominated Nandurbar is tougher than the other four districts due to the mountainous terrain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-jalgaon-dists-lead-in-planned-vax-drive-in-north-maha/articleshow/85663619.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee needs to be elected to the assembly after having lost the Nandigram seat to BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari who had crossed over to the saffron fold just before the elections. The delegation of five MPs -- Sougata Roy, Sajda Ahmed and Mohua Moitra from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members Sukhendu Sekhar Ray and newly elected member Jawhar Sircar – urged the EC to conduct the bypolls at the earliest since the Covid-19 situation in the state is under control. While there is time till November for the bypolls to be held, the upcoming festival season could come in the way of the polls, the TMC delegation argued. The TMC delegation of MPs submitted a written reply to the EC's earlier letter seeking views of all the parties on holding the elections. Sources said EC assured the delegation that it would hold the bypolls on seven seats as per its mandate. EC may consult West Bengal chief secretary and CEO in the coming days to assess Covid-19 situation in the state before taking final call, sources said. Moitra told the media that “it was a good meeting and EC also talked about the possibility of holding bypolls in two phases if necessary”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trinamool-team-meets-ec-seeks-bypolls-at-the-earliest-in-west-bengal/articleshow/85674560.cms||---

NMC wrote to MPCB stating that no permission was given to fell trees at Ajni, Futala and Ambazari garden, which activists counter by sharing satellite images with TOI which clearly show large-scale destruction in all the three areasNagpur: The local agencies have misled the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on facts submitted regarding tree felling in the city, activists have alleged.A series of internal communications between the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), which were procured by a group by activists through Right to Information (RTI), has brought to the fore various loopholes.It all started with environment activists writing a letter to PMO, complaining about destruction of green cover and unsustainable development in the city. Responding to this, the PMO forwarded the complaint to state department which directed the MPCB to look into it.In a letter written to MPCB on March 3 this year, NMC stated that it has not given any permission to fell trees at Ajni, Futala and Ambazari garden. However countering this claim, activists have shared satellite images with TOI which clearly show large-scale destruction in all the three areas. “In Ambazari, around 70 to 100 trees were chopped without permission.In Futala, Nagpur Metro took permission for 12 but chopped more than 100 trees.In Ajni area railway, over 70 trees have been chopped for residential quarters while another 50 were felled for a shed,” said environment activist Kunal Mourya, adding that NMC issued show cause notices but didn’t take any further action.In a letter written in March this year, NHAI informed MPCB that no construction activity has started by the contractor till date. “All the departments are giving false information to the PMO office. Violating its own norms, the Central railway has already started construction of 98 flats for which trees were felled illegally,” said Mourya.As per the latest norms of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, for commercial development of railway land, it is mandatory to get an environment management plan approved by the Environment and Housekeeping Management (EnHM) directorate.Documents reveal that the plan for IMS is awaiting the approval. “NHAI and railway officials have violated basic norms of environmental clearance. They failed to take sanction from MPCB too. Before allotting the IMS project work, none of the guidelines which a common citizen is asked to follow have been followed by any of the government departments,” said environment activist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani.When TOI had reported about IMS project being planned in multiple phases, NHAI had issued a clarification stating that a group of activists have been misleading the citizens by spreading wrong information. Now, the RTI documents make it evident that commercial parts of the project are also under planning. “From the agreement, it is very clear that they want to acquire 446 acres of land for the multi-phased project, yet it is not mentioned in the DPR. Entire process of allocation of work is full of flaws, complete violation of guidelines by all authorities, for reasons best known to them,” said Chhabrani.The environment ministry’s norms further state that for a railway project, no tree should neither be transplanted nor felled till “urgency demands”. “Old trees should be retained,” it added. To this, activists said, “Most of the trees at Ajni are age-old and heritage.”NMC and NHAI could not be contacted for their response.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/pmo-misled-on-tree-felling-in-city-say-green-crusaders/articleshow/85668843.cms||Manka Behl

Over 50% of the total teachers are fully vaccinated. “The higher secondary schools are functioning only in rural areas at this point in time. A good number of teachers got vaccinated when vaccination for Front Line Workers had started. We had also stressed on the need of teachers getting vaccinated before starting the schools though it was not compulsory,” Manisha Pingalkar, extension officer of secondary education office (Nashik ZP), said. Shantaram Deshmukh of headmasters’ association in Nashik said they also stressed on vaccination of teachers before starting physical classes. “Lots of students were suffering since schools were being conducted online. We, therefore, wanted the schools to function. Since creating an atmosphere of safety in the schools was our responsibility we stressed on vaccination of the teachers,” he said. The teachers, however, said that they were still unable get vaccination through the government system owing to which they were opting for private vaccination centres. “The private vaccination centres are helping us get vaccinated. I took both the doses at a private centre because it was difficult to get the booking slot for centres being run by the government. Besides, it was my moral responsibility to ensure that I got vaccinated before our school began,” Ramesh Dheringe, one of the teachers, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/over-50-zp-teachers-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/85663646.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Participating in the monthly grievance day meeting at the district collectorate here on Thursday, they said the water may not last till January. District collector S Sivarasu chaired the meeting along with senior officials from agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and allied departments through videoconferencing where farmers aired their demands from various destinations through the digital mode. Farmers from Lalgudi, Thiruverumbur, Mannachanallur and Musiri have raised kuruvai paddy on about 25,000 acres. Tamizhaga Eri Mattrum Attru Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam president P Viswanathan echoed the farmers’ view that the current storage in Mettur reservoir may not be sufficient to raise their crop. “So, the state government should act swiftly to get our due share of water in Cauvery,” he added. Farmers said the Centre’s announcement of Rs 50 as fair and remunerative price for sugarcane would in no way help farmers. Though the state government had announced about Rs 11,000 crore for crop loans, farmers said they found it difficult to avail it and urged cooperative department officials to sanction it without delay. Several farmers from Pullambadi and Manachanallur are raising cotton and maize. But since the yield was not good enough in the last few years, farmers urged officials from to visit the fields and educate farmers on getting a high yield.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/farmers-worried-over-mettur-water-level/articleshow/85670962.cms||---

---||Trichy||Anti-dengue drive launched in Trichy||Trichy: After coming under severe criticism, Trichy Corporation has finally launched a dengue prevention drive by letting Gambusia fish into open wells to eliminate mosquito larvae. With five fresh dengue cases surfacing in various parts in August so far, residents complained that their localities were not covered.One new case of a 12-year-old girl has been reported in Kattur in ward 61. As the locality has multiple open wells brimming with water, the civic body suspects dengue mosquitoes must have bred there and have let Gambusia affinis, a larvivorous fish used as part of the anti-dengue drive.The wells will have male and female fishlings which will multiply further by feeding on the mosquito larvae. “We are surveying the wells to cover them.

The number of active cases in Niphad has dropped from 120 to 70 within a month, while cases in Sinnar have come down from over 150 to 130 during the same period. Cases in all the other talukas are now less than 50. “The number of cases in the taluka hs dropped significantly. We do not have any patient on ventilator,” Sinnar taluka health officer Dr Mohan Bachchhav said. The number of daily cases in both the talukas is now around 20. Dr Nawalsing Chavan, taluka health officer of Niphad, said the number of villages termed as hotspots — where active cases are more than five — were also on decline. “The number of hotspot villages in the taluka had also gone down from 11 to four during the period and the number of villages gaining the Covid-free status has also increased marginally from 92 to 95. The situation is slowly becoming normal,” Chavan said. Niphad also does not have a single patient on the ventilator now. The taluka has 95 Covid-free villages out of 137 villages, while Sinnar taluka had 79 Covid-free villages out of the total 128 villages. Bachchhav added there were some patients who were partly or fully vaccinated. “Bulk of the patients were not vaccinated, though were some who have been partly or fully vaccinated. Though the age-group is mixed, the number of elders is a slightly high,” he said. The doctors also pointed out that complications were not seen among the vaccinated. “This is the reason we are appealing to the people to get vaccinated at the earliest so that they can at least cut down the impact of the infection,” Chavan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/covid-situation-eases-in-niphad-sinnar-talukas/articleshow/85663684.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Two brothers die in Bopal manhole||AHMEDABAD: Two tribal labourers, who were asked to enter a drainage line without protective gear were asphyxiated by sewer gas in Bopal on Thursday. The brothers were pulled out from a 20 feet deep manhole by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s fire personnel. A frantic search for the third brother, who had entered the manhole first, again with no protective gear, is currently on. The tragic incident took place around 11:45am, when the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority contractor, who had employed the tribal family, had allegedly asked Sandeep Meda, 33, to enter the manhole and break a wall of an already sealed but connecting dummy drainage line, which was pushed across a railway line. Firemen use JCB and safety gear to look for SandeepThe manhole was small and a human could barely squeeze through. “As soon as Sandeep broke the wall, he began choking on trapped sewer gas. The eldest brother Bharat, 53, and youngest brother Raju, 25, jumped in to save him. When the trio did not surface, the police and AMC fire department were called. The families lived in shanties near Shantivan farms in Shela,” said police. Geeta Meda in tears as she prays for her husband’s safe returnThe fire department with an earthmover even dug a trench along the line in the hope of recovering Sandeep’s body, but in vain. “We have identified another spot to dig but operations will resume on Friday,” said AFES official Mithun Mistry. Geeta Meda, wife of Sandeep, claimed the brothers usually preferred working at construction sites and had no experience of sewer work.“My three kids and I are praying for Sandeep’s life,” said Geeta, who was yet not aware of the deaths of Raju and Bharat. Police have arrested labour supervisor Himmat Patel and labour contractor Sanket Patel. Meanwhile, an AMC official claimed the 16km AUDA drainage line was operational since 12 days ago and that the contractor had no business sending anyone in. The line linked Bopal sewage pumping station to Shantipura trunk line. “The pumping station was built four years ago, but due to Covid, the work of pushing a line across Bopal railway was completed only last month,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/two-brothers-die-in-bopal-manhole/articleshow/85668925.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Fake baba dupes elderly promising land deal in Jammu & Kashmir||NEW DELHI: A self-proclaimed baba was arrested for allegedly duping an elderly couple of over Rs 1 crore on the pretext of getting them a scenic property in Jammu & Kashmir. According to police, the accused, Naresh Kumar, often visited the couple’s house on festivals and functions for rituals. During one such visit last year, he made them an offer to purchase a piece of prime land, while citing the abrogation of Article 370 and claiming it would soon be possible for everyone to buy land there, thereby leading to a sharp increase in the rates. According to DCP (West) Urvija Goel, Kumar was arrested from Jammu by a team led by SHO (Rajouri Garden) Anil Sharma. A case was registered in October last year on the complaint by the elderly woman, police said. The complainant alleged that Kumar and his family had developed friendly relations with them. After they got lured into his offer and promises, the accused allegedly took blank cheques from the complainant and her family after gaining their confidence and trust. “The suspect transferred around 1.25 crore in different accounts in lieu of purchasing the property in Jammu & Kashmir in the name of the complainant and her family members,” the DCP said. During investigation, several raids were conducted across the state and ground verifications were carried out in hostile conditions. As the accused had gone underground, non-bailable warrants were issued by a court. Subsequently, the family of the accused also joined the investigation, but the accused continued to remain elusive. Recently, the cops received a tip-off about Kumar’s presence in Upper Roop Nagar in Jammu, following which a team comprising SI Rajpal and others conducted a raid and arrested him. The accused was produced before the court and taken on remand for interrogation. Police were now investigating if Kumar had duped others in a similar way. They are also trying to recover the cheated money and have appealed to people not to fall for such offers made by unscrupulous elements aimed at duping them of their hard-earned money.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/fake-baba-dupes-elderly-promising-land-deal-in-jk/articleshow/85668931.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||‘Deaths prove violation of manual scavenging laws’||Ahmedabad: It’s demeaning, it’s fatal, and it was banned in India 28 years ago. Yet, manual scavenging — one of the country’s deadliest jobs — has once again claimed two lives in Ahmedabad. Two tribal labourers choked to death and one went missing after they were made to enter a sewage line in Bopal in clear violation of Section 5 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act 2013. The Act prohibits state and union territories to employ workers for manual scavenging of sewage and drainage lines. In July 2019, Gujarat government had also submitted before the Gujarat High Court that civic bodies have been directed to ensure that no person shall be asked to enter manholes for cleaning. The government submitted that nodal officers will be appointed in all civic bodies to ensure that safety guidelines are adhered to and criminal proceedings are initiated against anyone, be it an officer or contractor, for violations of the same. This submission was made in response to a writ petition by Manav Garima Trust, an organisation working for the rights of manual scavengers. “Despite all these laws, civic authorities in the state have mostly outsourced work for cleaning sewage and drainage networks. They wash their hands off once the contract is awarded,” says Parsottam Vaghela, director of Manav Garima Trust. Vaghela said that contractors make manhole workers enter drainage systems late at night without safety gear. “They make them work continuously for 5-6 hours. I have been watching the rescue work by fire department and what these firemen are doing with hi-tech safety gears is what manhole workers do without any gear,” he said. Vaghela who was present at the incident spot said he has asked the police to lodge complaint under IPC sections of culpable homicide and under atrocity Act. Between 2015 and 2019, Gujarat reported 39 deaths of manhole workers engaged in manual scavenging.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/deaths-prove-violation-of-manual-scavenging-laws/articleshow/85669001.cms||---

This comes even as some states are demanding negative Covid test reports on entry from travellers, irrespective of their vaccination status. The ministry in its guidelines said the Centre had not recommended any restrictions on inter-state travel in the context of Covid. It said states had earlier been allowed to develop their own protocols regarding quarantine and isolation. In its advisory to states and UTs, the ministry said fully-vaccinated asymptomatic people, having the final inoculation certificate and with 15 days having lapsed since the second shot, could be exempted from the mandatory requirement of negative RT-PCR or RAT reports on entry into a state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/let-fully-vaccinated-enter-without-rt-pcr-centre-tells-states/articleshow/85674586.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Civic body instructed to end its 15-year gardens dispute with NIT||Nagpur: After instructions from Union minister Nitin Gadkari, BJP-ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is all set to end its 15-year dispute with the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) over the latter taking over gardens for operation and maintenance. None of the two authorities is maintaining the gardens following the controversy that broke out 16 months ago. “Gadkari suggested that the NMC maintain all the gardens and NIT take care of all the playgrounds in the meeting held recently. Even Gadkari instructed the NMC not to ask NIT for funds for work and maintenance of the gardens,” sources from NMC told TOI. The move will pave the way for execution of more work in gardens and proper operation and maintenance by NMC. Confirming the development, ruling party leader in NMC Avinash Thakre said, “The proposal will come up for discussion in the general body meeting. As the gardens are meant for the public, the NMC will take the responsibility of operation and maintenance. We do expect some funds from the NIT for executing work and maintenance of gardens.” NIT had made over 100 gardens in various parts of the city of which 29 small gardens were handed over to the NMC in May 2005. After NIT kept some big gardens, the civic body refused to take over the remaining gardens. In June 2013, the NIT again took a decision to hand over 60 small and medium gardens to the NMC. Again, the civic body declined the NIT’s proposal. The state government made NMC the sole planning authority of the city and withdrew powers of the NIT in 2019. On June 16, 2020, NIT handed over 51 gardens to the NMC. At that time, the NMC administration took over the gardens. Stating that gardens were lacking policy decision, the general body passed a resolution to stall the take over. The NMC then asked the NIT to take back the gardens which the latter never did. Following complaints by corporators and citizens, the NMC was left with no option but to operate and maintain a majority of the 51 gardens. The government restored the powers of the planning authority to the NIT in February. Again, the civic body asked the NIT to take back the gardens but the latter refused to do so. “The NMC engaged security guards as well as a contractor to maintain the garden in Suyog Nagar. NIT did not complete work at the new garden developed at Friends Colony in Narendra Nagar. We are completing the work from funds approved by Devendra Fadnavis during his tenure as CM,” said Thakre. BJP corporator Virendra Kukreja said, “I ensured that the NMC continued with the security agency and contractor engaged by the NIT at Dayanand Park in Jaripatka. We can’t close or leave the garden as it is beneficial for people.” Congress corporator Manoj Sangole alleged that the three gardens in his ward were neither maintained by the NMC nor by the NIT. “Gardens were in bad shape due to the dispute between the two agencies. The authorities should not abandon infrastructure developed at the cost of public money,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/civic-body-instructed-to-end-its-15-year-gardens-dispute-with-nit/articleshow/85669065.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Mumbai||Live-in relationship consensual: Court; man gets bail in rape case||MUMBAI: Granting bail to a 30-year-old Vile Parle resident, arrested last month for allegedly raping his partner, a sessions court has observed that the live-in relationship by itself is sufficient to show that the sexual relationship was consensual. The court said that irrespective of the “no objection” given by the woman to his bail, the FIR reveals that the relationship was consensual for the simple reason that she started residing with the accused continuously, without getting married to him. “The said live-in relationship, by itself is sufficient to show that the sexual relationship was consensual, due to which, the applicant is entitled to be enlarged on bail…the ‘no objection’ given by the informant, notwithstanding whether it is voluntarily or otherwise,” the court said. The former couple lived together between November 2018 and May 2020. The woman claimed she was forced to undergo two abortions. The man then broke off with her and married another woman. She then went to the police and an FIR was lodged against the accused. The accused was booked under the Indian Penal Code sections relating to causing miscarriage without a woman’s consent and rape. The maximum sentence attracted in the case is life term. Seeking bail, the defence told the court that the accused and the woman were married prior to their sexual relationship. Subsequently, they got together and rented an apartment. It was also submitted that the man was falsely implicated and that the relationship was consensual. The defence pointed out that the woman had refused to undergo a medical examination after lodging the FIR. It was also submitted that she had given an affidavit stating that she did not object to the bail plea of the accused. The prosecution, however, objected to the bail plea and submitted that the woman was being pressurized. The prosecution further submitted that the investigation is in progress and the woman’s statement was yet to be recorded before a magistrate. The investigating officer added that the release of the accused before the completion of investigation was likely to affect the case. The court, however, allowed the bail plea and said that the accused is to be released on executing a bond of Rs 15,000 with one or more sureties. The court also directed him not tamper with the prosecution witnesses in any manner.

---||Nagpur||Tension in Yavatmal after ex-MLA Dhote’s house vandalized||Yavatmal: Tension prevailed in Yavatmal city after the residence of former MLA Vijaya Dhote was vandalized allegedly by Bunty Jaiswal and Sumit Bajoria on Wednesday afternoon over a property dispute. In her police complaint, Dhote said she was issued threats to life. Wife of former MP Jambuwantrao Dhote and daughter of former deputy chief minister Ramrao Adik, Vijaya was alone in the house when Jaiswal and Bajoria allegedly barged in with over 100 supporters. She said Jaiswal smashed the glass of the teapoy and had a pistol in his hand. “Bajoria came with youths, mostly hardcore criminals, in a truck and broke open the gate and tried to erect a mesh fence adjacent to the house. A bull-dozer was deployed to pull down a part of the compound wall built by us over 40 years ago,” she said. She said that the plot where the house stands was gifted to Jambuwantrao Dhote by one Satyanarayan Agrawal. “I have the gift deed which was executed in 1985,” she said. Her daughter Jwala and her supporters staged a rasta roko on Waghapur Road. Later, addressing a press conference, Jwala Dhote alleged that cops remained silent spectators when the incident occurred. She has demanded SIT probe into the “unaccountable wealth and prime land owned by Jaiswal and Bajoria”. Shopkeepers in Netaji Chowk pulled down their shutters to protest the attack. Supporters of Dhotes staged a dharna in front of the city police station to demand immediate arrest of Jaiswal and Bajoria. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Vijaya Dhote’s another daughter Kranti Raut criticised the police for their “inaction”. “The city police have registered an FIR against Jaiswal and Bajoria under sections 354 (A), 452, 447, 143, 147, 427, 504 and 506 of IPC on a complaint lodged by Vijayatai. However no arrest has been made so far,” she said. Kranti Raut has demanded for a probe into the “criminal activities of Bunty-Sumit duo, probe into the huge wealth owned by Bajoria, probe into the role of police, revenue officers and Bhoomi Abhikekh officers who were present on the spot”. “Though Bunty Jaiswal had a pistol with him, the police failed to invoke Arms Act. As a matter of fact, Bunty Jaiswal is on conditional bail. Yet, he is moving fearlessly in the city and involving himself in land grabbing,” she said. Kasabai, a 90-year-old woman who claimed to be wife of ex-Army man Marotrao Thakle of Netaji Nagar, said that she had lodged a complaint with Wadgaon Road police station against Bajoria over a dispute for agricltural land along the ring road in Wadgaon area “but no action was taken”. Sruthi and Swatha Diwate said that their father Pravin Diwate was brutally murdered by a gang led by Jaiswal who was in jail before getting conditional bail. Kranti said that they would give a befitting reply to Jaiswal and Bajoria for the unprovoked attack on her mother. She pointed out the then opposition leader Vike Patil on the floor of the Assembly had said that Jaiswals had a cache of weapons and enjoyed political patronage. Bajoria, while addressing a press conference on Thursday, said that he had purchased the open plots besides Dhote’s residence from Century Empex Pvt Ltd which had bought it from Satyanarayan Agrawal in 1985. “I sought police protection before reaching the site to take possession of the plots,” said Bajoria, adding that in government records the plots are in his name. SP Dilip Patil Bhujbal and police station officer Pradeep Siraskar could not be contacted. It is learnt, special IG of Amravati Chandrakishor Meena has reached the city to take stock of the situation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/tension-in-yavatmal-after-ex-mla-dhotes-house-vandalized/articleshow/85669145.cms||---

As clamour grew, the medical education and drugs department on late Thursday evening released a GR confirming appointment of Dr Bhavana Sonavane as dean of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH). At IGGMCH, resident doctors had been highlighting the sorry state of affairs at the Surgical Complex till Thursday. Doctors and patients are suffering due to lack of manpower and hygiene. After Dr Ajay Keolia superannuated this month, IGGMCH’s dean post became vacant. Talks of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and Government Dental College and Hospital (GDCH) too getting full-time deans were doing the rounds but no order was issued. The GMCH dean post fell vacant in May following the resignation of Dr Sajal Mitra. Dr Sudhir Gupta has been holding charge since his departure. The GDCH dean’s post has been lying vacant for more than four years, and the institution is helmed by Dr Mangesh Phadnaik. Dr Vinay Hazarey was the last full-time dean of the dental college. The case of both GMCH and GDCH is strange as two professors in their departments have cleared the state-level selection process for dean’s post but are yet to get a posting for more than a year. Dean posts of physiotherapy and government ayurveda colleges, besides that of several Class I officers in Super Speciality Hospital too have been lying vacant for several years now. One of the deans said of the 15 medical and three dental colleges, 12 were being run on additional charge till Thursday. Among the three GDCHs in the state, two still don’t have a full-time dean. In fact, the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), which is the apex body in the state, too is helmed by acting director Dr Dilip Mhaisekar. Dr TP Lahane held additional charge until he retired this year. Last week, Dr Mhaisekar claimed that GMCH already has a full-time dean in Dr Gupta, who is yet to receive the order. “The other two deans too would be named by September first week,” he had said. GDCH Mumbai too had got a full-time dean recently but he was shifted as joint director soon after assuming charge in a departmental promotion. Sources said the absence of full-time deans has badly affected routine affairs of the colleges and hospitals. “Ultimately, people are at the receiving end due to lack of decision making. The acting dean has full powers but doesn’t get involved much, knowing that he may be removed any time. Also, when the delay is long, there comes a time when they stop paying attention to core issues,” they said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/medical-colleges-running-sans-full-time-deans-works-hit/articleshow/85665704.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

In its latest circular, GCPB said , “After the Covid pandemic, industries made representations to the government asking that they be allowed to pay EDC in instalments as they are finding it difficult to pay in one go. As decided by GPCB, the concerned industrial unit will have to pay a minimum 50% of the EDC to get revocation permission and the remaining 50% in six equal monthly instalments with 12% simple interest on it.” “Any industrial unit can apply for this to the GPCB,’’ a source said.

Pictures of ex-communication and IT minister Syed Ahmad Shah Saadat, clad in an orange vest typical of Lieferando food delivery staff in Germany, broke the internet after a journalist tweeted about meeting a man who claimed to have been part of the Ashraf Ghani-led government in Afghanistan for two years. "I asked what he was doing in Leipzig. 'I am driving out of Essen for Lieferando,' he told me," the German journalist wrote. Saadat, a highly qualified professional with a master's degree each in communications and electronic engineering from Oxford University, was a minister from 2018 until his resignation from the Ghani cabinet last year. He arrived in Germany with his family last December, presumably convinced he needed to make a new beginning in a safer environment than his native country. Not that he knew the Taliban would capture Afghanistan this easily and so soon. In an interview with Sky News, Saadat said, "The fall of the Ashraf Ghani government so quickly was not expected." So, how difficult was it for an ex-dignitary to give up his lifestyle in Afghanistan for the rigours of working-class existence in a European nation? "I feel safe in Germany. I am happy to be with my family in Leipzig. I want to save money and do a German course and study further," Saadat was quoted as saying by local media.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/simple-and-safe-ex-afghan-minister-happy-to-deliver-pizzas-in-leipzig/articleshow/85671302.cms||Jatin Verma
---||Pune||Pune: Two held on charge of abetting suicide||PUNE: A 45-year-old construction contractor on Wednesday ended his life by consuming poison after he did not get his dues of Rs1.94 crore from five people, including a builder from Chinchwad. The contractor waited outside the builder’s office in Chinchwad from Tuesday for his dues. When he did not get the money, he consumed poison on Wednesday. He was taken to a nearby private hospital, where he died during treatment. His brother-in-law later filed an FIR with the Nigdi police. Senior inspector Ganesh Jawadwad of the Nigdi police said, “We have found a suicide note with the victim. He had mentioned the names of five in the suicide note. We have arrested two of them.” Jawadwad said the victim was a construction contractor and had completed different types of construction work for the suspects in the last one-and-a-half-years. “According to the complaint, the suspects did not pay the contractor his dues. He was under stress because of that,” the officer said. The suspects had been booked under the charges of suicide abetment and cheating, Jawadwad said. In July, the Wakad police had arrested two persons, including a labour union leader, in connection with the suicide of a Marathi film art director, who was found hanging from the ceiling fan of his flat. The deceased had shot a video before ending his life claiming harassment by the union leader.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/two-held-on-charge-of-abetting-suicide/articleshow/85669201.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Joint probe launched as more flyers complain about thefts from luggage||KOLKATA: Several passengers, who have recently flown out of Kolkata airport, complained that their checked-in baggage had been tampered with and that valuables had gone missing. Following the allegations, the Kolkata airport authorities and Airports Authority of India have launched a joint investigation to track those responsible for the thefts. TOI on Wednesday reported on a complaint from a software engineer, who had taken a flight out of Kolkata. The flyer, Chandan Prakash, had said initially he did not even detect anything amiss with his trolley bag, but later found its outer compartment had been slit open from the inside lining and certain items had been taken out by unzipping it. Following this report, more flyers sent similar complaints about thefts and damage to their luggage spread over several months. Aditya Bubna, a businessman from New Alipore, said a similar incident happened with him when he had flown to Delhi on August 8 for a family trip to Himachal Pradesh. “I had kept Rs 25,000 in the upper pocket of my rucksack. When the luggage arrived on Belt 2 at Delhi’s Terminal 2, the cash was stolen and the bag was torn from inside. I wrote multiple mails to the airline but neither got my money back nor any compensation,” Bubna told TOI. TimesViewThe decision to get to the bottom of this issue is laudable. The last thing that flyers want, especially when Covid protocols have already made travelling so complicated, is this type of harassment.Airport officials said the complaints indicated that a section of ground staff at the Kolkata airport could be responsible. “We have started an investigation based on flyers’ complaints. All the points, where baggage is handled, are under CCTV coverage. We are finding out whether there is a shadow area, which is being misused by some people to carry out the thefts,” said airport director C Pattabhi. An official pointed out there was a small shadow area, when bags are loaded into the plane’s belly and a staffer adjusted their placements inside the aircraft. “The mischief may have have occurred then,” he said. Prakash, who flagged off the thefts, said the airline contacted him with an assurance of compensation. “The IndiGo customer care team promised to send a new trolley bag. But no culprit has been found so far, I was told. I reported the matter not to get compensation but to raise awareness,” said Prakash.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/joint-probe-launched-as-more-flyers-complain-about-thefts-from-luggage/articleshow/85669237.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Delhi||No bail for cop, another accused in extortion case||New Delhi: A city court has dismissed the bail pleas of a constable posted at the dog squad of Delhi Police, and the son of a safai karamchari, who worked with the Crime Branch, for allegedly extorting Rs 9 lakh from a man saying the allegations were indeed serious in nature. Special Judge Dig Vinay Singh said there was possibility that if released on bail, either of the two accused might tamper with evidence, particularly when one of them was a serving police officer on the date of apprehension. According to the prosecution, the accused had allegedly extorted and obtained Rs 9 lakh after threatening the complainant that they would implicate him or his son in a criminal case unless the money was paid. The court noted that according to police even forgery was committed by preparing a forged identity card of Delhi Police in the name of one of the accused. The counsel for the constable had claimed that he was falsely implicated in the matter due to enmity between him and the complainant. The counsel for the other accused said he was ready to deposit the balance amount, besides what had been recovered from the account out of the extorted amount. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/no-bail-for-cop-another-accused-in-extortion-case/articleshow/85699624.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Not much action, Delhi-NCR may choke again on farm fires||NEW DELHI: North India, including Delhi-NCR, may yet again be staring at extreme air pollution and smog in less than two months’ time, with no major change apparent in efforts to deal with stubble-burning in the affected states of the region. Upcoming elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, and the continuing farmer agitation, also make it unlikely that punitive action will be taken against violators. On Wednesday, the Yogi government in UP announced that cases slapped against farmers for burning paddy stubbles would be withdrawn and the fine imposed on them waived. The state goes to polls early next year, along with Punjab, where the practice of burning is rampant. Agriculture fires are a major contributor to air pollution in north India in October-November. Under certain meteorological conditions, pollutants from these fires spread across the region, triggering smog and extreme air quality situations. While the poll-bound states are unlikely to come down hard on farmers for stubble-burning, the Centre too has watered down an ordinance it promulgated last year that had penal provisions against farmers burning their fields. This was one of the concessions made by the Centre during its talks with farm organisations agitating against the three new farm Acts. Not that efforts haven't been made to end the menace. Over the last three years, the Centre has been heavily subsidising various agricultural machines to help farmers to stop the practice, and even profit from the leftover paddy biomass. The state governments and other agencies have also been sensitising farmers on healthier practices. These efforts appeared to be bearing fruit when instances of stubble-burning dipped in 2019. However, with widespread anger among farmers in Punjab and Haryana over Centre’s new farm laws last year, these efforts suffered a setback. Farm fires surged substantially last October-November, by as much as 60% over the previous year, as per Nasa satellite data, with many seeing this as acts of defiance by farmers. Some experts are optimistic that stubble-burning would not be as high this year. "There are two main reasons why the biomass burning is likely to be less this year. One, there has been an increase of 10% in the acreage of short-duration paddy varieties in Punjab. These will be harvested early, giving farmers ample time to prepare their fields for the rabi crop," said M L Jat, principal scientist at the international non-profit organisation, CIMMYT. The second reason, Jat said, was the increase in the number of implements to help farmers manage crops sustainably. "There are 18,500 happy seeders with the farmers of Punjab and Haryana, and as many super seeders. These machines will be put to some use," the agro expert said. Other experts, however, said the low cost of burning the fields will be incentive enough for farmers, particularly with input costs of farming going up.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/not-much-action-ncr-may-choke-again-on-farm-fires/articleshow/85669368.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||India||ILP no longer needed by desi tourists to visit Ladakh protected areas||LEH: The Ladakh administration has done away with the Inner Line Permit for Indian nationals and local residents visiting all notified protected areas of Ladakh because ILP has “lost its relevance”, Mehboob Ali, secretary for tourism and culture in Ladakh told TOI on Thursday on the sidelines of a three-day event by the Union Tourism ministry, to promote Ladakh as a preferred tourism destination. An Inner Line Permit was a document both domestic and foreign tourists needed to obtain for visiting popular tourists areas like the Nubra valley, Khardung La, Pangong Tso, Tso Moriri, Dah and Hanu Villages, Man, Merak, Nyoma, Loma Bend, Turtuk, and Chushul. The UT did away with the ILP earlier this month. Foreign tourists will still need to apply for an inner line permit to visit the protected areas. However, the validity of their ILP has been extended to 15 days from the seven days period earlier. “With the opening up of domestic tourism in Ladakh, we found there is hardly any need for an ILP because it was creating a lot of logistical problems for tourists. That is why, after consulting with all stakeholders and realising it has lost its relevance, we did away with ILP. But tourists must still pay an environment fee online or in cash. There have been restrictions on visiting border areas, but slowly, these too will be lifted except in areas with border problems,” Ali said. Speaking at the event, Union tourism and culture minister G Kishen Reddy said his ministry will spend 50,000 crore in developing infrastructure in Ladakh sustainably. Lieutenant Governor RK Mathur, on the other hand, emphasised the need to promote winter, science-based and pastoral tourism in Ladakh. “The presence of heritage sites per square kilometre in Ladakh is higher than anywhere else in the country,” Mathur said, emphasising the cultural, topographical and geological uniqueness of the region. Mathur also said Raksha Mantri Rajnath Singh will inaugurate on November 18 this year, a war memorial at Rezang La, where an epic heroic battle was fought during the Indo-China war of 1962. Laying great emphasis on sustainable and responsible tourism, the Ladakh administration also announced on Thursday that no new projects will be approved in the UT if they do not comply with the principle of carbon neutrality, as prescribed by Prime minister Narendra Modi, adding that Ladakh has set itself a target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2025.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ilp-no-longer-needed-by-desi-tourists-to-visit-ladakh-protected-areas/articleshow/85674617.cms||Swati Mathur
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Vaccine conman charged with attempt to murder||KOLKATA: Debanjan Deb, who posed as an IAS officer and arranged for fake Covid vaccination camps, has been charged with attempt to murder. If proved guilty, Deb faces life imprisonment. A little over two months after a special investigation team was formed with detective department officers to probe Deb and his seven associates’ roles in organizing fake Covid vaccination camps, the first charge sheet was submitted on Thursday. Deb and the others have been charged under 13 sections of the IPC and one of the Disaster Management Act for criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, possession of forged documents, adulteration of drugs, sale of adulterated drugs and sale of drug as a different one. “This case pertains to the Kasba camp. We filed the charge sheet on the 66th day of our probe and cited 130 witnesses. Besides Deb, the other accused are his associates at his Kasba office and those who helped him set up the Amherst Street fake vaccination centre. They are Ashok Kumar Roy, who owned the Kasba property that Deb used as his office, Rabin Sikder, Sushanta Das, Sarat Patra, Arabinda Baidya, Kanchan Deb and Santanu Manna,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Deb, who also posed as a KMC joint commissioner, ran an office at Kasba and organized Covid vaccination camps, where he passed off Amikacin sulphate, an antibiotic, as Covishield. After the fraud was busted, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had instructed police to ensure justice in the case and that stringent charges were slapped on the accused. The charge sheets in the other cases against Deb will follow soon. Cops from the New Market police station had recently arrested three of his aides before filing the charge sheet in the complaint lodged by KMC. Police said reports from Serum Institute and the State Drug Control Authority helped them file the charge sheet fast. “By the time the reports arrived, we had recorded the statements of witnesses and completed questioning Deb and the others in at least three cases registered at Kasba and Amherst Street police stations,” said an officer. The state drug unit’s report arrived a day after Serum Institute confirmed that what was passed off as Covishield by Deb was fake. “The Covishield manufacturer said none of the samples, which were seized from Deb’s Kasba office, matched their batch numbers and that none was made at their units,” police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/vax-conman-charged-with-attempt-to-murder/articleshow/85669283.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Nagpur||RFOs use VIP influence for choice postings, seniors give in||Nagpur: Forest officials using political clout for choice postings is not new, but when it comes on record it makes news. Two range forest officers (RFOs) from Amravati used the influence of the guardian minister and a member of Parliament to get favourable postings. Papers in possession of TOI show that of the six RFOs proposed to be transferred, one Ashish Kokate, who is working with social forestry department (SFD) in Amravati, has been recommended to be posted as RFO at Morshi (territorial). Interestingly, Kokate is not due for transfer. Moreover, he has worked as a territorial RFO at Chandur Railway for four years. As per a policy decision by the government on May 22, 2017, an RFO has to spend three-year tenure in each wing – wildlife, social forestry, and territorial. Kokate cannot be posted again in the territorial area, as per the policy. However, Kokate’s case was recommended by Amravati guardian minister Yashomati Thakur on August 3, 2021, on the ground that she wants Kokate at Morshi as part of her Tiwsa constituency, which falls in Morshi, and she wants to set up an oxygen park. In another case, RFO Kailash Bhumar, who is RFO at Wadali, wants to be posted at the current posting of Kokate at Amravati. Bhumar used the influence of Shiv Sena MP from Buldhana Prataprao Jadhav. Bhumar’s wife works as RFO at Daryapur in Amravati district. Bhumar, who is already working in Amravati with territorial wing, wants posting at SFD at Amravati on the ground of alignment with family. “Where is the alignment in this case, when both are already working in the same district,” ask forest union leaders. The out-of-the-way recommendations of choice postings were recommended to APCCF (HRM) Vikas Gupta by Amravati CCF Jayoti Banerjee. Both Gupta and Banerjee were not available for comments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/rfos-use-vip-influence-for-choice-postings-seniors-give-in/articleshow/85669280.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Cops distributed 30 passes among the residents for parking their cars on the lanes and bylanes around Rabindra Sarani and KK Tagore Street, sources said. “The number of passes will vary, depending on the nature of the work on this stretch,” said an officer. There will be a no-parking zone around the 300-metre stretch of Vivekananda Road once the work starts. Cops have helped the residents to get their queries answered by the KMDA. The two parking lots on Vivekananda Road and KK Tagore Street, managed by the KMC, will be removed for the next three months. “The flyover is situated close to residential buildings and there might be minor damages due to the work. The KMDA officials have assured the residents that the civic agency will compensate them for such damage,” said a police source. “The blockade will be implemented after the peak hours in the morning. Since there will be no work till September 1, we don’t want to put the office-goers in any trouble. We will complete putting up signs on road by Saturday morning,” said an officer of the Jorabagan traffic guard.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/posta-work-cops-give-30-parking-passes-to-locals/articleshow/85669318.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||‘No outsider’ syndrome keeps children away from school||Nagpur: Rift between two communities caught children of one in crossfire. Over 100 children from Bharvad community, a tribe of herdsmen originally from Gujarat, living in Maharashtra were denied admission in two of the zilla parishad schools of Nagpur district. The denial, however, appears to have come as a blessing in disguise for many others like them. The matter was taken up with the state’s minister for school education as well as women and child development Bachu Kadu, who on Thursday directed education department officials here to not only get the admissions done but also ensure that children of other groups living on fringes of the society are spotted and enrolled. This is what had happened. Bharvads have been living in Vidarbha since generations. Frequent droughts in Gujarat had led to their migration. Lately, there has been an initiative from community leaders to formally educate their children. The children used to manage with informal learning at home in Gujarati language. Those better-off have got their children educated in private schools, but a number of others live in deep hinterland, said community members. Still considered outsiders, there have been many incidents of tiff with the locals over grazing. As the Bharvads living in Kaldongri, a village over 20km from the city, tried to get their children admitted in zilla parishad school, locals objected. The parents threatened to withdraw their wards from the school if the Bharvads’ children were taken in. The herdsmen had a similar experience at Bothali village in Umred taluka. Dilip Mendhe, sarpanch of Kaldongri village, confirmed such a stance by villagers. “It is the decision of the school committee, which includes parents too. Their culture and way of living is different from ours. Studying together may be detrimental to our children,” he said. “I understand that children are innocent and even they have a right to education. They can be accommodated in some other school. Why in Kaldongri alone? They speak a different language. Some of them are older, but will have to be put in a junior class. What if they hit other kids,” he said. Mendhe acknowledged locals having fights with Bharvads, especially over grazing of cattle. “Their herds are large and sometimes even damage the crop. They leave a little for the local cattle. Police complains against them are common. Some years ago, a fight had led to a murder,” he said. “Earlier, we used to live a semi-nomadic life, but have now settled in Kaldongri. The children used to learn whatever little they could when we went back to Gujarat for meeting kin. But that hardly helped, so we decided put them in the village school...but the locals are opposing,” said one of the Bharvads. Speaking in fluent Marathi, he said the Bharvads, many of whom were born here, now live a settled life. There are 35 homesteads in Kaldongri. Ramabhai Jograna, a community leader, said, “Our people had been nomads. Now the young generation needs to be given an opportunity to be educated.” He thanked Kadu for the move. “We would also see to it that there is no friction with the locals. I had met the sarpanch, who has now agreed,” he said. “It was a very frustrating experience for me. Even locals in Bothali resisted their entry. It’s good that the minster has intervened. A report has to be submitted to him within a week,” said Prasenjit Gaikwad, a Balrakshak. There are pockets where they live together peacefully, he said. Balrakshak is a post assigned to zilla parishad school teachers and their job is to find children who do not have access to education and bring them to school. Gaikwad, who had spotted the Bharvad children, has been made nodal officer following Kadu’s directions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/no-outsider-syndrome-keeps-children-away-from-school/articleshow/85669300.cms||Shishir Arya

He defended the Mysuru city police. “The police have acted swiftly after the gang-rape was reported. There is no laxity on their part,” he told the media on Thursday. He said chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has discussed with home minister Araga Jnanendra about the case, and has directed DGP Praveen Sood to crack the case expeditiously. The DGP has assigned ADGP C H Pratap Reddy the case. “The police have got some clues, which I cannot discuss openly,” he said. The minister admitted that the public perception about the Mysuru city police is dented, which calls for course correction. “After the ADGP submits his report to the home department, home minister Araga Jnanendra will discuss the changes to be made to the city police and act on the same,” he said. Meanwhile, KPCC spokesperson M Lakshmana told the media that serious criminal incidents taking place frequently, threaten tourism in the city. “Mysuru is one of the major tourist attractions in India. The local economy depends on tourism, which is now facing a threat due to the rise in the crime rate,” he said. He alleged that there was a lack of coordination between the Mysuru city police and the district minister. “Some 20 lakh tourists visit the city annually, which will be affected if the law and order situation is not in control,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/no-law-and-order-issue-in-mysuru-city-somashekar/articleshow/85666513.cms||---

Earlier, total garbage collection from the city was around 100-120 tonnes per day which has fallen to 30-35 tonnes. On August 15, GMC commissioner had announced that municipal sanitation workers will not collect garbage from homes unless the households give it segregated as wet and dry waste. Sanitation workers started strictly implementing his order which led to a clash between citizens and the GMC sanitation workers. A GMC official on terms of anonymity, said that a senior government official residing in Sector 19, had a verbal spat with sanitation workers who refused to pick up mixed garbage from his house a day ago. “The official was trying to force the workers to take mixed garbage and tried to threaten them. However, workers did not heed to his threats and categorically told him that they will not pick up garbage from his home as it is not segregated,” the official said and added that senior GMC officials had to rush to the spot to convince and calm down the angry government officer. In the last week, many such incidents took place in the capital city where citizens and door-to-door garbage collection staff clashed. “In one such incident the keys of the garbage truck were snatched away by residents,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gandhinagars-trash-collection-drops/articleshow/85669293.cms||---

The bench had observed: ‘Petitioner has sought for a larger prayer, which certainly cannot be granted by this court. We would only expect the secretary to the ministry of railways to look into the representation and do the needful. Thus we are not issuing any mandamus, as we are quite conscious about the position of law in even directing the said authority to consider the representation in the absence of any statutory prescription.’Pursuant to the order, he submitted a representation, however, the same was rejected by the secretary to the ministry of railways on May 10. The petitioner filed this petition, which was heard by a division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-seeks-response-in-plea-to-rename-madurai-rly-junction/articleshow/85666518.cms||---

The Kandivali police's chargesheet in connection with the fake vaccine drive at Hiranandani Heritage society attempts to answer this question. The vaccine certificates attached with the chargesheet name Nanavati Hospital, Lifeline Medicare Hospital and Nesco Covid Centre as vaccination locations. Police have arrested Gudiya Yadav, a data entry operator at the Nesco Centre and two employees of Lifeline Medicare-- dialysis manager Chandan Singh and accountant Nitin Monde. A senior nurse from Lifeline Medicare Hospital, whose name appears on some of the vaccination certificates, said in her statement that she only handled administration of shots, while keying in data online for generation of certificates was handled by Monde and Singh. "I have vaccinated 5000 people. But certificates for all of them have been generated by Monde and Singh who have access to logins," she said. The hospital owner, Aniruddha Ambekar, has stated that they haven't carried out any drive in Kandivali West. A data entry operator from the Nesco Centre has told the police that she keyed in data of nine people online despite their not being vaccinated at the Covid centre, only at Yadav's request. "On June 7, Yadav approached me and requested for my help in generating certificates for nine of her acquaintances who wanted to travel abroad urgently. Yadav did not have a user ID and password and couldn't do it herself. Initially, I refused to do so but she persisted two days later. On June 9, she sent me the data and I keyed it in," the staffer said. A Nanavati Hospital nurse, whose name appears on several certificates, said she suspected her user ID and password were stolen. The nurse was assigned a login between May 24 and June 12. During this time, camps were conducted by the hospital at Andheri, Thane, Chakala, Vikhroli, Sion and Kanjurmarg using her login, but not at Kandivali. A BMC report, attached with the chargesheet, says the Covishield batch that appears on a majority of vaccine certificates was supplied to Gujarat Daman and Silvassa. Serum Institute of India has also communicated with the Kandivali police that they never directly supplied any vaccine doses to Shivam Hospital, whose owners are arrested in the fake vaccine scam case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-hospitals-didnt-run-vax-drive-at-kvli-soc-yet-certs-name-them/articleshow/85664656.cms||Nitasha Natu

OnWednesday, Shahnawaz met Union food and textiles minister Piyush Goyal. He demanded that ethanol units of Bihar also should get benefits of the Centre’s subsidy scheme and the financing scheme of banks, in addition to the seven-year tripartite agreement among ethanol units, banks and oil marketing companies (OMC) for 100% buy-back of ethanol. During his meeting with Goyal, which was held at the Udyog Bhawan in Delhi, Hussain also made demands for two textile parks in Bihar. He said that the government of Bihar has two land parcels of 200 acres each for textile parks and if the Centre accepts the demand of Bihar then immediately two textile parks could be developed in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/shahnawaz-pushes-for-revival-of-bihar-institute-of-silk-textiles/articleshow/85669704.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The woman, Adusyanti Chatterjee, a photographer, was returning home in Shyambazar along with her father, Aniruddha, after the cat, Chhotu, underwent a procedure for corneal ulcer at the Bengal Veterinary College & Hospital in Belgachhia.

A few minutes into the ride, the driver allegedly demanded additional payment from Adusyanti to wash his car after she alighted as she had boarded his cab with a cat. “The cat was inside a pet carrier that the driver had seen even before we boarded the cab. But it was only after he started the ride that he demanded extra payment. He was very rude,” said the woman. Though Adusyanti told the driver that the cat was not suffering from any communicable disease, he said that he hated animals. “As I alighted, the driver uttered expletives under his breath but loud enough for me to hear,” said the woman who has 14 cats at home.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/woman-boards-cab-with-cat-abused/articleshow/85669379.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana sees 40 victims conned by cyber fraudsters every day||HYDERABAD: Cyber frauds may soon overtake, in terms of value, traditional property offences like burglaries and thefts. At least 40 victims from Telangana report to a national helpline each day about losing money between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 40 lakh. Cyber fraudsters have been looting over Rs 12 crore from the people of Telangana every month. The latest data indicates that loss of property in cyber crimes could be more than the amount lost in traditional property offences like burglaries and thefts. According to Telangana state annual crime report, in 2020, total property lost was Rs 93.7 crore, while in 2019 Rs 115 crore property was lost in offences like burglaries, robberies and thefts. However, in a span of two months after the central government launched helpline—155260 — in June to report cyber fraud, 2,513 victims had dialled the helpline from Telangana and reported a loss of Rs 24.1 crore. If the amount lost in some of the cases directly reported at police stations is included, the figure might be higher. Of Rs 24.1 crore lost, the law enforcement agencies could only stop Rs 1.5 crore from reaching the pockets of fraudsters. “Time is crucial in reporting cyber crime. The earlier the victim reports fraud, there is a better chance to contact banks or e-wallets to stop the amount from reaching fraudsters,” Cyberabad assistant commissioner of police (ACP), cyber crime, Balakrishna Reddy said. If a victim reports cyber fraud by dialling 155260 or through National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (cybercrime.gov.in), they get an acknowledgement. They are contacted by local police to collect further details to initiate the procedure to stop the money from reaching the fraudster. “If the victim contacts us within 24 hours after the incident, there is a better chance to stop it from reaching the fraudster by contacting banks or other private firms, including e-wallet companies, involved,” Rachakonda ACP, cyber crime, S Harinath said. Of the 2,513 victims who called the helpline, 1,047 were from Cyberabad, 359 from Hyderabad, 358 from Rachakonda and 749 from other areas of the state. Around 40 victims dialled the helpline number in Telangana between June 16 and August 16, each day reporting a daily loss ranging between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 40 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/telangana-sees-40-victims-conned-by-cyber-fraudsters-every-day/articleshow/85669812.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Mumbai||Mumbaikars use 18,000 self-test kits in August as city opens up||MUMBAI: More than 18,000 self-test kits have been used to confirm Covid-19 positivity in August in the city. The use of these at-home kits has shown a sharp uptick with opening up of offices and local trains. A total of 18,324 kits were used this month, through which 191 (1.04%) people tested positive. The usage has jumped from a daily average of 100-200 to 350-plus kits in the past few days, a civic official said, adding it was presumably due to unlocking of sectors. Civic data reflected it is also routinely being used in hospitals and workplaces as well. Mylab Discovery’s Coviself priced at Rs 250 for a single kit was the first to be launched in June. It was followed by Abbott’s Panbio for Rs 325 and Meril’s Covifind Rs 250 per pack in July. TOI had previously reported 85,010 self-test kits were used between June and mid-August in Maharashtra. The BMC has started maintaining self-test data since August. Although these tests are rapid antigen and not as accurate as RT-PCR, they can play an important role as more sectors look to return to normalcy. “We have noted its use primarily in offices that plan to summon employees back to work. The plus point of the tests being that they give actionable information in about 15 minutes,” said an Abbott spokesperson. The pharma company has been using the test to screen its own employees every Monday and Thursday. A spokesperson from Mylab said the response has been “enthusiastic” but a better picture about demand would emerge in the following months. The company didn’t wish to share sale numbers at this point. Dr Shashank Joshi, member, Covid taskforce, said there aren’t many downsides to the tests as they are done in the comforts of home. “But they are less accurate, so a negative result doesn’t rule out infection.” The civic official said they have no mechanism to find out how many kits were sold. It is also crucial to see that people report the findings, whether negative or positive, he added. Both pharma representatives, though, said it was not easy to skip the reporting step. “Any user has to download an app and fill in their details to go ahead. They also cannot access the final report or download it till the details have been filled in the app, which directly communicates the result to ICMR,” said the Mylab spokesperson.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbaikars-use-18k-self-test-kits-in-august-as-city-opens-up/articleshow/85664510.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Legal experts and the Forum for Good Governance (FGG) are among those who have slammed the investigation. The FGG has alleged that charge sheets filed in 11 drugrelated cases are superficial and that there was not strength in them. Advocate Rachana Reddy who filed a PIL on behalf of her client and Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president A Revanth Reddy, said that if the Enforcement Directorate (ED) dug deep, the role of the ‘big fish’ may come out. ED has summoned excise officials, including SIT head S Srinivas, as witnesses in the case. The investigation agency has recorded statement of the eight accused who have been charge-sheeted in the cases for the past four months after registering a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). “The SIT probe into the 2017 drug case involving film actors went cold after a while. Only a few lower level drug traffickers were charge-sheeted. On behalf of my client Revanth Reddy I filed a PIL in HC seeking a probe by agencies like ED, NCB and DRI. After two years, ED impleaded in the case and informed the court that excise department was not providing required documents like FIRs, charge sheets,” Rachana Reddy said The advocate added that the ‘big fish’ will be caught depending on ED’s willingness to go into the depths of the case. Meanwhile, FGG has been writing to the governor and chief secretary, asking for a detailed investigation. “SIT didn’t probe properly. The charge sheets are one or two pages. After the Movie Artists Association (MAA) met people at the helm of affairs, the probe was sidelined,” FGG secretary Padmanabha Reddy said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/sits-tollywood-drugs-probe-comes-under-fire/articleshow/85669576.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The waqf’s stance was put forth during a meeting with revenue, police, and national highway officials by TSWB chairman Mohammed Saleem over a discussion on land acquisition for highway widening in Shamshabad. The TSWB chief explained that waqf property cannot be changed and that mosques or graveyards would not be given up for land acquisition. Highway authorities were asked to make alternate arrangements to widen the roads. “Graveyards, shrines cannot be allowed to be demolished. Graveyards can’t be relocated if land is acquired for road widening. If there is any other property then it may be considered for land acquisition,’’ the TSWB chairman said. “Shrines, Chilla Mubarak and graves are the most important places that cannot be touched at all,” he added. The Waqf chairman informed that another highlevel meeting will be held soon to discuss alternate arrangements such as construction of bridges over the graveyards. Earlier, the waqf chairman along with minister for animal husbandry T Srinivas Yadav and other officers had inspected the Tharthare Shah graveyard in Bansilalpet, a notified waqf property of 15 acres, following complaints of encroachment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cant-allow-razing-of-graveyards-for-highways-tswb/articleshow/85669862.cms||Omar bin Taher

They cut a cake and adorned reflector collars on their necks to prevent them from being killed in road accidents.A C Nakshathra, a dog lover from Surya Nagar, said that they aimed at creating awareness about the various rules and regulations to protect community dogs. “These dogs, especially puppies get killed when they take refuge under parked cars, and the driver takes the car without honking,” she said. They wanted to stress on the importance of making a honk when starting vehicles that have been parked in streets for some hours.Creating awareness on Sections 428 and 429 of IPC, which made it illegal to maim or cause injury to animals was not something that many people who attack strays on the roads know. They need to be aware of it, said H Mayur, another dog lover.The animal lovers fed the community dogs in the area. The dogs were also given the cake. They fitted reflective collars on the dogs. They said that they planned to collar 50 dogs. The collar that glows in the night could prevent them from being run over by vehicles in the dark. A pack of five collars costs Rs 250 and they hope to protect at least 600 dogs by collaring them this year. If more people come forward to donate for the cause, more dogs could be collared and protected, they said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/animal-lovers-fit-glowing-collars-on-stray-canines/articleshow/85666574.cms||---

Addressing the event, Nitish said it was a matter of pride that Bihar tops the list of recruiting women in police force in the country. “Bihar has the highest number of women in police force in the country. It is a big achievement. However, unlike others, I don’t believe in advertisement. Carrying out good work silently and resolutely makes me happy. Every police station in the state has women officers and all necessary facilities have been provided to them,” Nitish said. He asked the new recruits, who underwent an 11-month training at the academy at Rajgir, to do their best to ensure that the liquor prohibition is strictly implemented in the area where they are posted. Referring to other initiatives takes by the state government for women empowerment, the CM said, “We have been working for progress of women ever since we were given the opportunity to work in the state. We provided 50% reservation to women in panchayati raj institutions. The government also introduced 35% women reservation in police services in 2013 and in all government services in 2015,” Nitish said. “The state-of-the-art training academy at Rajgir was constructed after its need was felt following bifurcation of Bihar and Jharkhand in 2000. Hazaribagh, now in Jharkhand, had police academy in the undivided Bihar," Nitish said. He added, "Besides the construction of police academy, where police personnel of all ranks could be trained, a number of infrastructural development works, including construction of police stations and providing new vehicles have been undertaken to improve law and order.” The CM said efforts were on to improve strength of police force in order to ensure smooth enforcement of law and order in the state. Speaking on the occasion, the CM also asked the officials to ensure strict implementation of Covid-19 guidelines in light of likelihood of a third wave of the pandemic. The sprawling campus of Bihar Police Academy spread over an area of 133 acres was constructed in 2018 at an expenditure of Rs 290 crore. The state-of-the-art police academy can train 4,000 police officers of different ranks simultaneously, including 2,000 men and 2,000 women. The first batch of 136 sub-inspectors had successfully completed two-year training at BPA in February 2020 while the first batch of 80 sub-divisional police officers had passed out in January this year.

Within a span of three days, Topare, a resident of Kharabi, had lost both his wife and newborn last year. His wife died following excess bleeding post-delivery, which too Topare insists was avoidable. Alone for over a year now, Topare is still fighting to prove he was handed over the body of someone else’s daughter, and the treating gynaecologist was at fault. “My wife was admitted for caesarean section at a hospital at Sakkardara. But ultimately, she delivered naturally around 7.30am on July 8, the hospital told me. The doctor was nowhere to be seen while she was under observation. Initially, they told me baby and mother were safe. They asked me to bring 5 litre hot water. I left for home and returned in 15 minutes. When I returned, my wife was motionless,” he said. Topare added, “A child specialist was called as the baby didn’t cry. I had seen it was a male child. The specialist asked to shift the baby to a hospital at Dhantoli. Once shifted, the specialist said it would be an abnormal child.” Meanwhile, Topare’s wife was shifted to another hospital at Nandanvan. “Her condition deteriorated. On July 8, at 10.30pm, they informed that the child has passed away. I told them my wife was serious so I went to take custody of the child’s body on July 9. The same night, my wife too died,” he said. The custody of the child’s body was taken by Topare’s brother, who took the female baby directly to Gangabai Ghat and buried it. On July 13, Topare was surprised to learn that it was a female child. “The death summary of the hospital mentioned female child. I questioned them and informed them it was a male child. Then the first hospital too made a U-turn and said it was a female child,” he said. (Since both the hospitals did not respond to TOI’s calls, they have not been named)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/man-accuses-hosp-of-handing-over-wrong-baby/articleshow/85669351.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Following orders, staff put up banners at the main gate, which stated that only children under 14 years of age would be allowed, along with their parents or guardians. The rule is still in place. “We converted the park into a children’s park about two years ago after receiving several complaints about some ‘indecent activities’ in the park,” M Shyam Sundar Reddy, administrative officer, Budha Purnima Parks, HMDA.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: GHMC shuts out unmarried couples from Indira Park||HYDERABAD: Civic authorities raked up a massive controversy, on Thursday, after the image of a board they had put up outside Hyderabad’s popular Indira Park, went viral. The board read: Unmarried couples are not allowed inside the park. Sharing the photograph on social media, activist Meera Sanghamitra termed the decision as “unconstitutional” and lashed out at officials for stooping to a “new level of moral policing”. “A public park is an open space for all law-abiding citizens, including consenting couples across genders,” she wrote. Her tweet gained traction almost immediately with a large number of residents and activists calling out the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) for its “regressive” move and demanding that it be pulled down immediately. While officials, giving in to the pressure, did remove the board within the next few hours, it failed to pacify many. This, as GHMC insisted that that area would continue to be patrolled by local cops to maintain “the serene atmosphere” of the park. “The banner was put up by some low-level officers. We removed it after it was brought to our notice. Police have, however, been asked to ensure visitors don’t indulge in activities like eve-teasing and property damage in the park,” said B Srinivas Reddy, zonal commissioner, Secunderabad. When quzzed further he added: “Unmarried couples cause inconvenience and embarrassment to others; but I cannot explain the problem in detail.” An official from the GHMC’s urban bio-diversity wing — in-charge of the 68-acre park in Tank Bund — seemed to agree. “We have rolled back the order. Now everyone is welcome to the park subject to the condition that they should not indulge in any indecent act that causes embarrassment to others. There are some private things that should be done in private only. Those things are not allowed in public places,” he said. Resident of the area, N Sai Balaji, said he was appalled by the attitude of the civic body. “My city (Hyderabad) has turned itself against love and young people. Such a tragedy. Why can’t unmarried people go to the parks,” he asked, joining others in demanding strict action against those who put up the banner in the first place.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ghmc-shuts-out-unmarried-couples-from-indira-park/articleshow/85669364.cms||Moulika.KV

Uncertainty on reopening of 21 civilian roads is likely to continue further.

Sena MLC Ambadas Danve and party city president Balasaheb Thorat are among 16 leaders and party workers of Sena against who an offence has been registered for flouting Covid-related restrictions. On the other hand, BJP city president Sanjay Kenekar and 17 other identified party workers and leaders have faced similar action from the police. The police have invoked Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and Section 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of Indian Penal Code against accused from both Sena and BJP. Kranti chowk police, however, have not invoked the Disaster Management Act, 2005, against leaders from both the parties. While Shiv Sena on August 24 held spirited protests against the alleged derogatory remark by Rane against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, BJP carried out counter protests during the second half of the day to target the Sena leadership.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/sena-bjp-workers-booked-for-holding-protest/articleshow/85664209.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mysuru||With no jabs, midday meal workers see a bleak future ahead||Mysuru: For the last few days physical classes in high schools are running successfully. The state government is planning to re-start offline classes for students studying in lower classes in a phased manner. However, one of the big challenges is providing mid-day meals for students by following Covid-19 appropriate Behaviour. Even though students are demanding midday meals, the government is yet to start preparations including vaccination of cooks and their assistants, which is key to reintroducing the scheme. Schoolteachers have been vaccinated on a priority basis. However, many mid-day meal workers, who are an integral part of the mid-day meal scheme, are yet to get the vaccine, raising concerns that the government may not start the scheme soon. Midday meal workers are worried that without vaccination there is no chance of re-starting midday meals. “All are talking about school re-opening. However, there is no proposal to vaccinate midday meal workers. Our fear is that the government may permanently stop serving hot cooked food in schools and continue with giving dry ration and cooking charges,” said Vimala Kumari, 41, a cook from Bannur. “The government must vaccinate all the workers immediately. It is possible to serve the food in schools by following the Covid-19 SoPs,” she said. ‘No pay since April’ According to midday meal workers, they are yet to get the honorarium of Rs 2,700 (for main cooks) and Rs 2,600 (for assistant cooks) since April. “There is no other support like what the government has extended to ASHA workers and teachers from private schools,” said Geethamma, Kumari, and Parvathi, who were serving as main cooks in various city schools. Many midday meal workers said they have got only the first dose of the jab. “Our demand is an early resumption of the scheme,” they say. Principal secretary to the department of primary and secondary education SR Umashankar said presently, teachers are being vaccinated on a priority basis. This is being done ona government order. “After 100% coverage of teachers, we will take up vaccination of others. Already many midday meal workers have taken the vaccines,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/with-no-jabs-midday-meal-workers-see-a-bleak-future-ahead/articleshow/85666699.cms||Shrinivasa M
---||Kolkata||5 students from Kolkata fly through 4 airports for 3 days to dodge Canada embargo||KOLKATA: Five students from Kolkata headed to study in universities in Canada have set off on a long and arduous journey via two other countries, with layovers at four airports, before reaching their final destination. The complicated travel itinerary had to be worked out due to the ban Canada has imposed on direct flights from India. The anxiety of the travel apart, the students’ parents have had to shell out around Rs 3 lakh each for the travel that includes airfare, food, and accommodation for a night in Moscow, where they have undergone RT-PCR test. A direct flight would have cost each student around Rs 65,000. Tanya M Parekh, Ahana Jain, Siya Dugar, Achint Singh and Avnish Pasari departed Kolkata at 10.25am on Tuesday. Their first stop was in Delhi, from where they took a flight to Moscow the same night at 11.15pm. The five reached Moscow at 3.15am local time on Wednesday. There, they checked into a hotel, got refreshed, had breakfast and underwent an RT-PCR test. Their next flight was to Frankfurt at 6.05am on Thursday. That flight reached Frankfurt at 8.30am local time. After a long layover, they then boarded the flight to Toronto at 4pm. The group will touch down at Toronto at 6.15pm local time when it is 3.45am on Friday in India. While that is the final stop for four of them, Tanya has another flight to take for Vancouver at 10.10pm the same day or at 7am the next day. “My daughter is travelling for around one hour shy of 72 hours, when she could have taken a 12-hour direct flight to Vancouver from Delhi. We have created a parallel time table with arrivals and departures in India time and have been calling them up on arrival and again, before departure to ensure that they don’t doze off and miss a connection,” said Tanya’s father Mohit. The set of parents had also got themselves enrolled on another online parents’ group that was planning to send their wards to Vancouver via Mumbai, Male, Abu Dhabi and Amsterdam in case the plan they had chalked out needed to be dumped at the eleventh hour. The families received a lot of help from Russian vice-consul Michail V Gusev, who made the arrangements for the students while in Russia, including their RT-PCR tests there, as reports from Indian labs are not recognised in Canada. “Around 200 parents in Kolkata are struggling to arrange for their children to travel to Canada. Travel has become an absolute nightmare due to various Covid-related restrictions,” said Mohit, who has hardly slept since his daughter’s departure from Kolkata on Tuesday morning.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/5-students-fly-through-4-airports-for-3-days-to-dodge-canada-embargo/articleshow/85669446.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Madurai||Govt trying to set right flaws in Periyar bus stand project: MP||Madurai: The flaws in the Periyar bus stand development project in Madurai under the Smart City programme, including the prominence given to the commercial section than the bus bay, would be discussed in detail at a review meeting of various works under the programme to be held on September 17, said Madurai MP Su Venkatesan. He said the bus stand section of the project was expected to be over in a month.The MP said officials under the new DMK regime were trying to rectify the flaws. One such measure was the construction of an underground path to help people who come to Madurai railway junction by train to reach the bus stand instead of having to come out of the railway station. A detailed project report to this effect was being prepared by the railways. A new connection to be given to Ellis Nagar bridge would help make the entire traffic movement from Veli streets in Madurai into a one way, he said. This would help in traffic decongestion, he said. Venkatesan was speaking after inspecting the bus stand complex along with corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan and officials on Thursday. The bus stand development work being carried out at a cost of Rs 167. 06 crore is being inordinately delayed. The bus stand was closed for renovation in January 2019 but the delay in completion of the work has been causing much inconvenience to the public, he said, adding that the inspection was aimed at expediting the work.The MP said he had persistently raised doubts and issues in regard to the bus stand project as well as other smart city projects in Parliament. Public hearings were conducted in Madurai before the implementation of the programme and 58% of the people had mentioned traffic as the biggest problem in the city. Periyar bus stand work was taken up with this in mind, but now it was found that the project had been implemented with the facility to service only 57 buses, against the earlier 50 buses at any given time. In reality, the bus stand should have expanded to service more buses with a futuristic vision, with provision for three to four times more buses, but this has not been done. Public transport has not been given the importance that the commercial section of the bus stand has been given, he said. As many as 462 shops are coming up in the bus stand. The work is expected to be completed by the end of this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/govt-trying-to-set-right-flaws-in-periyar-bus-stand-project-mp/articleshow/85666630.cms||---

Additionally, 50 staffers at Vikas Bhawan in Surajpur, where the camp was held, also got the jabs.Officials said they had informed all NGOs in Noida to help with the vaccination process. But none of the organisations contacted the district social welfare office.“We gathered as many people as we could. None of the NGOs brought anyone to the camp. If any social welfare group or NGO brings in a group of homeless people, street vendors or senior citizens, we will make arrangements to inoculate them on priority. We have orders from the state government to vaccinate the homeless in every district,” said Shailendra Bahadur Singh, the district social welfare officer.Officials said that the registration process took time as many of those who turned up did not have any identity proof. The plan was to register recipients on Co-WIN using the profile and identity proof of the district social welfare officer. But some entries were not accepted online. “After the initial hiccup, we discussed the matter with health department officials and registered everyone with their names and birth years. Many people did not have any proof of birth but a medical officer at the site checked for the age eligibility criteria,” Singh said.In all, 109 Covaxin and 80 Covishield doses were administered at the centre.Meanwhile, another mega vaccination drive has been planned for Noida and Ghaziabad on Friday. While Noida has a target of 40,000, for Ghaziabad, it is 57,600. The doses would be administered across 120 sites in Noida and 140 in Ghaziabad. On Friday, around 35 sites in Noida will inoculate only those who have booked their slots, other centres will allow walk-ins. Additionally, six sites — primary health centres (PHCs) at Jahangirpur, Jewar, Bisrakh, Mandi Shyamnagar Dankaur, Sector 22 and Mihirbhoj Intercollege in Dadri — will only administer second doses. Currently, Noida has 35,000 Covaxin and 17,000 Covishield doses.Ghaziabad nodal officer for vaccination, Dr GP Mathuria, said: “We plan to administer over 80,000 doses on Friday. We have received 67,000 vaccine doses from the state and are trying to get another 10,000 doses.

---||Delhi||Delhi: 25-year-old man shot at by another driver after overtaking him||NEW DELHI: A 25-year-old man was shot at and injured by the driver of another car allegedly after the victim overtook him in the Delhi Cantonment area on Wednesday morning. The accused driver also rammed into another car in Kalkaji on the same day and has been arrested. He has been identified as Nitin (27), a resident of Police Colony in Kalkaji. He is the son of a former Delhi Police constable. The police received information around 5am on Wednesday about the shooting incident and that the victim, Sandeep, had been shifted to a hospital in Noida. One of the victim’s friends narrated the sequence of events to the cops. In his complaint, the victim’s friend stated that he and three of his friends, including Sandeep, were coming back in a Verna car from Kholi Baba Dham Mandir in Bhiwadi. Sandeep was in the driver’s seat. When they reached near the airport, they noticed a blue Swift car whose headlights were switched off. The car was allegedly being driven dangerously. They sensed some fear from that car and accelerated their vehicle. The driver of the Swift car followed them and when they reached RTR Marg in front of Western Air Command Gate, he fired on them. The bullet hit the rear glass of their car and then on the forehead of Sandeep. The victim’s friends tried to stop the Swift car, but the accused sped away after hitting their car. Immediately, they reached a picket and reported the incident. Sandeep was admitted to the ICU of Yatharth Super Speciality Hospital in Sector-110, Noida. Meanwhile, a case was registered and investigation taken up. The case was blind as the victims could not note down the registration number of the car. A team of special staff and Subroto Park police post checked the footage of over 100 CCTV cameras from Delhi-Gurgaon border to Kalkaji and finally, the registration number of the blue car was traced as DL 3CCT 64**. It was registered in the name of a Kalkaji resident, who is a relative of the accused. A raid was conducted and the accused apprehended. In the second accident that took place in Kalkaji, his car was damaged. He then moved it to a workshop in Okhla, the accused revealed. Cops have seized the car and efforts are being made to recover the weapon used in crime.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/road-rage-25-year-old-man-shot-at-by-another-driver-after-overtaking-him/articleshow/85669474.cms||---

An FIR was lodged against Ketan Bhalala, his brother Dinesh Bhalala and Anil Bhalala, by Sanjay Dabhi (28), a resident of Khodiyar Nagar in Gondal town. Dabhi alleged that the accused collected money from him but did not deposit it with the cooperative society. Gondal police said that like Dabhi, 30 others have lodged complaints against the trio. To date, it has been revealed that the accused cheated over 30 people of Rs 93.45 lakh, said police. The accused were booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) including 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed). According to Dabhi, a daily wager, he had given Rs 1.50 lakh to Ketan to open a fixed deposit with the Gondal Mercantile Co-operative Society. His mother had also given Rs 2.85 lakh to Ketan over a couple of years as part of the Daily Savings Scheme of society. However, in June this year, Ketan died of Covid-19. The depositors then went to the cooperative society to inquire about their deposits. But the bank told them that there were no such deposits in their names. This is when the depositors realised that they were cheated by Ketan and his two brothers, police said, adding that more people are expected to lodge complaints against the accused in the coming days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/three-booked-for-cheating-30-daily-wagers-of-rs-93l-in-gondal/articleshow/85666711.cms||---

Published in “Human Genetics” journal on 23 August, the study also revealed the consequences of Portuguese Inquisition in Goa on the population history of Roman Catholics and also found indication of Jewish component. Dr Kumarasamy Thangaraj, chief scientist said, “The Roman Catholic is one such distinct group, whose origin is much debated. Some historians and anthropologists relate them to ancient group of Gaud Saraswat. Others believe they are members of the Jews Lost Tribes in the first century migration to India. Till date, no genetic study was done on this group to infer their origin and genetic history. This is the first high throughput study by CCMB and DST of Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences , Lucknow.” Researchers analysed DNA of 110 individuals from Roman Catholic community of Goa, Kumta and Mangalore, and compared the genetic information of the Roman Catholic group with previously published DNA data from India and West Eurasia. The other institutes involved in this study are Mangalore University, Canadian Institute for Jewish Research and Institute of Advanced Materials, Sweden.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/brahmin-link-to-roman-catholics-ccmb/articleshow/85671449.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The contract will be for building five launch vehicles and multiple sources confirmed to TOI that the three entities, on July 30, submitted their bids in response to an RFP (request for proposal) issued by New Space India Limited (NSIL). A space-PSU operating under the department of space (DoS), NSIL was initially conceived to be a commercial arm of Isro, and later mandated with productionising launch vehicles, owning satellites and more. As reported first by TOI in August 2019, NSIL had announced an expression of interest (EoI) for five PSLVs to which five entities had responded. The RFP for the same was then issued in December 2020. “There were five players who responded to the EOI; three have submitted bids after the RFP just over three weeks ago,” a senior official said. A consortium of HAL and L&T, another comprising Adani-Alpha Design, BEL and BEML are the two group entities, while BHEL has bid as a single firm. As per DoS, the contract will not only boost the Make-in-India initiative of the government, but will also enhance Isro’s ability to launch more satellites each year. NSIL chairman and managing director Radhakrishnan D, said: “The techno-commercial evaluation is underway, after which the bids will be opened. We are hopeful of completing the whole process in a couple of months, and cannot comment on anything more at this juncture.” One of the sources said that the contract is expected to be awarded by the end of this year and the selected entity will be a licenced producer. While Isro has always worked closely with the industry — any PSLV launch sees more than 150 industries, big and small, contribute to the vehicle — this is for the first time that it will be completely built by the industry. The PSLV, which had its first flight in September 1993, has been Isro’s workhorse having completed more than 50 launch missions over 25 years and the new initiative is . NSIL, whose mandate has been expanded to own and operate capital-intensive assets — satellites and launch vehicles — has plans of investing around Rs 10,000 crore over the next five years. The PSU, which has a paid up capital of Rs 10 crore and an authorised capital of Rs 100 crore, was allocated Rs 700 crore by the Centre in the 2021-22 budget. In 2019-20, NSIL earned a revenue of around Rs 300 crore and while the official figures for 2020-21 are not out yet, the company was confident of more than Rs 300-crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/adani-lt-in-race-for-deal-to-make-space-launch-vehicles/articleshow/85674630.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Pune||Year-end deadline to get both Metro priority sections ready in Pune||PUNE: With the trials runs successful, the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) has shifted its energies towards getting the two priority Metro stretches in the city up and running by the end of the year. MahaMetro has deemed two sections of Pune Metro — a 7km portion of the Pimpri-Swargate line and a 5km part of the Vanaz-Ramwadi line — as “priority stretches”. MahaMetro managing director Brijesh Dixit on Thursday said all the work related to the Metro viaduct and stations on the 7km stretch from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) to Phugewadi, and the 5km portion between Vanaz and Garware College, will be ready by December. “The rakes will start arriving next month. MahaMetro is also working on other services, such as a common ticketing card for commuters and a Metro mobile application, to make the commute easy,” he added. Dixit, accompanied by other Metro officials, bicycled along the route between the Phugewadi and Sant Tukaramnagar Metro stations. He said the Metro stations will have adequate space for bicycles and that MahaMetro will take steps to promote a bicycle-sharing scheme as part of the last-mile connectivity. “The Metro card will be known as ‘One Pune’, and will provide easy access to commuters. We are working on integration of the card with other public transport utilities. The commuters will also be able to purchase QR code-based travel tickets. The app will provide ticket options and Metro service details. The fare will range from Rs10 to Rs60 — on the same lines as the Delhi Metro system.

It came three weeks after the same was issued for undergraduate courses. According to NU officials, the initial delay was caused on account of Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown which deferred the UG examinations. Later, students faced several problems while appearing for online papers due to slow connectivity, server slowdown and other issues that led NU to re-conduct many papers. Since the results of these re-exams weren’t declared for a long time, the PG admissions schedule was delayed further. As per the schedule released by competent authority for centralised PG admissions, the students need to register themselves on the NU website by filling up an application form. The facility would commence from Friday and would continue till September 4. The provisional list of eligible candidates would be displayed on the website on September 6 at 5pm. The aspirants can submit their grievances till September 7 and the final merit list would be published on September 9 at 5pm. The online submission of forms for the first round of admissions would begin from September 9 and allotment of seats would be declared on September 13 at 3pm. The admitted students would be granted time for reporting to the respective departments till September 16.

---||Aurangabad||Now, special postal cover on Marathwada Kesar Mango||urangabad: Marathwada’s Kesar mango, a delicious variety of mangoes grown across the region, will feature on the special postal cover to be unveiled by the department of post on Friday. The mango variety, which has already received the Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2014 much before Alphonso, is exported in different parts of India as well as abroad. Welcoming the move by the government to come out with the special postal cover on Kesar mango, Marathwada Mango Growers Association said the measure would further give an official boost to the branding and marketing of mango variety cultivated in the region. “The Kesar variety of mango cultivated in Marathwada is exported to countries such as USA, UK, Japan and Gulf nations besides widespread distribution across different parts of the country. The special postal cover will give further impetus to different business involving Kesar mangoes,” he said. Enriched with more pulp as compared to many other mango varieties, Kesar mango is relatively cheaper than Alphonso and other types of mangoes. As per Marathwada Mango Growers Association, the region has over around 2 lakh hectare of land under the cultivation of Kesar mangoes with Aurangabad district leading with over 40,000 hectare of area. Different institutions such as Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board and Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University along with Marathwada Mango Growers Association are credited for increased area under cultivation. “The area under growing of Kesar mangoes has doubled in half of Marathwada including Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed and Latur over a period of last few years. The mango growers have been finding more assured income in cultivation of Kesar mangoes,” Deshmukh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/now-special-postal-cover-on-marathwada-kesar-mango/articleshow/85664247.cms||Prasad Joshi

However, two of the accused, including the mastermind of the crime, are still at large. Rajeev Krishna, ADG (Agra zone), has declared a reward of Rs 1 lakh for the arrest of the mastermind, identified as Arvind. Another accused, Naresh, who had shared the information with criminals is also on the run. On August 16, four motorcycle-borne men had snatched a bag containing over Rs 1.05 crore from a bullion trader, Raj Kumar Agarwal’s relative, Ankit Bansal, while he was going to deposit the money in the bank. The robbery took place in Chauki Bagh Bahadur area that falls under Kotwali police station. The robbers on bikes hit the victim who was riding his scooty, knocking him to the ground, snatched his bag and sped away. Guarav Grover, senior superintendent of police, said during interrogation, the accused told police that one of the local residents in Mathura, Komal Rajput, had shared the information about the money being taken to the bank with Naresh and he, in turn, informed the gang of thieves about the time the money would be taken to the bank. Besides money, three countrymade pistols were also seized from the gang members.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/7-arrested-for-robbing-rs-1-05-cr-from-mathura-traders-kin-on-way-to-bank/articleshow/85664258.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Navi-mumbai||With ‘Adopt Streets’ initiative, NMMC ropes in citizens to spruce up the city||NAVI MUMBAI: The NMMC has decided to involve residents through its ‘Adopt Streets’ initiative in an attempt to achieve the number one clean city tag in the country. Meanwhile, the NMMC has kicked off a cleanliness drive to participate in the nationwide Swachh Survekshan for 2022. The civic body has announced its zero garbage and adopted streets initiative, wherein various stakeholders will be given responsibility to help maintain cleanliness by monitoring day-to-day activities of civic employees engaged in cleaning activities. TimesViewThe NNMC’s decision to rope in residents as part of its ‘Adopt Streets’ initiative was tried by the Mumbai municipal corporation earlier, but it was unable to sustain it. In fact, the BMC has failed to optimally utilise the network of ALMs and residents’ groups in Mumbai for its various initiatives like the Swacch Survekshan. The BMC can restart such initiatives but ensure that they are sustainable and there is active role of residents and not just limit the role of citizens to social media and voting on mobile applications.Ward-level officials will reach out to housing societies, traders, NGOs and common citizens to make them understand the adopted street concept. Civic officials said the initiative will be rolled out in a week’s time. Under its jurisdiction, the NMMC has close to 500 kilometres of roads, of which around 70km are arterial roads. NMMC wants citizens to discharge their responsibility by ensuring cleanliness of the streets they adopt. Speaking to TOI, NMMC deputy commissioner and head of solid waste management Dr Babasaheb Rajale said, “In this programme, those who adopt a street will have to take a round of the road on a daily basis and click an image of the uncleaned portion and post it on the NMMC website. Our ward-level officials will alert the department concerned to redress the issue.” NMMC has urged interested individuals, NGOs, housing societies and business people to come forward and adopt a street. “We will be in touch with the housing societies, shopkeepers and NGOs to ensure cleanliness is maintained through their active participation voluntarily,” said Rajale. “We are in the process of creating a dedicated website through which complaints will be attended in zero response time and action taken report will be reflected as well,” said NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/with-adopt-streets-initiative-nmmc-ropes-in-citizens-to-spruce-up-the-mumbai-city/articleshow/85671862.cms||B B Nayak
---||Kolkata||CISCE uploads model questions for sem exams||Kolkata: The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), which conducts ICSE (Class X) and ISC (Class XII) board exams, on Thursday published sample questions for the first semester tests slated for November. The council had earlier announced the split in Class X and Class XII board exams, which would be held at the end of two semesters, the first one scheduled in November 2021 and the second one in March-April 2022. While the former exam will be online and the format will be multiple choice questions (MCQ), the latter will be either online or offline, depending on the Covid situation. The council uploaded sample questions papers in ICSE for 40 marks and ISC for 80 marks. The model papers will be of particular help for both students and teachers as the syllabus as well as format of both board examinations have changed. Schools welcomed the council’s prompt move to upload sample papers. Julien Day School Ganganagar principal Bobby Baxter said, “The council has been very cooperative. By publishing the model question papers early, they have cleared all doubts. We will now be able to practise them with students so that they are aware of what will be required of them at the first semester exam, which is due in less than three months.” Teachers at most schools said the sample question papers would help them set practise papers for students, who need to get familiar with the MCQ pattern. Ram Mohan Mission School principal Sujay Biswas also lauded the council. “This is a very helpful approach. Whenever there is any change in the pattern of questions, the council sends us specimen question paper copies in advance for our understanding. On the basis of the papers, teachers prepare more questions,” he said. The council has reduced the syllabus for various subjects for ICSE and ISC in view of closed campuses and online teaching-learning due to the Covid pandemic. The academic session 2021-22 will be divided into two semesters, with approximately 50% of the reduced syllabus being covered in each half. CISCE will conduct the examinations at the end of each semester.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cisce-uploads-model-questions-for-sem-exams/articleshow/85669504.cms||---

However, it was found that most police stations lacked the space to accommodate waiting public and petitioners. To avoid this, it was decided to set up waiting areas,” he said.The police commissioner said that the public can now make use of the waiting area when waiting to get any work done, or for an inquiry or to meet officials. At a few newly constructed police stations such as Vilakkuthoon, SS Colony, Southgate and Keeraithurai, a separate room has been allotted as the waiting hall in the station. In all other police stations, including Avaniyapuram, Teppakulam, Thirupparankundram, and Anna Nagar etc., make-shift waiting halls have been set up separately.Reception police personnel will be made available in the waiting areas to help the public. The waiting areas are equipped with chairs, fans and drinking water facilities. Police officers said that by having a separate waiting hall, crowding of people inside and near the police station is prevented.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/all-police-stations-in-madurai-city-now-have-waiting-halls/articleshow/85666746.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The relative alleged negligence on the part of the hospital in treating the woman. No police complaint was lodged either by the woman’s relatives or by the hospital authorities. Confirming it, senior inspector Ganesh Jawadwad of the Nigdi police said, “We did not receive any such complaints.” An official from the hospital told TOI that it was a very unfortunate incident. “The patient was serious ever since the admission in the ICU and was under treatment for Covid-19 for the last 14 days. Her HRCT score was 20 at the time of admission. The close relatives were aware about her critical condition.

---||Pune||Metro-Neo feasibility study for elevated mass transit corridor||Pune: The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) will prepare a detailed project report on introducing Metro-Neo service on the proposed High Capacity Mass Transit Route (HCMTR) in the city. The HCMTR is planned as a 36km-long elevated route with dedicated lanes for Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) and private vehicles in the city. Metro-Neo will be a part of the HCMTR; the feasibility report will give the authorities a better idea of how to implement it. The HCMTR project, first mentioned in the 1987 development plan, remains on paper. It is currently stuck in the approval and administrative stages. Recently, some changes were proposed in the alignment of the route. The project will also require an environmental impact assessment report. MahaMetro on Thursday said it has held preliminary discussions with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and mayor Murlidhar Mohol on Metro-Neo’s feasibility. The proposal has found support from deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and former CM Devendra Fadnavis. MahaMetro’s managing director Brijesh Dixit said, “We had discussions with mayor Mohol and PMC authorities about the DPR for Metro-Neo. We have also received a letter from the mayor. Metro-Neo is a cost-effective solution, which is also being implemented in Nashik. The feasibility study is expected to take one year.” Congress leader Aba Bagul, who has been following the HCMTR project for many years, said it was needed to strengthen the city’s public transport infrastructure. “The city needs HCMTR. It has dragging for many years. We recently gave it a push. Now, the Metro-Neo proposal is being studied,” Bagul said. During a recent visit, Fadnavis said the Union government would provide funds for the Metro-Neo project, as it can be classified as a fresh proposal separate from the ongoing Pune Metro rail work. Civic standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said they will identify a suitable option. Activists are concerned the project will have ramifications for the environment. Some said HCMTR will encourage the use of private vehicles and eventually defeat the purpose of strengthening public transport. The Pimpri Chinchwad civic body too has proposed Metro-Neo in its jurisdiction. MahaMetro’s study will also focus on how the two can be seamlessly integrated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/metro-neo-feasibility-study-for-elevated-mass-transit-corridor/articleshow/85669460.cms||---

Patil’s farm remains deserted after he destroyed banana trees during the lockdown last year. He suffered losses to the tune of around Rs 4 lakh as there was not adequate demand for bananas during the lockdown. The farmer had to sell off the banana produce to cattle farmers at a very low cost. Patil told TOI: “I have written to the collector asking for permission to cultivate ganja, as we have learned that it is the only crop now which fetches some money. I know it is illegal, but it should be legalised. Farmers are forces to destroy their produce in the farms as they are not getting a fair price. My neighbour sold his tomatoes just 50 paise per kg. He too had destroyed the crop and his field remains abandoned.” The 52-year-old farmer lives with his mother, wife, two sons, and daughter in the tiny village. He has two more acres where he has grown sugar cane. “We nurture the crop for 14 to 16 months, but the mills delay the payment by six months. We have to survive by borrowing money from local moneylenders. I don’t have the money to even get the puncture of my son’s bicycle repaired,” said the enraged farmer. He has sought written permission to cultivate hemp by September 15. If the permission is not given, then Patil will still start the cultivation without bothering about the legal consequences. Since he wrote the letter, there has been no response from the administration. Patil said only farmers are calling him, but no farmers’ leader nor any political leader has called or approached him so far. “I don’t expect them to approach me. I have taken the step to demand permission to cultivate hemp with my conscience clear and not under any pressure. I am not associated with any organisation or party,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/solapur-farmer-seeks-permission-cultivate-hemp/articleshow/85664319.cms||---

Due to Covid-19 restrictions this year, the number of idols has gone down but the excitement among these children has been very high. Shobha Tawade, chairman of Swayam school for special children, said, “The work of making Ganesh idols is being carried out in batches of three-four children at a time. Those who stay near the school are getting work from home assignments as per their ability. We call children in groups, teach them steps and then, accordingly, allow them to make idols.” This year, the students have made hundreds of Ganesh idols and the profit generated from these idols will be given to these children as stipend. “The response from our routine customers is very good. Due to Covid restrictions, these children were also unable to give their full time for the idol making work,” added Tawade. Meanwhile, children from another special school, Chetna Vikas Mandir, have made 200 Ganesh idols of paper pulp.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/eco-friendly-ganesh-idols-made-by-special-children/articleshow/85664299.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Delhi||Court denies bail to cop accused of demanding bribe||New Delhi: A court has dismissed a bail plea of a Delhi Police official in a bribery case, saying the alleged demand of bribe by a public servant in discharge of his official duty is a serious offence and cannot be taken lightly. Special Judge Anil Kumar Sisodia dismissed the bail application of a sub-inspector who was arrested for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs 40,000 from the complainant to extend undue favours to him. “The accused/applicant is not an ordinary person or a layman who does not know the law of the land. He is working in Delhi Police and was well aware of the law. However, instead of cooperating with the CBI in the investigation of the case, he preferred to avoid the investigation and when the CBI attempted to arrest him from the house of his friend/co-accused Sahil Bhardwaj, he managed to escape from the spot in connivance with the co-accused and his family members. The conduct of the accused further aggravates his role in the offence,” the court said in its order. It added that the verification proceedings confirmed the fact of demand of bribe allegedly by the accused who was working as sub-inspector in Delhi Police. It further said that the CBI’s apprehension that he might influence the witnesses or tamper with the evidence appeared to be reasonable in view of his conduct in absconding after the crime and the fact that he was a sub-inspector in Delhi Police and can exercise his influence on the witnesses directly or indirectly. Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, appearing for the accused, claimed that there was no demand or receipt of any illegal gratification by the accused and a story has been concocted by the complainant to falsely implicate him. Senior public prosecutor AK Kushwaha, appearing for the CBI, opposed the bail plea, saying co-accused Anil Yadav was allegedly caught red-handed while accepting the illegal gratification of Rs 20,000 on behalf of the police officer. The complainant, Karamvir, had alleged in his complaint to the anti-corruption branch, CBI, that on July 7, he was doing construction work of his house along with his brother, when a couple riding a two-wheeler got engaged in a quarrel with him. A case was registered against him by one of the riders. Karamvir alleged that the sub-inspector demanded a bribe of Rs 1,50,000 from his father which he later reduced to Rs 40,000.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/court-denies-bail-to-cop-accused-of-demanding-bribe/articleshow/85669560.cms||Usha Das
---||Meerut||UP requested withdrawal of 79 cases, just 1 scrapped, says govt counsel||Muzaffarnagar: The Uttar Pradesh government has made requests to withdraw 79 cases related to the 2013 riots in the district over the last four years and only one case has been withdrawn so far, a government counsel representing the state in the matter said. It comes a day after a senior lawyer, appointed amicus curiae by the Supreme Court, told it that UP “has withdrawn 77 cases without giving any reason”. Additional district magistrate (ADM) of Muzaffarnagar, Amit Singh, said, “The state government has directed to file applications in courts for withdrawing 79 cases so far. The last letter came in January this year asking us to withdraw 21 cases.” District government counsel Rajeev Sharma said, “Only one case, in which BJP ministers Suresh Rana and Kapil Dev Aggarwal were booked, was withdrawn in March after MP-MLA court’s permission. The remaining applications to withdraw the cases are still pending in various local courts.” But the fate of the UP’s plan to withdraw the riot cases is likely to be affected as the Supreme Court has on August 10 ruled that cases against MPs and MLAs cannot be withdrawn without the consent of the High Court. Since most of these cases involve MPs and MLAs, the applications pending before local courts are likely to become infructuous. On Tuesday, a special court in Muzaffarnagar rejected a similar plea by the UP government to withdraw a case filed against BJP MLA Umesh Malik citing the apex court's order. Malik was booked in 2006 for a protest outside a meat processing plant in Muzaffarnagar. The only case which has been dropped from the local court on the direction of the UP government involved several BJP leaders, including Suresh Rana, Sangeet Som etc, and right-wing leader Sadhvi Prachi. About two years ago, Union minister Sanjeev Balyan and some BJP leaders had met Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and demanded withdrawal of the cases from the court, saying the previous Samajwadi Party government had filed false cases. Later, the state department of justice sought a report from the district administration on the matter. Communal clashes in Muzaffarnagar and adjoining areas in August and September 2013 had claimed 60 lives and displaced over 40,000 people. Leaders from various political parties including BJP’s Suresh Rana, Umesh Malik, Kapil Dev Agarwal, Baliyan, Kunawar Bhartendu, BSP’s Kadir Rana and Mursaleen Rana, Congress’ Saiduzzaman were booked for making inflammatory speeches.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/up-requested-withdrawal-of-79-cases-just-1-scrapped-says-govt-counsel/articleshow/85664337.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Pune||IISER team works on chemical mfg method without fossil fuels||Pune: A team of undergraduate students from Indian Institute of Science Education Research (IISER) Pune is developing a solution to tackle carbon emissions from fossil fuels in the manufacture of industrial chemicals like fuels, plastics, pharmaceuticals and synthetic fabrics without new carbon emissions. The students aim to create a sustainable alternative method for chemical manufacturing that doesn’t depend on fossil fuels and doesn’t produce any new carbon emissions. Their two-step technique first traps some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere photosynthetically to generate renewable carbon reserves, and then uses this reserve to produce chemical. One of the participating students, Likhith Chandragiri, said, “These chemicals are principally made of carbon, which is sourced from coal and crude oil as raw materials. Some of this carbon is lost in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide The net climate impact is that some carbon originally buried underground gets into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, causing global warming.” Chandragiri added, “The cyanobacteria will be genetically modified to continually fix carbon dioxide as sucrose (table sugar) and to secrete it out. E coli will be engineered to be capable of consuming this sucrose and to convert it into chemicals like butanol, a biofuel.” In addition to scientific soundness, the team wants to actively engage with the public, stakeholders, and experts specializing in biosafety, industry, and policy to integrate feedback into their project design. The team is participating in the International Genetically Engineered Machine, an annual competition organised by the United Nations, where student groups from across the world work to provide solutions using synthetic biology.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/iiser-team-works-on-chemical-mfg-method-without-fossil-fuels/articleshow/85669519.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

This would be the first PET after the university changed norms. As per NU officials, the new administration under vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari and pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe has diluted PET standards by reducing the earlier pattern of two papers to one. NU has also relaxed its earlier condition of five-year expiry period for those clearing the PET. As per new norms, anyone clearing PET from 2010 till date, would not need to appear for it again. The aspirants can pursue PhD anytime in future in such cases. NU media coordinator Rajendra Pathak said over 4,205 students had registered for PET for 63 subjects, which would be held online on desktops at 11 centres across the city. Highest number of applicants are from science and technology faculty, where 1,820 aspirants would appear for 29 subjects. It is followed by humanities faculty where 1,080 would appear for 22 subjects. About 663 have registered for interdisciplinary faculty for eight subjects, while 642 enrolled for four subjects in commerce and management faculty. Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable has called on the students to carefully read the PET manual and instructions before appearing for the papers. According to him, the entire information for the entrance test had been uploaded on the NU website too. The aspirants need to submit a self-declaration for taking care of themselves and taking all precautions for protection from Covid-19 virus. NU has made special provision for an aspirant from Dubai, by allowing her to appear in the PET through online mode from her home country, as she couldn’t arrive in India due to Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. The PET is divided into two segments, where students would be tested on research methodology and their selected subjects, and total duration would be three hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/over-4k-students-to-appear-in-nu-phd-entrance-on-aug-28-29/articleshow/85669530.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The RLDA regional office at Hyderabad has invited bids for a sprawling 21.51-acre railway land at Moula Ali and another 2,204.96 sq mts at Nizamabad. The reserve price for Moula Ali land has been fixed at Rs 86 crore, while it’s Rs 3.95 crore for Nizamabad property. In fact, RLDA, Delhi, has short-listed a total of 16 land parcels in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi, Assam, Jammu & Kashmir West Bengal and Telangana. With all these properties located in prime areas, the RLDA now intends to monetise them. GVVS Raju, RLDA chief project manager (Hyderabad), told TOI: “RLDA has invited open tenders to lease out this railway land lying vacant for decades. SCR is the custodian of the land. The last date for submission of tenders is September 2.” The real estate prices in Moula Ali is estimated to be about Rs 10 crore-30 crore per acre, which would make the railway parcel worth anywhere between Rs 200 crore and Rs 600 crore. Officials, however, said that the RLDA land was not being sold but only being monetised on lease basis and the ownership stayed with the government. RLDA deputy GM Shakeel Ahmed added: “Both land parcels are free from litigation and are within SCR compound. Not even a single inch of the land has been encroached.” The RLDA, Hyderabad, deals with railway land in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Chhattisgarh, Shakeel said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/21-acre-railway-land-at-moula-ali-to-be-monetised/articleshow/85671526.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Nashik||Tomato prices crash, Nashik farmers dump produce on road||NASHIK: The north Maharashtra district of Nashik, which is well known for its onions, is equally popular for tomato cultivation. But the farmers here, presently in distress, dumped crates of tomatoes on the road after the prices crashed to Rs 4.5 a kg in the wholesale market. Like the famed Lasalgaon onion market, the Pimpalgaon Baswant market in Nashik is one of the biggest tomato trading markets in the country. Pimpalgaon supplies tomatoes to other markets like Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Assam and Haryana. It also exports tomatoes. An estimated 10 lakh farmers cultivate tomatoes in Nashik district, making up for almost 20% of the country’s production. For the last two consecutive days, a section of these irked tomato growers dumped the produce on roads near various ‘mandis’. The average wholesale tomato prices have dropped by around 65% in the last three weeks — from Rs 13 a kg to around Rs 4.5 per kg. The farmers said they dumped the produce on the roads to draw the attention of the state government. “The production cost of tomato cultivation is around Rs 5 a kg. Additionally, we have to pay for transportation. With such low wholesale prices, we just cannot cover the transportation cost,” lamented Nashik farmer Sanjay Dheringe. According to Nashik APMC officials, wholesale prices have crashed due to significant rise in the supply as compared with sluggish demand both within Maharashtra and elsewhere in the country. The tomato season in Nashik starts from August and the arrivals at the ‘mandis’ pick up in September. Nashik APMC secretary Arun Kale said the supply of tomatoes at the market has doubled from 20,000 crates (20 kg a crate) to 47,000 crates a day. The demand, however, is low. “This season Nashik has started registering bumper arrivals at the mandis since the production is more. Last year, the farmers fetched wholesale price of around Rs 35-40 a kg at the mandis. Seeing this attractive price, many farmers, who do not usually cultivate tomatoes, took it up. This has resulted in huge production and the prices have nosedived,” said tomato trader Bhikchand Parakha. According to figures shared by tomato traders, the daily arrival of tomatoes in the ‘mandis’ in Nashik district in August last year was around 50,000 crates a day. This year, it has increased to around 2.75 lakh crates a day. The pricing of agriculture produce in the state is looked after by Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB). Speaking to TOI, managing director of MSAMB Sunil Pawar admitted that the wholesale prices of tomatoes have crashed due to tremendous rise in the supply. “The solution to this problem is to add value to tomatoes as their shelf life is short. Plans are afoot to set up processing units, which will be a win-win situation both for both the farmers and the state,” maintained Pawar. Former minister of state for agriculture and MLC Sadabhau Khot, who met tomato growers in Nashik on Thursday, demanded that the state government provide a subsidy of Rs 10 per kg for the tomato growers. “The condition of tomato farmers is deplorable. The state government must act fast to ameliorate the plight of the hapless farmers,” he demanded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-farmers-dump-tomatoes-on-road-as-prices-crash-due-to-glut-in-market/articleshow/85664346.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Hyderabad||Telangana government to go slow as land auctions hit legal bump||HYDERABAD: As legal issues have arisen over Kokapet land sale, the state government has decided to go slow on land auctions. It is reliably learnt that the government may postpone the second phase of auctions to the year-end. The auctioning of 49 acres of land in Kokapet and Khanamet had fetched a record Rs 2,000 crore for the government. Overwhelmed by the response, the government had planned the second phase of auctions in August-end or September in HMDA jurisdiction and even told senior officials to get ready to conduct them. But, the series of legal wrangles on Kokapet land auction forced the government to apply brakes, sources revealed. Sources said the high court’s warning of opening an escrow account to keep the Kokapet auction money has also made it tough for the government to go ahead with auctions. A senior official said: “The government’s target is to mobilise about Rs 20,000 crore through sale of unutilised government land in the current financial year. This money is needed to implement various welfare schemes such as loan waiver and Dalit Bandhu.” He further said: “Going by the current situation, the government may not even reach half of its target.” Some officials also cast doubts on the response from bidders to the auctions, especially in HMDA limits, due to frequent legal issues. Some officials said they were motivated and meant to create hurdles to the government. “The government will continue to prepare the ground for auctions in the identified land parcels. The auctions will be conducted at an appropriate time,” a senior HMDA official said. Officials said the HMDA was planning to complete auctioning of leftover plots in Uppal Bhagat layout near Nagole metro station and a stretch of land near Miyapur. The HMDA owns 105 acres of land in Miyapur. Of this, 55 acres was earlier allotted for development of an integrated bus terminal, the plan of which, however, did not materialise. In another survey number, the HMDA has 270 acres, a part of which is caught in legal issues. The government was also planning to auction land in survey numbers 20 and 28 in Miyapur. Apart from this, about 1,500 acres of land was identified in erstwhile Rangareddy district for auctioning. These land parcels are located in Jawaharnagar, Budwel, Raviryal, Kongara Khurd, Thummaloor and Maheshwaram. Amidst confusion over the auctions, the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) has been tasked to identify big land parcels suitable for mega projects and Special Economic Zones.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/plan-to-complete-auction-at-uppal-bhagat-officials/articleshow/85671569.cms||Koride Mahesh

Filing compliance report in the apex court, the corporation sought four weeks’ to remove encroachments from forest land and said notices had been served to violators in other villages apart from Khori village. Though the corporation informed the court that it was taking care of aggrieved families whose jhuggis had been demolished, it was countered by the residents who told a bench, headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar, that facilities provided at temporary shelters were "woefully inadequate". Senior advocate Sanjay Parekh, appearing for the residents, said they were living in deplorable conditions and face the risk of exposure to diseases and other violations of their socio-economic rights. They also pleaded the court that a committee headed by a retired judge of the apex court or high court be set up with experts to look into rehabilitation and health and nutrition besides a woman member.

Chief conservator of forest NR Pravin on Wednesday forwarded a proposal seeking permission to capture the troublesome tiger to the PCCF (wildlife). Sources informed that the problem tiger has killed three people in the area around forest beat of Halda over last three months. The first victim was Bhaurao Jambhule, who was killed in adjoining Vandra beat on May 26. One Motiram Garmale was killed in Halda beat on July 7. Later, farmer Hiraman Kotgale was killed in Padmapur beat on August 2021. This entire area falls under South Brahmapuri range. Following repeated attacks and mounting discontent among people, forest department had declared alert in the area and warned people against going into the forest alone. Foresters had also installed camera traps and started intensive monitoring to identify the problem tiger. After the tiger was identified, the local advisory committee, instituted as per standard operating procedure, approved the proposal for capturing the tiger. Chandrapur guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar has already expressed serious concerns over rising man-animal conflict in Brahmapuri.

---||Pune||Inoculation of adolescent kids with comorbidities likely to start in October||PUNE: The Union government is keen to start the vaccination of adolescent children with comorbidities from mid-October this year with the three-dose ZyCoV-D vaccine and the healthy minors would be inoculated next year after all the adults were covered, said Dr NK Arora, the chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation Covid-19 working group. “A meeting would be organised soon to prepare the list of comorbidities and finalise the protocol so that it can be implemented,” he told TOI. Adolescent children with comorbidities comprise less than 1% of the 12 crore children in the 12-17 years age group. There are approximately 44 crore children below 18 years in the country. Arora, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) Covid-19 working group chairman, said they had been assured of one crore doses of ZyCoV-D vaccine each month from October onwards by its manufacturer. He said, “The manufacturing capacity for ZyCoV-D is approximately one crore doses per month. Thus, about three crore doses would be available for the national immunisation programme this year.” The indigenously developed world’s first DNA-based needle-free Covid-19 vaccine ZyCoV-D received Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the drug regulator on August 20, making it the first vaccine to be administered in the age group of 12-18 years in India. Arora said when they had started the adult vaccination programme, they had prioritised elderly and people with comorbidities before it was made available to all above 18. Similarly, for children, the priority would be given to those with comorbidities like heart disease and kidney diseases because they were likely to develop severe Covid infection. “The vaccination of healthy children would start after the adult immunisation programme is completed,” he said. Currently, Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V vaccines are being administered to only those above 18 years. Unlike ZyCoV-D, which is a three-dose vaccine, these are administered in two doses. Covaxin is being tested on children above two years and the results should be available in next two-three months, Arora said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/inoculation-of-adolescent-kids-with-comorbidities-likely-to-start-in-oct/articleshow/85669726.cms||Nisha Nambiar

As for August, this is the third time that we have crossed the one-lakh count. Among them, Thursday’s count is the highest,” said public health expert Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services. After record doses on Thursday, the total number of vaccinated beneficiaries in the PMR has gone up to 76.02 lakh. Among them, 55,80,278 received the first dose of the Covid vaccine and the rest 20,21,801 got the second dose. Fresh vaccine supplies this week allowed civic bodies and the district administration to carry out drives at 754 vaccination centres. On June 25, a total of 1.41 residents were inoculated at 772 vaccination centres — the highest daily count in the region so far. The vaccination number is likely to drop on Friday because the stock has exhausted. “We have utilised almost all the available 46,000 Covishield doses on Thursday. Hence, we won't be able to carry out vaccination with Covishield till we receive the fresh supplies. Private hospitals will continue to hold the drive on their premises,” said PMC’s immunisation officer Suryakant Devkar. As for Covaxin, PMC will hold the drive only at seven civic-run vaccination centres on Friday. So far, 63% of the eligible 18-plus population in PMR have got the first dose of the Covid vaccine. The vaccination percentage comes to 23% when the completion of the second dose is taken into consideration in the region’s population. PMR’s total population is 1.17 crore. Of this, 87.42 lakh residents are eligible to get the Covid vaccine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-records-augusts-highest-daily-vaccination-count-so-far/articleshow/85669753.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||India||Captain shows off strength as Sidhu is asked to sack aides||CHANDIGARH/ NEW DELHI: Congress’s Punjab minder Harish Rawat on Thursday asked state party president Navjot Singh Sidhu to sack his advisers Pyare Lal Garg and Malwinder Singh Mali over their “irresponsible remarks” on Kashmir and Pakistan that he said had “hurt people’s feelings”. If Sidhu doesn’t do so, Rawat said he would write to the party to remove the duo. “For one, Congress has nothing to do with Sidhu’s advisers. Secondly, the adviser’s remarks on Kashmir are not acceptable to Congress. Kashmir is an integral part of the country. If there is an unresolved issue with Pakistan, that is Pak-occupied Kashmir (PoK). I have told Sidhu to remove his advisers. The party cannot accept such people,” Rawat told TOI over the phone. Meanwhile, in an apparent show of strength, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh met around 55 Congress MLAs and eight MPs over dinner at the home of a cabinet colleague in Chandigarh on Thursday. The CM’s meeting with party legislators has come amid the infighting between camps of the CM and Sidhu. The ultimatum to Sidhu came a day after Rawat told a delegation of dissident legislators believed to be batting for the new PCC chief that Congress would contest the 2022 polls under CM Capt Amarinder Singh’s command. Rawat later headed for New Delhi to update Congress president Sonia Gandhi on the turmoil in the state unit, which blew up on Tuesday with four ministers and 26 other MLAs demanding that Amarinder be replaced as CM. Sources said the Congress high command had already asked the CM to try and mend fences with the dissenters, three of whom — Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa — stayed away from a meeting of the council of ministers on Thursday. Bajwa and Randhawa, along with a couple of other dissident MLAs, were in Delhi to meet the AICC brass and convey their grouses. Another prominent dissident, minister Charanjit Singh Channi, attended the Chandigarh meeting through video-conferencing, In Congress circles in Delhi, the “sudden outburst” against Amarinder is being attributed to insecurity among MLAs in the wake of a survey that recommended that the party drop around 25 of them to stem anti-incumbency. Rawat held a meeting with general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal and is likely to meet Sonia on Friday.

---||Coimbatore||Ooty municipality seals more than 800 shops in its market||Udhagamandalam: The Federation of Nilgiris Merchants Associations would meet in Ooty on Friday to discuss the issue of sealing the municipal market because of the shops’ failure to pay the revised rent. Of the 1,395 shops, 800 were sealed on Wednesday and another few on Tuesday. The rent was revised in 2016. According to an Ooty municipality official, there are around 1,587 municipal shops in the hill town. Of them, 1,395 are located in the municipal market. “After revising the rent, the tenants haven’t paid the same in the past five years and they now owe us Rs 38 crore. Because of the pending dues, we are facing difficulties in paying salaries and meeting other miscellaneous expenses.” The municipality, the official said, was yet to settle electricity bills to the tune of Rs 14 crore because of the financial crunch. “We had given the shopkeepers enough time to pay the rent arrears, but they didn’t make use of the same.” The merchant associations had earlier approached the Madras high court against the exorbitant hike in the rent. The case is still pending before the court. R Parameswaran, president, Federation of Nilgiris Merchants Associations, said they were not against paying the rent arrears. “We have been demanding for a reasonable revision within 100%, while the rent was hiked by anywhere between 300% and 600% in 2016. During the election campaign, M K Stalin had promised to revise the rent to bring it down. Once the issue is solved, we will settle the arrears in two to three months.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/ooty-municipality-seals-more-than-800-shops-in-its-market/articleshow/85669651.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

She was among the 596 women out of a total 1,586 sub-inspectors who were inducted into the Bihar Police after completion of their rigorous training at the Bihar Police Academy, Rajgir. Coming from a family of Army men, Sudha said the sense of security for women and zeal to serve the people inspired her to join the police force. “There was a sense of discipline in the family as my father and two elder brothers were in the Indian Army,” she said. Originally hailing from Bhojpur district, Sudha said the training on field during Covid-induced lockdown would help her in discharging duty in a better manner. She was deputed in Kaimur district in Shahabad police range during the Covid-induced lockdown. Like Sudha, another trainee sub-inspector, Khushboo Kumari, was on cloud nine after the passing out parade. She was greeted by close relatives. A graduate in mathematics from Punjab University, Khushboo decided to don the police uniform after she got married. “When I came to my in-laws’ house in Jamui district, I came across some girls preparing for the job in the police force. As I was earlier preparing for the banking services, it came in handy for me and I finally got selected,” she said. Mother of a five-year old kid, Khushboo is a native of Nawada district. But she was born and brought up in Punjab where his father Janardan Singh was employed in a factory. Though her brother Vikas Kumar was serving in the SSB, the role of police officers in Hindi movies inspired her since her childhood. Amrita Kumari, a postgraduate in rural engineering and cooperation from Tilka Manjhi University, Bhagalpur, is the first in her family to join the police force. Daughter of a practising lawyer Jai Prakash Singh, Amrita got inspiration to join the police force from movies. “In fact, I was enchanted with the role of police officers in movies. Moreover, my ambition to do something different in the society drew my attention towards the police force,” Amrita told this newspaper after the passing out parade. Ravita’s case is different. A former teacher at a school, Ravita joined the police force to set things right in the society. “People with criminal mind will be taken to task. They are primarily responsible for rise in atrocities against women. They will be dealt with an iron hand,” Ravita, a resident of Rajepur in East Champaran district, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/criminals-to-face-music-newly-hired-women-cops/articleshow/85669642.cms||Ramashankar

Due to the pandemic, the written exam wasn’t held last year and students were admitted on the basis of their percentage in undergraduation. This affected students who passed out from Rajasthan University and other government colleges as they had low percentages. NSUI spokesperson Ramesh Bhati said, “Students from government educational institutes don’t get high percentages, but in private institutes, marking is lenient so they score high. Hence, toppers of various departments of Rajasthan University couldn’t get into post graduation in university, while from private colleges, students were admitted in large numbers.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/ru-students-want-written-exam-for-pg-admissions/articleshow/85671723.cms||---

The accused were identified as M Ram Dheeraj, a stamp vendor, and his father, M Balaji, a document writer. Addressing the media, Krishna district SP Siddharth Kaushal said they received a complaint from Mandavalli joint sub-registrar, KNV Subramanyam, after he carried out a surprise check across the office. During the checks, Subramanyam found out that Dheeraj and his father created 652 fake registration documents and diverted Rs 2.47 crore to themselves and duped the government by paying only Rs 15.92 lakh. Cops said that the total loss to the exchequer stood at Rs 2.52 crore for 568 registrations done by the duo. Kaushal said that the father-son duo had purchased non-judicial stamps for seven challans and paid a meagre of Rs 1,981 as against Rs 1,55,800 causing a loss of Rs 1,53,819 to the exchequer. Gudivada DSP Satyanandam probed the Subramanyam’s complaint and identified the victims.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/2-arrested-in-mandavalli-fake-challan-scam/articleshow/85671714.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Police later recovered four bullet leads from the site — the one that grazed welder Anjay Kumar (24) and three more — from the Metro power house nearby. They were investigating the source from where the bullets were fired. Also, the recovered bullet leads were being sent to the ballistic experts for establishment of their make and related details. Kumar, who hails from Bihar, was taken to a nearby hospital from where he was discharged after treatment. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta on Thursday told TOI, “It is too early to make any specific comment on the source of firing. We are not ruling it out to be a case of accidental firing. Our teams are identifying the possible source. The nearest we can think of is the firing range of the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) at Pashan. We are in the process of seeking details from ARDE about the possibility of any incident.” Deputy commissioner of police (Zone III) Pournima Gaikwad said, “ARDE authorities have sought time to confirm certain things before submitting their report to the Kothrud police.” The Pune defence public relations officer (PRO) on Thursday evening issued a statement that read: “There is no Army unit or firing range in the vicinity of the said area and hence there is no possibility of any accident occurring due to army firing.” A senior ARDE officer, who did not wish to be named, told TOI, “Our firing range on the campus carries out testing of arms and weapon systems with a maximum range of up to 200m. There is no question of a bullet reaching so far a distance as to where the Metro car shed is located.” Director of state forensic science laboratory Sangeeta Ghumatkar told TOI, “We can comment on the incident and the make of the bullets only after we get to examine them.” MahaMetro general manager Hemant Sonawane said, “The incident occurred at the Vanaz depot site when a worker involved in wielding work found the bullet-like material near him. He was not sure from where the material came from. The worker sustained a very minor injury. The material was not related to Metro work. We have shared information of the incident with police and requested them to investigate the matter further.” An FIR has been registered by the Kothrud police under sections 337 (act done negligently to endanger human life) of the Indian Penal Code and 3 (25) of the Arms Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/bullet-grazes-metro-workers-chest-at-car-shed-near-vanaz/articleshow/85669708.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Jaipur||Parents & private school assn spar over reopening||Jaipur: Parents and private school associations are at loggerheads on reopening of schools from September 1. While parents said schools should not open till students are vaccinated, private school association is demanding that schools be opened right from primary classes. Both parties announced protests on different dates regarding their demands. School Shiksha Pariwar president Anil Sharma said schools should be opened from primary classes onwards and not just for classes 9 to 12. “In many states, schools have reopened with the consent of parents. I suggest at least government should open up schools and let the parents decide whether they want to send their kids,” said Sharma.He added that students from lower income families do not have good resources to have good quality of education through online classes due to lack of resources. Hence, not opening schools will be detrimental to them.School associations will gather in front of Birla Auditorium on Friday to protest against the government and will try to march towards the chief minister’s house. Union members from all over the state will take part. Apart from this, Rs 330 crore of RTE money, taking back cases registered against association members are some important demands. MP Kirori Lal Meena has supported the school association and will be present in the protest on Friday. Meanwhile, Rajasthan Abhibhavak Sangh has threatened to march towards Vidhan Sabha against the opening of schools until all students are vaccinated. “There is a need to re-consider this decision. Many doctors also gave negative feedback against the opening of schools. It is better if students study from home as most parents are reluctant to send their children to school when the fear of third wave is there,” said Sushil Sharma, general secretary of association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/parents-private-school-assn-spar-over-reopening/articleshow/85671735.cms||---

On Friday and Saturday nights, the iron lids were stolen. Pune Municipal Corporation was in the process of completing repairs when the thieves struck again on Wednesday night. Ahmednagar road ward officer Suresh Jagtap said they have written to the Ramwadi police chowkey to intensify night patrols in the area. “We have not been able to recover CCTV footage, but have requested the police to check if any theft was recorded,” Jagtap said. Kalyaninagar resident Ajay Bulbule said the latest manhole covers to be stolen were affixed on stormwater-nullah overflow pipes passing through North Avenue, Lanes 6, 11 and 12, and Central Avenue. “This can cause serious accidents at night. In a few places, it is imperative that PMC uses iron grilles to avoid flooding,” he said. Residents have demanded that the entire area be under CCTV surveillance and that police intensify patrols between 2am and 4.30am. Residents feared that these incidents could embolden the thieves to commit robberies and burglaries. Corporator Yogesh Mulik, who visited the spots on Thursday morning, termed the series of thefts “unfortunate” and that a police complaint has been lodged. “We have replaced the manhole covers with concrete lids for now. However, since there is flooding in the area when it rains heavily, we plan to install iron grilles with hinges,” Mulik said. Malik said the tender for the hinged covers would be floated in the next 20 days and repairs would be done accordingly. On Friday, nighttwo manhole covers were stolen in Kalyaninagar and Pune Municipal Corporation carried out repairs. The following night, eight iron lids were stolen from various lanes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/manhole-covers-stolen-in-kalyaninagar-again/articleshow/85669765.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Most of its foreign payments were made to companies related/owned by Chinese who run the Opera group. The Chinese picked the foreign service providers and price,” the ED said. According to ED officials, all PCFS payments were as ordered by country head Zhang Hong who directly reports to Zhou. PCFS sent Rs 429 crore to 13 foreign companies in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, US and Singapore in the guise of payments for license fee for Cashbean mobile app (Rs 245 crore/ annum), software technical fee (about Rs 110 crore) and online marketing & advertisement fee (about Rs 66 Crore). “All these services are available in India at a fraction of the cost incurred by PCFS. All its clientele are in India but huge payments were made abroad without proof of receipt. During the same period, PCFS also booked domestic expenditure of similar amount under the same heads. PCFS management failed to give any justification for these expenses and admitted all remittances were done to move money out of India to accounts of group companies controlled by the Chinese promoter,” the ED said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/remittances-worth-rs-429cr-made-for-fake-services/articleshow/85671740.cms||---

---||Pune||Allow entry to fully-vaxxed travellers sans RT-PCR tests: Centre to states||PUNE: The Union health ministry has finally come out with a revised set of guidelines on domestic travel, advising states to exempt fully-vaccinated travellers from the need to furnish a negative RT-PCR test or RAT report on entry. TOI had earlier reported that some states were demanding negative Covid test reports on entry from travellers, irrespective of their vaccination status. The ministry in its guidelines said the Union government had not recommended any restrictions on inter-state travel in the context of Covid-19. It said states had earlier been allowed to develop their own protocols regarding quarantine and isolation as per their assessment. “It has, however, come to notice that certain states have made negative RT-PCR test reports as a criterion for entry,” the ministry said. The ministry said India was witnessing a declining trajectory of Covid cases after a peak during mid-May. “To facilitate inter-state travel, while observing required precautions, the guidelines for domestic travel (flight/train/ship/bus inter-state travel) have been revised so as to have a uniform protocol for domestic travel across the country,” it said. In its advisory to states and Union Territories (UTs), the ministry said fully-vaccinated asymptomatic people, having the final inoculation certificate and with 15 days having lapsed since the second shot, could be exempted from the mandatory requirement of negative RT-PCR or RAT reports on entry into a state. A health and family welfare ministry official told TOI, “The new travel guidelines are meant to guide the states about the uniform travel protocol but are not binding on them. They can adopt a stricter protocol if they want to. But we usually try to ensure uniformity in processes. A negative RT-PCR report is still required from travellers in many countries irrespective of their fully-vaccinated status and that’s an international call, which is being handled by the WHO.” An official from the Covid-19 Working Group of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation said the top panel had recently reiterated to the ministry its earlier recommendations on excluding fully-vaccinated travellers from RT-PCR tests for intra-country and inter-state travel. As of now, places such as Jammu, Ladakh, Assam, Bihar (for travellers from Maharashtra, Kerala and Punjab), and Jharkhand, Mizoram, Goa and Karnataka (for travellers from Maharashtra and Kerala) still have the mandatory test report rule for entry. Jyoti Mayal, president of the Travel Agents Association Of India’s (TAAI) national office, told TOI that its representatives had earlier met officials in the ministry of tourism for a uniform travel protocol. The association had requested for a “green pass” for fully-vaccinated travellers to exempt them from the Covid test requirement to enter states. “Travellers who have been vaccinated and completed a 14-day safety period should not be told to get the RT-PCR tests done to enter other states. The tests should be done only if any symptoms are noticed. States should invest time in processing correct protocols and not make rules which hinder movement. It is also time to open international borders and announce the date for granting visas,” said Mayal. Mehboob Shaikh, managing committee member of TAAI, said, “There have also been instances of differential travel rules for different states, like mandatory Covid test requirements that some states have in place for fully-vaccinated travellers from states such as Maharashtra and Kerala. The RT-PCR test requirement has been affecting travel budgets, especially since airline fares surged after the government increased the minimum and maximum limits on fares.” Shaikh said some hotels in West Bengal and Gujarat had also started demanding RT-PCR test reports from travellers, though it was not mandatory.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/allow-entry-to-fully-vaxxed-travellers-sans-rt-pcr-tests-centre-to-states/articleshow/85669792.cms||Neha Madaan

The woman finally approached the Pimpri Chinchwad cyber police. Her complaint was verified and an FIR was lodged on Wednesday by the Sangvi police. Tonape said that in February, the complainant looked up a private finance company’s online and got in touch. “A woman answered her call and promised a loan of Rs1 lakh and asked for documents such as Aadhaar and PAN card,” said Tonape. The complainant was told to transfer Rs 5,200 as processing charges to a bank account and Rs 6,000 as “state charges” as her Aadhaar was from Maharashtra. The fraudster woman continued to demand money from the complainant under various categories such as service charges, fund management charges, demand draft charges and even income tax. “After paying almost Rs 20.72 lakh to the fraudsters, the woman realised that she had been duped,” Tonape said. Another fraudster contacted the complainant and promised to return the money and demanded more money as “charges”. “The woman told her father, who also fell prey to the crooks and gave them Rs 16 lakh more to recover Rs 20.72 lakh from them,” he said. “The amount was transferred to 21 accounts with different banks. We have sought the KYC details to trace the account holders,” said Tonape.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/woman-loses-rs-35-9l-in-bid-to-secure-rs-1l-loan-online/articleshow/85669819.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Nagpur||Theft of manhole covers leaves motorists at risk, NMC worried||Nagpur: Rampant theft of stormwater drain covers in various parts of the city has become a cause for concern to people as well as the civic administration. It also puts pedestrians and motorists at risk. At least three stormwater drain covers were stolen from busy Mount Road in Sadar on Wednesday night. A few days earlier, another cover from prabhag 28-D in south Nagpur of former standing committee chairman Vijay Zalke was stolen. “Stealing of manhole covers made of iron bars and even RCC material has become rampant,” said municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, adding that the civic body will seek city police’s help to nab the thieves. CCTV cameras installed across the city could come in handy to trace them, he said. A public works department official suspected involvement of some scrap dealers in the theft. “The stolen lids are worth Rs15,000,” he said. TOI spotted manhole covers missing on Mount Road. Locals said the covers were opened by NMC for cleaning the stormwater network. Later, they realized that it was the job of some crooks. Naresh Jain, a local resident, claimed that he had kept a stone at one of the open stormwater holes while two others were covered with tree branches, which were later grazed by stray cattle. TOI then alerted Radhakrishnan, who asked the PWD officials to cover the same without delay. A PWD official said the thieves might have used an iron bar to break open the hinges of the covers. “Otherwise, it is not an easy task to remove these iron-made covers,” he said. Zalke too claimed that stealing of manhole covers has increased in the recent past. He said recently, a manhole cover weighing around 25kg was stolen from Dhanwantari Nagar in south Nagpur. The entire theft of how two persons used a two-wheeler to lift the manhole cover was recorded on a CCTV camera. Congress corporator from north Nagpur Manoj Sangole claimed that there was a gang involved in the thefts. According to him, even RCC structure covers having iron bars inside cement frame too are being stolen frequently from the stormwater and sewerage networks. Radhakrishnan said though cases have increased, the civic body has not filed any police complaint. “But now we will approach them to nab the miscreants,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/theft-of-manhole-covers-leaves-motorists-at-risk-nmc-worried/articleshow/85667300.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||No bail for 60-yr-old sodomy accused only on ground of AIDS: HC||Nagpur: Refusing any leniency to a 60-year-old sodomy accused, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court rejected his bail application filed on the ground that he’s HIV positive and his health condition is deteriorating in jail. Satish Badnakhe, a resident of Dharni in Amravati district, had allegedly committed the heinous act with a minor at an isolated place after promising to give him Rs200. He repeated the act with the survivor on September 27, 2019, at the same place. On a complaint by the boy’s mother, Dharni police arrested him and lodged him behind bars. The petitioner, a senior citizen, and a tailor by profession, filed a first application for regular bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) with the Achalpur sessions court, which was rejected. He challenged this verdict in HC, which too dismissed his plea on June 5, 2020. He then applied for bail under Section 14-A of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, with the same court in Achalpur. It was however rejected on October 19, 2020, which he challenged in HC. Badnakhe contended that he was suffering from HIV and his health condition is worsening day by day. HC then directed superintendent of Amravati Correctional Home to examine his physical condition through either jail hospital or nearby civil hospital and submit a report. Medical officer Dr Milind Gavai filed an affidavit on August 3, informing the HC that he had examined the petitioner thoroughly and perused his papers. He also handed over a copy of his report as per directives of National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). It was informed the senior citizen is receiving antiretroviral therapy as per NACO guidelines. He was said to be asymptomatic and receiving good nutritious diet regularly. Gavai added that the accused’s present health condition was stable. “This court had already rejected petitioner’s earlier bail application, and there is no change in circumstances, except allegation that he’s suffering from HIV disease. In view of the prosecution’s affidavit, it appears that his condition is stable,” a division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar observed. While dismissing accused’s appeal with detailed reasons, the bench clarified that it considered the merits. “In the absence of change in circumstance, the rejection of second bail application by the sessions judge is perfectly legal. There is no illegality in the order,” the judges said. WHAT HC SAID * Considered merits before dismissing sodomy accused’s appeal * In absence of change in circumstance, rejection of his 2nd bail plea perfectly legal * No illegality in Achalpur sessions court order rejecting bail * In view of prosecution’s affidavit by Dr Gavai, it appears accused’s condition is stable * He is receiving antiretroviral therapy as per NACO guidelines||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/no-bail-for-60-yr-old-sodomy-accused-only-on-ground-of-aids-hc/articleshow/85669805.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Pune: 3 cattle owners held after buffalo injures couple||PUNE: The Cantonment police on Wednesday night arrested three cattle owners on charge of negligence after a buffalo went berserk, hitting two vehicles and injuring a couple on Jaan Mohammad Street in Camp on August 8. The three men were later released on bail at the police station. Bhavani Peth resident Zubair Shaikh, who was injured along with his wife, underwent treatment for internal wounds and later approached the police on Wednesday to register a complaint. Three cattle owners — Shanawaz Qureshi, Sadakat Qureshi and Nadaf Qureshi — were summoned, arrested and later released on bail. “We released them on bail as they were arrested in a bailable offence,” said senior inspector Ashok Kadam on Thursday. The incident brings to the fore the nuisance caused by buffaloes in the Camp area. Local residents said that a proposal to relocate cattle sheds from congested localities to alternative sites in Koregaon Park and Wanowrie tannery has not seen the light of the day since 1988. Shaikh, a manager in a private automobile firm, said, “I sustained injuries on my fingers and my wife suffered internal injuries. The buffalo ran amok, hitting a parked bike, which collapsed on my vehicle. We fell on the road and got injured.” Amit Kumar, CEO, Pune Cantonment Board, told TOI, “There is no plan to relocate cattle sheds to an alternative site as of now.” Former PCB member Shailesh Bidkar said, “The buffaloes have not been relocated to Koregaon Park because the government land reserved for constructing cattle sheds has been converted into a marriage lawn. The other proposal to shift animals to Wanowrie tannery is pending for changing classification of land from defence to civil.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/3-cattle-owners-held-after-buffalo-injures-couple/articleshow/85669784.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Jaipur||Pachpadra refinery project cost could rise by 70% to over Rs 70k cr||Jaipur: It is unlikely that the refinery at Pachpadra will be completed by December 2022 and its cost could also go up by 70%, putting further financial burden on the state government which holds 26% in the joint venture company HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd (HRRL).Sources who attended the review meeting said the company did not give a firm deadline for completing the project and there was no definite discussion on cost escalation due to the deadline extension. Sources said because of the delay, the cost of the project could go up from Rs 43,129 crore to over Rs 72,000 crore. In that case, the state has to bear 26% of the Rs 30,000 crore as additional burden for no fault of its own. It is also estimated that the project will not be completed before 2025.TOI made phone calls and sent text messages to HRRL CEO S P Gaikwad, but he did not respond. The sources in the state government also expressed unhappiness over the CEO not sitting in the Jaipur headquarters of the joint venture company, nor in HRRL’s corporate office in Jodhpur. The refinery has been at the centre of state politics between the two main political parties here. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot made the project a major achievement before going to the 2013 assembly elections. After Vasundhara Raje won the elections and came to power, she renegotiated the deal with HPCL. Now, Gehlot has another chance to prove that what he first announced has become a reality. The state elections are due in late 2023. The chief minister is very keen to see the project getting commissioned well before that. But as per the current pace of the development, it is not going to be completed before 2025, said the source.The company cites Covid as a major reason for delay. But the government had allowed construction activities immediately after the first phase of the lockdown. When there was scarcity of bajri, special arrangements were also made so that the construction of the 9-million tonne refinery does not suffer.The meeting was attended by HPCL chairman and managing director M K Surana among senior government officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/pachpadra-refinery-project-cost-could-rise-by-70-to-over-rs-70k-cr/articleshow/85671764.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Pune||Pune: Duo rob man of valuables worth Rs 1.8 lakh on Baner hill||PUNE: The Chatushrungi police have arrested two men suspected of robbing a photographer of cash and valuables worth Rs1.8 lakh on Baner hill at 1pm on August 17. As per a complaint lodged by the photographer, Mukul Mukherjee (40), the robbers took his mobile phone, camera, a bracelet, and cash. The police have since recovered the camera, bracelet and cellphone, worth Rs1.40 lakh, from the arrested duo. The robbery has sent ripples of fear among residents of Baner and adjoining areas, who frequent Baner hill — perceived to be safer than Vetal Tekdi, Hanuman Tekdi, Taljai hill, Parvati and Bhamburda. Mukherjee said he took a photos atop the hill and was climbing down around 1pm when the two men accosted him and robbed him of his belongings. “The hill does not have a CCTV surveillance system. Our team surveyed the area and found some footage from the CCTVs from spots on the road leading to the hill. We studied the footage and did canvassed for information when we received a tip-off about one of the suspects,” senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure told TOI. On Monday, the police arrested the suspect, Akshay Vitthal Suryavanshi (23) of Baner, and the following day, took his accomplice Vishal Mahadev Gaikwad (21) also of Baner, into custody. “Both are daily-wage workers. Gaikwad has a criminal record; he was previously arrested in a theft case,” police said. “My parents and I are visiting my sister in Mhalunge. I heard the hill was a good place for nature photography. On August 17, I went there to photograph butterflies and birds,” Mukherjee told TOI. As he was walking down, the suspects — armed with a stick and a rock — accosted him and asked him to hand over his belongings. “I did not resist. However, as they were walking away, I snatched my bag and ran down the hill, calling for help, but no one was around. The duo caught up, assaulted me and snatched my bag again,” he said. Pandurang Bhubal, a member of Vasundhara Abhiyaan, which carries out conservation work on the hill, said, “Robberies and fights are a regular occurrence but are rarely reported. Our group and many others frequent the hill during between 6am and 11am. It’s only after this window that crimes occur. We often advise people — especially couples — to avoid the hill in the afternoon.” Local resident Abhinav Kashid said he never faced a problem on the hill. “I heard about such incidents and avoid visiting the hill in the afternoon.,” Kashid.

The number of fully vaccinated people rose to 1 crore in the state on Thursday. The number of eligible beneficiaries for Covid vaccination in the state is 5.14 crore. Congratulating healthcare workers, health minister Raghu Sharma said that the state is leading in vaccination against Covid. He said that 20% of the targeted population in the state has been vaccinated, by administering a second dose to more than 1 crore people by Thursday afternoon. On Thursday afternoon, the number of total doses administered, including first and second doses, rose to 4,12,67,359, and of these, 3,12,58,116 people have been administered the first dose and 1,00,09,243 people have been administered both doses. The health department achieved this by setting up 3,177 vaccination sites across the state, including 3,109 government and 68 private vaccination sites. Anticipating the third wave of Covid, Sharma said the infrastructure of all children’s hospitals in the state is being strengthened along with ICUs. Also, availability of medical oxygen has also been ensured at the selected 332 Community Health Centres. Oxygen generation plants have been installed to increase the availability of oxygen upto 1,000 metric tonne daily. To overcome the shortage of oxygen, the government has procured more than 50,000 oxygen concentrators, which are being sent to medical institutions in remote areas so that villagers don’t need to come to cities. Sharma said that the state government, besides providing medical facilities to the patients, is also working to empower them with the legal right to avail medical treatment, as the state would be the first one where the medical facility will become a legal right for the patients. Sharma said that the Right to Health would be the biggest change ever in the medical sector in the state. For this, suggestions of the common people were taken while preparing the draft of this law. Right to Health law will be brought in by including these suggestions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/over-1-crore-beneficiaries-fully-vaccinated-in-state/articleshow/85671792.cms||---
---||Meerut||In UP town founded by Afghan soldier, 11th-gen kin say ‘lucky ancestor came to India||Meerut: Four centuries ago, an Afghan soldier recruited by the Mughal army set up the town of Shahjehanpur, about 30 km from Meerut. Eleven generations have lived in the town, carrying on the legacy of Mohammad Abbas Khan Karlani, its founder, are now a family of farmers. “Even until the last century, the town was called Shahjehanpur Afghan,” said Dr KK Sharma, history professor at Multanimal Modi College in Modinagar. About 2,000 live in the town now, most of whom are descendants of Daulat Khan, one of Karlani’s four sons, all of whom were recruited by the Mughal army. Daulat was the only one who stayed. As one enters the town, the relic of its Afghan founder, the story goes, is an arm — that of Karlani, a Dilzakh pathan of the Pashtun community from northern Afghanistan who arrived in what is now India four centuries ago to join the Mughal Army. In 1632, he set up Shahjehanpur and died in 1660, blown to pieces by a cannonball while he was fighting alongside Aurangzeb against Shah Shuja. Only his arm could be salvaged and was buried at the spot which now marks his tomb on the Meerut-Garh road. Mohammad Imran Khan, 82, the patriarch of the family lives in a modest house that has seen better days. “We can never forget we once belonged to Afghanistan. But I think we are fortunate our ancestors moved out,” he said. “No one could control the Afghans — the British, Russians, Americans. History is witness to that.” Occupying an entire wall is a shijra, or family tree, which, Imran said, goes back all the way to the Quranic Abraham. “Karlani had rescued the princess of Jodhpur from dacoits. The royal family had held him in favour since then,” said Imran’s brother Naumaan Khan, 84. “It was Manvati Bai, also known as Jodha Bai, who would marry Jahangir and give birth to Mohammad Khurram, who would become Shah Jahan.” Karlani served three Mughal emperors, they said — Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb. But no one from the family wanted to talk at length about what Afghanistan is facing now. “What is the point?” asked Zakraya Khan, 38, Imran’s nephew. “We are Indians. The remnants of our history — the havelis and mansions — are also giving way to modern structures in these serpentine lanes.” The family has had to adapt and makes its living off of mango orchards and nurseries. Dr Sharma said, “Over time, with repeated fragmentation of agricultural farms, many of them now have smaller landholdings. Many have also moved to horticulture, because of which nurseries line the roads.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/in-up-town-founded-by-afghan-soldier-11th-gen-kin-say-lucky-ancestor-came-to-india/articleshow/85664688.cms||Sandeep Rai

Development of Kanpur as a tourist and industrial hub, replication of the Indore swachh model have been proposed in the scope of the MoU established by the department of higher education, ministry of human resource development and Central government. “We are drafting a plan to turn street vendors into a more organized sector,” director IIM-Indore, Prof Himanshu Rai told TOI. He said, IIM-Indore is designing a platform for online real-time monitoring of civil infrastructure and preparing a traffic management plan, besides drafting a plan for implementing information, education and communication (IEC) as per Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) programme. “Also, we are defining new areas of collaboration that can be beneficial to institutions," said Rai. He added, “Highly trained personnel prefer to move to places with better standards of research, higher salaries and access to advanced technology. Such an initiative will reduce brain drain and provide quality infrastructure to encourage people to return to their roots,” he said. He said, modalities are being planned to establish industrial units, particularly leather industry in the city. “Meetings would be organised with district officials, local industrialists, businessmen and local representatives. Surveys would be conducted to get a first-hand information on problems faced by local industrialists and modalities for making Kanpur region an industrial hub. We will identify problem areas in industrial growth and remove bottlenecks," he said. Rai said, there was immense potential for establishing the leather sector and for which Kanpur is globally known. “And such a step will bring socio-economic changes in lives of people." The MoU will be effective from the date of signing by institutions for a period of three years and may be subject to extension through mutual consent of institutions, he said. Any institution can terminate the MoU with a three-month notice. Provisions of the MoU may be amended at any time with mutual consent of institutions in writing. Amendment, termination and expiration of the MoU will not affect terms of activity at the time of notification, termination and expiration unless otherwise agreed upon by institutions. The MoU riders include that no action would be undertaken to diminish autonomy of any institution, nor any party shall impose constraints to carry out the agreement. Rai further said, special provisions in the MoU entail that every institution will consult and take approval of other institutions to use names of officials/faculty members and logo for activities and dissemination of results on a case-by-case basis. Detailed modalities of individual forms of collaboration, activities associated with them and financial aspects of each shall be mutually agreed upon on a case-by-case basis and specified with necessary details in separate agreements. This MoU will not be legally and financially binding to any of the institutions. The four institutions will consult with each other and attempt to resolve disputes or misunderstanding. All Institutions will designate persons who will have responsibility for coordination and implementation of this agreement. The intellectual property rights (IPR) that arise as a result of joint research and collaborative activity under the agreement will be worked out on a case-to-case basis and will be consistent with officially laid-down IPR policies of the four institutions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/mou-with-iim-indore-civic-bodies-to-turn-kanpur-into-industrial-tourist-hub/articleshow/85669836.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The agency is supporting sustainable development goals in more than 115 countries and a group of the representatives of AFD were in Jaipur on Thursday to discuss the proposed project with the state government. The project aims to combat climate change with conservation of forests and biodiversity and will cover 13 districts in eastern Rajasthan in its eight-year duration. Forest and enviroment principal secretary Sreya Guha said, “Community empowerment will be a key aspect of the project and it would include various efforts to increase the income of the local communities without adversely impacting the local natural ecosystem.” The support of AFD for forest conservation efforts is a reflection of growing international consensus and cooperation towards reducing the impact of climate change. The project in Rajasthan, however, also has its roots in empowerment and association of local communities with sustainable development and thus proposes ecotourism and other measures as means for sustainable income generation for local communities. The project wil reach 600 villages in the forest areas of the selected districts and initiate activities for developing more income opportunities for 1200 self help groups.The project shall cover districts of Alwar, Baran, Bhilwara, Bharatpur, Bundi, Dausa, Dholpur, Jaipur, Jhalawar, Karauli, Kota, Sawaimadhopur and Tonk with focus on conserving biological diversity and enhancement of deciduous forest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/french-support-for-raj-forest-conservation/articleshow/85671838.cms||---
---||Kochi||Haritha leaders upset as MSF counterparts let off lightly||Kozhikode: IUML announced a ‘reconciliation’ agreement without taking disciplinary action to settle the row that arose after the state leaders of Haritha, the girls’ wing of MSF, complained that their male counterparts made anti women and sexually-coloured remarks against women leaders. Haritha leaders, who were demanding action against three MSF leaders (including state president PK Navas) are unhappy with the terms of agreement put forward by the party which limits action against MSF leaders to ‘an expression of regret’. Haritha leaders have strong reservations against withdrawing the complaint given to women’s commission under the current terms. Sources said Haritha leaders will convey their dissatisfaction to party leaders and wait for two days for their response. The party announced the ‘reconciliation’ agreement after talks by senior leaders in Malappuram late on Wednesday. The statement announced by IUML general secretary PMA Salam said Haritha leaders will withdraw their complaint submitted to women’s commission and the party will not take further action against MSF leaders. The party will withdraw its decision to freeze the state committee of Haritha. It added that the statements made by Navas, Malappuram district president Kabeer Muthuparambu and district general secretary VA Wahab were out of place and they have realized it. Stating that the remarks were made without bad intentions, the party said that the three leaders will express their regret on Facebook. Salam said that the party will ensure women representation in the district and state committees of MSF and make changes in the constitutions of MSF and Haritha in this regard. Meanwhile, Navas expressed his regret over the incident on Facebook but stuck to his stand that he hadn’t made derogatory/sexist remarks against anyone at MSF state committee meeting. He reiterated that he hadn’t uttered a word with malicious intent at the meeting which was attended by 20 persons, including a woman leader. "If any of my colleagues who attended the meeting were hurt due to misunderstanding or otherwise, then I express my regret," he said. Haritha leaders are sore over the wordings of regret expressed by Navas and others as they feel that the male leaders have not even accepted that they had uttered anti-women remarks. Meanwhile, IUML leader MK Muneer said that the agreement was reached with the approval of Haritha leaders and it was read out to them before publishing. Earlier, Vellayil police had registered a case against the leaders under IPC Sections 354 (1) (iv) (making sexually coloured remarks) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman). Ten Haritha leaders had submitted a petition to the women’s commission, which was forwarded to the Kozhikode police chief.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/haritha-leaders-upset-as-msf-counterparts-let-off-lightly/articleshow/85667448.cms||---

The park will aim at conserving traditional crafts, provide employment to thousands of artisans and boost the handicrafts sector’s contribution to the state’s economy,” the spokesperson added. He said that under state’s one district-one product scheme (ODOP), UP’s handicraft and traditional crafts like Banarasi sarees, brass works of Moradabad, perfumes of Kannauj, chikankari of Lucknow and terrocotta of Gorakhpur are being given a major push by the government. “Hundreds of craftspersons are making beautiful things from clay, wood and other materials, including toys and idols that have started drawing attention of people from other parts of the country as well. The park will showcase their craftsmanship to the world,” he added. A YEIDA officials said among the prominent investors in the park are Vikas Exports, which deals in wood, metal and marble work. Vikas Exports has been allotted 5,000 sq metre of land to set up its venture.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/handicraft-park-to-provide-jobs-to-22k/articleshow/85671847.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Bullets shatter Jaipur’s peace as guns become easily available||JAIPUR: Once a tourist haven, Pink city is now regularly jolted by gunshots. The fatal shooting of a 64-year-old consultant in Vaishali Nagar on Thursday was another grim addition in the long series of firing incidents that have shattered the city’s peace. On August 16, people enjoying an evening at a cafe in C-Scheme had to duck for cover when a 26-year-old man opened fire. No one was hurt in the incident but for people inside the cafe, it was still a close call. Police later arrested the gunman, but such incidents have become a recurrent feature here. A similar scene had earlier played out on June 16 near Gandhi Path, when two bike-borne assailants had fired at a car washer. The 41-year-old sustained firearms injuries and was taken to hospital. Police said the gunmen were hired by a jilted lover who wanted to bump off the car washer in order to marry his wife. The city police had recently started an operation AAG (Action Against Guns) to control growing incidents of illegal firearms in the city. As of now, a total of 262 persons have been arrested in the operation. But the menace of illegal arms continued to hound the city. A senior official attributed arms trafficker behind the gun violence in Jaipur. However, what is more disconcerting is that weapons are now used over trivial issues too. On August 6, three drunk youths fired at a refrigerator in a highway dhaba near Kotputli after the staff could not serve their favorite dinner dish - ‘bhindi ki sabzi’. The same day, another shooting over a small tiff shook the area where a minor boy who was miffed at being dismissed from his school, shot at his teacher near Nareda area of Kotputli tehsil. An official told TOI that acquiring an illegal firearm has become increasingly easier. “A rugged gun (desi katta) made in Khargone in Madhya Pradesh can cost up to Rs 5,000. Whereas a pistol is available for Rs 35,000. Madhya Pradesh-made weapons don’t come to Jaipur very often because they are sold mainly in Jhalawar and Kota,” the official said. “There are places in Western Uttar Pradesh like in Mathura and regions of Mewat in Haryana and Rajasthan, where illegal arms traders sell all kinds of weapons at an affordable price,” the official added. Jaipur police said that firearms in the city are acquired for two major reasons- extortions and protection against a rival. “We have been keeping a tight leash on illegal arms traffickers, but new gangs soon crop up,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/bullets-shatter-citys-peace-as-guns-become-easily-available/articleshow/85671851.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University’s convocation ceremony: President Kovind presence added glitter to gold, say toppers||LUCKNOW: Some meritorious students choked with happiness, while some were in a state of disbelief at receiving their medals from the President of India. Seven gold winners who were conferred medals by President Ram Nath Kovind during Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University’s ninth convocation ceremony on Thursday were on cloud nine. “Getting a medal from the President has doubled its glitter. I feel blessed as people even after working hard throughout life don’t get such moments,” said gold medal winner for BSc (food science and technology) Bhanu Pratap Singh, who hails from Kaushambi. Bhanu, the son of Nayak Subedar Rajendra Singh who participated in the Kargil war, said that his dream is to conduct research in food sciences and develop special food for soldiers so that it can be easily carried during wartime and lasts long. “I don’t have words to express how it feels. After listening to his speech, I am inspired to do something for my country. I will work hard to become an IAS officer to serve the nation,” said Priyanka Gautam, BTech (computer science engineering), from Lucknow. She said it was her good luck amid the pandemic to have become part of a convocation ceremony where not only the President but the chief minister and governor were also present. Asking his friends to pinch him to be aware of reality, Barabanki’s Shubham Mishra (MSc geology) said, “This gold has made me more confident and focused towards achieving my dream of developing special remote sensing technology that can save our country from flash floods and avalanches. Only technology can help handle such natural disasters.” MSc (agriculture) student Pooja Meena from Rajasthan shared the same emotion. “It was a day of three biggies: getting a gold medal, opportunity to hear President sir and a real convocation ceremony.” “I was blank for several minutes after getting the medal from the President. Today I promise myself and the country that I will become a librarian to ensure that no student leaves education midway due to inability to buy books,” said MPhil (library science) gold medal winner Niharika Kumari. MPhil (statistics) gold medal winner Shanya Baghel shared that getting a medal from the President was a lifetime achievement award. Baghel, who aspires to become an academician, said she will work for the education of the poor. Similar career dreams and emotions were shared by MA (history) student Anju Rawat, the winner of Shri RD Sonker Founder Samta Samaj award. “Getting an award from the President was like a dream come true. I promise my alma mater to spread the light of learning in rural India by becoming a professor,” she said. “Yahin nahin rukna hai, aur aagey jaana hai,” the President said to Shanya on stage. “He asked me to keep the momentum going and that I should not stop here,” she said, adding that those words will echo in her ears forever to inspire her.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/prez-presence-added-glitter-to-gold-toppers/articleshow/85671884.cms||Mohita Tewari

P Ananthu Babu, who suffered spinal injury in the fall, is currently admitted to the Pariyaram Medical College. His mother Usha Babu said that Ananthu, who passed the Class X exam recently, had climbed atop the tree to get internet signal on his phone to check the Plus One allotment status. He fell on to the rocks beneath the tree. “He had passed the SSLC exam by taking his virtual class lessons by climbing the tree due to the poor internet connectivity in the area. That was the case with all other students in the colony. Today, as usual, he climbed the tree with his phone to check the Plus One allotment, but the branch on which he was standing broke and he fell on the rocks. Doctors have said that he has suffered a spinal injury,” she said. She said that there was just one mobile phone for her three children Ananthu, his brother who is a Class X student and his sister, who is a Class V student and they had to take turns to access their online classes. Usha said that the colony residents had pleaded with authorities and had even sent a memorandum to the chief minister urging steps to solve the issue of poor internet connectivity last year itself but to no avail. There are as many as 72 students in the tribal colony which has around 102 families. The students of the Kurichiya colony have been accessing the online classes by venturing to the nearby forests where the colony residents had even built a temporary tree house (erumadam) to overcome the poor internet connectivity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/boy-falls-from-tree-in-bid-to-access-internet/articleshow/85667498.cms||---

The BJP state president was visiting the circuit house for a meeting with the party members, keeping in view the upcoming assembly elections. Although farmers wanted to protest at the circuit house, they were stopped near Verka milk plant by the police. Some of farmers crossed the barricades and reached up to Malhar Road Chowk. Even after threats from the police of lodging FIR against them, they continued with their protest. The farmers also blocked traffic at Ferozepur Road for a few minutes as the police were not allowing them to cross Verka milk plant. When the police released the farmers from Verka milk plant, those who blocked traffic near Malhar Road, opened the road. The farmers sat at one side of road near Malhar Road Chowk in protest. The farmers, however, said the BJP was responsible for the plight of farmers who were sitting in protest against farm bills from past so many months and these leaders were not bothered about them. Meanwhile, at circuit house the police had tightened the security and the road was closed from both sides. IKt was also learnt that the BJP leaders had in the meeting discussed the modalities about booth-level planning and choosing probable candidates. Sharma reiterated that the party will contest at 117 seats in Punjab and will create history. He asked the workers to gear up for the elections. In the meeting, the members from Amritsar urban and rural, Ludhiana urban and rural and Khanna, Nawanshehr, Malerkotla and Muktsar were also present. However, media was also not allowed in the meeting as leaders claimed it to be their internal meeting. ‘Cong stage manage sugarcane protests’ State president Sharma said the blockade at national highway by farmers for revision of SAP for sugarcane was a planned drama by Congress just to show that CM Amarinder Singh was concerned about the well-being of the farmers. He said BJP wants to resolve the issue of farmers, but opposition parties are grinding their axe through farmer protests. He said BJP will run a campaign against drugs in state in the coming days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/farmers-gather-to-protest-against-bjp-prez-as-he-visits-city-for-internal-meeting/articleshow/85669922.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Maharashtra Rajya Saraf Suvarnakar Federation (MRSSF), which has over 3,00,000 goldsmiths and 60,000 jewellers as members, stated that there were many inconsistencies in the new hallmarking system, causing much confusion among the traders. “After keeping their shutters closed on Monday as a sign of protest against the new hallmarking system, the member-jewellers have decided to wait till Friday to take a call on the next course of action and make the government consider their demand for returning to the old system,” said Nitin Ashtekar, vice-president of the Pune Saraf Association (PSA).  Fatechand Ranka, president of PSA and MRSSF, said, “There have been many cases of repeat HUIDs in cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata and Pune. If anything like this happens, the jewellers will be responsible even if they are not at fault.” Saurabh Gadgil, chairman and managing director, PNG Jewellers, said, “Though it seems tedious now, HUID will improve the goodwill of the Indian gold jewellery industry as unscrupulous players will shut shop.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/jewellers-fear-losses-due-to-new-norms-of-hallmarking/articleshow/85669888.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Vadodara||Rape-accused man’s bail cancelled for delaying trial||Vadodara: A court in Vadodara has taken a strong view in favour of speedy trials especially in cases where minor girls are targeted. In another instance, the court of additional district judge A J Kanani cancelled bail of a man accused of raping a minor girl and ordered him judicial custody after he wanted to adjourn the hearing of the trial to change his lawyer. Twelve witnesses, including a 70-year-old doctor from Vadodara, were to be examined when accused Raju alias Kalidas Thakarda submitted an adjournment asking the court time to change his lawyer. The court, however, told him that his reason did not seem to be genuine. It asked him to call his newly appointed lawyer or manage a proxy one for cross-examination. When nobody turned up, the court took a tough stand by closing the right for cross-examination. The court also noted that the rape-survivor’s mother, who was also to be examined was afraid of deposing her statement owing to accused Thakarda’s presence in the court. “This court believes that accused wants to delay the proceedings. The witnesses are vulnerable in this case and are also afraid of the accused. Hence, there are ample possibilities to win over the witnesses,” the court noted and ordered to cancel his bail. Earlier this month, two rape accused from Ahmedabad were sent into judicial custody as their lawyer had failed to appear. The court had then referred to the high court’s notification regarding adjournment and section 309 of criminal procedure code.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/rape-accused-mans-bail-cancelled-for-delaying-trial/articleshow/85665385.cms||---

The report ranks Mumbai 50 out of 60 cities surveyed. Copenhagen in Denmark crowns the list. Safe Cities Index 2021 report ranks 60 cities across 76 indicators covering digital, health, infrastructure, personal and environmental security.  Delhi ranks 48 according to the index. Mumbai fares worse than New Delhi on the personal security quotient. Mumbai earns 48.2 points out of 100 in the category. It ranks higher than Dhaka and Karachi. Overall, Mumbai ranks 50 with a score of 54.4 out of 100. On the digital security front, the city ranks 53 with 45.4 points. In terms of health security during the Covid pandemic, Mumbai is at 44 with 60.8 points. On infrastructure security, the city comes in at 48 with 57.3 points. Cyber security expert Ritesh Bhatia analysed the findings and said, “The cybersecurity maturity of private and public organisations, as well as their preparedness, is decent in Mumbai. However, what we lack is the digital awareness of threats for which public-private partnership is essential.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-mumbai-make-it-to-eius-60-safe-cities-list/articleshow/85674681.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Merit list deadline difficult to meet, feel college heads||KOLKATA: The number of days allotted to publish merit lists after receiving the applications for under graduate courses are inadequate, according to a section of college principals. They said since the number of applications was so high this year, scrutinising them in such less time will be impossible. There is a risk of discrepancies and fake applications creeping into the final merit list, they added. August 27 is the last date to apply for UG courses now. The colleges have been instructed to publish the merit list byAugust 31, which the principals said was difficult because there is a weekend and a public holiday for Janmashtami on August 30. Even though the entire application process is online this year and the software is designed to calculate the percentage, college authorities want to scrutinise the applications to weed out fake candidatures, which led to unnecessary delay and embarrassment last year. “Earlier, when the deadline for application was August 20, we were getting at least seven to eight working days to publish a provisional merit list followed by a final merit list. Provisional list is published so that applicants can check that their details. But after the deadline revision, we are getting only four days to publish the merit list, out of which there are two days of weekend and Janmashtami on August 30,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. The admission software most colleges can calculate the percentage and draw up the merit list according to the eligibility criteria, but they cannot spot fake applications and those using fraudulent means. Last year, a fake application in the name of actor Sunny Leone made it to the top of the English merit list of Asutosh College. “We do need some human intervention to prevent discrepancies and weed out fake applications. If colleges get some more days, they can publish error-free merit lists,” said Partha Pratim Roy, secretary of the Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association. But many principals are not in favour of extension of any deadline. “I feel we should get started with admitting students and start the semester on time so that students do not face any problems in finishing their syllabus. They have already suffered a lot due to the pandemic. We must all try to wrap up the admissions and start the classes on time,” said the principal of a north Kolkata college.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/merit-list-deadline-difficult-to-meet-feel-college-heads/articleshow/85667508.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu bill reserves 7.5% seats in engineering, agriculture & law for govt school students||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu legislative assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a bill to provide 7.5% horizontal quota to government school students for admissions to UG courses in engineering, agriculture, veterinary, fisheries, law and other professional courses in both government and private institutions. The quota is applicable to students who have studied from Class VI to XII in state government schools. Chief minister M K Stalin said government school students were unable to secure admission to professional courses as they were not able to compete with their counterparts from private schools owing to socio-economic disparities. Of the 8.5 lakh students, who appeared for board exams in 2019-20, 3.45 lakh students were from government schools. In 2020-21, only 0.83% government students got admission in Anna University, 6.31% and 0.44% in government and aided engineering colleges respectively, 3% in veterinary courses, 3.7% in fisheries, 4.89% in agriculture, and less than 1% in National Law University, Trichy, the chief minister said. Stalin recalled the introduction of 15% reservation for rural students in professional courses in 1997 and the fee exemption granted to first-generation graduates. The state cancelled entrance tests for professional courses in 2006 and admissions were being done based on Class XII marks since 2007-08, considering the difficulties faced by students from rural and backward areas, he said.  The AIADMK and its ally, the BJP, welcomed the bill. ‘Bill would bring about real equality among students’The previous AIADMK regime had enacted a law to provide a similar quota to students for medical courses. The bill comes in the wake of a recent report from the state government-constituted commission led by retired judge Justice D Murugesan. Leader of opposition Edappadi K Palaniswami said 40% of the students in the state were studying in government schools and most of them were from economically weaker sections. They could not compete with the students of private schools. “We unanimously support this bill,” the former CM said. BJP floor leader Nainar Nagendran said he welcomed the bill on behalf of the party. It is evident from the commission’s report that there exist inequalities between government school students and private school students. The government, after careful examination of the recommendation of the commission, has decided to take affirmative action, said the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill. This would bring about real equality between the students, who studied in government schools and in private schools, by setting apart a certain percentage of seats on preferential basis, it said. Welcoming the bill, G K Mani of PMK said it was former chief minister M Karunanidhi who brought about the act and created government colleges to help poor and marginalised sections of society to pursue higher education. He thanked the state government for announcing the opening of education institutions in the constituencies of opposition parties (PMK and BJP). VCK member Sinthanai Selvan said it was the need of the hour, an evolution of social justice. Congress floor leader K Selvaperunthagai heaped praise on the government for passing the bill. T Velmurugan of NTK and E R Eswaran of KMDK have also welcomed the bill.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tn-bill-reserves-7-5-seats-in-engg-agri-law-for-govt-students/articleshow/85669923.cms||---

The happiest moment was getting clicked with my teachers without whom gold would not have glittered around my neck, he added. Many students were seen making phone calls to their parents and sending them their pictures on WhatsApp soon after the ceremony. “Our parents were not allowed due to Covid-19 protocol, hence soon after the ceremony, I made a video call to my parents who wanted to see me with a gold medal around my neck,” said gold medalist PhD (History) student Arvind Swaroop. “The presence of our President on the campus made all BBAU students and alumni proud and boosted our confidence. Getting the medal from the dean who taught us was no less of an achievement,” said MSc (Integrated) gold medal winner Farheen. “We were thinking that the convocation would be held online due to Covid curbs, but the offline ceremony was just what we all wished for.

The daily Covid tally rose sharply in Mumbai, doubling from 195 cases 10 days back to 398 on Thursday. This is the highest tally since the first week of August when the daily count started dropping below 300 cases. Meanwhile, Maharashtra reported 5,108 new cases, up from the 4,145 cases on August 16. The daily test positivity rate in Mumbai also rose to 0.95% (41,628 tests as against 398 cases) after dropping to below 0.7% on some days. The state added 159 fatalities, while Mumbai added seven deaths. Maharashtra’s caseload rose to over 64.4 lakh, of which more than 7.4 lakh were in Mumbai and the total deaths climbed to nearly 1.4 lakh, of which 15,963 were in Mumbai. BMC officials, however, said there is no cause for concern. “The daily positivity rate is still below 1%. As we are testing more, more cases are detected,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. He had spoken to Kerala health officials who said that despite the rise in cases, less than 5% needed hospitalisation. “In Mumbai, we have a ready infrastructure in terms of beds, medicines and oxygen supply. There is no reason to worry,” he Kakani. Meanwhile, over 95% villages in Palghar district have been declared Covid-free, with only 91 active cases. The tribal belts of Mokhada and Vikramgad have zero cases. District officials said with 859 of the 903 villages being free of the infection, more schools are likely to reopen. Palghar remains the least vaccinated district at 31%—of the over 9.4 lakh doses administered, only 2.4 lakh have got two shots. According to the weekly Covid update presented to the cabinet, the weekly case growth rate of the state has dropped to 0.07% and the average weekly positivity rate is 2.5% and there are nine districts which have a higher weekly positivity rate than the state’s average. “We are taking steps as per the predictions given by the Centre for the third wave.

---||Dehradun||Lab accused in Kumbh Covid scam seeks quashing of ED case, court gives agency 3 wks to reply||Nainital: Days after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided the premises of a Haryana-based lab in connection with fake Covid tests conducted during Kumbh in Haridwar, the owner of the laboratory has approached the Uttarakhand high court and sought quashing of a preliminary case of money laundering registered by the law enforcement agency on the grounds that “no money had exchanged hands”. The court on Thursday issued a notice to the ED, asking it to respond within three weeks. The notice was issued by the bench of Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe while hearing a petition filed by Navtej Nalwa, owner of Hisar-based Nalwa laboratories. Nalwa is one of the several path labs that have been accused of conducting nearly one lakh fake tests during the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. Earlier this month, the ED had registered a case of money laundering against several labs, including Nalwa, and raided their offices in various cities. Nalwa’s counsel, Parikshit Saini, told TOI that the ED has registered a case of money laundering against the lab even though the Uttarakhand government is yet to pay the lab for Covid testing. “According to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), there has to be proceeds of crime for the ED to act. However, no money is involved in this case,” he said. Proceeds of crime refer to any property or the value of such property gained through criminal activity.

Other than ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups, K Sudhakaran, V D Satheesan and K C Venugopal too want their nominees to be given DCC president posts. This has led to the present stalemate. Meanwhile, Sudhakaran submitted a list to AICC even before reaching a consensus among state leaders and this irked the group leaders. Now, AICC has decided to have more discussion before finalizing things. But, opposition leader Satheesan made it clear that the announcement of new district presidents will not be delayed beyond this week. The KPCC president is now in New Delhi to have discussion with AICC leaders. At least in half-a-dozen districts, there is no consensus on the names to be appointed as district committee presidents. “If the groups used to share the district president posts all these years, now there is stiff lobbying from leaders like Sudhakaran, Satheesan and Venugopal to appoint their nominees. The KPCC president has made it clear that he will not yield to the demands of group leaders. Hence, a stalemate continues,” said a senior party leader on the inordinate delay in finalizing the list. It is learnt that the dispute is continuing in finalizing the names for the posts in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Kottayam and Palakkad. Though ‘I’ and ‘A’ groups had staked their claim in Thiruvananthapuram, the name suggested by Satheesan has delayed the decision. Similarly in Kollam, Kodikunnil Suresh wants his nominee as the president and the two groups are opposing his view. In Alappuzha, ‘I’ group wants Chennithala nominee to be appointed as the president but there is stiff lobbying from Venugopal to appoint his trusted person; both leaders belong to this district. In Ernakulam, ‘I’ and ‘A’ groups had staked their claim, but Satheesan too wanted his nominee to be appointed there. The ‘A’ group cannot even dream of leaving out Kottayam from their kitty. But, the KPCC chief wants a leader from outside the group to be appointed there. The situation in Palakkad is such that Satheesan, Sudhakaran and Venugopal have their own nominees. In Kozhikode, the two groups are opposing the nominee of K Muraleedharan which is delaying the final decision.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/talks-on-dcc-chiefs-falter-as-leaders-stick-to-their-guns/articleshow/85667532.cms||---

Representatives of over 30 housing societies, including Bramha Angan, Natasha Enclave, Sunshree Kangan, Silver Estate, Amba Vihar, Rose Avenue and others, have taken up the matter with the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL). David Chinnayya, secretary, Amba Vihar housing society, said, “We face constant voltage fluctuations, which cause damage to appliances such as fridges, inductions, televisions and microwaves. .” “Residents in the area have been facing these issues even before the pandemic, but over the last 18 months we are facing the brunt of it as most people are working or studying from home. Many senior citizens live on higher floors. Very often one phase goes off, the lifts stop working, leaving them with no choice but to use the stairs,” said Nisha Monteiro, a resident of Sunshree Kangan. Aditya Jha, a resident of Brahma Angan, complained about lack of maintenance of transformer installed in his housing society. “The transformer was installed in 2001. Since then I have not seen anyone coming for maintenance. When we call MSEDCL officials, we are told that there is a lack of manpower. There are high tension lines hanging just behind the building. There have been major developments in the area over the last 10 years, with a 200% increase in residents and new establishments coming up, leading to a corresponding increase in consumption of electricity.” Rohan Gaikwad, chief of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) NIBM-Mohammedwadi ward, submitted a memorandum to the assistant engineer, MSEDCL, NIBM section, on August 12. “We met the officials from the St Mary’s sub-station. They said they would probe the matter and call representatives of each society to discuss a solution over the next few days. But there has been no response yet.” “We have an internal agency that carries out regular maintenance work of transformers. Our pre-monsoon maintenance work was also completed. After receiving complaint, we rectify the problems on a case-by-case basis,” the MSEDCL spokesperson told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/power-cuts-fluctuating-voltage-plague-kondhwa-mohammadwadi-residents/articleshow/85669938.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Kolkata||Radioactive whiff in Dum Dum seizure||KOLKATA: The CID has recovered four mineral-like rocks — weiging 250.5gm — that two men were trying to sell, claiming it was an extremely expensive radioactive metal called californium. They were caught red-handed while trying to make the sale at Motilal Colony near the airport. A sample of the seized substance has been sent to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for identification. Californium is valued around Rs 17 crore per gm in the international market. If the confiscated material does turn out to be the radioactive metal, it could be worth Rs 4,250 crore. Police have not ruled out the possibility of it being fake. Californium, a synthetic radioactive material, has a variety of uses, including acting as a neutron emitter, providing neutrons for the start-up of nuclear reactors, and to detect gold and silver ores. According to police, two persons — Sailan Karmakar (41) of Singur and Asit Ghosh (49) of Polba — were at the house of local promoter Babu Dey and were negotiating the sale when CID who had been tipped off earlier raided the house and arrested the duo. Dey had earlier approached the police after he suspected something fishy in the deal that they wanted to conclude for a few lakhs. Karmakar and Ghosh, both from Hooghly, initially said they had brought the metal in the form of four ash-coloured rocks from Karnataka by train. “During interrogation, the accused initially claimed that they were appointed only as carriers. Later, they said it might have been sourced from Kerala. There are inconsistencies in the statements,” said a source. In May-end, eight people had been apprehended in Lucknow while attempting to sell 340 gm of the substance they had claimed was californium. Like that metal, what was confiscated during the raid on Wednesday evening also sparkles in the dark and reflects light. However, the Department of Atomic Energy had clarified that the material confiscated in Lucknow was not a radioactive material. In that instance, too, the arrested persons had attempted to sell the material to a builder who had alerted cops.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/radioactive-whiff-in-dum-dum-seizure/articleshow/85667551.cms||---

The CM is planning to visit village secretariats and interact with the public during Rachabanda programme. Although Jagan wanted to hold the programme last year, he suspended it due to Covid-19 situation. He did not campaign for Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election and elections to local bodies. YS Jagan had confined himself to attending inauguration of a few projects and schemes and inspection of irrigation projects since coming to power two-and-a-half years ago. The chief minister had already told the district collectors that he will be launching Rachabanda very shortly while interacting them through video-conference. The chief minister asked the officials to gear up the field-level administration particularly village and ward secretariats to improve service delivery. He wanted all senior officials right from district collector to revenue divisional officer to mandatorily inspect the secretariats and set things right. He even went to the extent of directing the pashie to issue memos to many IAS officers of joint collector rank for not visiting the secretariats as mandated by him last month. The chief minister expressed his satisfaction about improved performance of the senior officials in visiting the village/ward secretariats during the Wednesday’s video-conference. The chief minister is of the view that strengthening of the secretariat system would automatically bring in transparency and accountability in the administration. He has set deadlines for delivery of each scheme initiated by his government and wanted the officials to meet the timelines. The chief minister also warned the officials of serious consequences if public came up with unresolved grievances during his field visits. “No application under any welfare scheme either housing or rice card or pension should be rejected without any valid reason. Any delay in grant of benefits to the eligible beneficiaries will be viewed seriously,” the chief minister told the district collectors. With almost all welfare initiatives implemented through village/ward secretariats, the CM is expecting maximum satisfaction levels among the public about the functioning of the government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/cm-likely-to-launch-mass-contact-prog-next-month/articleshow/85667536.cms||Samdani MN

---||Pune||Approval to controversial proposal of leasing out amenities put on hold||Pune: The general body of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Thursday took a call to postpone its decision on the controversial proposal to lease out amenity spaces to private players for development. After opposing the move earlier, the Nationalist Congress party (NCP) decided to support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday only to change its stand on Thursday. The meeting was adjourned after putting the proposal on the backburner. Nongovernmental organisations (NGO) and citizens groups have been protesting against handing over of amenity spaces to private players. The NCP had demanded that 33% area of these spaces be used for tree plantation. The party said on Wednesday that it would support the BJP’s move as its demand had been accepted. The NCP’s change of stand was opposed by political parties and civic groups. The Pune unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) staged an agitation at the PMC on Thursday, blaming the NCP and BJP for the move. “The civic body’s plan to lease out amenity spaces is wrong. It will affect future generations. Both these parties have tried to serve their personal interests by joining hands,” said Mukund Kirdat, the city unit chief of the party. NCP, which decided not to support the move at the last minute, claimed that it took the decision after studying the updated version of the proposal. “We had asked the BJP to send us the proposal along with the changes suggested by us. The updated proposal did not fulfil our demands. So, we decided to go back on our decision,” said Prashant Jagtap, the city unit chief of the NCP. The Congress and Shiv Sena had opposed the move and remained firm on their stand. “We had not supported the move in the larger public interest. We will continue to oppose the plan to give public places to private parties,” said Aba Bagul, the Congress leader in the PMC. Prithviraj Sutar, leader of the Shiv Sena in the PMC, said, “The civic body would have suffered losses had the proposal been approved. The move will benefit private developers at the cost of citizens. So, we are not in favour of it,” he said. NGOs and citizen groups in Pune have approached the Bombay High Court requesting it to scrap the proposal for transferring amenity spaces to private players for development.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/approval-to-controversial-proposal-of-leasing-out-amenities-put-on-hold/articleshow/85669925.cms||---
---||Dehradun||U'khand govt depts surrendered Rs 259 cr on last working day of 2019-20, leaving no scope for utilising funds on other development purposes: CAG report||Dehradun: The audit report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) pertaining to the state government for the financial year 2019-20 was tabled in the Uttarakhand assembly on Thursday. The report found several irregularities in the budgetary management of the state. The report said that departments surrendered Rs 259 crore on the last working day of the financial year leaving no scope for utilising the funds for other development purposes. “Supplementary provision of Rs 2,481 crore obtained in 45 cases was unnecessary,” the report added. It recommended that “the state government should be more realistic in budgetary assumptions and ensure efficient control mechanisms to curtail savings/excess expenditure.” “The state government may assess the savings/excess and surrender the amount well before the close of the financial year so that they can be effectively utilised in other areas/schemes,” the report said. Under the head of budgetary management, the CAG also found that excess expenditure of Rs 35,659 crore pertaining to years from 2005-06 to 2018-19 was yet to be regularised by the state legislature. “An expenditure of Rs 330 crore was booked under the revenue section, whereas it should have been booked under the capital section,” CAG said. The report further said that the fiscal deficit for 2019-20 was Rs 7,657 crore and recommended that the state government should augment its resources to become a revenue-surplus state. As far as the finances of the state were concerned, the CAG observed that revenue receipts decreased by Rs 493 crore over the previous year and ‘Own Tax Revenue’ declined by Rs 675 crore. “As per finance accounts for year 2019-20, there were 210 incomplete/ongoing projects worth Rs 886 crore under various divisions of public works as on March 31, 2020.” The CAG has recommended the state to make efforts to augment its own revenue and settle the pending tax claims timely, settle arrears in assessment of taxes and recover the arrears of revenue and improve non-tax revenue towards better resource mobilisation. Under the head of quality of accounts and financial reporting practices, the CAG mentioned that the departmental officers did not submit 52 utilisation certificates to the accountant general of Uttarakhand in respect to grants of Rs 944 crore given up to March 2019 for specific purposes. The auditing body further said that as on March 31, 2020, there were 30 State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) out of which eight had been inactive since last eight to 33 years. Out of the total profit of Rs 258 crore earned by SPSEs, 91.28% was contributed by three SPSEs. Out of the loss of Rs 634 crore incurred by 13 SPSEs, loss of Rs 577 crore was contributed by one SPSE one – Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited, the report said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-depts-surrendered-rs-259-cr-on-last-working-day-of-2019-20-leaving-no-scope-for-utilising-funds-on-other-development-purposes-cag-report/articleshow/85664789.cms||Kautilya Singh

Traditionally corporation polls were won by MES candidates as the Maratha community is in majority in several parts of city. However, this time around, BJP and Congress has fielded candidates for the first time and the election is being fought on party symbols. Both parties have given tickets to aspiring candidates from the same community. This has become a source of anxiety for the MES and unless focused effort the candidates supported by it may lose. Keeping this in mind, MES is inviting leaders from Maharashtra including some big names to invoke Maratha identity and stoke emotions of the people. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut is famously known for making controversial statements on the border dispute and on multiple occasions, his statements have evoked emotions of the community here. MES leader Shubham Vikrant Shelke told TOI that he was confident of people placing MES backed victorious candidate as the mayor. MES has fielded 50 candidates and is looking at winning 40 seats. Shelke said to keep the tempo going till the election, many leaders from Maharashtra including Raut and Pawar will visit Belagavi to campaign. Ashok Chandaragi, a senior Kannada activist has urged chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and KPCC president DK Shivakumar to forge an alliance after the BCC poll results to keep MES away from power.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/sanjay-raut-of-shiv-sena-maha-dcm-ajit-pawar-likely-to-campaign-for-mes/articleshow/85664808.cms||Basavaraj Meeshi

Sowing in Barmer district has been less than the target due to less than average rain. The target of sowing in Barmer district was 14.79 lakh hectares, but it has been done in only 12 lakh hectares. Now, the crops are on the verge of wilting due to no rain. The situation is no different in Jaisalmer district. In Jaisalmer as well, crops in 3 lakh hectare area have gotten damaged. With drought approaching in Barmer, the district administration has started the preparation. District collector Lok Bandhu called a district level meeting of PM Fasal Bima Yojana to conduct a survey of sowing. Collector Lok Bandhu said that there has been no rain in majority areas of the district due to which around 75% of the sown crops are on the verge of getting damaged. Preparations have been started to provide compensation of crop insurance to the farmers and directions have been given for girdawari. The survey will be completed in one week. He said that the insurance company is not ready to accept that the sown seeds have grown so as per rules, compensation cannot be given, but when it was checked at our level it was found that the seeds have grown, but we will try to persuade the insurance company that the farmers be given compensation for the sown crops. Lok Bandhu held a meeting with SDO, agriculture department dy director Virendra Singh Solanki and agriculture insurance company officers. As per PM Fasal Bima Yojana guidelines, survey has to be done on time, so directions have been given to all officers to conduct the survey in time. Solanki said that the survey was started from Tuesday by the employees of agriculture, revenue and insurance company and local sarpanch and public representatives will be with them. Survey has been started by forming teams at the tehsil level. Farmers say that they are worried about their crops. They had taken loans and did sowing, but after 2.5 months and no rain, they are now in a fix. Crops are getting damaged and they had taken loans for second sowing and now, they are facing problems repaying them. They are hoping to get help from the government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/lack-of-rain-adds-to-farmers-misery-in-jaisalmer-barmer/articleshow/85671952.cms||---

There has been a lot of transformation in the state as far as industrial development is concerned owing to the government’s zero-tolerance policy on law and order,” said Mahana at the conference on ‘Building state capabilities for global value chain-Uttar Pradesh’. Discussing the state’s investment policies, Mahana said earlier there was a huge trust deficit between the industry and the government but now the chief minister, the minister himself and senior officials of the department were ready to support the industry. “I am sure that UP is now the largest industrial state across the country. It has both dedicated freight corridors running through it, while new policies have been designed to help bring further investments in the state. However, for better coordination, I urge the industry to engage with relevant departments for issues related to different sectors like power, environment, tax etc,” he said. The minister said that many textile units in UP were shut down earlier due to primitive machinery and related issues, which pushed the state backward but now with better policies, ease of doing business and a cooperative government, the state had become a hub of investments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-now-most-preferred-hub-of-investment-in-nation-min/articleshow/85671974.cms||---

Bengal currently has 679 such women and the mother-to-child transmission of HIV is 0.3% in the state. “I was almost thrown out by my in-laws after I was detected to be HIV-positive during an ante-natal check-up. Instead of crying over it, I worked overtime to save money, consulted doctors and continued with my ART regime, which prevented the virus being transmitted to my child,” said a mother in her 30s. The Kolkata resident had delivered a HIV-negative baby. According to various health organisations, the mother-to-child transmission should be below 5%. With only 0.3%, Bengal already has a very low transmission rate. “Registering for ante-natal check-up, early detection for timely intervention with ART therapy and prophylaxis to the newborn and exclusive six month breastfeeding are very essential to stop vertical transmission,” said professor Kalpana Datta, director of the Paediatric Centre of Excellence at MCHK. Organised by the West Bengal State Aids Prevention & Control Society (WBSAP&CS) and NGO SAATHII, the weeklong programme will have many more activities. “HIV transmission cases from mother to child have been reduced in a significant manner. Nowadays, we see these women coming forward to talk about it. It is a very encouraging sign,” said Souvik Ghosh, SAATHII state programme specialist on EMTCT.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/health-tips-for-hivve-would-be-moms/articleshow/85667605.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The cost of the machine is Rs 2.5 crore. In private laboratories, the investigations done by this machine are very expensive and may go up to Rs 35,000. With the help of this machine, the investigations will be done for as low as Rs 3,000. The senior citizens and BPL families can get their tests done free of cost.In yet another development, the Government has installed a TB disease testing TrueNat machine costing about Rs 15 lakh in Kotra and Jhadol region of the district. The machine will detect TB disease within a few hours. Earlier, patients from Kotra and other areas had to go to the district headquarters due to non-availability of this facility in local hospitals. Truenat machine is based on advanced technology, along with common TB, immunological conditions like MDR TB will also be tested and identification and treatment of TB patients will also be faster due to the availability of local level testing. With this machine TB bacteria can be detected with 100% reliability and a test report is also received within an hour.EBUS bronchoscopy is a procedure used to diagnose different types of lung disorders, including inflammation, infections or cancer. Performed by a pulmonologist, EBUS bronchoscopy uses a flexible tube that goes through your mouth and into your windpipe and lungs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/govt-hospital-gets-machine-to-detect-tumour-in-lungs/articleshow/85672013.cms||---

Rajinder Kumar Chawla crumpled to the ground underneath a tree, barely 10 metres away from the NHAI’s office after the shooting. The two armed assailants then scurried off into different residential localities. According to police, the firing took place shortly after 2.40pm. Chawla had just concluded his meeting with NHAI officials and stepped out of the office, located in D-148 behind a power sub-station when the two accused in denim jeans and t-shirts walked up to him and fired a single shot at his temple. Police recovered a brass shell from near Chawla’s body. Blood was streaming from his head and he died in SMS Hospital without regaining consciousness. “The gunmen fired a single shot from close to the victim’s forehead,” said DCP (crime) Digant Anand. Rajinder Kumar Chawla The CCTV footage that emerged after the incident showed the accused running away in different directions. Vaishali Nagar ACP Rai Singh Beniwal said the accused may have met each other at some other location after the killing. Vaishali Nagar police station SHO Anil Kumar Jaimain said the motive of the crime could not be determined. Police, however, also suspect the gunmen were hired to carry out the killing. “They knew the moment Chawla would step out of the building after completing the meeting. They had parked their vehicles elsewhere and walked into the locality to execute the murder,” an officer said. A lady ironing clothes in a shack near the office claimed she did not see anyone. Though the investigators questioned her thoroughly, she continued to say that she did not witness any murder. Police said that Chawla had come to Jaipur from Gurugram with two other colleagues. The meeting with NHAI officials began sometime after 12.30pm and continued for a long time. Hari Singh Gila, an NHAI official, said that Chawla regularly visited the office for various meetings related to NHAI projects. According to him, a project for the construction of 14-foot over bridges on Jaipur-Gurugram is underway. Chawla was reportedly one of the consultants involved in the big project which is estimated to cost Rs 35 crore. Police said that Chawla had retired in 2015 from the public works department (PWD) in Haryana. He was working as a consultant after his retirement. He had come to Jaipur at least thrice before. Till dusk, a team of crime branch sleuths was going door-to-door to find some clues about the suspects. There are three abandoned houses outside the NHAI office with their gates locked. “We have informed the victim’s wife about the incident. The body has been moved to the mortuary. We are waiting for the family to come so that a post-mortem can be conducted,” an officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gurugram-based-project-consultant-shot-dead-in-jaipurs-vaishali-nagar/articleshow/85672025.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Now, all Covid +ves to be in institutional isolation||Nagpur: Soon after five samples of Covid-19 positive patients who were admitted to hospitals in July were found positive for the Delta+ variant, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) swung into action on Thursday. The civic body has made institutional isolation mandatory for all Covid-19 positive patients, regardless of whether they are symptomatic or or not. The order that was issued on Thursday evening stated that there will be no home isolation for any patient henceforth. “NMC’s Covid care centre is at MLA Hostel. Patients may get admitted in any of the NMC-run hospitals or in Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) or Mayo (Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital). They can get admitted in private hospitals too,” reads the order which clearly states that no Covid-19 patient will stay at home now. The decision has evoked a mixed response from city doctors. Majority of them called this “unscientific” at this stage of pandemic while some of them, mostly those associated with Covid-19 task force, supported the decision by saying that there’s nothing wrong in being overprotective rather than being careless. “NMC is behaving as if we are in 2020. We don’t have that much multiplication going on to induce dramatic mutations. This step will cause unnecessary fear among people and deter them from getting RT-PCR tested,” said infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. He added, “NMC should rather focus on vaccination. It’s a well-known fact that 65% of the people infected with Delta+ in Maharashtra were unvaccinated. If we vaccinate more people, it will provide better protection and normal life,” and said that there is no report of variants emerging even in Kerala, where massive multiplication of virus is being reported. A source in the NMC health department claimed that the five Delta+ patients found in Nagpur had slightly different spike protein as compared to the typical Delta+ variant. So, it was decided to take the precautionary measure. “It is suggested in the state protocol that local administration should stop home isolation. We have decided to implement it now,” said the official. Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, who is a member of the Covid task force, said there was no problem in being overprotective. “We must understand that the Covid care centre of hospital is not jail. It’s our social responsibility to stay in isolation to avoid further spread of disease,” he said, appealing that people should not consider this as a panic signal. Another member of the task force said that this can only be a temporary measure and cannot be sustainable in the long run, if cases rise. Genome sequencing is a regular exercise and it takes 4-6 weeks to get results. The results of samples sent in June-July are now arriving batch-wise. Genome sequencing not only detects Delta or Delta+ variant, but also other variants such as Alpha, Beta, Kappa etc. In Mumbai, samples positive for Alpha and Kappa variants have been detected so far. Not Just Delta+Enough scientific evidence available that Delta+ is not more dangerous than Delta Different variants — Alpha, Kappa etc also getting detected in genome sequencing Genetic mutation an integral part of virus life cycle, and will continue Controlling virus multiplication by vaccination best remedy at this stage More people should be tested to detect asymptomatic carriers||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/now-all-covid-ves-to-be-in-institutional-isolation/articleshow/85667643.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Honour for doctors who led from front in Covid fight||KOLKATA: Their age make them vulnerable to Covid-19. Even as the virus has claimed the lives of many younger colleagues, these senior doctors did not hang up their boots and continued to attend to patients during the pandemic. On Thursday, they were felicitated by Protect the Warriors (PTW) for their commitment to the profession. Cardiothoracic surgeon Sidhartha Chakraborty has been conducting surgeries all through the pandemic. The former medical superintendent and vice-principal of Medical College Hospital, Kolkata, had taken up the assignment as KPC Medical College principal after he retired from government service. Now superannuated from KPC Medical College, he works with two private hospitals. “Even as most surgeries I conducted were planned ones, I had to get involved in some emergency cases where Covid status of the patient was unknown. Fortunately, I have not got infected yet. Covid is going to stay for now and we better try to go back to normal as much as possible after taking all precautions,” said Chakraborty. At 77, pulmonologist Dhiman Ganguly had worked with the state government in containing Covid-19 during the first wave in addition to patient consultation. He, along with senior physician Sukumar Mukherjee (in his 80s), were the first among the senior citizens to take the vaccine in the state. “I have tried to contribute whatever little I can in the Covid fight. This virus has emerged as the most difficult to predict. But I would like to agree with WHO scientist Soumya Swaminathan on the possibility of the virus entering endemic stage in India,” said Ganguly. Interventional cardiologist Shuvavan Ray of Fortis Hospital and eye specialist Gautam Bhaduri, former director of Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, were also among the doctors who were felicitated on Thursday. Bhauduri, however, is currently not seeing patients after a knee surgery. “As we started learning more about the the virus, we opened our department, which is working fully since August 2020. We had to open up to patients. Apart from patient coming only for cardiac issues, we need to coordinate with doctors in the Covid ward as heart issues are involved in patients with severe infection,” said Ray. “It is really encouraging to see the professional commitment of these senior doctors who have taught and guided many of us,” said PTW general secretary ENT specialist Abhik Ghosh. The organisation has also launched Covid Memoir, a book of 60 stories told by doctors themselves.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/honour-for-docs-who-led-from-front-in-covid-fight/articleshow/85667629.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The deceased were T Sankaraiah (57), his wife Guruvamma (50) and their youngest son Vinay (25). According to Puttur circle inspector Venkat Ram Reddy, the incident happened in the wee hours. Locals found the three dead with an insecticide bottle lying next to them. Preliminary investigation revealed that the trio took the extreme step due to the huge debts incurred by the eldest son of the couple, Satish. He was into jaggery business. Police said Satish owed more than Rs 1.5 crore to creditors and a few days ago, he allegedly fled his village along with wife and children. Cops said the lenders came to the house of Sankaraiah and asked him and Vinay to repay them. “Feeling humiliated, all of them decided to end their lives on Wednesday night. The incident came to light on Thursday morning,” the CI told TOI.

Officials said the departments of planning, engineering, public health and land were faced with severe shortage of manpower. The move comes almost a month after the Noida Authority floated the requirement for retired government employees. But while Noida sought to fill just six posts, Greater Noida is looking for 70 personnel. A GNIDA official said, “See, Noida has about 1,040 permanent employees. We have less than 275 at the moment. Moreover, we have been instructed by senior officials of the industries department to fill the void without expecting the government’s intervention.” The official’s comment suggested that the government wasn’t planning a recruitment drive as of now. The Greater Noida Authority requires 15 architects, 10 engineers, 10 sanitary inspectors and 10 lekhpals. Apart from them, GNIDA also wants horticulture inspectors, stenographers and administrative managers. The jobs will be offered for six months and an extension could be provided after review if the authority feels.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/gnida-seeks-retd-govt-employees-to-fill-70-key-posts/articleshow/85672009.cms||Shalabh
---||Lucknow||BJP to connect with farmers via outreach drive||Lucknow: With CM Yogi Adityanath announcing a hike in sugarcane State Advisory Price (SAP) for the forthcoming crushing season and withdrawing stubble burning cases lodged against farmers, BJP is setting in motion its massive organisational machinery to reach out to farmers, essentially in west UP, ahead of the state assembly polls. Sources said the party is planning to launch a farmer outreach programme at booth level in October when crushing and Rabi cultivation start. The party has asked functionaries of its farmer wing to start the spade work for the campaign to inform farmers about the benefits of farm laws, the increase in minimum support price (MSP) of various crops by the central and state governments, ensuring availability of fertilisers and electricity supply and social security schemes for them. “The party will inform farmers and the public about the measures taken by BJP in their favour. Our party works all through five years, unlike the opposition which is active only on social media,” said UP BJP Kisan Morcha president Kameshwar Singh, while speaking to TOI. “We will reach out to farmers through our booth-level committees. There are 1.83 lakh booths and we have constituted nearly 1.5 lakh booth committees,” Singh added. More committees will come up in the next couple of months, said sources. BJP plans to neutralize the misinformation spread by the Opposition which is aiming to put the ruling party on the mat on farm protests. Analysts, however, are viewing BJP’s initiative as an attempt to negate any impact of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), which is targeting BJP and is calling it anti-farmer. BKU is largely active in the politically volatile west UP region, comprising nearly 125 assembly seats. BJP Kisan Morcha leadership contradicts reports of BKU having any impact on farmers. “I myself camped in West UP 10 days ago and found that farmers are happy with the Yogi Adityanath government and are satisfied with the measures taken by it,” Singh added. Earlier, BJP had organized mega ‘Kisan Panchayats’ to mobilize farmers, especially in west UP where protest against farm laws is on for over eight months. BJP also held ‘Kisan Samvad’ from August 16 to 23 in the state to improve its prospects in the assembly polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bjp-to-connect-with-farmers-via-outreach-drive/articleshow/85672015.cms||Pankaj Shah

Rohini Somanakatti, who passed BCom last year, has filed her nomination from ward-39 in Hubballi from AAP.Rohini, who hails from a middle class family from Sundar town on the outskirts of Hubballi, said she was working as a contract executive in a nationalised bank and earning Rs 20,000 per month. “As I pursued my primary and high school education at a government school in Vishweshwara Nagar, I used to think how to develop the state-run schools on the lines of private schools. When I used to travel by bus during my college days, I was disgusted with the worst roads in Hubballi. Despite paying types of taxes, commoners are still deprived of the rightful facilities. Except KIMS, medical infrastructure in Hubballi is poor. When these thoughts were going on in my mind, I saw an invitation from the Aam Aadmi Party for membership. I met AAP national leader Romi Bhati and other leaders two months ago and after a thorough interview, the party chose me to contest in HDMC poll,” she explained.Somanakatti is elder daughter of Basavaraj, who works at a kitchen utensils shop, and Prabhavati, a home maker. Romi Bhati, AAP’s Karnataka in-charge, said, “We have encouraged many youngsters, who have a vision for development. As of now, Rohini is the youngest contestant from AAP, after Payal Patel, 22, in Surat. During the interview, we observed the spark in Rohini and her out of the box ideas for the development of the city.

The police immediately swung into action to track the couple. The man has been identified as Laxman Keer of Modlon ka Jopndyan under Nainwa police station in Bundi. In the video, the couple said they did not want to live as their enemies were chasing them. They vowed not to part with each other and instead embrace death. Keer said, “My father has six sons and nothing will be lost if I die.” The girl said, “We are four sisters, two elders and one younger. If I die, there will be three others in the family.” The couple asked the police and locals not to trouble their parents, family members and they (couple) had forgiven them for their doing and the decision to embrace death was their own. The couple also warned the youngsters not to follow the path of love and to do everything in life as per the wishes of parents. “Those who live the life as per their wishes and do work accordingly, they are destined to the same ill and tragic fate as they do”, the couple said. Notably, the couple also appealed the folk singers to compose songs on their love story and to release the album with their photos. The youth particularly urged one of local singers Manraj to compose the songs on their love story and asked his friends and local people to widespread their message on social media. The accused worked as daily wage labourer in Jaipur. A police team on Wednesday was in Jaipur where suspected locations of the accused were searched but none was found there, investigating officer Jai Singh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/runaway-couple-vows-to-end-lives-uploads-video/articleshow/85671993.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||With schools opening, teachers say poll duty messes with their schedule||Ludhiana: With a number of teachers complaining that they were being made to perform non-teaching tasks under election duty even during the school hours, the district education officer (DEO) secondary Lakhbir Singh has instructed the principals and school heads to fill up the details in the data form of the teachers, who are performing the duties for election. According to recent instructions by the DEO, the teachers would not be assigned any non-teaching tasks as all the schools have been opened and the staff is required in the schools. The teachers who have been assigned such duties have to submit their details in a google form. Those teachers who have been appointed as booth level officers by the deputy commissioner should perform the duties after school hours only.” It is also suggested that non-teaching staff should be deployed for election purposes or those officials or departments should be pitched who have less work. However, deputy commissioner (DC), who has assigned the duties mentioned that these deployment were in accordance with the instructions of election commission. Teachers claimed that despite instructions from the department against performing non-teaching duties, over 50% of the education department was assigned election duties, for which meetings were being conducted even during study hours. However, the DC, sub-divisional magistrate have assigned their duties to them in their offices. A lecturer of chemistry at a multi-purpose school who has been assigned the duty of SVEEP nodal officer, said, “Sector officers and SVEEP activity nodal officers have their meetings in the middle of the schools hours, which is compulsory to attend. Either they can attend a school or they can perform duties. To attend meetings, they have to be relieved. As BLOs have to work after school, in maximum cases, staff has to travel to longer distances to perform duties at their designated booths.” “The election officer should actually use anganwadi workers and non-teaching staff. This would be a good income source for them and teachers could concentrate on school work,” the lecturer added. When contacted, DC Varinder Sharma said, “The election commission has decided for the duties. We will draw people from every department whenever required as elections are important and they are just 180 days away. Nobody can be relieved.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/with-schools-opening-teachers-say-poll-duty-messes-with-their-schedule/articleshow/85670000.cms||Mehak Jain
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu govt asks company to rectify or replace 600 ventilators||CHENNAI: Two months after medical device maker Philips announced recall of Philips bi-level positive airway pressure (Bi-Level PAP), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and mechanical ventilator devices, the state government has asked the company to replace or rectify defects in at least 600 invasive and non-invasive ventilators used in government hospitals. The firm has issued safety alerts to address potential health risks including toxic and carcinogenic effects related to components used in these devices. On June 14, it initiated a recall notification. These devices push air into the lungs of people with problems such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sleep disorders, where breathing intermittently stops. The notification said the foam used in these devices to reduce sounds and vibrations were defective. It may break down into small particles and if inhaled, these particles could lead to short-term and long-term health issues. “The potential risks of chemical exposure due to off-gassing include headache, irritation, hypersensitivity, nausea/vomiting, and possible toxic and carcinogenic effects. Philips has received no reports regarding patient impact related to chemical emissions,” it said. However, the fine print read that recall notification was for the US only. For the rest of the world it was just a “a field safety notice.” On August 9, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation put out a medical device alert stating that Philips India Limited is “voluntarily issuing field safety notification” for necessary rectification and continued usage of the devices. While it warned the foam may enter the device air pathway, it also warned that “high heat and high humidity environments may contribute to foam degradation in certain regions”. The foam may emit chemicals and gases during initial operation and may continue throughout the device’s useful life, it said. It advised patients using Bi-Level PAP and CPAP devices to discontinue using these devices and consult their doctors. Those using mechanical ventilators have been asked not to discontinue use without consulting their doctors. Over the week, Tamil Nadu surveyed the devices in all government hospitals. “We have purchased four of the nearly dozen faulty models over a period. Our biomedical engineers are now reviewing them and are also collecting information about the machines present in government hospitals across the state received as donations. We are asking the manufacturer for a replacement or take needy measures in rectifying the issue” said Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation managing director Deepak Jacob. These devices were used extensively during Covid-19 in patients with moderate and severe illness. “We have adequate respiratory devices such as ventilators of various makes and high flow nasal cannulas which could be used as alternatives to the faulty devices. Our engineers will ensure that there is no shortage of this equipment anywhere,” he added. However, the state or the company does not have a count on the number of people using these devices at private hospitals or at people’s homes in Tamil Nadu. One of the users, 91-year-old Padma Reddy, a resident of Vepery, who has been using a non-invasive ventilator at night in her house since 2018 for her COPD, complained of nausea last week. After running several tests, doctors asked her family to service the ventilator. “That’s when the bio-medical engineer told us the machine was faulty. We placed the tube on a white cloth and saw several tiny black particles,” said her daughter Vidya R, who is now waiting for Philips to take corrective measures. While Padma was lucky to discover the defect and find a replacement for the device, pulmonologists say many patients who use these devices at home may still not be aware. “We registered with the company as soon as they released the alert. They have serviced 10 oxygen concentrators and three non-invasive ventilators. Our machines were fine since they were well maintained,” said Dr Avinash Rajkumar of Nurture Out Reach Medical Services, which offers home care services. “But people who buy them for personal use may not be aware of maintenance or safety alters,” he said. A senior official from Philips told TOI that the company would replace the foam with a new material in all faulty devices. “We have asked users to register the devices on our website or call us at 000800-852 1411 to get their device registered,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tn-asks-co-to-rectify-or-replace-600-ventilators/articleshow/85670054.cms||Pushpa Narayan

He was speaking at the event, Rajasthan Health Icons-2021, organised by The Times of India to felicitate doctors and hospitals for their exemplary contributions to the healthcare sector, held at a city hotel in Jaipur. The work of setting up oxygen plants at 400 places in the state has picked up pace along with other facilities, including strengthening of critical care for children, increasing the number of beds in hospitals. “The health infrastructure which we are developing will cater to the needs of the next 25 years so that any medical crisis or pandemic such as Covid or any other outbreak of diseases can be dealt with efficiently,” Sharma said. At the event, 21 doctors and hospitals were felicitated. Major General Rajendra Rai, General Officer Commanding, 61 Sub Area, Indian Army, was the guest of honour at the function. Congratulating the doctors, Sharma lauded their selfless and dedicated service for patients who required treatment and care during the pandemic. “Doctors have not bothered about their own health during the pandemic. I have closely monitored it in the past one-and-a-half-years. They put their own lives at risk. They also sacrificed their lives for the patients,” he said. Recalling the days when the first Covid case was reported in the state in March 2020, Sharma said, “At that time, we did not have any facility for Covid tests and we had to send the samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. Now, we have a capacity to test 1.45 lakh samples a day. Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan are the only two states which took only RT-PCR tests, which are more reliable and accurate.” Doctors who were felicitated for their exemplary contribution to healthcare sector at an event by The Times of India at a city hotel on Thursday“We have learnt from the second Covid wave. During the second wave, the Centre had taken control of oxygen generation plants and centralised the distribution of medicines such as remdesivir and tocilizumab. As a result, the state faced a shortage of oxygen. With the second wave vanishing, we have started preparing for the third wave so that we shall not face such difficulties.” The health department is now planning to increase oxygen generation in the state to 1000 metric tonnes daily for the purpose. More than 40,000 oxygen concentrators have been procured and 400 oxygen plants are being put up. Sharma said that 332 community health centres (CHCs) across the state have been identified to strengthen healthcare facilities. The vaccination drive against Covid too has gathered steam in the state and now 60% of the eligible population have received the first dose, while 20% have received both the doses. For giving a boost to medical education, 15 medical colleges have been approved over the past two years in districts. This has also helped in increasing the number of MBBS seats, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-building-med-infra-for-needs-of-25-yrs-min/articleshow/85672051.cms||---

They also deleted data from the database to mask irregularities and never kept hard copies.

The Ghaziabad office of CBI had received the complaint in October 2018 and it took the agency almost three years to dig into the scam perpetrated by the four accountants of the pay account office of RVC, which operates under the CDA, Meerut. Eventually, the FIR was filed at the Anti-Corruption Branch of Ghaziabad on June 30.

Dhillon said already development remained at back seat during Congress tenure and now when Congress leaders had started works ahead of elections, the contractors have raised allegations against them. Dhillon in a statement said here on Wednesday, in the present government the corruption is at its peak and no work gets completed without commission or bribe. He also referred to the claims by a section in the civic body that 3%commission was being given to the engineers for getting the bills approved and the commission amount was being shared with the political bosses in the name of election fund. “It is being seen for the first time that election fund is being collected for getting the bills approved. When SAD-Bahujan Samaj Party government comes to power, we will take action against such corrupt officials. Even e- tendering system is being misused for the political interests. The entire system of MC is corrupt, once we come back to power we will bring back transparency,” he said. Refuting the allegations, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said he had already clarified that contractors were indulging in such practices at the behest of Akali leaders just to defame the ruling party. “If anyone has proof against any officer who took commission, he should bring it to me and I will take strict action. As far as development works are concerned these will not stop,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/residents-to-suffer-with-refusal-to-work-by-contractors-dhillon/articleshow/85670032.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The local administrations have received a letter from the government asking them to ensure all these beneficiaries complete both their doses as soon as possible.Officials said the move indicates the government is probably planning to unlock formal schooling at all levels in view of the easing Covid situation. The move is to ensure teachers are protected, and also don’t infect students.Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the government has assured of special doses for separately vaccinating teachers and their relatives. “There is no deadline but we have started preparing a list of teachers still left out of vaccination drives. We can hold special camps at different locations or we can block certain centres from the over 150 currently operational for teachers. The duration for both doses remains 84 days for Covishield and four weeks for Covaxin,” he said.Zilla parishad CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar said, “We have asked the education department to identify the unvaccinated teachers and their relatives as per government’s instructions. We have received good number of stock. Many teachers may have already been vaccinated at personal level. We have been asked to complete their vaccination as soon as possible. The camps would be at village level. Schools and gram pancyahat bhavans would be used. As per need, location would be decided.”Some time back, the government had revised the workplace policy and included family members in the eligible beneficiaries list for vaccination.Zafar Khan, president, School Headmaster Charitable Association, said many have already taken the doses. “Still, it is a good move to hold a special drive for the teachers. Those remaining will be covered in the drive. It will be good for teachers and students. Parents too will be confident if they know that all teachers are fully vaccinated as well as their family members. Std I to XII students are all under 18 years of age and not eligible for vaccination now. So this is the only way to prevent spread of infection either way,” he said.Khan added that for some days in the beginning, teachers were identified as FLWs but due to lack of doses it was discontinued. “Yet teachers queued up and took their doses as a common man. Some were reluctant too. Now they are confident and not fearful of taking vaccination. The ultimate purpose of the drive should be to reopen schools completely,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/spl-vax-drive-for-school-teachers-non-teaching-staff-their-relatives/articleshow/85667675.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The mill has a capacity to crush 5,000 tonnes of sugarcane per day. A state government spokesperson said on Thursday that the unit will be set up under the ethanol blending programme of the central government. It will be the first plant in UP to produce ethanol directly from sugarcane juice. The Munderwa sugar mill in Basti was also re-started by the state government after coming to power in 2017. The British era mill had been closed by the previous state governments, the spokesperson said. Three other sugar mills shut during previous regimes were also revived by the Yogi government and the state now ranks first in sugar production in the country. Ethanol plants have been set up in Sathiaon and Najibabad mills, which are in the cooperative sector. The government also increased the crushing capacity of Ramala sugar mill in Baghpat from 2,750 TCD to 5,000 TCD and of Mohiuddinpur mill in Meerut from 2,500 TCD to 3,500 TCD. Keeping in view the increase in sugarcane cultivation, the crushing capacity of 11 private sector sugar mills has also been increased by 20,600 TCD.

As per records available with UP Police, around 1,500 FIRs were lodged against farmers in 38 districts. Of these, the chargesheet was filed in 868 cases while the remaining were either closed with a final report for absence of evidence or expunged for one reason or the other. In all, over 2,500 farmers were named as accused. Maximum 165 cases are from Kheri where chargesheets have been filed. Last year, the Supreme Court had directed all the district police chiefs to coordinate with other departments to curb stubble burning which was leading to air pollution. Another officer in the home department said apart from withdrawal of cases, the decision on refund of fine, running into several crores of rupees, will also be considered. A senior police officer said that these cases are usually registered under the sections of not obeying an order passed by a public servant along with Indian Penal Code sections like making atmosphere noxious to health, negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter and also National Green Tribunal sections. All these are non-cognisable offences which have mostly fine and imprisonment of very less duration. A farmer leader, who wished not to be named, said the move will bring relief to the farmers. Last year when cases of stubble burning were not stopping, the government had also instructed the local police outpost incharges to spread awareness among farmers for not burning stubble.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/stubble-burning-up-selects-868-cases-for-withdrawal/articleshow/85672093.cms||---

The state has administered over 5.5 crore doses, of which the Centre has provided 4.5 crore and the government has procured 25.1 lakh doses. Districts with a higher concentration of private hospitals have seen more paid vaccinations, the state’s weekly bulletin showed. Mumbai’s private sector has administered the highest, 33.2 lakh doses accounting for 44% of shots in the city (see box). But BMC’s update on Thursday pegged private vaccination at 38.6 lakh doses. The state also released the data on vaccines allocated to districts. While districts with higher populations have evidently got most doses according to the Centre’s formula, there were several who didn’t get vaccines commensurate with their population. At least 17 districts were allocated fewer doses than their population ratio. An official said certain districts have got marginally lesser doses as places with higher transmission had to be prioritised at several stages in the last eight months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-pvt-sector-delivered-78-5l-shots-city-got-max-jabs-vax-allocation/articleshow/85670082.cms||---

Some of the hospitals were left with second doses, which were reserved for their own patrons, while others kept it open for all.Unlike Covaxin and Covishield, Sputnik V shots come in pair and the beneficiaries are advised to take it from the same centre. Centres also observed a drop in demand as compared to what it was a month ago.Dr Tushar Gawad, director (administration), Alexis Multispeciality Hospital, said they are giving only second dose of Sputnik V and Covishield (both doses) as of now. “DRL had communicated non-availability of second dose of Sputnik V due to which they have refused to dispatch even the first dose which is available with them. As a result, people who want to take first dose of Sputnik V are being inconvenienced. DRL is non-committal with regards to timelines for availability of second dose,” he said.Dr Shravan Kumar Enumula, facility director at Amercian Oncology Institute, said as per the letter from DRL, they have been assured of supply by first week of September. “Second dose is available and open to any eligible beneficiary who may have taken it at other place too. Since people would be needing vaccination certificate for small things like entry into a shop, they are more willing to get vaccinated. We never made it mandatory for any beneficiary to get second dose at our centre only by taking any deposit. Yet, when people get excellent service, they come back,” he said.Abhinandan, centre head, Wockhardt Hospitals, said the demand for Sputnik V has dropped drastically. “We are getting only a few queries. But it doesn’t give confidence that all doses would be utilized. We are left with 100 doses from the first batch of 1,200 and as many second doses. We are taking requests based on that we may plan for another lot of 1,200 doses. But the mad rush for Sputnik V is not observed now,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/district-runs-out-of-sputnik-doses-demand-too-drops/articleshow/85667682.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Most of the visitors come to sight tigers and leopards in the open but sightings were rare for the last 15-20 days. “Last week, I visited the park with my family, but we were disappointed as no animals were sighted due to undergrowth,” said Manoj Sawalkar from Wadi.Divisional manager Pramod Panchbhai said that there is huge undergrowth of rantulas, called wild basil, and also tall grass up to 5 feet which are depriving sightings of tigers and leopards. “There were several complaints from visitors. Hence, we decided to clear vegetation,” he said.The Indian Safari is spread in 115 hectares. It is divided into four segments, overall covering a 12km route. It starts with leopard safari and ends with tiger safari. There are seven leopards (2 male and 5 female), two tigers (Lee and Rajkumar), six sloth bears, 14 nilgais, and four chitals.Panchbhai said that daily over 400 tourists are visiting the park, generating a revenue of over Rs1 lakh.

TDP legislator Velagapudi Ramakrishna and one K Hima Bindu filed two separate PILs on two different grounds challenging certain sections of APSDC and raising of loans. Arguing on behalf of Ramakrishna, senior counsel Basava Prabhu Patil said certain section 12(1), 12(4) and 12(5) of APSDC Act are in violation of articles 21, 204 and 266 of the Constitution. He sought time to place additional material on record which they have collected after filing of the petition. On the other hand, B Nalin Kumar, the counsel for Hima Bindu argued that the APSDC is illegally raising loans in violation of RBI Act, Companies Act besides violating constitutional provisions. He sought the bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya to hear the matter separately. Arguing on behalf of the state government, senior counsel Dushyant Dave said that the petitions have been filed just to embarrass the government without any basis. He said the primary contention raised in Ramakrishna’s PIL has been answered in the counter affidavit clarifying that the tax revenues are not being directly deposited in the escrow account. He said the tax amount collected is going to consolidated fund and from there the government is allotting funds to APSDC. The second petition was not maintainable and liable to be dismissed for delay in filing the same, he said. Dave cited the Supreme Court judgement in Narmada Bachavo Andolan that the petitions cannot be filed on the same issue raising different grounds after six months of issuing GOs. . Considering the arguments on all sides, the high court posted the matter for further hearing on September 7. The high court added that no extension will be given after September 7.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/pils-against-apsdc-hearing-on-sept-7/articleshow/85667729.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Mumbai||Kripashankar Singh appointed BJP Maharashtra vice-president||MUMBAI: Though union minister Narayan Rane’s Jan Ashirward Yatra was disrupted due to his arrest, the BJP is pushing forward with its plans for the BMC polls. It has appointed former Congressman Kripashankar Singh as its state vice-president. Singh is expected to be BJP’s face to woo the North Indian community in Mumbai. The BJP on Wednesday also appointed Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha’s (BJYM) former IT cell functionary Devang Dave on its election managment panel for local body polls in Maharashtra. Dave is one of the backroom operators of the BJP youth wing’s IT cell and is known for his social media outreach skills. “Thank you Devendra Fadnavis, Chandrakant Dada Patil for believing in my abilities (and) entrusting important responsibility of election management for BJP Maharashtra…I shall strive hard to win elections from panchayat to parliament and bring back BJP in Maharashtra,” Dave tweeted. Political observers said that with Rane and Singh on board, the BJP will look to give its campaign a targeted push. “The elevation of Narayan Rane as BJP’s face for the BMC and induction of Singh will surely have an impact on the BMC elections. Both these netas are being deployed by the BJP. However, BJP will have to tactfully ensure its own bench strength is utilised. It will have to get the insiders and outsiders together and strike a balance. If this is not done, there will be infighting and the party may face a rebellion,” said political analyst Birju Mundra. Singh, a face of the North Indian community, is known for his networking among voters from UP and Bihar. According to estimates, there are 45 seats where North Indian voters can be the swing factor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-kripashankar-appointed-bjp-state-vice-president/articleshow/85672143.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Thereafter, the owner of the vehicle must be cautious in safeguarding the interest of driver, passengers, third parties and himself/herself, so as to avoid unnecessary liability being foisted on the owner of the vehicle,” said Justice S Vaidyanathan. Rebuking the practice of third-party insurance which covers only others and not the occupants of the vehicle concerned, Justice Vaidyanathan said: “When a buyer is ready to pay a huge amount for purchase of a vehicle, it is really shocking as to why he is not interested in spending a paltry sum to take a policy to safeguard himself/herself and others…“It is saddening to point out that when a vehicle is sold, the buyer is not clearly informed about the terms of policy and its importance. Similarly, at the time of buying the vehicle, the buyer is also not interested in thoroughly understanding the terms and conditions of the policy. They are more concerned about the vehicle’s performance and not about the policy.” HC sets aside Rs 14L awarded by tribunal The court was passing the orders after setting aside Rs 14.65 lakh awarded by a motor accident tribunal to the family of a road accident victim. However, citing policy violations and availability of only third-party insurance with the vehicle owner, the New India Assurance Co Ltd challenged the award. The vehicle involved in the accident was covered with only a ‘third-party’ insurance (covers injuries/damages caused to third party and not the occupants of the vehicle or damages caused to the vehicle). It is very clear that it is a Private Car Liability Policy, wherein the third party premium has been paid as Rs 5,081 and not even a paisa had been paid as premium for the other passengers, who are going to travel in the vehicle, it said. Acceding to the submissions, Justice Vaidyanathan set aside the award entirely, giving liberty to the victim’s family to move fresh applications to claim the amount from the vehicle owner who too was travelling in the vehicle on its way to a picnic spot, Hoganekkal, in August 2016.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-5-year-bumper-to-bumper-insurance-must-for-all-vehicles/articleshow/85670104.cms||Suresh Kumar

It culminated into a public meeting that was addressed by SP national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav. The Yatra is being seen as a part of SP’s strategy to reach out to caste sub sets, particularly non-Yadav OBCs. Addressing the gathering, Ram Gopal Yadav attacked the Modi government for the national monetisation plan under which it plans to monetise government assets to fetch an estimated Rs 6 lakh crore. He attacked the UP government over the deteriorating crime scene in the state. “Under the BJP government, everything has a price tag: from phone lines to roads and railways. All government assets are being sold. The time is not far when all public assets will be in the hands of a select group of four to five individuals,” he said. Ram Gopal said in UP people are canecharged for demanding justice and raising their voice for their rights. Appreciating the efforts of Mahan Dal, Ram Gopal said its president Keshav Dev Maruya has given the call ‘Mahan Dal ne thana hai, Akhilesh Sarkar banana hai’ (Mahan Dal will ensure that Akhilesh government comes to power) and the response of the Janakrosh Yatra has confirmed that we all are heading in the right direction. Maurya said his party’s association with SP was not opportunity based but for a bigger cause which is to safeguard the honour of the Dalits, backwards, poor and the deprived.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/everything-has-a-price-tag-under-bjp-ram-gopal-yadav/articleshow/85672134.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The civic body is yet to start the processing plant at Tajpur Road where 1,100 tonne of garbage is being piled up daily. The authorities though claimed to install waste to energy plant at municipal corporation (MC) main garbage dump, as of now it is at planning stage and project report is being finalised. Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) had earlier slapped environment compensation worth Rs 1.8 crore on MC for its failure in ensuring 100% source segregation and door-to-door garbage lifting. In January 2020, the National Green Tribunal Monitoring committee had passed orders to impose penalties on the civic bodies for their failure in managing the solid waste. Similar types of penalties were imposed for not treating the legacy waste. The teams of officials made several visits at main garbage dump at Tajpur Road, but did not feel satisfied over the arrangements being made by the civic body for the treatment of solid waste. The penalty was imposed for July 2020 to March 2021. When contacted, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “We are working and soon there will be processing of garbage at the main dump. As far as penalty is concerned, we are making an appeal with PPCB chairman to give a chance to clear things. Once we will keep our side in front of chairman we will be able to make him understand that it was due to Covid-19 cases started rising we could not do anything about garbage.” Processing plant non functional since February 4 After the MC had terminated the A2Z waste management and company stopped work on February 4, the plant also stopped working. The NGT panel members had declared the underground water up to 2 km of areas from Tajpur Road garbage dump unfit for consumption. The fire incidents have also been taking place on regular basis at garbage dump and heaps of garbage have been lying there awaiting treatment. The MC officials and many councillors were sent on several trips to other cities to study successful solid waste management. The officials suggested the waste to energy model as the best available option. However, it is yet to be seen whether it will be implemented or not. Tenders done for settling legacy waste The MC was also supposed to settle legacy waste lying at dump through bioremediation and in this regard the civic officials are going to tackle some part of legacy waste at the cost of Rs 5 lakh through smart city mission and tenders are already finalised for the purpose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/mc-yet-to-finalise-plans-for-solid-waste-management/articleshow/85670123.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Strict rules put snake rescuers in a spot||RAJKOT: Spotted a snake in your backyard? You have two options — either let it slither away or you stay well out of its reach as rescue operation now may take more time than earlier. Thanks to the forest department, its new guidelines issued on March 30 this year for snake catching is restraining volunteers from doing their work. In fact, the department’s intention to save the snakes has only bitten the volunteers as well as general people. There are around 2,000 volunteers engaged in these activities all over the state and many of them are part of NGOs. In any such situation earlier, whenever a call goes to an NGO, the volunteers rush to the spot and successfully rescue the reptile within minimum time so as to avoid confrontation with human or cause harm to its own safety. However, the new guidelines mandate that calls will have to go through the taluka forest wildlife warden, who will send a bona fide rescuer to do the job, thus taking a lot of time in the process and endangering lives. According to the new rules, volunteers will have to register first, their names will be scrutinized by the respective circles of forest department and thereafter undergo a 15-day training by GEER foundation before they get a photo ID card which they will have to carry in rescue operations. They will also need to have a life insurance cover of Rs 10 lakh. Sources said the execution of these new guideline is very slow, and that except in Ahmedabad, no training has been started anywhere. Again, even if the forest department starts training in all the districts immediately, it will take a minimum of over a year to train all the people. Snakes are found around human habitation in areas like Jamnagar, Porbandar, Junagadh, Amreli, Bhavnagar and in most parts of south Gujarat. Of the snakes that get rescued, 40 percent are poisonous, rescuers claim. Cobra, Indian krait, Russell’s viper, bamboo pit viper are some of the venomous species found commonly in Gujarat. For the past three decades and more, Lakhota Nature Club in Jamnagar has been engaged in rescuing snakes and its team of 42 rescuers save around 300 snakes in a month. These activities are done in coordination with the forest department and the NGO also provides the rescue data to the department every year. However, recently the NGO gave an advertisement in a local newspaper stating that rescue work of snakes have been stopped owing to the new guidelines of the government. “If any of our (NGO’s) members is found doing this work, it will be considered an activity going against the organization and their membership may be cancelled,” the ad stated. It also furnished an address of a local forest office for the general public to contact in case of need. Earlier, the NGO had a WhatsApp group where people could place a call and get help within minutes. President Suresh Bhatt tld TOI, “We did this to avoid any controversy and clash with new guidelines. We want the forest department to execute this guideline immediately and start training rescuers as soon as possible.” “It’s not possible for the forest department to attend to every call and rescue snakes. General public calls us, not the forest department,” said Vikram Gadhvi, founder of Gujarat snake conservation society. “If a person has to inform the department first and it will then inform us, the entire procedure will consume precious time which will increase possibility of a snakebite or the reptile being killed out of panic,” explained Gadhvi, adding that many individual rescuers are still doing the risky job despite the guidelines. These wildlife lovers are doing this to save the reptiles from harm even at the risk of being prosecuted while waiting to get authorisation, he stated. Gadhvi also sent a letter to the chief minister last year demanding compensation for family members of rescuers in case of death from snakebite and also for providing free government treatment for volunteers who get injured in such rescue operations. “The government, without asking me, made a wrong interpretation of my suggestions. They (authorities) have made the Rs 10 lakh life insurance cover mandatory for rescuers. Volunteers put their lives into risk and no insurance company has policy to cover such risks,” Gadhvi added. Talking to TOI, principal chief conservator of forest, Shyamal Tikadar, said, “There are certain confusions with the guidelines. We will work it out.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/strict-rules-put-snake-rescuers-in-a-spot/articleshow/85667844.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The court said that for 49 years they were residing together and there was nothing on record to show that during that time any report had been lodged against Nensey alleging cruelty. The woman had accused him of illegally giving her talaaq. His wife also alleged that Amir had abused and humiliated her by calling a woman at their bungalow at Royal Palms in Goregaon. “It appears from the report, that there is a property and business dispute between the applicant (Amir), informant (wife) and their children. In such circumstances, relations between the applicant and informant are strained,” the court said. The court said considering the nature of allegations, his custody was not warranted. “He is also not having any criminal antecedent. Nothing has also to be recovered from him. The prosecution has not disclosed substantial grounds requiring custody of the applicant,” the court said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bizman-gets-pre-arrest-bail-in-caseof-cruelty/articleshow/85670197.cms||---

His family included two children, wife and parents. On September 14, 2016, Satyanarayana died of electrocution after he came in contact with a live electric wire lying on the ground near the house of Duppada Rama Murthy in the same area.  Blaming the EPDCL for the death of Satyanarayana, his family approached the consumer disputes redressal forum seeking a compensation of Rs 10 lakh. However, the EPDCL claimed there was no negligence on their part. The company said there was heavy rain accompanied by strong gales on the fateful day. Satyanarayana grabbed the snapped wire without any safety precautions , the company added. District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum held that the company was responsible for the death of Satyanarayana. Challenging the order, EPDCL filed an appeal with AP State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. Commission president Justice T Sunil Chowdary and member P Mutyala Naidu said there was negligence on the part of EPDCL which resulted in the death. The appeal was later dismissed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/discom-ordered-to-pay-rs-6-88l-relief/articleshow/85667822.cms||Nalla.Babu

The authorities have decided to cover maximum people with at least one dose of vaccine. In addition to the 10 permanent vaccination centres in the city, special centres have been identified for the purpose. “Vaccination is the only way to protect ourselves from Covid-19. Many people are still reluctant to take vaccine. It is high time everyone took the jab to protect themselves and their family from Covid-19.

These elections all fall due early next year. The issue was discussed in the state cabinet on Thursday and it was decided that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar, along with health officials and the Covid task force, would meet the SEC about the severe Covid third wave that has been forecast. “We will hold a discussion with them and present to them the predictions regarding the third wave. Since they are an autonomous body, we will express our recommendation seeking postponement of these elections and the final decision will be with the commission,” said health minister Rajesh Tope. Officials said the state government also wants to put off the polls till the Supreme Court decision on OBC reservation in local bodies is given. The state has appointed a commission to prepare the data that will be required in court. Tope pointed out if elections are announced, it would be difficult to control ensuing activities, like campaigning. “We are approaching the issue suspecting that a third wave will come for sure and, with it (a high) rate of infection and risk of fatalities. The cabinet was of the opinion that the elections should be postponed,” said Tope. The minister said elections to co-operative bodies like banks, etc have been scheduled, and even those will have to be reviewed. On Wednesday, the SEC had issued a notification asking the 18 municipal corporations to begin the delimitation exercise. In June, the state government had urged the state poll panel to postpone byelections to five zilla parishads and 33 panchayat samiti elections, citing the risk of the third wave. Tope said the cabinet also reviewed the Covid situation in the state and as per the projections by the Centre, it is expected there will be 60 lakh cases in the state in the third wave and nearly 12% of those will need oxygen.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-citing-covid-state-to-suggest-sec-puts-off-18-civic-elections/articleshow/85670183.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Hubballi||Failure of the administration led to high fatality in Haveri dist: Report||Haveri: Three experts, who conducted an audit of deaths due to Covid-19 in Haveri, have mentioned that the failure on part of the administration to tackle the situation resulted in a sharp rise in the number of deaths during the second wave in the district. Haveri district has recorded 2.9% fatality rate, topping the state in Covid fatality rate cumulatively. The expert committee was constituted by KV Trilok Chandra, commissioner, health and family welfare department, consisting of Dr Basavaraj Kallapur and Dr Ishwar Hasbi from KIMS, Hubballi, and Dr Sampath Singh Rangawale, senior specialist. The committee reported that the administration has violated the protocols while treating Covid-19 patients during the second wave and also failed to use ventilators to save lives.The report states that identification, early detection, and tracing of primary and secondary contacts are very poor in Haveri district. Triage and shifting teams have not worked effectively and they didn’t shift patients to the CCC or DCH on time. This led to the death of many patients in home isolation. Shortage of OT, ICU and lab technicians, staff nurses, and service engineers are some of the causes that led to the high fatality rate. Reacting to the report, Congress MLC Srinivas Mane said, “The district administration’s effective work to curb pandemic remained on papers only. The government should know why the second wave of Covid-19 was so fatal.” Govt will act: Member“We have completed our responsibility by submitting the detailed report. We have mentioned the causes of high fatality rate. The government will decide to initiate action against the authorities who violated protocols,” said Dr Sampath Sing Rangawale, senior specialist and member of the expert committee.Highlights of the report* 12 hours duty for doctors and staff, wearing PPE kits in Covid wards, was quite hectic* Blood sugar monitoring was not done as per protocol* Syndromic case management for SARI patients was not effectively done* Master Covid-19 register was not maintained* The follow-up of patient routine rounds in ICU or Covid wards was not properly done* Covid treatment guidelines not followed, CT scan not followed as per protocol* In some taluks, there was delaye in swab collection of ILI/SARI patients and primary contacts||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/failure-of-the-administration-led-to-high-fatality-in-haveri-dist-report/articleshow/85665033.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

The reasons mainly point to one overreaching cause — that of the connection between the delinquent of cyberbullying and the victim. In many cases, these criminals are found to be either close relatives, friend or any known person and therefore, to avoid social stigma, victims prefer not to lodge FIRs. Every month, of around 20-odd cybercrime complaints, the cell has to handle 10 such cases. “It takes police over a month’s time to trace the offender as we have to gather details from several social media and internet service providers. We have to analyse a huge amount of data to reach the criminal but due to the unwillingness of the victim at the fag end of the process, we have no option but to let them go,” an officer told TOI. Following such repeated incidents, police are now suggesting prevention as the key to stop cyberbullying and asking people to adopt responsible cyber behaviour for personal protection. Take this case of a 33-year-old bank official who approached the cybercrime cell after she failed to convince an online harasser to stop posting her morphed images. The complainant told the police that all her requests through online messages to the person fell on deaf ears and she was forced to approach cops and submit a written complaint. Based on preliminary questioning, police suspected it to be the handiwork of a jilted lover or an insider who had complainant’s private photos and she too cast her aspersions but was unsure. After much digging, cops finally traced it to be her one-time female best friend who was unhappy that her got engaged. In a bid to break the new relationship, the offender started sharing the officer’s images after their friendship had been broken over some tussle a few months ago. But, when she was produced in the police station, the complainant refused to lodge an FIR. “In almost 50 percent of cyber bullying cases the complainant refuses to lodge a complaint after the culprit is identified,” an officer in the cybercrime cell said, explaining that the difficulty mostly arises as in most of the cases, the offender is a known or a close person. “It is true that to avoid social stigma the victims avoid registering FIR and also because the offender is a known person,” said cyber law expert, Snehal Vakilna, adding that ideally the complainant should take a logical stand and lodge an FIR to stop further harassment with others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/victims-volte-face-leave-cyber-cops-high-and-dry/articleshow/85667899.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The disgruntled residents have decided to boycott the elections to the HDMC Council to protest the neglect of their locality by parties cutting across the political spectrum. The residents have also put up posters and erected boards, informing candidates of all parties not to enter their homes seeking support.Prabhu Mundagod, a resident of Rajadhani Colony, told TOI, “Our ward comprises three big colonies, one of which is ours. But our locality has witnessed no development for many years now. Our ward is facing a multitude of problems, and despite being one of the more posh areas, lacks basic amenities.”No streetlightsMundagod said that lack of proper roads connecting the ward to other parts of Hubballi-Dharwad was the primary problem. The number of streetlights was inadequate, which resulted in swathes of the locality remaining in darkness for the better part of the evening. “There is much fear among the people owing to the lack of streetlights; women, in particular, are afraid to step out of their homes. Incidents of eve-teasing have been reported in the ward as well. Waterlogging is a common problem in the ward owing to the lack of a systematic drainage network,” Mundagod said.Residents have repeatedly appealed to HDMC officials, and submitted a memorandum to the local corporator and even the MLA, but to no avail. Nearly 500 voters in the locality have decided unanimously against exercising their franchise in the forthcoming election to the HDMC Council, to express their anger with the elected representatives.Residents of the ward complained that elected representatives seldom turned up in their locality after the election.Resident of Malangouda Chawal in ward 35 Abdul Kazar said that their colony was also facing similar problems. “The main road in the locality is in a very poor condition. The road is unfit for commute, and even ambulances struggle to travel on the road. Our repeated pleas to fix the damaged road have not yielded desired results. So, we have decided to boycott the elections this time,” Kazar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/residents-to-boycott-polls-to-protest-politicians-apathy/articleshow/85665068.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Cops hospitalize two Mumbai residents after receiving SOS calls to control room from Mumbai||KOLKATA: The Kolkata police has come to the rescue of a 75-year-old woman and her 46-year-old son - both residents from Mumbai - after the latter suffered multiple neurotic attacks while trying to return home after visiting relatives at Burdwan on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan. Police said the mother-son duo - Saroj Malik and Amit Malik, a person suffering from neuro-related complications - was to board a train to Mumbai on Wednesday from Howrah Station and had reached the city early morning for this purpose. They decided to visit Victoria Memorial and the Iskon Temple in Albert Road as they had time. "While on the Albert Road, Amit received a severe attack," said an officer from Lalbazar. A panicky Saroj, comparatively new to the city, turned to her relative in Mumbai whom she called and sought help. This relative - Sonali Kochar - searched the KP Control room number and called them for help. "We received the call at our control around 4:30 pm. Kochar, was at the other end, and anxiously she informed us that Amit needed medical help and that his mother was 75-year-old making it impossible for her to seek help all by herself. Kochar informed us that the duo were somewhere on Albert Road. Immediately, the photographs of the two persons and contact number of Saroj was obtained from Sonali and this was relayed to the officer in charge of Shakespeare Sarani police - inspector Joy surjo Mukherjee. Within a few minutes, sergeant Sandip Roy of Shakespeare Sarani police station reached the Iskon Temple to try and offer help," said a senior officer. It was learnt that the mother and son had gone to the house of Saroj's elder brother at Burdwan for the occasion of Raksha Bandhan. But due to Amit's neurotic attack they were forced to miss the train. "It was also learnt that they were looking for an accommodation and had decided to approach a Gurudwara in south Kolkata or the Iskon Temple at Albert Road. However, Amit had again suffered an attack yet again and they were stuck on the road," said an officer from Shakespeare Sarani police station. Sergeant Roy arranged for an ambulance and initially shifted them to the emergency ward of SSKM Hospital and then to the Psychiatric department of Bangur Institute of Neuro Sciences. "After initial treatment, Saroj requested us to get her son removed to a private hospital at Kaikhali under a particular doctor who had treated her son earlier. All arrangements were, thus, made accordingly by Shakespear Sarani police station and Amit was shifted to the private hospital at Kaikhali. Assistant sub Inspector Barun Mukherjee of Shakespeare Sarani police station accompanied them. Malik is under treatment and the doctor confirmed that Amit's condition is stable. Later, we also ensured that the relieved mother, Saroj, was accommodated at one of her relative's residence in Lake Town for the time being," said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cops-hospitalize-two-mumbai-residents-after-receiving-sos-calls-to-control-room-from-mumbai/articleshow/85667940.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Lucknow||Chargesheet against Dr Kafeel set aside by Allahabad high court||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Thursday set aside the chargesheet and its cognizance order passed against Dr Kafeel Khan by chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Aligarh in a criminal case alleging that Dr Khan had delivered an inflammatory speech during protest against CAA/NRC at Aligarh Muslim University in 2019, reports Rajesh Kumar Pandey. The court set aside the chargesheet and its cognizance order, observing that before filing the chargesheet, the police authorities concerned had not taken the requisite sanction from the Centre or the state government or the DM under section 196 (a) of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) as required in such cases (inflammatory speech offences). However, while giving this judgment, Justice Gautam Chaudhari made it clear that the chargesheet and its cognizance order may be taken up by the court after the mandatory sanction granted under section 196 (a) of CrPC from the Centre or the state government or the district magistrate. According to section 196 (a) of CrPC, no court shall take cognizance of any offence under section 153A of IPC except with the previous sanction of the Centre or the state government or the district magistrate. Earlier, an FIR was lodged against Dr Khan in this connection under section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 505 (2) (statement creating or promoting, enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) and 109 (abetment of offence) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) after his speech at the AMU on December 12, 2019 during the anti-CAA protest. Consequently, he was arrested and sent to jail. Later, the police submitted the chargesheet before an Aligarh court on March 16, 2020. The CJM, Aligarh took its cognizance on July 28, 2020. Hence, the present petition was filed by Dr Khan challenging it. At another stage, he was booked under National Security Act (NSA) in this connection, which was later set aside by the high court. Dr Khan, a paediatrician of BRD Medical College of Gorakhpur, was earlier suspended from service on August 22, 2017, following the death of about 60 infants in the BRD Medical College hospital due to lack of oxygen. Dr Khan has challenged his suspension before the high court which is hearing the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/chargesheet-against-dr-kafeel-set-aside-by-hc/articleshow/85672236.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Cabinet gives ex-post facto approval for jobs to 104 dead farmers kin||Chandigarh: The Punjab cabinet on Thursday gave ex-post facto approval for jobs to 104 legal heirs of farmers and farm labourers who have died during the ongoing agitation against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws. Chief minister Amarinder Singh has directed the departments concerned to give any further relaxations needed to ensure that the next of kin of all such deceased protesters are provided employment. He said he wanted the family members of all Punjab farmers sacrificing their lives during the agiation against the “draconian laws” to be accommodated in government jobs. The cabinet earlier authorised the chief minister to make any further changes in rules, while approving relaxations to candidates who were not covered under the Punjab government policy dated November 21, 2002, relating to compassionate appointments. The said policy is applicable to government employees and those persons who have died fighting for the security of the nation. The cases of legal heirs of farmers/farm labourers who have died during the farmers’ agitation against the farm laws were not covered by the policy, necessitating approval/relaxation. With the cabinet decision, the deceased farmers’/labourers’ mother, father, married brother, married sister, married daughter, daughter-in-law, grandson, granddaughter, next of kin (NoK) etc., as recommended by the DC concerned, would be eligible for employment as a one-time measure. A committee was earlier constituted under the chairmanship of principal secretary personnel, on the chief minister’s orders, to consider the issue. On July 26, 2021, the committee had considered the cases of 104 candidates and recommended employment to those found eligible. In this regard, a letter has been issued by the revenue department. An official spokesperson said that a number of farmers/farm workers have lost their lives while protesting in the inclement weather conditions on roads and under the open sky. Taking note of problems/hardships faced by farmers/farm workers, the Punjab government has already provided ex gratia/financial aid of Rs 5 lakh to the families of farmers/farm workers who have died during the agitation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/cabinet-gives-ex-post-facto-approval-for-jobs-to-104-dead-farmers-kin/articleshow/85670187.cms||---
---||Dehradun||40 ex-Armymen rescued from Kabul||Dehradun: Dodging bullets and trudging through the shadows while teenage boys brandished arms, 40 former Army personnel from Uttarakhand and Darjeeling have made it back home from Kabul in Afghanistan after a week-long journey. “A weapon is a weapon, we learnt in the Army. The smallest error can kill. We saw these huge guns in the hands of young boys, barely 15-16. They were firing in the air,” said Nitesh Kshetri, 47, who retired from the Indian Army as a havildar in 2011 and went to work in Afghanistan as a security personnel with the Danish Embassy the following year. “We hid behind a wall of cement bags outside the airport until they stop firing.” This was on August 18, the day the group of ex-servicemen who worked at various embassies reached the airport after a four-day march. They had started on August 15. “India was celebrating the day it got independence and we were worried if we would lose ours,” said Sachin Bisht, 39, from Dehradun. Bisht had retired from the Army in 2018 and was also working at the Italian Embassy since 2019. “It was the last time I ate well, had a bath. The week that followed was mayhem.” It was also the day Kabul fell to the Taliban. When they started walking towards the airport with hopes of getting out, they saw the streets were brimming with Taliban fighters. “We decided to hide at the Danish Embassy,” Bisht said. It would be a long wait. After three days, they started walking again. It was August 18 and flights had resumed at the Kabul international airport. “We walked for what seemed like endless hours at night. We were thirsty, hungry and could not even stop to relieve ourselves. It was raining fire all around us,” said Kshetri. But reaching the airport, they later realised, was just part of the problem. “There were lakhs around the airport that day,” Kshetri said. And their group would not be let inside. “There were Talibs outside the airport who would not let us go inside,” said Bisht. That was when the young boys started firing, Kshetri added. For eight hours, they waited outside the airport. Finally, a senior Indian official at the airport spotted them. “He helped us,” said Bisht. Around 4pm that day, the former Army men were sent off in two batches to India, one via Qatar and another through Tajikistan. The first reached India on August 22 and the second on August 23. “A lot of former Army personnel join security services in Afghanistan. The network helped us keep track of what was happening,” said Kamal Thapa, 50, from Dehradun. “We will never go back to Afghanistan. We got a second lease on life. We pray for those struggling to be evacuated.” Thapa had retired from the Army a decade ago and has been working as a security guard for a UK-based company in Kabul since 2019.

With this, the total average increase in salary/pension per employee has gone up to Rs 1.05 lakh per annum, from the earlier Rs 79,250 per annum that they were getting following the government’s decision to accept the recommendations of the 6th Pay Commission with effect from July 1, 2021, which had earlier led to a Rs 4700 crore bonanza for the employees, said an official spokesperson. The decision on further hike was taken at the cabinet meeting. Chief minister Amarinder Singh directed all ministers, administrative secretaries and heads of departments to talk to their respective employees for early redressal of their grievances. While all reasonable demands of employees should be resolved following today’s announcements, he made it clear that strict action should be taken, as per rules, if employees continue to agitate. The chief minister appreciated the efforts of cabinet minister Brahm Mohindra and others in resolving the grievances of 2.85 lakh employees and 3.07 lakh pensioners, who will benefit from today’s decisions. The move will cost the government exchequer a total salary/pension bill of Rs 42,673 crore per annum. Amarinder pointed out that all operational allowances have not only been retained but also doubled in absolute terms over what they were being paid earlier, with the cabinet decision to restore common allowances, such as Fixed Medical Allowance, Mobile Allowance, Conveyance Allowance and City Compensatory Allowance, at the revised rates (2.59 X 0.8), with effect from July 2021. The decisions taken by the cabinet are based on the recommendations of the committee of the group of ministers to consider the demands of various categories of employees. Other decisions >> Treat Non-Practicing Allowance admissible to doctors at the rate of 20% of revised basic pay as pay, with Secretariat Pay for Employees (Working in Punjab Civil Secretariat) to be doubled with effect from July 2021 and also to be treated as pay >> Employees covered under National Pension Scheme have now given cover under family pension in case of death-in-harness, with the adoption of Family Pension guidelines dated May 5, 2009, and subsequent linked instructions dated September 4, 2019, with suitable state government modifications in respect of employees covered under New Pension Scheme as applicable to similarly placed employees in Government of India, as per the provisions under the Punjab Civil Services Rules- Volume II >>Service rendered during the probation period shall be counted for the purpose of ACP, as already being done by the department of general administration||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/rs-1500cr-bonanza-for-punjab-govt-employees/articleshow/85670233.cms||---

No. 53, 54, issued on August 24. Commission chairman Justice R Kantha Rao told reporters here on Thursday that the new fee structure would be applicable for three academic years. “Every school should notify the fee structure and get it approved by the government. But school managements have never implemented this norm in the last ten years but have resorted to exorbitant fee hike. Some private schools continue to function without basic infrastructure. This government has decided to control the fees and provide students belonging to poor and middle class families with quality education,” Kantha Rao said. Around 80 per cent of schools are collecting reasonable fees. Rest of the schools should reduce it immediately, he added. School managements can raise objections on the fee structure on helpline number 9150381111. He said parents could also raise complaints with the commission if any school collected extra fee. Commission secretary Aluru Sambasiva Reddy said, “While we are trying to improve the quality of education, corporate schools and college managements are trying to hamper our functioning. They are creating legal issues and trying to escape from implementing the recommendations of the commission.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/pvt-schools-told-to-follow-govt-fee-norm/articleshow/85667948.cms||Venu Lanka

They are free to lodge a complaint, we are not scared of shallow complaints. Ever since the MVA government took charge in the state in November 2019, BJP has been filing false complaints against MVA cabinet members and leaders. We feel that the CBI is not the forum for such complaints. If the BJP is serious, it must lodge a complaint with the competent authority,” Malik told TOI. Malik defended Parab, saying that as guardian minister of Ratnagiri, it is well within his jurisdiction to secure information on the law and order situation in the district, particularly after law-enforcing agencies registered a criminal case against Rane. “Why such a hue and cry over the information sought by Parab from the district administration? As guardian minister, it is the responsibility of Parab to maintain law and order and peace in the district,” Malik said. Malik alleged BJP is in the habit of grossly abusing power. So far, he said, it has implicated leaders of Shiv Sena and NCP in false cases. “BJP is misusing Central agencies to settle political scores,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mva-ministers-not-afraid-of-bjp-threats-in-mumbai-ncp/articleshow/85670253.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Goa||Taxi owners go to court over digital meters||Panaji: The Vagator Caisua Taxi Owners’ Association, through its president Rohidas Babu Naik, has approached the high court over “highly unreasonable” price of the digital fare meters that the taxi owners are being asked to install. The association comprising private taxi operators who have not yet installed the digital fare meters stated that they are shocked that they have to bear the cost of Rs 14,000 per device which excludes the annual charges of Rs 4,500 payable to the subscriber. The cost of the device is inclusive of all taxes towards supply, installation and maintenance of automated tracking device with integrated emergency system fare meter but excludes the annual charges payable to the subscriber. The association has stated that the meters can be bought at half the price if they are permitted to purchase them on their own. The petitioners have also stated that they can purchase the digital fare meter with printer for Rs 5,500 (NECO TIFM-N1) or Rs 4,500 for (NECO DTS-T100) that too from authorised dealers in other states. If permitted to purchase on their own, they can pay a total of Rs 7,900 (5,500 of the meter and 2,400 subscription fee) for the first year and Rs 2,400 per year thereafter instead of Rs 14,000 plus subscription fee of Rs 4,500, they stated. They have stated that their business of passenger taxi is mainly hand to mouth and that they don’t make huge windfalls. They are greatly affected by the pandemic and are suffering the most compared to others as the tourist season has not been allowed to fully open up. “Though Goa is a tourist state, Covid-19 has curtailed, stifled and dented the income of the petitioners to a large extent,” they said. Rule 140 of the Goa Motor Vehicle Rules mandates that digital fare meters approved by the state transport authority be installed and the high court is monitoring the implementation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/taxi-owners-go-to-court-over-digital-meters/articleshow/85668017.cms||---

---||India||Kerala only state to report surge||NEW DELHI: India’s daily count of new Covid-19 cases again crossed the 40,000 mark, driven by a rapid surge in positive cases in Kerala – which alone accounted for over 68% of total 46,164 new cases detected across the country on Wednesday. Kerala - accounting for 58.4% of total Covid-19 cases last week - is the only state reporting a surge in new Covid-19 cases, even as all other states are showing a declining trend with overall weekly positivity rate below 3% for eight consecutive weeks. It is also the only state with more than 1 lakh active cases at present. With over 1.70 lakh active cases, Kerala alone has more than 51% of country’s total 3.33 lakh active caseload at present. Worried over the surge in Kerala coupled with upcoming festivities, the Centre said the second wave of Covid-19 has not yet concluded and months of September-October will be crucial. The home ministry on Thursday reviewed the steps being taken by the state government to check the high rate of infections. The meeting, chaired by home secretary Ajay Bhalla via video conferencing, also took stock of the Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra. During the meeting, the home secretary sought adequate intervention in geographical areas having higher infection with measures such as contact tracing, vaccination drives and strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour. Bhalla suggested that the governments in Kerala and Maharashtra explore the option of placing areas with high case positivity under night curfew. Calling for maintenance of pace of the vaccination programme, the home ministry offered to provide more vaccines if required, while at the same time insisting on the two states consuming all the vaccine doses received. The Centre urged states to ensure Covid-appropropriate norms are followed, while underlining vaccination as a pre-requisite for attending any public gathering that is critical. “We are still in the midst of the second surge of Covid-19 in our country. The second surge has not yet concluded. It is not over and therefore, we have to maintain all necessary precautions, particularly in light of our experience that after every festival we see a spike,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said. “The coming months of September and October are crucial for us because we would be celebrating a few festivals. Thus festivals have to be celebrated with Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Bhushan said. Officials also underlined the importance of using mask even after receiving two doses of vaccination. “Population density is causing the spread. Wherever Covid-appropriate behaviour is not observed, we are seeing a surge in cases. We know that these vaccines are disease modifying vaccines and not disease preventable vaccines, and therefore, it is very important to continue to use the mask even after vaccination with one or two doses,” the Indian Council of Medical Research director general Balram Bhargava said. Ramped up testing in areas with positivity rates on the higher side and focus on suppressing the levels of transmission of the virus to effectively control the chain of transmission, were the other key measures stressed upon by the Centre for turning around the Covid-19 situation, particularly in Kerala. The meeting with the home secretary on Thursday was attended by Dr V K Paul, member (health), NITI Aayog; secretary, ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW); Director, National Centre for Communicable Disease (NCDC)and the chief secretaries and DGPs of Kerala and Maharashtra. Though new cases of Covid-19 have come down in most parts of the country, there are still localised clusters with high positivity rate. To ensure that these cases do not spread further and are contained locally, the Centre has been insiting on imposing stringent curbs in localised areas or identified districts with large number of cases. Currently, 41 districts across the country have weekly positivity rate of more than 10%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-only-state-to-report-surge/articleshow/85674712.cms||---

They will now be known as Kalyan Singh Super Specialty Cancer Institute, Chak Ganjaria, Lucknow and Kalyan Singh Rajkiya Medical College, Bulandshahr,” said a government spokesperson. Singh passed away on August 21 in Lucknow after a prolonged illness. Deputy CM and PWD minister Keshav Prasad Maurya has already announced that roads in six districts will be named after him, including Ayodhya, Etah, Aligarh, Bulandshahr, Lucknow and Prayagraj. Maurya had tweeted: “One road each will be named after Babuji, Ram Bhakt late Kalyan Singh ji by the Public Works Department in Ayodhya, Lucknow, Aligarh, Etah, Bulandshahr and Prayagraj. Babuji gave up power for Ram Mandir but did not fire at kar sevaks. Instructions to the PWD officers to submit the proposal soon.” On Thursday, government spokesperson and MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh also spoke out against some persons at Aligarh Muslim University who had put up posters against vice- chancellor Tariq Mansoor after the latter issued a condolence message for Singh. “There are some people who are intent on spoiling the image of AMU. These people have nothing to do either with the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb or with Islam. Their mindset is that of separatists. I want to ask them whether it is a crime to issue a statement of condolence at the death of a former chief minister and governor. Which religion allows this? This can only be done by powers which want to break the country and spoil peace,” the minister said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-to-name-two-med-institutions-after-kalyan-singh/articleshow/85672278.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The child’s mother has lodged a complaint with the Golabari police station but the accused teacher is yet to be arrested by police. The private tutor Dipak Prajapati used to teach three children of a flower-seller at Salkia. On August 14 evening, he went to the latter’s home to teach his three pupils. At that time, none of the parents of the children was at home. When the tutor asked him some questions, the kid could not give satisfactory answers. In a feat of rage, the tutor poured hot paraffin from the candle on his body. The paraffin left the child scalded and traumatized. The child kept writhing in pain even as several blisters appeared on his arms and legs. When their parents returned home, the elder sister, who also was terrified, told her parents about the torture. The child was first taken to a doctor and the next day he was taken to Howrah State General Hospital. The parents first lodged a complaint with Golabari police station on August 19. But there was no action. The parents then met the commissioner of Howrah city police. Immediately, Golabari police swung into action but the teacher managed to evade the police and remains untraceable.

---||Goa||Alemao supporters, AAP workers lock horns at Benaulim||Margao: Invitation extended by AAP functionary Vincy Viegas to NCP Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao for a public debate on education led to a clash between AAP and Alemao supporters late Wednesday night. Complaints have been filed by both rival parties at the Colva police station each alleging the other of assaulting their party workers. No offence was registered by the Colva police until late Thursday evening. AAP functionaries Viegas and Pratima Coutinho told reporters that AAP volunteers were putting up banners on road sides at Benaulim when Churchill’s son Savio and nephew Warren confronted AAP ZP member Hanzel Fernandes and others. They allegedly objected to banners being put up by AAP volunteers on the grounds that they had obtained no permission from the authorities. This led to a quarrel between supporters of the two rival parties. While Fernandes said he and his co-volunteers were manhandled and threatened with dire consequences, Savio and Warren claimed that they were “attacked” by AAP volunteers. Alemao, speaking to reporters, accused AAP of creating a controversy over a non-issue like a public debate. “AAP has no right to put my photo on their banners without my permission. So when they were questioned last night, this led to a commotion. Complaints have been lodged with the police. Let police conduct an impartial inquiry and investigation,” he said. Viegas, on the other side, said that education was an important issue in Benaulim as the anganwadis and primary schools weren’t in a good condition, and that Alemao had failed to improve the education scenario in the constituency over the last many years that he represented.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/alemao-supporters-aap-workers-lock-horns-at-benaulim/articleshow/85670307.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 33-week foetus had ‘serious handicap with high morbidity’, said med board||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday permitted a 20-year-old woman to medically terminate her 33-week pregnancy after a medical board said the foetus suffers from Arnold Chiari malformation II—a group of brain malformations that lead to serious spinal disorders—and bilateral clubfoot. Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar noted that the parents have been advised that since the gestation is beyond 33 weeks, the foetus might be born alive. Its liability will lie with the parents. In its report, the medical board set up by J J Hospital confirmed the congenital defects of the foetus. A medical board of JJ hospital told the Bombay HC in a hearing about the medical termination of a 33-week pregnancy (MTP) that the condition of the foetus fulfils the criteria of “substantial risk of serious physical handicap with very high morbidity and mortality”. It added that since the pregnancy was beyond the 20 weeks cut-off under the MTP law and even the extended 24-week limit in the amendment, the case needs approval of the HC. The HC granted permission and, given the urgency, directed it to be done expeditiously at JJ hospital. A report of the outcome is to be given to the bench on September 2. Last October, the Bombay HC had permitted a 35-year-old woman to terminate a 32-week pregnancy, where the foetus has serious cardiac anomaly. The 20-year-old pregnant woman had petitioned the HC for MTP permission, citing severe abnormalities in the foetus. After hearing her lawyer Shraddha Vavhal and Amit Shastri, a government pleader, the HC had directed the JJ Group of Hospitals on August 23 to constitute a medical board to examine the woman and submit a report. The medical board mentioned that “termination of pregnancy at 33 weeks of gestation carries the same risk to the pregnant woman which is not likely to be more than delivery at term”. The board advised an MTP, saying the “pregnant woman has voluntarily expressed her desire to terminate the pregnancy and is well informed about the nature of the condition of foetus and its outcome. She is anguished with the condition of the foetus in utero”. In April 2019, in an important judgment, a bench of Justices Abhay Oka and M S Sanklecha, after analysing all relevant laws relating to MTP and constitutional rights, had said HC permission has to be sought when a pregnancy exceeds 20 weeks (as the legal cut-off was then) and the woman “fears its continuation would involve grave injury to her physical or mental health or where there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped”. The HC had said: “In such cases, the pregnant woman will have to seek permission from the high court and unless such permission is granted, no registered medical practitioner can terminate such pregnancy.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-33-wk-foetus-had-serious-handicap-with-high-morbidity-said-med-board/articleshow/85672385.cms||Swati Deshpande

PWD assistant engineer Lester D’Souza told TOI that repair work will be undertaken in a few months. This route along with two interior roads have been approved for repairs, and the works will be taken up in October post monsoon, D’Souza said. Chapoli village comprises around 300 inhabitants, and this is the only road that connects the locals to other parts of the taluka. A resident Krishna Gaonkar said that their remote village does not have regular bus service, and hence most of the people use two-wheelers to commute. However, since the road has run down, riding has become unsafe for them, he said. “Worst still, if there is a medical emergency and a person needs to be transported to a hospital in Canacona, it is a nightmare,” he added. The road has remained unattended despite being used by PWD personnel who visit Chapoli dam. On an average, 50 to 80 people visit Chapoli dam, so it is PWD’s duty to maintain the road, said Sarvanand Naik, a visitor from Quepem. A British tourist couple who visited the area recently complained about the bad condition of the road and called for repair work to be taken up immediately.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/in-bad-shape-for-a-year-chapoli-locals-want-road-repaired/articleshow/85668114.cms||---

The department has asked all the districts to be ready with their preparations in case the government gives its approval. Currently, offline classes are underway for students of Classes IX-XII. Talking to TOI on Thursday, department secretary Rajesh Sharma said, “Covid cases have come down drastically now, even though the threat perception isn’t officially over yet. Having said that, we were monitoring the situation after offline classes for students Classes IX-XII resumed almost a month ago and found that there hasn’t been any spike in cases anywhere. We are tracking the situation in other states too where schools have reopened to check if they have reported a spike.” He added, “We have started our preparations to keep the classrooms ready for physical classes. We have asked schools across all 24 districts to sanitise their buildings and premises. We are also seeking the details of those teachers and staff members who have received both the vaccine doses so that they can be called to office once school reopens. Of course, the approval has to come first and that’ll be given by the state disaster management department in consultation with the health department.” Ajay Rai, the president of Jharkhand Parents’ Association, said parents will be ready to send their kids to schools only when they feel that it is safe to do so. “While we realize that the prolonged closure of schools is harmful for children in the long run, at the same time it is to be seen how the state government and the school management is prepared to ensure safety on campus. Right now, only 30% of the students of Classes IX-XII are going to school as parents aren’t sure about their ward’s safety. The school management must instil confidence in the parents with proper arrangements,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/edu-dept-eyes-govt-nod-to-let-i-viii-students-back-to-school/articleshow/85668240.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Action recommended against Ranchi DC for misusing powers||Ranchi: Ranchi DC Chhavi Ranjan was found misusing his judicial powers in an inquiry conducted by the South Chhotanagpur divisional commissioner into the mutation of a 7.16 acre-land in the Helal area. According to a senior official, the DC had ignored several legal provisions when he heard a petition filed by one Vinod Kumar Singh after 15 months well beyond the stipulated time limit of 60 days. Sources in the district administration said Vinod had communicated saying he was informed about the order late and couldn’t file a revision petition. He was, however, present during the hearings of the deputy commissioner. Revenue board member Amarendra Pratap Singh, who has also been provided with a copy of the report to issue recommendations on such matters, said, “We are studying the report and as a quasi-judicial body, we cannot take any action on anyone related to administrative matters. However, we have been asked to recommend a few suggestions in light of the alleged wrongdoings so that similar instances do not happen elsewhere.” Notably, South Chhotanagpur divisional commissioner Nitin Madan Kulkarni was directed to conduct an enquiry by the state revenue secretary into the matter after Vinod moved the chief secretary over the “wrongful mutation” of his land to other parties. After conducting an inquiry, the commissioner has recommended administrative as well as disciplinary action against Ranjan. The commissioner in his report said Ranjan had misused his judicial powers by taking decisions in favour of one Ravi Singh Bhatia and Shyam Singh in the mutation. The report also said the DC had not only heard the petition after the stipulated time but also pointed out wrongdoings on the part of the incumbent circle officer of Hehal by submitting a ‘panchnama’ in favour of Bhatia and Singh. The report recommended issuing a show cause to the circle officer concerned over the issue. A senior bureaucrat said the report is startling and the allegations of wrongdoings are of grave concern. “The details of the report has highlighted a senior official in the rank of a deputy commissioner showing complete disregard for rules,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/action-recommended-against-ranchi-dc-for-misusing-powers/articleshow/85667281.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

We will be questioning them as it’s not possible that Sheikh laundered the money in the name of the trust without the knowledge of the other trustees,” said a police official. The official further said that all the organisations run by Sheikh are under the scanner as the accused must have used these institutions to divert the money he got through foreign donations. A team of cops have left for Uttar Pradesh to take custody of Sheikh and co-accused Mohammad Umar and the duo may be brought to the city within next two days. Md Umar had reportedly visited the city a few months ago to attend some events organized by Sheikh. He has a network in Bharuch and Surat apart from some neighbouring states where he had diverted the foreign donations. The UP ATS had arrested Md Umar and Qazi Jahangir in June this year on charges of mass conversions of people through inducements like marriage or jobs. Umar was alleged to have converted over 1,000 persons in UP. He is suspected to be involved in mass conversions of deaf and mute students, women and children. Sheikh’s name surfaced during their interrogation and the cops learnt that his bank accounts were used for hawala transactions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/trustees-of-afmi-trust-to-be-probed-for-laundering-of-funds/articleshow/85665427.cms||---

The rally also demanded that the PSUs return the unused land, acquired for building their units in Bokaro, to the locals. Titled Janakrosh rally, the rally was organised in Sector-4 and attended by locals who were displaced after BSL and other units, such as the Bokaro Thermal Power Plant of Damodar Valley Corporation, and Tenughat Thermal Power Station acquired their lands. The party has submitted a 10-point demand to the BSL management. JMM’s district president Hiralal Manjhi said, “If the companies want to run the plant, the land owners should be provided with jobs. Otherwise, JMM will drive the officials out of the state.” JMM’s city president Mantu Yadav said, “The CM had announced a few months ago that companies functioning in Jharkhand must give 75% reservation to locals and BSL should follow it.” Former Gomia MLA Yogendra Mahto, who was also part of the rally, said that the BSL management should understand that even though it is a central undertaking, it cannot function in Jharkhand without following its rules and regulations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jmm-bokaro-unit-takes-out-rally-seeking-75-quota-in-jobs-for-locals/articleshow/85667195.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad while hearing a PIL on the lack of infrastructure in the autonomous hospital observed that Rims should be self sufficient. The bench observed that Rims has to cater to the needs of patients and outsourcing of different facilities was not acceptable. An intervention application was also filed by Dawai Dost urging the court to pass orders directing the Rims authorities to allow them to operate on the hospital campus. Dawai Dost dealing with generic medicines operated within the campus of Rims but was ordered by the hospital administration to cease its operations. Defending the stand of the hospital, its counsel Akashdeep said that Dawai Dost was allowed a lease of one year to operate on Rims premises. The counsel further said that since the lease with Dawai Dost has expired, the generic medicine chain was asked to vacate the premises. Earlier, while hearing the case, the high court had queried the hospital as to when it will start its own counter for dealing with generic medicines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/hc-pulls-up-rims-for-not-starting-medicine-centre/articleshow/85667134.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Right to privacy includes right to be forgotten, says Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Recognising that the right to privacy includes the right to be forgotten and to be left alone, Delhi high court has ordered various online platforms, including YouTube, to remove explicit videos and audio clips of a Bengali actress. “In the circumstances and inview of the fact that the plaintiff (actress) is entitled ‘to be left alone’ and ‘to be forgotten’, she is entitled to protection from invasion of her privacy by strangers and anonymous callers on account of such publication/streaming/ transmission of the suit videos by the defendants,” Justice Asha Menon stated in her order passed on Wednesday. The actress hasfiled a suit seeking restraint on publication and streaming of her objectionable videos on URLs and sites. The high court also noted that while there is no statutory ‘right to be forgotten’, in view of the facts of the case where her explicit video clips are being circulated, there is a clear and immediate effect on the woman’s reputation, requiring the grant of interim protection. It added that the right to privacy of the actress has to be protected, especially when it is her personality that is being exhibited and against her will. The Bengali actress has filed a suit seeking restraint on publication and streaming of her objectionable videos on various URLs, websites, mobile applications and online platforms portraying her in a manner that infringes her privacy. The woman claimed that she is a well-known actor, particularly in Bengali films, and had been approached by a production house for filming a webseries. On the promise made to the woman of giving her the lead role in the web-series, she was lured into participating in a demonstration video/trailer, consisting of explicit scenes. However, the project fell through and the web-series was never produced. Last year, the woman came across the videos that had been uploaded by the producer on his YouTube channel and website, but on her request, the producer removed the clips, the plea added. Without her consent, various websites uploaded the videos and some of them also superimposed objectionable and obscene commentaries on them, it said. The high court also relied upon the new Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which mandates intermediaries, including search engines, to remove or disable access to content upon receipt of a complaint made by any individual/person in relation to any content that shows the individual in partial or full nudity or in some sexual act or conduct. “She has clearly stated in the plaint that the producer had taken the videos down. If others were circulating the same for monetary and other prurient benefits, the plaintiff cannot be denied any relief,” the court said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/right-to-privacy-includes-right-to-be-forgotten-says-delhi-high-court/articleshow/85674714.cms||Abhinav Garg

India reported 44,510 fresh cases of the virus, with Kerala alone accounting for 30,007 new infections. The state had recorded 31,445 cases on Wednesday, making it the first state in nearly three months (since May 29) to register more than 30,000 fresh infections in a day. India's daily count of Covid cases had crossed 46,000 on Wednesday. With the number of cases exploding after the Onam week, Kerala reported a test positivity rate (TPR) of over 18% on Thursday. The TPR in the state has been steadily rising, indicating that infections may still be on the rise. Meanwhile, Maharashtra logged more than 5,000 new cases for the second day in a row. The state recorded 5,108 fresh Covid infections on Thursday, up slightly from the previous day's tally of 5,031. Prior to Wednesday, Maharashtra's daily count of cases had remained below 5,000 for five days. Despite the seeming surge, daily numbers in the state have remained lower than the corresponding days of the previous week. Andhra Pradesh and Bengal too were witnessing a minor surge in infections since Wednesday. Andhra Pradesh reported 1,539 cases on Thursday and 1,601 on Wednesday, both numbers slightly higher than last week's peak of 1,501. Bengal logged 717 and 708 in the last two days. These numbers, however, were lower than the previous week's peak. India recorded 486 deaths from the virus on Thursday, down from the previous day's surprisingly high toll of 603. Kerala reported 162 fatalities, Maharashtra 159, Odisha 66, Tamil Nadu 26 and Karnataka 25.

---||Delhi||Delhi has maximum CCTVs per sq mile in world||NEW DELHI: Delhi has beaten cities like London, Shanghai, Singapore, New York and Beijing with the maximum number of CCTV cameras per square mile. The capital has 1,826.6 cameras per square mile compared to the city in the second spot, London, which has 1,138.5 cameras, according to data collated by Comparitech, a firm of researchers in cyber security, and published by Forbes India. Chennai is at the third spot with 609.9 and Mumbai at 18th with 157.4. Comparitech said the data “focused primarily on public CCTVs — cameras used by government entities such as law-enforcement”. However, it added there was “little correlation between the number of public CCTV cameras and crime or safety”. CM Arvind Kejriwal said it was a moment of pride for the city, which had emerged on the top among 150 cities. The AAP government says that despite obstacles put in their path by the LG, they had ensured that maximum number of cameras were installed to boost women’s safety. “My compliments to the Delhi government officers and engineers who worked on the project like a mission and achieved the feat in such a short time,” tweeted Kejriwal. It was AAP’s poll promise to provide CCTV cameras throughout the capital to primarily check crime. Feel proud to say that Delhi beats cities like Shanghai, NY n London with most CCTV cameras per sq mileDelhi has… https://t.co/oVedbXgDOt— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) 1629951885000The study estimated the number of CCTV cameras in Delhi at a little over 5.5 lakh for an area of 302 square miles, which suggests that it excluded the farmlands of the national capital territory, which has a total area of 573 square miles. The Delhi government said it has installed 2.75 lakh cameras while 1.4 lakh are in the process of being installed. The rest of the cameras have been installed by Delhi Police, New Delhi Municipal Council, private agencies and citizens. Other Indian cities that rank among the most surveilled cities in the world in terms of cameras per square mile are Chennai, which is at the third spot with 609.92 and Mumbai at the 18th position with 157.43. Five of the top 10 on the list are Chinese cities — Shenzhen, Wuxi, Qingdao, Shanghai, Changhsha and Wuhan — the others being Delhi, London and Singapore. Going by cameras per 1,000 population, Chinese cities once again dominate the top 20, accounting for 16 of the slots, but Indore is at a surprising No.4, Hyderabad at No.12 and Delhi at No.16. London in the third spot is the only city not in China or India among the top 20. “No other Indian city is even close to Delhi, which has three times the CCTVs than Chennai and 11 times that of Mumbai per square mile. Despite continuous roadblocks by the central government, the Kejriwal government did not deter in enhancing women’s safety in Delhi and the CM with MLAs even sat on a dharna in 2018 at the LG House in order to pave the way for the CCTV project,” said the Delhi government in a statement. The AAP government had given in-principle approval for the project in October 2015. The project had led to several flashpoints between the elected government and the LG over the proposed regulatory framework to guide their installation. PWD took up the process of acquiring and installing 2.75 lakh CCTVs in phase one of the project. In the next phase,1 .4 lakh CCTVs are being installed. “The project of installing CCTVs in Delhi exemplifies Swaraj; RWAs were involved in surveying the locations where the CCTVs should be put up, and not just gated colonies but all localities of Delhi, including slums, were covered by the project,” said the state government. The government said that all CCTV feeds are highly secure with the hardware monitored by the community and the feeds accessible only to authorised users.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-has-maximum-cctvs-per-sq-mile-in-world/articleshow/85674782.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram murders: Most gashes on tenant' wife||GURUGRAM: The machete attack that led to four murders in a Rajendra Park house earlier this week was most vicious on Anamika, who lived as a tenant a floor above the alleged killer, the autopsy report of the victims suggests. There were 22 gashes and cuts on Anamika’s body. The attack on Anamika’s nine-year-old daughter was also savage – the child had 16 such injuries. There were seven cuts and gashes on the body of Anamika’s husband Krishan Tiwari, believed to be one of the killer’s main targets. Sunita, the daughter-in-law of main accused Rao Rai Singh and apparently the first to be attacked by him in the early hours of August 24, had 16 deep injuries. The gashes, in all the victims, were in the upper body, mainly the neck, face and head that the swinging machete landed on. Based on Singh’s interrogation, police believe Sunita and Anamika were attacked twice, once between 2.30 and 3am and again around 6am when he discovered they were still alive. After the murders, Singh walked to the police station with the machete and surrendered that morning. Krishan and Anamika’s other daughter, who is six years old, is the only survivor of the attack. She is being treated at Safdarjung Hospital. Despite Singh walking up and surrendering, the investigation, two days on, has thrown up more questions than it has answered. At the heart of the riddle is the motive, which remains mired in haze. There are three sets of contradictory claims, one made by Singh about Sunita and Krishan having an affair, another by Sunita’s brother about Singh eyeing a one-acre plot Sunita had inherited in Mahendergarh but refused to part with, and one more by Krishan’s brother-in-law about a rent agreement dispute between Krishan and Singh. Singh, too, is believed to have told police Krishan had not paid rent for some months. None of these claims connects all the victims to a common motive. The autopsy report has thrown up questions too. Why was the nine-year-old girl so savagely hacked down? Both Sunita’s and Krishan’s families have called allegations of an affair concocted to hide the real motive. A relative of Sunita asked on Thursday where the evidence was of a connection between her and Krishan. “If two people have some kind of a relationship, there must be regular telephonic conversations, message exchange, some pictures of them together or something to prove that they had a relationship. Have police found any details of call records or messages between Sunita and Krishan. We are not aware of any,” said the relative. After Singh surrendered, his wife Bimlesh was arrested on August 25, for allegedly accompanying her husband while he slaughtered Sunita and the three others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/machete-murders-most-gashes-22-on-tenants-wife-16-on-her-daughter/articleshow/85671287.cms||Bagish Jha

The four homogenous meteorological regions — northwest, east and northeast, and central India, and south peninsula — have also experienced truant rainfall, according to experts. “This year so far has been an ENSO Neutral year in the Pacific Ocean. The monsoon has been weak for most of the time except for a short period from June 8 to 19, when it was active. Also, there have been two break spells, one three-day break spell in July and another five-day one in August,” meteorologist and retired chief scientist, National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Ramesh Kumar said. Monsoon over Goa is so far in 2% deficit. Rainfall was normal to excess on most days during the first two months of this season, but activity was weak to very weak, even break type, in the month of August over the state. According to Kumar, June saw all the four homogeneous regions receiving excess rainfall with the core monsoon zone region (central zone) receiving the maximum rainfall, with an excess of 17.5%, and the south peninsula region receiving the minimum of 3.7%. In the peak monsoon month of July, the south peninsula region received the maximum rainfall of about 26.3% excess and the east and northeast regions received the minimum rainfall. In the peak monsoon month of August (up to August 23), the core monsoon zone of central India is facing the maximum deficit of 37.4% and the east and northeast the minimum deficit of 6%. “If we consider the season as a whole, out of the 36 meteorological subdivisions, there are 11 deficits, 21 normal and four excess subdivisions,” Kumar said. He said that there has been no convective systems such as a depression or monsoon depression over the Arabian Sea or Bay of Bengal so far this year. “The last time this has happened was way back in 2002, which was incidentally a drought year.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goa-records-weak-monsoon-overall-with-few-short-spells-in-june-july/articleshow/85668711.cms||Nida Sayed

However, standalone theatres like Cine Samrat and Cine Ashok have yet to resume operations as the current norms make it unviable. Unlike the multiplexes, which predominantly screen Hollywood and Bollywood flicks, the other theatres in Goa depend on Hindi, Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam movie patrons. With the Covid-19 pandemic delaying new movie releases, smaller movie houses such as Hira Film Exhibitors have decided to take it slow. Though the state government extended the curfew for another week, it permitted theatres to reopen with 50% capacity. “We wholeheartedly welcome the state government’s decision to allow cinemas to operate. We will evaluate our preparations and will look to start operations across all our four cinemas in Goa,” said regional director, west, INOX Leisure Ltd, Atul Bhandarkar. The cinemas will be operated by a fully vaccinated team with the theatres being “frequently deep cleaned” and disinfected, said Bhandarkar. Masks, temperature checks, contactless payments and e-ticketing will be mandatory. Pravin Zantye, who is the managing partner of the chain of Z-Square theatres and the president of the All Goa Theatre Owners Association, said that smaller cinemas cannot afford to run at 50% capacity. “The costs are the same, the salaries are the same but the revenue is not the same,” said Zantye. “If theatres in Goa are reopened at this point of time then there would be a severe problem as regards getting new film releases, every week, especially as theatres in Maharashtra and Kerala are still shut,” he added, pointing out that Hindi, English, Marathi and Konkani language films are popular in this order, among the theatre-going people in Goa. To try and increase revenue, INOX is offering private screenings and food delivery service. INOX is exploring day long multi-meal service windows to deliver breakfast, lunch, high tea and dinner orders. INOX will make food available on online food ordering platforms, Bhandarkar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/multiplexes-finally-open-but-standalone-cinemas-still-shut/articleshow/85668727.cms||---

The SWR has replaced the conventional rake of the train No. 07342/07341 Vasco-Kulem-Vasco passenger special and train No. 07343/07344 Vasco-Kulem-Vasco special with new DEMU rakes with effect from Thursday. The train composition will have eight car coaches, a spokesperson of SWR said. With the introduction of the DEMU trains, SWR has effectively introduced an additional train service between Vasco and Kulem. Accordingly, train No. 07379 Kulem-Vasco DEMU special will depart from Kulem at 12.20pm and reach Vasco at 2.10pm. In the return direction, train No. 07380 Vasco -Kulem DEMU special will depart from Vasco at 1.05pm and reach Kulem at 3pm. Enroute, the train has stops at Kalay, Sanvordem-Curchorem, Chandor, Sao Jose de Areal, Margao, Suravali, Majorda, Cansaulim, Sancoale and Dabolim. Konkan Railway runs two DEMU trains between Margao and Karwar. General manager, SWR, Sanjeev Kishore said that arrangements have been made for maintaining these rakes at Vasco itself and that men and material have been made available for the purpose. “Thus,DEMU rakes can be maintained during the night while they are stabled at Vasco. This will avoid movements for maintenance between Vasco and Verna, saving line capacity too,” Kishore said. SWR officials said that local short distance commuter trains are ideally suited to be of DEMU type as the train has a driving cabin on both ends and can ply in both directions, thus doing away with the requirement of engine reversal at terminal stations, thereby saving time. Besides, the coaches provide more comfort for passengers with each car having a seating capacity of 105, 15 more than conventional coaches, SWR said. The primary fuel source for the train is diesel. A diesel engine powers an alternator and subsequently feeds the electric motors. Each coach has its own source of motive power fitted below, which enables the train to accelerate and decelerate quickly making them ideal to ply as shuttles between stations located at short intervals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/swr-launches-its-first-demu-train-for-goa-section-inaugural-run-from-vasco-to-kulem/articleshow/85668867.cms||---

Private persons in that state have filed the case, questioning the drinking water and balancing reservoir project proposed by Karnataka. “Neither the Madurai court has jurisdiction over inter-state water disputes nor the petitioners have any locus standi. The Supreme Court has said it on many occasions in the past. So, we have decided to implead in the case and argue the same,” chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said in Delhi on Thursday. He held a meeting with legal and technical experts to chalk out strategies for tackling the water-sharing disputes with neighbouring states. He sought steps to get various water-related cases before the Supreme Court disposed of at the earliest. Ministers and advocate general Prabhuling Navadgi were part of the meeting. Reiterating that a river interlinking project being taken up by Tamil Nadu is illegal, the chief minister said that another petition opposing the work would be submitted to the Centre. “I have also instructed the legal team to make Karnataka’s stand clear when Tamil Nadu’s miscellaneous petition pertaining to the Mekedatu project comes up for hearing in the Supreme Court,” he said. Bommai has also asked the legal team to prepare ground to press for notification of the final verdict of the Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal in the gazette when the hearing of an interlocutory application filed by the state comes up for hearing. The Telangana government has filed an SLP seeking higher share of the Krishna water. Bommai said that he had met senior advocates Mohan Khatri and Shyam Divan and discussed ways to proceed in view of the existing water disputes. The row over the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project on Mahadayi River was also discussed. The hearing of this case is listed for September 2.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/mekedatu-karnataka-govt-to-argue-in-case-before-madurai-court/articleshow/85674827.cms||---

The diamond major had witnessed a 17% dip in its India sales in Covid 19-hit 2020 against its 2019 number. “We are hopeful that 2021 will be a strong year. Following the market reopening, both June and July sales have resonated strongly to the industry. There is a pent-up demand since Akshay Tritiya as a lot of weddings are taking place now amid the fear of third wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The industry is buoyant and optimistic as new retailers are coming in,” said Sachin Jain, MD of De Beers India, on the sidelines of Forevermark Forum, the annual B2B event which was held virtually last year. The Forum also saw good traction for its newly unveiled designer collection Avaanti, which is the company’s first global line. “We are piloting a Code of Origin project for diamond quality verification, which will be launched next year,” Jain said. According to the industry, Rs 5 lakh crore worth of diamonds will be in demand worldwide by 2030. “We are targeting to sell around 250,000 units of diamond by 2021-end,” said Jain. Sensing the surge in demand, De Beers India is planning to take the number of its exclusive stores to 35 by 2022 from 13 at present. The company’s total point of sales would go up to 325 by next year-end from the current level of 275. Despite the Covid-19-induced lockdown and subsequent surge in online sales across all the products, the high-value diamond market is yet to catch up with that trend. “Prospective customers are spending time on our new hybrid e-commerce sites for checking on product lines and doing research on designs before coming to our outlets more informed. We don’t foresee a large chunk of buyers switching to online purchase for our normal range worth Rs 80,000-Rs 1 lakh,” he admitted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/de-beers-sees-15-sales-jump-in-2021-over-pre-covid-year/articleshow/85668929.cms||Sovon Manna

Additional collector-II, South Goa, Sanjit Rodrigues issued the order on Thursday. Their RT-PCR tests were done at the Loutolim PHC on Wednesday. Health officer of the Shiroda PHC Dr Sunita Redkar informed the South Goa collectorate after all nine tests returned positive. Redkar said that one of the family members had recently travelled to Mumbai and had developed symptoms soon after his return. “Though it could not be confirmed if he contracted the virus in Mumbai or during his travel, he has a history of going to areas that have prevalence of Covid-19,” Redkar said. She said that the infection did not spread in the vicinity. “After the whole family tested positive, we immediately collected samples of their 17 immediate neighbours, and they tested negative,” she said. Meanwhile, joint mamlatdar Saiesh Naik and mamlatdar Rajesh Sakhalkar have been appointed magistrate and deputy magistrate, respectively, to maintain the law and order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/9-of-borim-family-test-ive-house-made-micro-zone/articleshow/85668957.cms||---

Organ transplant is a miracle of modern medicine and is giving a new lease of life to hundreds every day, he said. The awareness programme to commemorate Organ Donation Day organised by Mohan Foundation with IMA-Goa and Mapusa Municipal Council also highlighted the fact that the donation of one kidney or part of a liver is safe for the donor and is allowed only after stringent medical and legal checks. After a person is declared brain dead organs can be donated with the consent of the next of kin, participants were told. Multiple organs can be donated, which can directly save eight lives (vital organs) and improve at least another 50 (tissues), Mahaldar said. The organ failure patients, who don’t have any fit living donors, can be placed on a well-organised and managed wait list of SOTTO Goa. Mapusa MLA, Joshua De Souza was the special invitee while IMA-Goa, Bardez, president, Dr Sophia Rodrigues was the guest of honour. De Souza spoke on how the council can take up this initiative on a micro level to spread awareness. Sophia gave some real-life examples about organ donation. Gabriel Pereira of Mohan Foundation explained how they take up similar awareness programmes and have ‘Gift of Life’ courses where one can be an ambassador in promoting organ donation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/many-await-transplant-due-to-few-donors-doc/articleshow/85669226.cms||---
---||India||Judge oath-taking at SC hall to fit in crowd||NEW DELHI: In order to accommodate a crowd of nine judges, their relatives and friends as well as advocates, the Supreme Court has decided to open up its large auditorium for their oath taking, which is traditionally administered in the largest Chief Justice’s courtroom in the SC. CJI N V Ramana has scheduled the oath taking for Tuesday in the 900-seater auditorium at the new additional building of the SC. He will administer the oath of office to Justices A S Oka, Justice Vikram Nath, Justice J K Maheshwari, Justice Hima Kohli, Justice B V Nagarathna, Justice C T Ravikumar, Justice M M Sundresh, Justice Bela M Trivedi, and P S Narasimha. This is the second time since 2000 that the judges appointed to the SC would take oath of office at a place other than the high-ceilinged Chief Justice’s courtroom, which can accommodate 200 people when full. On January 28, 2000, the CJI A S Anand had utilised the stage set up in the SC lawns for celebrating golden jubilee of SC for administering oath to three SC Judges — Justices Y K Sabharwal, Ruma Pal and Doraiswamy Raju. Justice Sabharwal became CJI on November 1, 2005. Justice Pal retired as the senior-most SC judge on June 2, 2006, seven months ahead of Justice Sabharwal. In another important decision, the CJI has decided to commence physical hearing from Wednesday, a day after the nine take oath and bolster the number of SC judges to 33, which is just one less than its sanctioned strength of 34. The SC downed its shutters for physical hearings from March 25 last year and continued to dispense justice through video-conferencing. There were some serious moves to reopen the court and commence physical hearing in March this year, but the surge in Covid cases, which included several SC judges and hundreds of advocates, abruptly scotched the proposal. With the number of Covid patients on the decline in Delhi, CJI Ramana and senior judges took a cautious decision to resume physical hearing from Wednesday for matters requiring long arguments. According to SC sources, the “competent authority” has decided to hear matters on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays through a hybrid system — both physical and video-conferencing mode.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judge-oath-taking-at-sc-hall-to-fit-in-crowd/articleshow/85674817.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Cross complaints regarding the incident were registered at the Shahera police station in Panchmahahal district on Tuesday evening. The three youths had allegedly harassed two girls studying in Class IX and Class XI and living in a village in Shahera taluka on Tuesday.

The trio left the place and the girls who were in shock informed their other relatives. The girl’s kin allegedly traced one of the youths and beat him up. They asked him to call two others who were present with him in the morning. The three youths were taken to an isolated place and were stripped naked. They were beaten up and a video of the trio confessing to their deeds was recorded by someone. Others in the mob were also seen recording the video.

The high court is hearing a public interest petition (PIL) demanding footpaths for pedestrians. The contractor was instructed to commence work on June 24, 2021, and on July 1 commenced work. The contractor has completed excavation to construct a foundation for the 150m side wall on the right side leading from the Verla Canca circle towards Mapusa, as well as the excavation and soiling for road widening — 180m in length on the right side of the same stretch. “The said work was kept on hold in the last week of July on account of heavy rain, due to which the pace of the work has been adversely affected. Further, during excavation of the retaining wall, it is noticed that the water beneath gushes and hence it becomes difficult to carry out masonary work for the retaining wall. However, the work shall be undertaken at its optimum pace soon after monsoon,” executive engineer (North Goa), GTDC, M P Balan stated. GTDC through an e-tender had issued a work order dated August 16, 2019, to M/s Bagkiya Constructions Pvt Ltd, but work couldn’t start immediately due to illegal encroachments on the property, Balan stated. The court was told that three out of the 16 illegal encroachments have been demolished. The project comprises construction of a 850m-long roadside pathway for pedestrians with a ramp on either side, provision for service lines, underground drainage systems on either sides of the road as well as illumination of the road and pathway, development and beautification of the traffic island at temple junction.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/canca-footpath-to-be-ready-in-9-months-tourism-corp-to-hc/articleshow/85669588.cms||---

The data of the health department till Wednesday evening revealed that 51 cases have surfaced in Ludhiana district so far, out of which 25 patients are from Ludhiana, 21 belong to other districts in Punjab and five from other states or Union territories. Out of 25 cases from Ludhiana, 23 were from Ludhiana urban, one each from Sidhwan Bet and Jagraon. Twenty-one other patients are from Muktsar, Hoshiarpur, Moga, Jalandhar, SBS Nagar, Mansa, Faridkot, Muktsar, Kapurthala districts and five from Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Till August 16, 31 cases had been reported in Ludhiana that included patients from other districts and states or union territories too. The number had shot up from three on July 1 to 20 by August 2. In comparison, there were two cases of dengue till date last year. While 2015 had seen maximum dengue cases at 1,876, the same had dropped to 489 in 2018. But there was a sharp increase in cases (1,509) in 2019, which dropped to 1,355 last year. However, dengue deaths have decreased from seven in 2015 to just 1 in 2018. No death was reported in 2019, whereas two persons died of vector-borne disease last year. As the dengue cases have witnessed a rise, the health officials said it is a cause of worry, but steps are being taken to check the spread. Civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia said they are already implementing a plan to check dengue cases. He said apart from the municipal corporation, the health department has constituted 18 teams of two members each, including an assistant malaria officer (AMO), to check the spread of the vector-borne disease. A health officer asking not to be named said even though teams visit various areas to check breeding of mosquitoes, the Ludhiana municipal corporation has an important role to play by ensuring fogging in various areas. Meanwhile, residents complained that fogging has not been done by the department concerned in their areas. “I haven’t seen a team coming to our area for fogging this year. The department concerned should carry out fogging regularly, so that people don’t fall prey to dengue, malaria etc,” said Kulwant Singh of Dugri area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/dengue-tightens-grip-on-ludhiana-20-cases-in-10-days/articleshow/85671472.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Ludhiana||Punjab provides golden chance to regularise 50,000 illegal water connections in Ludhiana||LUDHIANA: In a city which has more than 50,000 illegal water and sewerage connections, people have been provided an opportunity to regularise the same and clear their outstanding dues. With election fever catching up, the Punjab government has again notified one-time settlement policy for unauthorized water and sewerage connections. The residents have been given three months’ time to clear their dues and get their connections regularized. In the policy, a nominal fee has been fixed for regularization of illegal connections. For houses constructed in area up to 125 square yards, Rs 200 per connection has been fixed, out of which Rs 100 is for water supply line and same is for sewerage; for houses built in 125 to 250 square yards, the charges will be Rs 500 per connection; and houses built on above 250 square yards will have to pay Rs 1,000 per connection. For commercial/institutional properties up to 250 square yards, the charges will be Rs 1,000 per connection and it will be Rs 2,000 per connection for properties built in over 250 square yards area. The notification said after depositing the fee, no other charges like road cutting, connection fees and security will be chargeable. Upon the satisfaction of technical officials of MC, quality of pipe, size of connection and alignment of water supply line (not below or adjoining sewer line) connection will be regularized. No penalty will be charged if the fee is deposited within 3 months from the date of notification (August 25). For those who would not get their connection regularized within this period, 100% penalty will charged on the above fee while regularizing their connection. For users who do not get their connection regularized within 6 months from the date of notification, their connection will be disconnected and applicable penalty and interest will be charged on pending user charges. However, the water supply and sewer connection issued in the name of user will not be treated as proof of ownership. From the date of notification, bill for user charges will be sent. Also if the residents, who had not cleared their water and sewerage charges, pay the principal amount in three months, no interest and penalty would be on the outstanding amount. If the principal outstanding amount and interest payment is made between 3 and 6 months from the date of issue of notification, no penalty will be charged. The failure to deposit arrears after 6 months will attract both applicable interest and penalty in addition to disconnection. Superintending engineer of operation and maintenance cell, MC, Rajinder Singh admitted that there are over 50,000 illegal consumers who did not get the connections legally. He said in the past too, OTS for this purpose had been notified and consumers had come forward to get their connections regularised. Notably, there are over 4 lakh properties in the city and as many as 2.80 lakh properties have legal connections and 1.50 lakh properties are getting water supply and sewerage bills. As per official estimate, there are around 50,000 defaulters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/punjab-provides-golden-chance-to-regularise-50000-illegal-water-connections-in-ludhiana/articleshow/85671535.cms||Nidhi Bhardwaj

While Congress was quick to latch on to the remarks, its party’s own spokesperson made similar comments against the woman earlier in the day. Instead of being sensitive to the plight of the rape survivor, and focusing on making the state safe for women, in tone-deaf reactions, not only the home minister but a couple of others too tried to shift the blame onto the girl for stepping out in the evening. “What was she doing there at 7-7.30pm? Why did she go to a secluded place with her classmate after sunset? But what can we do, people are free to go anywhere anytime,” Jnanendra said after reviewing investigations with officials on Thursday. Lovers, couples should not venture into secluded places after dark: MinisterTo Congress’ demand for his resignation, the home minister said, “The rape happened in Mysuru, but Congress is trying to rape me to gain political mileage from the incident.” Following outrage and a putdown from CM Basavaraj Bommai who directed him to apologise, Jnanendra said, “The victim is like my daughter. Whatever I spoke was only out of concern. I apologise for my comments. Mysuru is a cultural town and this is a blackmark on the whole of the state,” he said. Anand Singh, minister for environment, ecology and tourism, too sought to shift the blame: “Lovers and newly married couples should never venture into secluded places after dark. The government cannot ask police to keep vigil all the time.” Labour minister Shivaram Hebbar, on the other hand, said such incidents have happened during other governments too. “It is not that such incidents are taking place only when our party came to power. Women have been targeted earlier,” he said. Congress tweeted, “Home minister, you have the onus of protecting the state, are you not ashamed of making such a shabby remark? With this statement, he has agreed that it is dangerous to venture out in the state after 7 pm under BJP rule.” On Jnanendra’s jibe at Congress, state party chief DK Shivakumar said, “He is using the word rape very lightly... I seek the response of BJP leaders on this statement.” Hours before, though, Congress spokesperson Manjula Manasa embarrassed the party by saying she was shocked that the woman and her classmate had ventured into a deserted place. “One shouldn’t bang one’s head against a wall just because its strong,” she said, cryptically, drawing flak from women’s activists. Manasa is now part of the Congress team constituted under former MP VS Ugrappa to look into the incident and submit a report. ‘Create secure environment’Slamming the bid by the government and parties to blame the survivor, KS Vimala, vice-president of All India Janawadi Mahila Sanghatane said, “Instead of telling women not to step out, these people should make society secure for them.” “This is a failure of our system. From toddlers to senior citizens, women are sexually assaulted in different places and in different circumstances. Creating a safe and secure environment for women round the clock is the responsibility of society,” said R Indira, a retired sociology professor of University of Mysore.

The SAIL board gave its nod to the restructuring programme a few months ago when Dharmendra Pradhan was the steel minister. Control of the RMD’s mines would be transferred to Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) in Odisha and Bokaro Steel Plant in Jharkhand depending on their location. “It is part of the restructuring process which the SAIL board has taken up. And now the process of shifting is complete including the manpower. So now, there is no scope of reviewing (the decision),” Singh told reporters on the sidelines of the inauguration of MSTC’s new headquarters at New Town near here. He claimed that the steel major is likely to save around Rs 40 crore a year courtesy of the move. West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra in June had requested Pradhan to intervene and stop dismantling of the RMD in Kolkata, saying it would result in job loss amid the Covid-19 pandemic and would also be detrimental to the interests of two "iconic and profitable" steel plants of the state. "It is even more alarming that with the dismantling of RMD, the iconic Durgapur and Burnpur integrated Steel plants in West Bengal would be left with no captive mines nor would they get supplies of iron since the RMD vertical would have been dismantled," the state finance minister had said in his letter to Pradhan. He was referring to the Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP) in Durgapur and the IISCO Steel Plant (ISP) in Burnpur, two profit-making SAIL units located in Paschim Bardhaman district, that employ 14,400 workers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sail-rmd-shift-from-city-complete-minister/articleshow/85669557.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

PCFS runs an instant mobile loan app ‘Cashbean’ and is accused of remitting money abroad for non-existent software and marketing services. ED is probing several NBFCs for money-laundering via instant micro loans on mobile apps. “PCFS is a wholly-owned subsidiary (WOS)of Oplay Digital Services, SA de CV, Mexico, which isa WOS of TenspotPesa Limited, Hong Kong, owned by Opera Limited (Cayman Islands) and Wisdom Connection | Holding Inc(Cayman Islands). The ultimate owner is Zhou Yahui, a Chinese. The original Indian company PCFS was incorporated in 1995, got NBFC licence in 2002 and after RBI nod in 2018 ownership moved to Chinese controlled firm,” the ED said. While the foreign parent firms of PCFS brought in Rs 173 crore as FDI for lending business, within a short time the company made foreign remittances of Rs 429 crore for fake software services received from related foreign companies. “PCFS also showed high domestic expenditure of Rs 941 crore. Most of its foreign payments were made to companies related/owned by Chinese who run the Opera group. The Chinese picked the foreign service providers and price,” the ED said. According to ED officials, all PCFS payments were as ordered by country head Zhang Hong who directly reports to Zhou. PCFS sent Rs 429 crore to 13 foreign companies in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, US and Singapore in the guise of payments for license fee for Cashbean mobile app (Rs 245 crore/ annum), software technical fee (about Rs 110 crore) and online marketing & advertisement fee (about Rs 66 Crore). “All these services are available in India at a fraction of the cost incurred by PCFS. All its clientele are in India but huge payments were made abroad without proof of receipt. During the same period, PCFS also booked domestic expenditure of similar amount under the same heads. PCFS management failed to give any justification for these expenses and admitted all remittances were done to move money out of India to accounts of group companies controlled by the Chinese promoter,” the ED said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/enforcement-directorate-seizes-107-crore-from-chinese-loan-app-firm/articleshow/85674928.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Officers on Thursday said they’re yet to find any strong clue about the accused. The incident occurred at a secluded stretch at the Chamundi foothills in Mysuru on Tuesday night. Based on the little information provided by the woman and her friend, police also filed a case of dacoity, indicating the six-member gang had indulged in extortion and blackmail after the heinous act. Three construction workers have been detained in this connection. Police sources said the accused, who were in an inebriated state, had made a video of the assault and demanded Rs 5 lakh for not uploading it on social media. They had taken turns to rape the student for two hours, police said. “Since the place is isolated and people fear the movement of leopards, the accused were sure their act would go unnoticed and no one would come to the woman’s rescue,” the officers said. The rape survivor and her friend are still under physical and mental stress, and police are waiting for their detailed statements before sketches of the perpetrators are drawn up. “We have been gathering information from the woman’s friend, but no breakthrough has been made so far,” said additional director-general of police (law and order) CH Pratap Reddy, who is heading the probe. According to him, an FIR has been registered under IPC sections 376D (gang rape) and 397 (robbery or dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt). Sources said the miscreants had hit the woman’s friend repeatedly with a small boulder, slapped and assaulted him. Though they both promised they wouldn’t tell anyone about the incident, the accused didn’t relent. Police recovered empty beer bottles and cans from the area. Sources said they are working on tracking calls from the tower location as they suspect the accused spent more time there. The National Commission for Women has taken suo motu notice of the gang-rape and registered a case. Rekha Sharma, chairperson, said the commission would meet the woman on Friday. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said the government has taken the incident “seriously” and the perpetrators will be caught soon. “It is a big challenge for Karnataka cops since officers have been roped in from different districts...We have some experts in our team and I am confident the case will be cracked at the earliest,” Reddy said.

Pictures of ex-communication and IT minister Syed Ahmad Shah Saadat, clad in an orange vest typical of Lieferando food delivery staff in Germany, broke the internet after a journalist tweeted about meeting a man who claimed to have been part of the Ghani-led government in Afghanistan for two years. Saadat, a highly qualified professional with a master’s degree each in communications and electronic engineering from Oxford University, was a minister from 2018 until his resignation last year. He arrived in Germany with his family last December to make a new beginning. Not that he knew the Taliban would capture Afghanistan this easily and so soon. In an interview, Saadat said, “The fall of the Ghani government so quickly was not expected.” So, how difficult was it for an ex dignitary to give up his lifestyle in Afghanistan for the rigours of working class? “I feel safe in Germany. I am happy to be with family. I want to save money and do a German course and study further,” he was quoted as saying by local media.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/simple-and-safe-former-afghan-minister-happy-to-deliver-pizzas-in-germany/articleshow/85674944.cms||---

Highlights of the budget include a 3% cut in Vat on petrol, education and crop loan waivers. The allocation of resources will be Rs 1,200.4 crore under the capital head and Rs 8,724 crore under the revenue head. The territory must mobilize Rs 6,190 of the budget from its own resources while it will receive Rs 1,729.8 crore as central assistance. The allocation under centrally-sponsored schemes will be Rs 320.2 crore. The territory must meet the remaining allocation of Rs 1,684.4 crore from open market borrowings and loans from central financial institutions. “Ours is a government that listens to the voices of the people and responds proactively. I have sincerely attempted in this budget to give priority for poverty reduction, health, education, housing for the poor, water resources management in irrigation, socio-economic development of SC/ ST, fishermen, women, and children despite revenue constraints,” Rangasamy said. He pointed out that a major portion of the financial resources will be utilized to meet the committed expenditure. The government will allot Rs 2,140 crore (21.6%) for salaries, Rs 1,050 crore (10.6%) for pensions and Rs 1,715 crore (17.3%) for payment of loans and interest, and Rs 1,591 crore (16%) for power purchase. Other major expenditures include old-age pension and allied welfare measures of Rs 1,290 crore (13%) and grant-in-aid to public sector undertakings, local bodies, cooperative institutions, and societyrun higher education institutions of Rs 1,243 crore (12.5%). The budget promises waiving educational loans SC/ST students availed through Padco and free education for SC/ST students from Class I to college from this year. Crop loans availed by farmers in cooperative banks will be waived. “Vat on petrol in Puducherry and Karaikal regions will be immediately reduced by 3% in view of the impact of the prevailing petrol price hike. This will reduce the petrol price by Rs 2.43 per litre,” Rangasamy said. The total outstanding debt of the UT as of March 31 was Rs 9,334.78 crore, which is 22.17% of the GSDP (2020-21), well within FRBM norms. Rangasamy said the average growth rate of GSDP of the Union territory stood around10% as against the average national GDP growth of 7% to 8%. He said the government has submitted a detailed project report to Centre to set up a national school of planning and architecture at Rs 334.3 crore. The government has also proposed a 500-bed hospital at Gorimedu to treat epidemic infectious diseases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/puducherry/puducherry-gets-rs-9924-crore-budget-for-2021-2022-vat-on-petrol-cut-by-3/articleshow/85674942.cms||Bosco Dominique

At least two blasts tore through crowds of people trying to flee Afghanistan, causing “total panic”. Wounded men in blood-soaked clothes were ferried away from the scene in wheelbarrows, while a boy clutched the arm of a man with a head injury, in images posted on social media. “Bodies, flesh and people were thrown into a canal nearby,” Milad, who was at the scene of the first blast, told AFP. “When people heard the explosion there was total panic. The Taliban then started firing in the air to disperse the crowd at the gate,” a second witness said. “I saw a man rushing with an injured baby in his hands.” In the confusion, he said he dropped the documents he hoped would help him board a flight with his wife and three children. “I will never ever want to go (to the airport) again. Death to America, its evacuation and visas.” The explosions happened at Abbey Gate, one of Hamid Karzai International Airport’s main entries, and the Baron Hotel, which boasts of “the most secured lodging arrangement in Kabul” on its website. After the explosion at Abbey Gate, sounds of gunfire and sirens could be heard. Taliban fighters, wearing a medley of uniforms, brandished lengths of pipe and cables in an attempt to clear the crowds that had gathered earlier to try to enter the airport. “There was an explosion against the Americans, a bunch of people were killed, civilians and military,” said one Taliban fighter at the gate, who declined to give his name. “The situation is out of control. There’s a lot of dead people on the ground there.” A video posted on Twitter after the explosions appeared to show bloodied bodies piled on a sidewalk and floating in a canal near the entrance to the airport. At one emergency hospital, ambulance after ambulance could be seen arriving under the glare of floodlights and the eyes of an anxious crowd, some of them children. A journalist and former government worker wept as she described how she had received a call from a taxi driver, informing her that her husband was among the wounded. “I begged him not to go, but he went this morning with his government I.D. card to try to show the foreigners,” she said. “We have four children. What will happen to us now?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/panic-chaos-anger-as-twin-blasts-rock-kabul-airport/articleshow/85674973.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Support, resentment greet BBMP’s vaccination diktat||BENGALURU: Barely hours after the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) issued a circular making it mandatory for all commercial establishments to vaccinate staff by the end of the month, Karnataka Pradesh Hotels and Restaurants Association said the civic body cannot compel anyone to take the vaccine. Following a surprise check by Shankar Reddy, commissioner, Rajarajeshwari Nagar zone, who found eight in 10 people whom he spoke to in the zone on Wednesday were not vaccinated, the Palike issued a circular mandating commercial establishments, including industries, hotels and offices to ensure all their employees get least one dose of the vaccine by August 31. BBMP has authorized marshals and health officials to enter workplaces and check compliance. Violators will be punished under section 188 of IPC, as defined in the Epidemic Diseases Act. Vaccine certificates of staff must be produced on demand. The order received a mixed response with some resenting it and others welcoming the move. Chandrashekar Hebbar, president, hotels association, said they support vaccination, but there cannot be any compulsion. “We told our cooks to compulsorily get vaccinated and show certificates, but we cannot pressure cleaners and waiters to take the jab,” Hebbar said. “Some of our staff tell us they have taken the jab and the certificates are at home. If we keep doubting our staff, they will leave. Our industry needs to run.” Sujatha Ravi, a roadside street eatery owner in Jayanagar who fears side effects of the shot, said, “Vaccination is a personal choice. How can BBMP force me to take it? I do not want to spread the virus to my family or customers, and I take precautions. But forcing me to get the vaccine is unacceptable.” SG Adithya, general secretary, Indiranagar Owners, Traders, and Resident Welfare Association, supported vaccination, but said the compulsory order is unacceptable. “Employees in smaller shops and street vendors may not be able to waste a day to get the shot. They are like daily wage workers and cannot afford to not earn for a day,” Adithya said. “Instead the government should make alternate arrangements to provide them a meal or wage on the day they take the vaccine, so they do not lose out on their earnings.” However, many citizens believe vaccination should be made mandatory as it will reduce the spread of Covid-19. “The government is providing doses for free so people should get them. It will help them build immunity to fight the virus,” said Malini Krishnaswamy, a homemaker of Rajajinagar. “However, the government should provide some financial incentive to domestic maids, street vendors and small eatery owners to get the shot.” Murali Rao, a resident of Koramangala, said vaccination should be compulsory, considering the damage Covid-19 has caused. “Following the government’s mandate is important,” Rao said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-support-resentment-greet-bbmps-vaccination-diktat/articleshow/85674978.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Police said the 23-year-old woman was the daughter of a couple from a village near Sriperumbudur. Due to the pandemic, her parents were forced to work and had to leave their daughter alone at home. The minor boy noticed that the woman was alone in the house and went to her house to befriend her. Police said he went to her house two days ago and locked the door from inside and subsequently raped her.

Approval of boosters for three Covid-19 shots being administered in the US — those manufactured by Pfizer and partner BioNTech, Moderna Inc and Johnson & Johnson — is expected in mid-September, the report said, citing a person familiar with the plans. Pfizer and BioNTech have already started the application process for the approval of its booster shot in people 16 and older, saying it spurs a more than threefold increase in antibodies against the coronavirus. Earlier this week, US regulators granted full approval to Pfizer’s two-dose vaccine. Moderna said on Wednesday it has completed the real-time review needed for a full approval for its jab in people 18 and above. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in her daily briefing that any such development would be under the purview of the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. The CDC said the government’s plan to administer booster shot depends on pending action from the Food and Drug Administration and recommendation to it from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The FDA, however, reiterated its statement from last week that said the government was gearing up to roll out the third shot from mid-September to Americans who had their initial course of two-dose vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer over eight months ago. The rollout would start if the FDA and the CDC decide that boosters are needed, officials had said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-mulls-booster-6-months-after-2nd-jab-instead-of-8/articleshow/85675007.cms||---

Scientists from CDFD and several forensic labs in the country have conducted a study on population of five Indian states to find out the forensic relevance of certain genes. The study also reconfirmed earlier findings that the population of Telangana is much closer to the populace of Madhya Pradesh. The research paper, ‘Assessment of Significance and Forensic Relevance of SE33 (ACTB) Locus in Five Indian Populations’ was published recently in ‘Gene Reports’ journal. Varsha Srivastava, one of the authors who contributed to the analysis of Telangana population told, TOI, “The genome profile is a signature profile of an individual or population as DNA fingerprinting gives a unique set of patterns.” The probability of matching a profile with any other source is always unique and therefore can be used to establish the identity of the person. “DNA database can be helpful not only in police investigation and forensic identification purposes but also in evolutionary studies,” she added. SE33 is the potential marker for human identification, especially for solving paternity disputes and analysis of mixed samples. “Different populations from Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan were subjected for analysis. In all, 1,400 blood samples of randomly selected unrelated individuals from various regions of these states were collected for analysis. Samples were genotyped and studied for allelic variability of the marker. The statistical data was also compared with the population from countries like Malayasia, Portugal, Bahrain and Columbia. The highest genetic variability was reported in the Malaysian population,” Varsha added. The highest genetic diversity was found in the population of Himachal Pradesh, while the least was found in Rajasthan. Allele-19 (a variant form of gene), was the most frequent allele for the Telangana population making it a good choice for forensic applications and genealogical studies,” she added. In Telangana, around 305 samples, mostly drawn from Goud and Muslim communities, were genotyped and evaluated for allelic diversity and statistical parameters for SE33 marker.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cdfd-study-finds-novel-marker-in-telangana-population-may-help-in-cracking-crime/articleshow/85675010.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||World||Why the baby on Nirvana’s ‘Nevermind’ album is suing now||Spencer Elden was 4 months old when he was photographed by a family friend in 1991 drifting naked in a pool. The picture, taken at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Centre in Pasadena, California, would be used that year for the cover of “Nevermind”, Nirvana’s seminal second album that helped define Generation X and rocketed the Seattle band to international fame. In the decades that followed, Elden appeared to celebrate his part in the classic cover, recreating the moment for the album’s 10th, 17th, 20th and 25th anniversaries, though not naked. “It’s cool but weird to be part of something so important that I don’t even remember,” he said in 2016 in an interview. Now, however, Elden, 30, has filed a federal lawsuit against the estate of Kurt Cobain, the musician’s former bandmates, David Grohl and Krist Novoselic, and Cobain’s widow, Courtney Love, among other parties. He claimed that they, along with Geffen Records, which released “Nevermind”, profited from his naked image. It is one of the bestselling records of all time, with at least 30 million copies sold worldwide. “Defendants knowingly produced, possessed, and advertised commercial child pornography depicting Spencer, and they knowingly received value in exchange for doing so,” according to the lawsuit filed on Tuesday. Elden suffered “permanent harm”, including emotional distress and a “lifelong loss of income-earning capacity”. The lawsuit said that Elden is seeking $150,000 from each of the 15 people and companies named in the complaint, including the photographer Kurt Weddle. Weddle paid Elden’s parents $200 for the photo, which was later altered to show the baby chasing a dollar, dangling from a fishhook. Elden said his feelings about the cover began to change “a few months ago, when I was reaching out to Nirvana to see if they wanted to be part of my art show.” He said he was referred to managers and lawyers. “Why am I still on their cover if I’m not that big of a deal?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/why-the-baby-on-nirvanas-nevermind-album-is-suing-now/articleshow/85675015.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Act if complainants turn hostile, says Pocso court||MUMBAI: In a rare instance, a Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act court this week directed the prosecution to take legal steps against a now 21-year-old woman and her mother for turning hostile in a case where they had accused a 22-year-old of raping the youngster as a minor and getting her pregnant. The alleged victim, a former state-level throwball player, claimed to be 17 years old when she became pregnant. In a police complaint, she had accused the man who impregnated her of rape. The alleged victim and accused then married in June 2019, four months after the FIR was lodged, and are now parents to a daughter. “The marriage between the accused and the victim may be the reason because of which they have not supported the prosecution case. But because of their attitude, the backbone of the prosecution case has collapsed,” the court said. The woman and her mother had turned hostile during the trial, retracting from their earlier statements. ‘Couldn’t prove victim was a minor, drop Posco charges’The court said that nothing has come on record to prove the guilt of the accused. “…so I am constrained to conclude that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the offence of…rape on the victim by the accused,” the court said. As an option, the prosecution can move to invoke perjury charges against the duo. Perjury is wilfully making a false testimony under oath. In India it attracts a punishment of imprisonment up to seven years. The FIR said that as a sportsperson, the complainant used to travel across the city for her coaching. During her practice, she met the accused, also a player. The FIR said that in January 2019, the accused called her to a railway station to meet him. From there, he took her to a room where he proposed to her and forced her to have sex. It was alleged that this happened three times. The FIR further said that in March 2019 after her HSC board exams, the minor suffered from jaundice. Subsequently, in June 2019 when she had stomach pain and her mother took her to a doctor, she was found to be six months pregnant. Her mother, therefore, took her to the police station and alleged that the accused under the false promise of marriage, raped the minor. The court said that the prosecution could not prove in court that the alleged victim was a minor and dropped the Pocso charges.

This is the second time after July 15 that a TMC team met the EC. The delegation, comprising Saugata Roy, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, Mahua Moitra, Jawhar Sircar and Sajda Ahmed, submitted a memorandum elaborating TMC’s response to the Election Commission’s letter to parties seeking their opinion over holding of bypolls. EC assured it would hold bypolls as per its mandate and based on assessment of Covid situation after consultation with chief secretary and West Bengal CEO. TMC senior Saugata Roy said: “The number of Covid cases is on the decline. We gave specific figures of Covid cases in the seven assembly segments. The EC acknowledged the figures because they tally with those with the commission.” Bypolls are due in the seats of Bhowanipore, Khardah, Santipur, Bongaon, Gosaba and Dinhata. Elections could not be held in Samserganj and Jangipur in Murshidabad. Moitra pointed out that the EC was in favour of holding the bypolls. “They asked us if we wanted all the five assembly bypolls at one go or hold them at different dates. The impression we got was that the EC might consider holding the bypolls in two phases.” The TMC delegation was supposed to leave for Delhi on Friday. But the team brought it forward as desired by the Trinamool chief because Saugata and Sukhendu had to represent TMC at the all-party meet on Afghanistan on Thursday. Shobhandeb Chattopadhyay resigned as MLA after being elected from Bhowanipore to make way for Mamata Banerjee to contest from that seat in the bypolls. The CM has to get elected by November to continue in her chair. The Bengal BJP is not too interested in the assembly bypolls as in the civic polls. Bengal BJP leaders have conveyed to the party brass that Covid cases were picking up in Bengal again. They also fear that TMC wouldn’t give them a level-playing ground for campaign because police were rounding up BJP leaders, including Union ministers, participating in party programmes under the Disaster Management Act. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said: “ Is the pandemic over? The state government is not allowing local trains. The CM has announced that schools will reopen after the puja vacation. But she wants assembly bypolls.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/trinamool-team-meets-ec-again-over-holding-of-bypolls/articleshow/85671634.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Chief minister Mamata Banerjee may visit north Bengal in early September||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to visit north Bengal from September 6-9. This will be her first visit to Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar after assembly polls. Banerjee is likely to hold an administrative meeting in Uttarkanya, the north Bengal secretariat, and review various ongoing projects and schemes, including the Duare Sarkar programme. The CM’s proposed schedule follows certain developments in north Bengal politics. The former North Bengal development department minister from Cooch Behar, Rabindranath Ghosh, took charge as North Bengal Development Board (NBDB) chairman in Siliguri on Thursday. The same day, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) faction chief Anit Thapa tendered his resignation from the party, weeks after Binoy Tamang quit and called on Gorkha leader Bimal Gurung, who had thrown his weight behind the Trinamool government ahead of assembly polls. Also, the visit is timed immediately after junior Union ministers Nisith Pramanik and John Barla participated in BJP’s Shaheed Samman Yatra in Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar. Political observers are keenly following Trinamool’s recovery plans in Darjeeling, Cooch Behar, Alipurduar and Jalpaiguri, where BJP won most seats despite its poor show in south Bengal. Ghosh’s taking charge as NBDB chairman assumes significance after BJP’s Cooch Behar leader Pramanik was made Union MoS for home affairs. BJP also made Alipurduar MP Barla a junior Union minister, sending out the signal to Adivasis in the Dooars that the party cared for them. Trinamool sources said Banerjee wanted to break BJP’s support bases in north Bengal by taking it on over fomenting sentiments for a separate north Bengal state. “Oto shoja noi (It is not so easy).

Apparently, a letter of resignation submitted by Thapa in the Calcutta High Court is doing the rounds on social media. Issued on July 16, 2021, it is addressed to the vice-president of GJM which has been received and stamped. The Gurung faction, however, claimed Thapa was trying to fool people to stay in power using the GJM party and flag. “We have the document which he (Thapa) submitted in the HC. He resigned a day after Binoy Tamang, former president of the other faction, resigned. How come Thapa continues to use the GJM party and flag?” asked Bhuwan Khanal, senior leader of the Gurung faction. Thapa had earlier announced that he would float a new party in September.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/gurung-faction-slams-thapa/articleshow/85671758.cms||Deep Gazmer

---||Kolkata||‘Practitioner nurses’ to be allowed to do some doctor jobs, says West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Experienced nurses from government hospitals will now be designated “practitioner nurses” and allowed to perform the duties of junior doctors, in the absence of senior medics or to assist them, chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced on Thursday after a meeting on health infrastructure with senior officials at SSKM Hospital. Banerjee also said that “quacks” (medical practitioners) would be used at rural health centres for preliminary treatment, as there were not always enough fully qualified doctors to serve at those centres. “We are short of doctors, and to bridge the gap we have planned to give promotion to expert nurses as ‘practitioner nurses’. Many nurses are well experienced and work well. Now, they will be able to practice as well, for which the state health department will issue guidelines. These nurses will work with responsibility,” Banerjee said, adding that the number of nurses would also be increased at hospitals. She said the decision to utilise ‘quacks’ was taken because it took time to earn a doctor’s degree. “And there is always a shortage. So, we can have more quacks to fill in for them at the preliminary stage of treatment,” she added. Mamata Banerjee at SSKM on ThursdayThe CM said a 10-acre plot had been identified for the purpose of constructing a housing complex for doctors, which would be given free. She is scheduled to meet the principals of five government medical colleges in the city on September 16 at SSKM to again review the health infrastructure. After the onset of the second wave of the pandemic last May, the state government had announced that 2,75,000 quacks across the state would be used as the first line of defence against Covid. They were called ‘Swasthya Suraksha Bandhu’. Banerjee said that steps were being taken to inoculate the parents of children below 12 years old on a priority basis. The CM discussed the setting up of a cancer hospital on the SSKM campus, to be built with the collaboration of Tata Cancer Hospital. She directed Firhad Hakim, chairman, board of administrators, KMC, to set up a foot overbridge to connect the two campuses. Banerjee also sought link roads at SSKM Hospital to connect different departments within the hospital so that staff could easily move between one to another. Health secretary N S Nigam was also present at the meeting, which reviewed the health infrastructure before the probable third wave of the pandemic. Ten thousand beds had been kept ready at the paediatric wards, it was announced.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/practitioner-nurses-to-be-allowed-to-do-some-doc-jobs-cm/articleshow/85672126.cms||Debashish Konar
---||Kolkata||Sushmita may lead Trinamool charge in Tripura, Assam||Kolkata: The Trinamool Congress is eyeing the Northeast in the run-up to the next general elections and may ask former Congress MP Sushmita Dev to nurse the party organisation in Tripura and Assam, both BJP strongholds. Mamata Banerjee’s party is hoping to wrest some of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in the seven northeastern states and Sikkim in 2024, not a mean feat if achieved given that the Northeast Democratic Alliance of 11 parties supports the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. “The party may entrust former MP Sushmita Dev with the responsibility to nurse the party organisation in Tripura and Assam,” Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Ray said, adding that the party would not give the BJP a walkover in the Northeast. Both Tripura and Assam have a substantial Bengali-speaking population. Sushmita, a former MP from Silchar who recently joined Trinamool, told a private TV channel that Congress was not “interested” in the Northeast while the BJP was “hand in glove” with Maulana Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) in Assam. The daughter of former Union minister Santosh Mohan Dev, Sushmita is well acquainted with the political situation in Assam and Tripura. Her father was elected to Parliament five times from Silchar and twice from Tripura West.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/sushmita-may-lead-trinamool-charge-in-tripura-assam/articleshow/85671184.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal keen on judicious solar, thermal mix||Kolkata: The Bengal government wants to strike an intricate balance between solar and thermal power, with the climate crisis pushing for faster and drastic transition to renewable energy. Solar for day time and thermal, with a judicious mix of battery storage, for night might be a plausible solution, experts said.. Additional chief secretary, power, S Suresh Kumar said: “Bengal is blessed with natural resources like a number of coal mines. We don’t need to carry coal more than 20-30 km for power generation.” Solar power, however, costs half or less compared to thermal power station of the same capacity, and solar power generates more jobs, he said at the 14th environment and energy conclave of Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCC&I). An increasingly alert consumer will go for cheaper energy like solar power, he said According to Kumar, fear of job loss with the transition from thermal to solar was unfounded. Earlier, TERI distinguished fellow Manjeev Singh Puri, a former foreign service officer and an ambassador, said: “There is a great opportunity for industries in Kolkata, which serves as gateway to southeast Asia. The fossil fuel-based projects are getting less and less bankable by international investors. Indian Inc in Kolkata can play a role by floating renewable energy-based projects to attract easy global funding.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bengal-keen-on-judicious-solar-thermal-mix/articleshow/85671657.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Bankura police sources said that four accounts belonging to Mukherjee have been frozen while those in the names of his children are under scanner. Cops claimed they have mounting evidence of Mukherjee’s accounts showing huge amounts of transactions in the run-up to the assembly elections. They are also probing the possible role of Mukherjee grabbing some prime property in the temple town of Bishnupur and areas around it. In court on Thursday, defence counsel Gouranga Prasad Biswas pointed to Mukherjee’s failing health and pleaded bail, which was strongly opposed by public prosecutor Indra Narayan Biswas, who said Mukherjee’s questioning was essential to recover government assets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ex-minister-in-cop-custody-4-a/cs-frozen/articleshow/85671849.cms||Falguni Banerjee

A day earlier, CM Mamata Banerjee had tweeted her joy at reaching the milestone of 1 crore visitors since the launch of its second phase eight days back. More than 22,000 camps are being operated in panchayat and municipal areas, where the major rush is for the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme. Till Thursday, the enrolment for Lakshmir Bhandar was over 90 lakh. Women in the age group of 25-60 will get a monthly direct bank transfer of Rs 500 in the general category and Rs 1,000 in the SC/ST category, if they are not in a government job or pensioners. The camps will continue till September 15. There was chaos at a Duare Sarkar camp at Howrah’s Dasnagar as people rushed to reach the counters when gates were opened. Around a dozen women were injured and RAF and senior officials were deployed to control the situation. Chief secretary H K Dwivedi told DMs to arrange more camps with increased manpower to avoid a repeat of the situation. There had also been complaints that Covid norms were not followed in many camps.

---||Mumbai||Amitabh Bachchan’s police bodyguard shunted ‘over Rs 1.5 crore income’||MUMBAI: Jitendra Shinde, a head constable with the Mumbai police assigned the responsibility of being actor Amitabh Bachchan’s bodyguard, was transferred to D B Marg police station on Thursday by city police commissioner Hemant Nagrale after reports emerged that he was earning an annual income of Rs 1.5 crore. The state government is checking whether Shinde had informed police authorities about his annual income and his assets and whether he was drawing a second salary from another source, which is prohibited under state service rules. Though a senior IPS officer told TOI that Shinde, who had been with Bachchan since 2015, was shifted “in a routine manner as per the new guidelines prescribed by Nagrale, who had made it clear no police constable will continue on the same post beyond five years”, the transfer took place immediately after reports surfaced on Thursday about the head constable’s alleged income. Pressure on Mum police not to shift star’s guard? Bachchan has been provided with X-category security, which means there are two constables with him per shift. Shinde was one of them. “We are in the process of conducting a departmental probe against Shinde over his annual income and assets,” the IPS officer told TOI. The IPS officer said that apart from reports about Shinde’s income, the police department has been informed that Shinde’s wife runs a major business which includes providing security guards to leading personalities. “As of now, we do not have specific or concrete information. On the basis of reports in a section of the media, we will first issue Shinde a show-cause notice and secure basic information from him. We are keen to know if, despite the state government paying him a regular salary, he was accepting an additional monthly salary from some other agency. As per Maharashtra’s service rules, a government servant cannot accept a salary from two establishments. The future course of action will depend on his reply to the show-cause notice,” the IPS officer said. Asked if Shinde has been relieved from Bachchan’s assignment, the IPS officer confirmed he had been, but said “pressure was mounting on Mumbai police not to shift him in view of his association with the star”. As per reports, Shinde has been among Bachchan’s trusted guards and has travelled with him for all his work assignments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/amitabh-bachchans-police-bodyguard-shunted-over-rs-1-5-crore-income/articleshow/85675085.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
