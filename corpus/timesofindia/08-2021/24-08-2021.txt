---||Kolkata||#WeddingRush: Guest cap prompts families to splurge on food, decor, jewellery and more||The wedding industry was among the worst hit last year with several couples postponing or curtailing their marriage ceremonies due to lockdown restrictions amid the pandemic fury. But this year the business is showing some green shoots as event planners are flooded with booking enquiries for weddings scheduled from November onwards. With the guest limit capped at 50, families are now splurging most of their wedding budgets on fancier food, decor, jewellery and venues. “A lot of people got married post the second wave, fearing the third wave may hit us soon. Those who cancelled their weddings last year are getting married now, so the rush is back,” said wedding planner Manoj Kheria, adding that since the guest list is now much smaller, people are using the money saved there on venues, clothes, decor and food. “The wedding calendar is chock-a-block from November. It seems the lull is over and people have started to accept the new normal, helping the wedding industry get back on its feet,” said Manoj. Wedding planner Bhavna Hemani agreed and said the mindset is changing and people are now eager to get married even with restrictions in place. “The last few months saw many weddings. With fewer guests, these ceremonies have become a more intimate affair, allowing everyone to interact with each other better. The money saved on wedding venues and catering is now being used on the bride’s outfit and jewellery. Some are also spending that on decor and to organise live performances,” she said. As people can’t go for destination weddings now, some families are asking for the venues to be decorated in a way that it resembles their dream location. “There are a lot of bookings from November till January. The vaccination drive has helped change people’s mindsets and outlook towards weddings,” added Bhavna. Pandemic couples more practicalAfter the pandemic ruined wedding plans for many last year, couples have now become more practical. Businesswoman Pooja Gandhi Malani is one of them. “I think my decision to get married in the pandemic was right because no one knows when this is going to be over. The gathering was small, but both the families made peace with it,” she said. Professional Shreya Dutta (name changed on request), who got married recently, made sure all her guests were vaccinated. “We even chose an open space to make everyone feel comfortable and safe. We couldn’t invite all our guests, but one has to abide by the norms,” she said. Professional Radhika Juthani had initially planned to get married in 2020, but it got postponed multiple times till this year. “We invited 50 people to each of our functions and divided the guest list so that everyone can attend at least one of the functions. While some came for mehendi, they skipped the wedding and vice-versa. I’m glad that our relatives and friends took it sportingly as that was the only way we could make all our close ones a part of our celebrations,” said Radhika. Jewellers rejoiceWith just 50 guests at weddings, families are being left with a major portion of their overall budget. A lot of them are investing that in jewellery. Said Rupak Saha from a jewellery shop in Kolkata, “This year, we did 70% more business in the wedding season compared to 2020. People are again splurging on jewellery for marriages. Earlier, Bengalis preferred only gold ornaments during weddings, but now they are opting for diamond and platinum too.” Jeweller Kamal Dutta feels the industry is gradually picking up pace, thanks to the wedding season. “The number of weddings has gone up considerably this year. Our industry is looking up and we are positive about a turnaround,” said Dutta. Food in focus Another area where people are spending more now is food and catering. “Those who used to have a budget of Rs 800 per person for 500 guests are now willing to spend Rs 1,200-1,500 per guest now because of the cap on the number of people,” said Rongon Neogi, who runs a catering service. S Ramani, who runs a restaurant that provides catering service at weddings, said business has been much better this season, compared to last year. “We have already been a part of many weddings in 2021, and we already have inquiries for events starting from November. The COVID vaccination has instilled confidence among people,” said. Decor budget upBanquets, florists and everyone else involved with the decor aspect of wedding functions are also happy with the improvement in their business. “Lots of weddings are taking place this year. The florists are doing extremely well as the wedding hosts are spending more on decor now,” said Ritu Jagnani, a wedding planner. After a dismal run last year, local flower shops at Gariahat are finally heaving a sigh of relief. “Now that people are not postponing their marriages anymore, we are getting a lot of orders and expecting to make up for last year’s losses,” said Bablu Saha from a flower shop in Gariahat. Hotels get advance bookingsStar hotels have also started getting inquiries for the next wedding season and are seeing fewer cancellations now. Said Arshad Ahmed from a five-star hotel, “Weddings are back with a bang this year and the business is 45-50% better than 2020 in terms of banquet bookings. Last year was all about cancellations, but this time we have already started getting booking requests for the upcoming wedding season.” Kumar Shobhan from another five-star hotel said last year they saw several weddings being cancelled or postponed. “But this year there has been a 50% growth in our wedding business. It seems we are now ready to keep the celebrations on despite restrictions and that is a welcome change," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weddingrush-guest-cap-prompts-families-to-splurge-on-food-decor-jewellery-and-more/articleshow/85562447.cms||Ruman Ganguly

India will bring them back later. This is expected to ease the pressure on the evacuation process in Kabul, and make repatriation smoother. Live updates: Afghanistan crisisOn Monday, 146 Indian nationals who had been flown to Doha from Kabul earlier were brought home, while another 78 were evacuated from the Afghan capital by an IAF C-130. However, another flight couldn't take off because of firing at the airport in which an Afghan security guard associated with Western forces was killed, throwing the airport again into chaos. On Tuesday, another flight left Kabul with several Afghan Hindus and Sikhs. Read AlsoWith the US gone, what happens to Afghanistan's economy?Unless the country embarks on high and sustained growth, it will be stuck in a low income, low development trapOfficial sources reiterated that the priority was to evacuate Indian nationals. PM Narendra Modi discussed the Afghanistan situation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the phone on Monday. Both emphasised the importance of maintaining peace and security and agreed that the priority was to repatriate stranded people.

He had spoken to Jean Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, when he was in New York last week. The German military had earlier in the day confirmed that US and German forces were involved in the airport clash. According to a CNN report, the clash began when a sniper outside the airport fired at Afghan guards helping US forces.

In their hurriedly-packed minimal belongings, they also carried three saroops of Sri Guru Granth Sahib - the holy book of Sikhs. In a video uploaded on social media, three Sikh men could be seen carrying the saroops, packed in suitcases, on their heads. Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri took to Twitter to say: "Three Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji are being escorted to the IAF aircraft at Kabul Airport. Forty-six Afghan Hindus and Sikhs along with stranded Indian nationals are blessed to return on the same flight." On Sunday, a group of around 24 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, including two MPs Anarkali Kaur Honaryar and Narender Pal Singh, has arrived in India. Nearly 200 more Afghan Sikhs and Hindus are still stranded in Afghanistan, Chandhok said.

---||India||Army women break another glass ceiling||NEW DELHI: Five women officers from "combat-support arms" have for the first time been cleared for promotion to the rank of Colonel (time-scale) in the Army after completing 26 years of service like their male counterparts. The Army on Monday cleared the promotion of Lieutenant Colonels Sangeeta Sardana (Corps of Signals), Sonia Anand and Navneet Duggal (Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers), and Reenu Khanna and Ritcha Sagar (Corps of Engineers) to the Colonel (time-scale) rank. An officer becomes a "selection-grade" Colonel in around 15-17 years. The "passed over" male officers become Colonel (time-scale) after completing 26 years of service. The promotion of the five women officers is the outcome of a Supreme Court order to the 13-lakh strong Army last year to end gender bias and grant permanent commission (PC) to women officers in eight more branches, in addition to previously existing legal and education wings. Consequently, the Army has till now granted PC to 424 of the 615 short-service commission (SSC) women officers (who can only serve for a maximum of 14 years) eligible for it. The Supreme Court had last week also allowed women to take the exam for the tri-Service National Defence Academy this year. Women officers, excluding the medical stream, number just about 1,650 in the 43,000-strong officer cadre in the Army. Till now, women officers could reach the rank of Colonel only in the medical, legal and education streams. "The widening of promotion avenues to more branches of the Army is a sign of increasing career opportunities for women officers. Combined with the decision to grant PC to women officers from a majority of branches of the Army, this step defines the Army's approach towards a gender-neutral force," said the Army on Monday. The eight new branches for women officers to get PC are Army Air Defence, Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, EME, Army Service Corps (ASC), Army Ordnance Corps and Intelligence Corps.Women officers are, however, still not allowed in main combat arms like infantry, mechanized infantry, artillery and armoured corps in the Army. But the IAF has 12 women fighter pilots. The Navy earlier this year also deployed four women officers on warships for the first time after a gap of 23 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-women-break-another-glass-ceiling/articleshow/85578863.cms||---
---||India||1.6 crore people in India have missed their 2nd shot||NEW DELHI: At least 1.6 crore people in India are yet to get second shot of the Covid vaccine 16 weeks after their first, the longest recommended gap between two shots. Over a crore of them are among the elderly, and the rest are from other vulnerable groups such as health and frontline workers and those aged over 45. The 1.6 crore figure was arrived at by looking at how many people had got their first shots as of May 2, that is 16 weeks back, and comparing it with the total number of those who have so far got their second. All data is from press releases issued by the health ministry. The government had on May 13 approved a gap of 12-16 weeks for Covishield, which accounts for over 85% of all vaccinations; for Covaxin, it's a much shorter 4-6 weeks. The number of people whose second shots are delayed beyond the recommended interval may well be higher since the calculation for 1.6 crore is based on 16 weeks for Covishield and not six weeks for Covaxin. So, the figure for those who've got both doses so far includes many who received their first shot after May 2. The number of people who are eligible for their second shot - after 12 weeks - and are yet to be fully vaccinated is 3.9 crore (again, this number may be higher since the minimum gap for Covaxin is four weeks compared to 12 for Covishield). According to government data, 12.8 crore persons from the priority groups of healthcare and frontline workers, 45-59 years and those over 60 years had got their first dose on May 2. Of them, 11.2 crore have got their second dose. Over one crore 60+ people, about 45 lakh in the 45-59 age group, 12 lakh-odd health workers and 1.8 lakh frontline workers from among those who had got their first shot by May 2 had not received their second dose as of Monday morning. Times ViewThe Covid numbers are coming down. But a lag in vaccination helps nobody's cause. These are vulnerable groups and the government must be proactive in vaccinating them at the earliest and ensure that they retain their protective power.One of the most important reasons given for the use of the CoWin platform for Covid immunisation was to ensure that groups more vulnerable, because of their risk of exposure such as health and frontline workers, and groups with higher mortality risk such as those above 45 years and the elderly could be accorded priority. However, the trend appears to be contrary to what was intended. For those in the 18-44 age group, vaccination opened only on May 1. On May 2 just over 86,000 in this age group got their first dose. Since then, vaccination among them has taken off with over 1.94 crore having got their second dose by Monday - driven to some extent by their employers organising camps and other initiatives to get them vaccinated. Overall, in the 18+ population, 48% have got at least one shot, but only about 14% who have got both. Vaccination for the 18-45 group opened on May 1, which is about 16 weeks ago.

---||Bengaluru||Drone survey of 30k properties in 3 Bengaluru wards this week||BENGALURU: Last week, the Karnataka government obtained clearance from Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to use drones for conducting a survey of properties in Bengaluru as part of its ambitious but much-delayed Urban Property Ownership Records (UPOR). The government, as part of a pilot, will be covering at least 30,000 properties spread across Pattabhiramnagar (number 168), Ganesh Mandir (number 165) and Shakambarinagar (number 179) wards. The project under the revenue department will be implemented by staff at Survey Settlement And Land Records (SSLR). Revenue secretary Tushar Girinath said it is being headed by Rajeev Chawla, additional chief secretary (e-governance), who had earlier helmed the government’s Bhoomi project, which digitised more than 2.5 crore RTCs (Records of Rights,Tenancy & Crops) of agricultural land across rural areas. Rajeev Chawla told TOI: “...We will start flying the drones this week, and weather permitting, the aerial survey should be completed by the end of the week as we only need to cover around 10,000-odd properties in each of these wards.” But the drone survey is just the beginning. Once imaging is completed by the drones, which will be operated by Survey of India (SoI), the department will need to digitise the images, which will then be laid over existing village maps to identify various types of land — government-owned, public, private, etc., — and verify if there is any illegal occupation. Surveyors to visit plots“Surveyors under the commissioner of SSLR will also visit each plot or land and make a record and determine who the owner is. We are confident that we should be able to complete this process by December,” Chawla said. If there are any issues with the SoI survey — technical or otherwise — the government also has permission to conduct a survey using a private firm. One company has offered to conduct it for free and is being kept on standby. Explaining the need for UPOR, Chawla said: “After implementation of Bhoomi, there has been no tampering of land records and citizens are at peace. But unlike with rural/agricultural land records, which were available in manual format with around 10,000 village accountants, there are no proper records for urban properties other than those maintained for tax purposes by agencies like BBMP, which do not have legal value from a civil dispute point of view as they aren’t created under the (Karnataka Land Revenue) Act.” He said UPOR was first mooted in 2008, but couldn’t take off for various reasons. Another official said that some pilots conducted in places like Shivamogga had come under criticism and people did not accept it, leading to further delay in implementation of a state-wide project. “...Finally, revenue minister (R Ashoka) issued a government order last year setting up an implementation committee to do a proof-of-concept. Therefore, we are not mapping the whole city. The reason for asking for a proof-of-concept is because earlier efforts have failed; we need to show how we can make this faster and make people accept it. So, once we complete the project in three BBMP wards, the review committee headed by the minister will look at how to include more people in this,” Chawla said. While creating property records in urban areas, the government has two objectives, he said. First, to ensure that no government/public land is allowed to be illegally occupied and second, not to penalise individuals for minor violations such as not obtaining an approved plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/drone-survey-of-30k-properties-in-3-bengaluru-wards-this-week/articleshow/85578960.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Bengaluru||New Education Policy takes off in Karnataka; admissions begin online||BENGALURU: The Karnataka government plans to bring in digitalisation and new research and development policies soon, said chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday during an event organised by the higher education department to launch admissions to undergraduate courses under the New Education Policy (NEP). “Digitalisation is important not just for education, but also for administrative works. We are planning a new digitalisation policy. We want every village to have internet connectivity. If we work with the same vigour as we did for NEP, we can be there quickly,” the CM said. The CM also announced giving tablet PCs to all first-year degree students from this session. A primary and secondary education council will be set up in the coming days. Students will be provided career guidance and mandatory personality development classes from class 8. While a government order rolling out NEP was signed on August 7, officially announced the launch of the policy on Monday. With this, admissions to first-year degree courses began online. Private colleges which have already completed admissions are hoping they will now only have to ask students what combination they would like to opt for as part of the new format prescribed by NEP. Helpline in placeThe state government also launched an NEP helpline — 080 24486666 — to guide stakeholders on the new framework. An exclusive NEP Karnataka website and social media handles will be launched with more information on NEP and to clear doubts, if any. The government is also planning YouTube live sessions, phone-ins and talks at various levels. In the new format, students can opt for two subjects from the discipline they choose to study and one elective from any other stream. They can also acquire 40% credits through online courses and transfer credits from one college to the other. This way, they will have the flexibility to seek transfer from one institution to another. Further, there are options of multiple entries and exits. Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan congratulated the state for being the first to roll out the policy. Bommai called it a “day of liberation” as the new framework will offer students more flexibility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nep-takes-off-in-ktaka-admissions-begin-online/articleshow/85578962.cms||---

The accused is Mubarak Pasha, a resident of Tarabanahalli near Chikkabanavara. He came under police radar after the parents of his wife, Shirin Banu, 28, lodged a complaint stating their daughter was missing since August 18 night. Following this, police launched a manhunt for her and questioned the family. When Pasha started avoiding cops, the latter intensified their probe. On Monday, Pasha along with his advocate visited the police station and confessed to having killed Banu and dumping her body in Chikkabanavara lake. Banu, a mother of three minor children, was a homemaker, while Pasha sells beds and pillows. Pasha reportedly told police: “I told her to cook chicken fry on August 18 night. When I came home, I was disappointed to see there was no chicken fry. When I asked my wife, she replied arrogantly and, in a fit of rage, I smashed her head using a wooden log. The children were asleep then. Wrapping the body in a gunny bag, I carried it on my bike at midnight and disposed it of in Chikkabanavara lake.” Police said the body is yet to be recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-kills-wife-for-not-making-chicken-fry/articleshow/85578964.cms||---

MP Srikanth, counsel for the association, informed the court that BBMP is disconnecting even those cables installed after obtaining permission. The association said respective cable operators need to be present when cables are being cut by the Palike, mainly to identify legal or illegal ones. The association contended that guidelines issued by the ministry of information and broadcasting provide right of way and that cannot be ignored while disconnecting cables. “The proposed respondent/impleading applicant is not against disconnection of illegal cables, but is aggrieved by BBMP’s erratic execution of the work. Its officials are disconnecting even local cables, thus causing huge monetary loss to the cable operators,” the association claimed. Allowing the application, a division bench headed by Justice Satish Chandra Sharma said BBMP is rightly trying to remove dangling cables obstructing pedestrian movement and disrupting traffic flow. If the association has any grievance, it should approach the Palike directly. Petitions challenging ZP, TP delimitation notices rejectedThe Karnataka high court on Monday dismissed a batch of petitions challenging the notifications pertaining to delimitation exercise of Raichur and Chikkaballapur zilla panchayats as well as Chikkanayakanahalli taluk panchayat, Tumakuru district. “The constitutional and statutory objectives cannot be effectively achieved unless delimitation exercise of this kind is undertaken by the Election Commission,” Justice M Nagaprasanna noted in his order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/operators-assn-can-approach-palike-over-erratic-cable-cutting-says-hc/articleshow/85578968.cms||---

While regular road users are already experiencing difficulty due to the shrinking carriageway, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) officials are trying to allay fears, saying the inconvenience won’t last long and work will be wrapped up before the 2025 deadline. According to BMRCL, the deadline for the ORR stretch (19.8km) is June 2025. The corridor will be extended from KR Puram to the international airport and the 38.4km line is slated to be ready by September 2025. However, BMRCL is yet to finalise the KR Puram-KIA tender. Preliminary work on Namma Metro’s ORR corridor has already begun, Metro officials confirmed, adding they are planning to finish the project without any delays since land acquisition is complete. BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez said: “The barricades placed for Metro work may reduce the road width and may increase traffic congestion in areas like Iblur and Marthahalli, but we will complete work as early as possible.” U-girders to speed up workBMRCL chief public relations officer BL Yeshwanth Chavan said: “Soil investigation and test piling work is progressing between Central Silk Board and KR Puram. The airport line tender will be finalised soon. We are coordinating with various stakeholders to manage traffic during Metro construction.” For the first time, BMRCL will be using U-girders on ORR to speed up work. “On the ORR-KIA route, U-girders will be used for almost 80% of the corridor’s length. Another 12% with sharp curves will have I-girders. About 8% will be below road level,” said an official. “One U-girder between two pillars can be erected overnight, against 5-6 days required in case of box girders,” he added. Currently, the bus priority lane is operational between KR Puram and Silk Board on ORR. Now, Metro work is likely to affect the lane in some sections since BMRCL requires 4.5m width on both sides of the median. Many commuters say bus lane and Metro work have increased traffic on ORR for the past few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/disruptions-due-to-metro-work-on-orr-wont-last-long-says-bmrcl/articleshow/85578971.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Enema helps cops find chain rowdy swallowed||BENGALURU: Scenes inside the jail ward of Victoria Hospital in the wee hours of Sunday bordered on the hilarious. Four police officials were pleading with a rowdy-sheeter to eat bananas. Not one but 15. They wanted Vijay Kumar alias Viji, in his early 20s and from JJ Nagar, to flush out a small piece of gold chain he had swallowed in a bid to prove he was innocent. An X-ray, however, showed the piece stuck in his stomach. After force-feeding of 15 bananas was of little help, Viji was administered enema solution on Sunday night. One Monday morning, the suspect excreted the piece of gold chain, weighing around 7.5 grams. Had targeted homemakerTrouble began around 9pm on Saturday when Viji and two of his associates, Sanjay and Prem, targeted a 31-year-old homemaker, V Hema of BVK Iyengar Road, who had stepped out of her house to buy milk, and tried to snatch her gold chain. Sanjay and Prem grabbed her from behind while Viji snatched her chain. However, Hema held on to the chain firmly and shouted for help. By then, Kiran, a neighbour of Hema, rushed to her rescue and caught hold of Viji. Hema managed to catch Sanjay, while Prem fled the scene. A crowd gathered at the spot and thrashed the duo black and blue. Soon, a Hoysala patrol vehicle arrived. “We asked Hema to first check her gold chain and whether there were any injuries on her neck. The chain was cut into two pieces. The larger portion was with Hema, while the smaller one was missing. Someone from the crowd said they saw Viji swallowing the chain seconds before the Hoysala arrived,” an investigating officer said. However, Viji argued he had not swallowed the piece and it may have fallen on the road. A thorough search was made by everyone, including cops, but in vain. “Since the suspects had been thrashed, we took them to Victoria Hospital for treatment. We told doctors that Viji had swallowed the chain, and they said they would administer enema solution the next day. By then, we brought around 15 bananas from the market and gave them to Viji. He ate them till Sunday afternoon. Doctors gave him enema at night,” an investigating official said. A case of attempt to robbery under IPC section 393 was booked against the trio. Police are looking for the third suspect, Prem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/enema-helps-cops-find-chain-rowdy-swallowed/articleshow/85578981.cms||---

---||World||G7 leaders plan to pledge unity on Taliban: Diplomatic sources||WASHINGTON: Leaders of the G7 advanced economies are expected to pledge unity on whether or not to officially recognise or sanction the Taliban when they meet virtually to discuss Afghanistan on Tuesday, according to two diplomatic sources. The United States allies are still smarting from Washington's delays in outreach after Kabul fell on August 15, and foreign diplomats in Washington said cooperation will be a key theme of the call. "The G7 leaders will agree to coordinate on if or when to recognise the Taliban," said one European diplomat. "And they will commit to continue to work closely together." The Taliban's lightning-fast takeover of the country this month, after the US troops started to withdraw and President Ashraf Ghani fled, left foreign governments scrambling and sparked a panicked mass exodus from the country. Leaders of the United States, Britain, Italy, France, Germany, Canada, and Japan may use the possibility of unified official recognition, or renewed sanctions to push the Taliban to comply with pledges to respect women's rights and international relations. Recognition is a political act taken by sovereign states with important consequences, including allowing the Taliban access to the foreign aid relied upon by previous Afghan governments. A 2020 agreement signed by the former Trump administration explicitly states that the group "is not recognised by the United States as a state". The tool of recognition is "one of the most important remaining pieces of leverage that we have," said Annie Pforzheimer, a retired US diplomat who served as the deputy chief of mission at the embassy in Kabul from 2017 to 2018. It would be "infinitely more powerful" if it is well coordinated and ensures that the new government is inclusive and recognises Afghanistan’s human rights commitments, she said. The G7 leaders will also discuss a possible extension of Biden's August 31 deadline for withdrawing the US forces to give them more time to locate and evacuate Western citizens, Afghans who aided NATO and the US forces and other vulnerable people, the sources said. Britain and France are pressing for more time, but a Taliban official said foreign forces had not sought an extension and it would not be granted if they did. "The United States have over 6,000 people in Kabul airport and when they withdraw that will take away the framework that has allowed us to withdraw and we will have to go as well," British defense minister Ben Wallace said on Monday. The G7 leaders will also commit to coordinate on any sanctions, resettlement of a wave of refugees, and concerns about possible attacks by Islamic State groups, the sources said. The G7 will take stock of the current evacuation efforts and commit to coordinating closely on further steps, including security, humanitarian assistance, resettlement of refugees and potential sanctions, the sources said. "We need to make sure that more funds are provided urgently for humanitarian aid," German foreign minister Heiko Maas said on Monday. "I believe the G7 countries should live up to their responsibilities and find a response to mitigate the acute humanitarian hardship that's already prevalent in the region and that will increase over the coming weeks." Biden told reporters on Sunday that the United States was already working with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuations, but that the Islamist group was "seeking legitimacy" in the longer term. That meant it would need "additional help in terms of economic assistance, trade, and a whole range of things", but the international response - including potential sanctions - would depend on their actions going forward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/g7-leaders-plan-to-pledge-unity-on-taliban-diplomatic-sources/articleshow/85578985.cms||---
---||India||To our readers: The trust of India||Every relationship - from the personal to the global - rests on the bedrock of trust. Companies and countries, individuals and institutions sign treaties and agreements, but even the most legally airtight documents are just pieces of paper without that all-powerful glue: Trust. Indeed, there are businesses that have run forever without any formal paperwork - such as the angadias or couriers of Mumbai who carry diamonds worth thousands of crores every year, often on the city's crowded local trains. They've been doing so for generations, and there are very few instances of anyone running away with the diamonds they've been entrusted to deliver. The dictionary defines trust as a "firm belief in the reliability, truth, or ability of someone or something". What it does not mention is that trust is not built in a day, a week, a month, a year. It takes time, and effort - and has to be earned every single day. As The Times of India has done, day after day, for 183 years and counting. Recently, a study by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which is housed in Oxford University, declared the most trusted of the major news brand in India covered in its survey, across formats, mediums and platforms - print, television, digital. It was official validation of what we've always known in our hearts and minds. Every morning, millions of people across the length and breadth of this vast, diverse country reach out to TOI to make sense of the increasingly complex world that we live in. They count on us to provide fair, accurate and unbiased news and information.

The survey, released as partIt's a responsibility that we take very seriously. More so now, at a time when words can easily become weapons, and an unthinking forward on social media can have catastrophic consequences. Trust is not acquired easily. It is accumulated painstakingly, through courage, dedication and an obsessive commitment to sifting fact from rumour, truth from propaganda. Our reporters and editors work tirelessly, across over 55 editions, to bring you the most accurate and balanced coverage. We're human, and sometimes we make mistakes. But we're quick to acknowledge them, and we take full responsibility for them. Bringing out the perfect paper is an elusive Holy Grail. But we'll never stop trying.

General Hank Taylor told reporters that 61 military, commercial and charter flights involving a number of countries flew out from Hamid Karzai International Airport in the 24 hours to 3.00 am Monday (0700 GMT) carrying people fleeing after the Taliban seized power. Of the total evacuated that day, 11,000 were taken out by the US military airlift operations, Taylor said. Taylor said the number of people relocated from Afghanistan since July on US flights hit 42,000, with 37,000 of those since the intense airlift operations started on August 14 as the Taliban took Kabul. That includes "several thousand" US citizens, and thousands of Afghans who worked for the US forces, who had applied for or received special immigrant visas, and Afghans seen as at risk to the Taliban attacks for their work in non-governmental organisations, media, and other jobs, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. Kirby said the focus remains on getting the US evacuation operations done by the August 31 deadline that President Joe Biden has set for completing the withdrawal from Afghanistan. That would require withdrawing the 5,800 US troops who have essentially run airport operations and maintained security since August 14, as well as large amounts of equipment brought in to support their mission. German, British and French officials said Monday that evacuations on their part could continue after August 31, and said they want the US force to stay in place to help the international airlift. On Tuesday leaders of the G7 group of wealthy nations will meet virtually on Afghanistan. "Whether or not the US can be persuaded to stay is a matter for the prime minister (Boris Johnson) tomorrow in the G7 meeting," British armed forces minister James Heappey told Sky News. Britain currently chairs the G7, also comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Kirby did not categorically rule out Washington extending the deadline, although the Taliban have said they will hold the US to it. For the United States, Kirby said, "The goal is to get as many people out as fast as possible." "The focus is on trying to do this as best we can, by the end of the month," he said. At the White House, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan deferred questions on extending the US pullout deadline to the G7 talks on Tuesday, saying the White House is taking the situation "day by day." He said Biden had already spoke with Johnson on Monday. "We remain in close touch with allies and partners to coordinate the evacuation of their own citizens and their priority personnel," Sullivan said. He added that there is enough time to evacuate all the US citizens in the country who have sought to leave. "We believe that we have time between now and the 31st to get out any American who wants to get out," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/16000-evacuated-from-kabul-airport-in-past-24-hours-pentagon/articleshow/85579063.cms||---

"Canada already recognises, and has for long, that the Taliban are terrorists, and harbour terrorists. That's why they're on the terrorist list. So, yes, we can talk about sanctions," Trudeau told reporters.  On Tuesday leaders of the G7 group of wealthy nations -- Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- will meet virtually on Afghanistan.  Trudeau said he was "looking forward to" a conversation "shortly with my fellow G7 leaders as we look at what more we can do."  Britain, which currently holds the rotating presidency of G7, has said that relief of existing sanctions "will depend on the behavior of the Taliban".  The Islamist group swept to power in mid-August, nearly 20 years after its first regime was toppled in 2001 by the US-led invasion of Afghanistan.  The United States and its allies are racing to evacuate tens of thousands of people from the country before US President Joe Biden's August 31 deadline for the final withdrawal of all its forces.  But with the European Union and Britain saying it would be impossible to get everyone out by then, Biden is under pressure to extend the deadline.  Britain said Monday it would urge the United States to extend it, while the Taliban warned any delay would lead to "consequences."  Trudeau did not reveal his position on pushing the deadline back.  He said Canada's focus remains "on getting as many Afghans out to safety as possible".  The situation remains "volatile and chaotic" near the airport in Kabul, where thousands of terrified Afghans fleeing Taliban rule have gathered for days in a bid to make it on to an evacuation flight, senior Canadian government officials said Monday.  Canada resumed flights to Kabul on Thursday for the first time since the Taliban seized the Afghan capital.  Four flights have taken off from Kabul to Canada, the latest of which carried 436 Canadian citizens and Afghan nationals on Sunday.  Nearly 900 Afghans have arrived in Canada under a new special immigration programme, the Canadian officials said. Canada recently pledged to take in 20,000 Afghan refugees under the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/canadas-trudeau-leaves-door-open-to-taliban-sanctions-as-g7-meet-looms/articleshow/85579131.cms||---
---||World||Insurgents claim to have recaptured 3 districts near unconquered Panjshir from resistance force||The Taliban have ruled out extending the August 31 deadline for the evacuation mission being carried out by foreign troops', and for the withdrawal of foreign troops themselves, saying that staying beyond the announced date will have "consequences". "If the US or UK were to seek additional time to continue evacuations - the answer is no. Or there would be consequences," Suhail Shaheen, Taliban spokesman for political office, said on Monday. Staying beyond the agreed deadline would be "extending occupation," he added. Without elaborating on what he actually meant by "consequences", Shaheen said a decision in this regard would be made by the Taliban leadership. Earlier, the Taliban had said that foreign troops staying on in Afghanistan after August 31 would be crossing a "red line". Following Shaheen's statement, the British PM's office said the UK would continue its evacuation as long as it was safe to do so. It said the evacuation process would be included in discussions at the G7 members meeting on Tuesday. The evacuation of people has been described as a challenging mission, with thousands of Afghans trying to flee. Shaheen urged the Afghan people to stay and rebuild their country instead of fleeing. "We want them to stay in the country but if they intend to go, they can... if they have the proper documents," the Doha-based Taliban representative said in an interview with the BBC on Monday. He said people could still leave on commercial flights after the expiry of the deadline for foreign troops to leave. Taliban forces have, meanwhile, recaptured the three districts, adjacent to the unconquered Panjshir valley, which had fallen last week to the National Resistance Front (NRF), an anti-Taliban resistance movement in northern Afghanistan. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, posted on Twitter: "Bannu, Pul-e-Hisar and Deh Salah districts of Baghlan province have been completely cleared of the enemy." He added: "The mujahideen were stationed at the gates of Panjshir from the directions of Takhar, Badakhshan and Andarab. The Salang Pass is open and the enemy is under siege in Panjshir. The Islamic Emirate is trying to solve the problem through talks." Pro-resistance accounts on social media had dismissed earlier claims of being pushed back. The Panjshir valley, a mountainous area surrounded by the high peaks of the Hindu Kush northwest of Kabul, had resisted the Taliban before 2001. Two Tajik leaders - Ahmad Massoud and Amrullah Saleh - have called on Afghan warlords and forces to join them in anti-Taliban resistance from Panjshir. Massoud, the 32-year son of the slain Afghan warlord and politician Ahmad Shah Massoud, has been leading the NRF. Members of private militias, remnants of the regular Afghan army and special forces units of the toppled Afghan government have joined the NRF. He has called for talks to form an inclusive government but has promised to resist if Taliban try to enter Panjshir. He is said to have gathered some 9,000 fighters. Saleh (48) is the defiant Afghan vice-president who had declared himself acting president after President Ashraf Ghani escaped the Taliban's dramatic entry into Kabul. "Talibs have massed forces near Panjshir a day after they got trapped in ambush zones in neighbouring Andarab valley and hardly went out in one piece, " Saleh said in a tweet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/insurgents-claim-to-have-recaptured-3-districts-near-unconquered-panjshir-from-resistance-force/articleshow/85579185.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||Taliban pledge inclusivity as transition talks begin||The Taliban have reached out to former President Hamid Karzai and to Russia in an attempt to fulfill their pledge to form an "inclusive" government and defeat holdouts against their rule, amid deadly mayhem outside Kabul's airport, with thousands of terrified Afghans trying to flee. Little in the Taliban's history suggests any readiness to compromise on their harsh Islamist principles or to share power, but the US has warned the militant group that going it alone will result in continuous conflict and isolation. In this context, Karzai, who led the county from 2001 to 2014, has tried to put himself forward as a mediator, albeit one under increasingly strained circumstances. Karzai, 63, who as president fell out with the US over American drone attacks, corruption accusations and other issues, has met with Taliban leaders, including Khalil Haqqani, whom the US has designated as a terrorist. Karzai is also working closely with Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the former Afghan's government's peace delegation. A Taliban leader described as the acting governor of Kabul talked over the weekend with Karzai and Abdullah. A growing number of senior Taliban have been seen in Kabul in recent days to discuss the shape of the next government, among them Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban's chief diplomat, who was a senior official in the group's government in the 1990s. A delegation of Taliban leaders also visited the Russian embassy in Kabul, asking officials there to pass along an offer of negotiations to a group of Afghan leaders holding out in northern Afghanistan, the Russian ambassador, Dmitri Zhirnov, told Russian television on Saturday. Karzai's position is tenuous. Both he and Abdullah were on a Taliban list of wanted people, and former government officials said they were concerned for their safety. How the US will view Karzai's re-emergence is unclear. So, too, is whether Afghans will be convinced by the sudden professed moderation of the Taliban. A week after the Taliban overran the country and the two-decade long American attempt to shape a democratic Afghanistan collapsed, there was no sign of any cabinet taking form.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/taliban-pledge-inclusivity-as-transition-talks-begin/articleshow/85579259.cms||---

The US military too confirmed gunfire outside the airport. "The incident appeared to begin when an unknown hostile actor fired upon Afghan security forces involved in monitoring access to the gate. The Afghans returned fire, and in keeping with their right of self-defence, so too did US and coalition troops," the statement said. Gunfire broke out near an entrance to the airport, where at least seven Afghans died a day earlier in a stampede of thousands of people. The German military tweeted that one member of the Afghan army was killed and three others were wounded by "unknown attackers." An Italian humanitarian organisation that operates hospitals in Afghanistan said it had treated six patients with bullet wounds from the airport. Taliban did not comment. The tragic scenes around the airport have transfixed the world. Afghans poured onto the tarmac last week and some clung to a US military transport plane as it took off, later plunging to their deaths. At least seven people died that day, in addition to the seven killed Sunday. The Taliban blame the chaotic evacuation on the US and say there's no need for any Afghans to flee. They have pledged to bring peace and security after decades of war and say they won't seek revenge on those who worked with the US, Nato.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/gunfire-at-kabul-airport-kills-afghan-soldier-3-others-injured/articleshow/85579473.cms||---
---||World||China may fill financial vacuum in Afghanistan||BEIJING: China on Monday hinted at stepping up financial assistance to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, saying it will play a "positive role" in helping the war-ravaged country amid global pushback to stop funding to Kabul until the Afghan militant group modified its hardline religious policies. In his media briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin called the US "main perpetrator" for the Afghan crisis and said Washington cannot leave without doing anything for Afghanistan's reconstruction. Asked about Afghanistan's exiled central bank chief's comment that the Taliban may go to China and Pakistan to replace the US for financial aid, Wang said, "I want to stress that the US is the main perpetrator and biggest external factor for the Afghan issue. It cannot leave the mess without doing anything. We hope the US will match its words with deeds and shoulder its responsibility to honour its own commitments in humanitarian assistance and reconstruction." Wang said, "China always adopts a friendly policy towards entire Afghan people and has provided substantial assistance to socio- economic development to Afghanistan. We hope there will be an early end to the chaos and wars in the country,(so) it can resume financial order at an early date. China will also play a positive role in helping the country in self capacity building, peace, reconstruction and improvement of peoples' livelihoods." The US, which has poured about $1 trillion into Afghanistan over 20 years, moved to block the Taliban's access to Afghanistan's $9.4 billion in international reserves. And IMF suspended plans to distribute over $400 million in emergency reserves to the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-may-fill-financial-vacuum-in-afghanistan/articleshow/85579551.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Make NREGS payments within 2 weeks: HC to Andhra Pradesh govt||VIJAYAWADA: The high court, in an interim order on Monday, asked the state government to make payments under NREGS to the petitioners within two weeks and submit a report to the court.  Observing that non-payment of bills for works done under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme was nothing but taking away the right to live life with dignity and respect, the court said it is also in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution. More than 500 petitions were filed before the high court over non-payment of bills for works done under NREGS prior to 2019. The petitioners complained that the state government was not paying bills to which they were entitled and was depriving them of their right to life. They said they are facing severe hardships as they could not pay the workers and repay the loans secured to procure materials to complete the works. The high court had earlier asked the Union government to submit details of funds that it has released to AP under NREGS. Contrary to the claims of the state government stating they could not make the payments as they are yet to receive funds from the Centre, the latter filed an affidavit stating that they have released funds from time-to-time, and as per the utilisation certificate submitted on April 1, 2021, the state government is having 1,991 crore of unspent funds. The court wondered why the state government has not made payments to the petitioners which they are legitimately entitled to and depriving their rights. Justice Battu Devanand further noted that the government did not submit proper and satisfactory details pertaining to the works done and payments made till date despite taking sufficient time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/make-nregs-payments-within-2-weeks-hc-to-govt/articleshow/85573253.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The incident came to light on Monday after her family members lodged a complaint at Suryaraopet police station, alleging that her husband had killed her. The deceased was identified as Usha Rani, a software engineer working with a tech major in Hyderabad. She was working from home for the past several months due to the pandemic situation. Suryaraopet circle inspector NV Surya Narayana said the incident happened at around 6.30 pm on Sunday. Rani had visited her mother’s place at Prasadampadu in the morning as it was Rakshabandhan. After tying the sacred thread on her brother’s wrist, she had returned to her in-laws’ place at around 4 pm. About three hours later, her husband M Phani called her family members and informed them that Rani had passed away. He said she suddenly collapsed and doctors pronounced her dead by the time they could take her to a nearby private hospital. Her shocked family members rushed to the hospital, and suspected foul play after seeing their daughter’s lifeless body. On Monday morning, they filed a police complaint alleging that Phani and his family mambers might have murdered her. Police have registered a case under section 174 of CrPC (suspicious death) and are waiting for the post-mortem report. Rani and Phani, a medical representative by profession, fell in love and got married about two years ago. However, there was marital discord between them which she used to frequently share with her parents. The dispute only grew after both came back from Hyderabad after their respective companies allowed them to work from home. They had no kids. “We have sent her body to Vijayawada government general hospital for post-mortem. We can’t draw any conclusion till we get the report. We will wait for the doctor’s opinion before moving forward with her parents’ complaint,” Surya Narayana told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/techie-found-dead-family-alleges-husband-killed-her/articleshow/85573242.cms||---
---||World||They were protectors in Afghanistan. Now they need help||KATHMANDU: The suicide bomber driving a sedan packed with explosives struck in the early hours of the morning, as the minibus crawled through Kabul's traffic. A piece of shrapnel pierced Amrit Rokaya Chhetri's left ear. He was lucky. Nine of his fellow security workers, hired by a contractor to protect Canada's embassy in Afghanistan, were killed immediately as metal tore through the packed bus in 2016. Ultimately, 13 Nepalis were among the dead. They were less than 700 feet from their dormitory. The Taliban claimed responsibility. The attack five years ago focused attention on the little-known but crucial role that Nepali security personnel play in protecting officials, diplomats and companies in Afghanistan. Hired by private contractors, many are ethnic Gurkhas who have served in the Nepali, Indian or British military, and they often work under counditions that have drawn protests from labour activists. But Nepal is one of the poorest in Asia, making security jobs abroad look appealing. Now Nepal is trying to get thousands of its people out of Afghanistan. The task is daunting. Reports from Afghanistan suggest the Taliban are tracking those who worked with Western countries. The exact number of Nepali nationals in the country is unclear, and the country does not have an embassy in Afghanistan and lacks resources for helping people stuck there. The government of PM Sher Bahadur Deuba is urging Western nations to help rescue Nepali security guards while they evacuate their own citizens from Kabul. Gyanendra Bahadur Karki, Nepal's minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, said evacuating Nepali contractors has been complicated by the fact that many have worked in Afghanistan illegally for years, making it difficult to find and count, much less rescue, them. Nepal reacted with relief last week when more than 100 of its nationals were flown out by the US, including Gurkhas who had worked at the US embassy. As of Sunday, 504 Nepali contract workers, including those working for the US and British embassies in Kabul, were evacuated out of Kabul, Nepal's foreign affairs ministry said. Many more may remain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/they-were-protectors-in-afghanistan-now-they-need-help/articleshow/85579654.cms||---

Haji Mohammad Idris was named as acting governor of the central bank to help bring order to a war- crippled economy, which has been adrift for more than a week with banks closed and many government offices empty. He was expected to help organise institutions and address the economic issues facing the population, the statement said. The appointment, which came as Iran resumed fuel exports to Afghanistan, comes amid increasingly acute economic problems, with many businesses closed and growing pressure on prices of staple goods including food and household fuel. The price of gasoline in Afghanistan reached $900 per tonne. "The Taliban sent messages to Iran saying 'you can continue the exports," a spokesperson for the Iran's Oil, Gas and Petrochemical Products Exporters' Union said While Idris had no public profile outside the Taliban and no formal financial training or higher education, he was head of the insurgent group's finance section and respected for his expertise, a Taliban official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-name-acting-head-of-central-bank-following-economic-turmoil/articleshow/85579899.cms||---

The bank said that it will issue three lakh cards a month — its monthly run rate before the ban — for the next two to three quarters, following which it will scale up to five lakh cards a month. Outlining the plans, the bank’s group head for payments & consumer finance, digital banking and IT, Parag Rao, said, “In the next three to four quarters, we will regain all our lost market share. The bank has lost close to 2% as rivals like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI Card swooped in to fill the demand." According to Rao, the four-pronged strategy would be to tweak the products, sell more cards to its six-crore customer base, add more partners like fintech companies, telecom, hospitality and pharma companies. It has also revamped the digital process to allow more do-it-yourself features to customers on the bank’s app. Rao said that despite the embargo from the RBI, the bank managed to scale up spend volumes by 60% year-on-year during the first quarter. “Our card spend is on an average one and a half times that of the industry,” said Rao. He said in the eight months the bank has been busy analysing industry trends and customer behaviour and now planned to put them to work. “During the pandemic, we have seen cards being used for low-value transactions as well. In the past, lower credit limits resulted in inactive cards. We are now seeing active users voluntarily opting for lower limits,” Rao added. HDFC Bank’s outstanding credit cards has declined to 1.48 crore as of June 2021 from 1.53 crore in November 2020 as a result of the ban. The same for ICICI Bank increased to 1.10 crore from 97 lakh, and SBI Card had its number increase to 1.20 crore in June 2021 from 1.12 crore in November 2020. In a statement, the bank said that it has 20 new partnerships lined up for the next 6-9 months, including co-branded offerings. Rao said while the bank lost market share in terms of number of active cards, it has been able to retain its share by overall spending courtesy specific initiatives to prod customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-will-issue-3l-cards-a-mth-regain-lost-ground/articleshow/85577554.cms||---

The Vidarbha Student and Youth Organization (VSYO) has requested the NU top brass to restart the online registration on its portal. The university had closed registration through its portal on August 18. Many students, particularly from the rural areas, who couldn’t enrol on NU portal approached the university authorities. Later, deputy registrar Raman Madne issued a circular on August 20 asking all such aspirants to approach colleges where they wished to take admission and register their names there. The colleges’ managements were told to collect Rs 20 as registration fee from the students and deposit the amount online with their names, documents and other details. NU has set a deadline of September 5 for all its affiliated and conducted colleges to complete the admission formalities. It would, however, exclude professional courses, whose admissions are done through the Common Entrance Cell (CET) of Directorate of Technical Education (DTE). The VSYO has slammed the NU authorities stating that “ NU’s mismanagement and flawed policies led to harassment of thousands of aspirants who want to seek admissions in its various colleges”. According to VSYO coordinator Aniket Mate, the colleges weren’t cooperating due to which students were facing several hardships. “As per the first schedule, NU was supposed to declare the merit list on August 24. Now, after the deadline for completion of admission formalities was extended till September 5, there is a confusion about when the merit list would be released and when admissions would be done. Even the college managements are confused about it,” he said. Besides its demand for restarting the online registration on NU portal, the VSYO has requested the university authorities to declare the new admissions schedule to avoid any confusion. Earlier, the NU Principals’ Forum too opposed NU’s move to make it mandatory for the students to register on its portal and submit documents for admissions to its various colleges. As reported by TOI earlier, there’s likely to be a rush across top NU colleges for admissions as the majority of students cleared Std XII without appearing in the examinations due to Covid-19 pandemic. From six districts in Nagpur division, over 1.40 lakh students had registered for the Maharashtra State Board exams and of them only 534 had failed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/students-demand-restarting-online-registration-on-nu-portal/articleshow/85578867.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The US remained top importer of India’s engineering goods with total exports growing 27.23% YoY in July to $1.27billion. The UAE is India’s second largest export destination for the third month in a row with shipments nearly doubling to$518 million. Like the previous month, exports to China slipped to the third position and declined 13% to $532 million. Exports of iron and steel to China fell sharply by 55.4% in July. As many as 20 out of 25 key nations accounting for 77% of India’s total engineering exports recorded positive monthly growth during July, 2021, as compared to July, 2020. This significant high share is indicative of the dependence of India’s engineering export on the traditional markets. Desai said that support of the government would be needed in difficult times and requested for reviewing the refund rates under Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP). The EEPC chairman said that iron and steel — the primary inputs of engineering goods — had been kept out of the purview of the RoDTEP scheme thus reducing the efficacy of the benefits. “We have brought the issue to the notice of the government and hope the anomalies in the RoDTEP will be removed soon. This along with other policy support would be key to the sector achieving $107 billion export target in the current fiscal,” said Desai. Mexico, South Africa and Nigeria were the top three importers of automobiles during April-July 2021 with 12.2%, 11.4% and 5.6% share in India’s global exports respectively over the same period last fiscal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/at-9-billion-engineering-exports-hit-all-time-high/articleshow/85574667.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

Academics and a few principals of colleges affiliated to Patliputra University (PPU) have once again urged the state government to execute its decision and delink Intermediate education from degree and postgraduate (PG) colleges. “Intermediate teaching is still being imparted in degree colleges in Bihar only,” they said. B D College principal Pravin Kumar said the institution is imparting Intermediate education in science, arts and commerce streams. “In addition to it, the college is carrying on degree level honours teaching in 24 major subjects and postgraduate teaching in commerce. Steps should be taken to delink Intermediate teaching from PPU colleges. The Patna University had completely delinked Intermediate teaching from its degree colleges in 2007,” Kumar said. He added, “During pandemic, all PPU degree colleges had conducted online classes for the undergraduate (UG) and PG students only. Raj Bhavan and university had sought weekly details of online classes of the UG and PG students only. Thus, Intermediate teaching was a liability on the degree colleges.” A N College principal S P Sahi said the state government should implement its decision without any further delay. “Delinking of Intermediate teaching will give an impetus to quality and research-oriented wok in the colleges. It will take off workload from the teachers,” he said . M D College-Naubatpur principal Kanhaiya Prasad Sinha has also questioned the continuation of Intermediate teaching in the PPU degree colleges as the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) does not take into consideration colleges’ contribution in Intermediate teaching. "Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) does not recognise Intermediate teaching in degree colleges in Bihar,” he said. According to sources, the government had earlier identified 250 schools in the state for their upgradation to start Intermediate teaching. Of them, only 25 schools have been upgraded so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/plea-to-delink-intermediate-education-from-ppu-colleges/articleshow/85573739.cms||Kumod Verma

The AAR made the ruling in a recent case where a Valsad-based manufacturer and supplier — Sampoorna Dairy and Agrotech — had approached it on the applicable GST rate. On the flip side, owing to the complexities in classification, AAR benches have held in the past that flavoured milk is not exempt from GST. The Valsad-based dairy sold lassi under the brand name ‘Elan’ in four flavours — plain (with no sugar or salt added), salted with cumin, strawberry sweetened with sugar, and blueberry sweetened with sugar. The AAR bench noted that the main ingredients of the lassi that was being manufactured and sold were curd, water and spices. The ingredients displayed on the bottle were pasteurized toned milk, spices, pudina, green chilli, ginger, salts, active culture, added nature-identical flavour and stabiliser. The bottle displayed that it was a ‘dairy-based fermented drink’. Fortunately for the manufacturer, and the end consumer, curds, lassi and buttermilk come under a specific classification (HSN 040390) and are exempt from GST. Tax experts point out that manufacturers and suppliers of flavoured milk have not been as lucky. The Gujarat AAR itself, in the case of Amul, which manufactured and supplied flavoured milk (made of milk added with sugar and permitted flavours) had held that a GST rate of 12% would apply (HSN 22029930). “In essence, both lassi and flavoured milk are dairy-based drinks, but the classification codes treat them differently,” said a tax expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lassi-exempt-from-gst-but-not-flavoured-milk/articleshow/85577732.cms||---

In what it calls the ‘waste to wealth’ mantra, the TTD will procure used garlands from its numerous temples located in Chittoor district to produce the agarbattis. The temple body runs 26 temples in Chittoor district alone. While used garlands from Tirumala temple will not be used for now as the Agama advisory board is yet to give its consent to the proposal, they would be procured on a daily basis from Padmavathi Ammavari temple in Tiruchanoor, Govindaraja Swamy temple, Kodandarama Swamy temple and Kapila Teertham temple in Tirupati, and from other temples in the district. Executive officer (EO) KS Jawahar Reddy said the temple body has tied up with a Bengaluru-based firm for the manufacture and marketing of the incense sticks. The TTD has already set up a state-of-the-art incense sticks manufacturing facility in the SV dairy farm. “Separate sale counters for sale of incense sticks would be set up near the laddu counters in Tirumala, and also at several other temples and pilgrim amenities complexes in Tirupati,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ttd-to-roll-out-its-brand-of-agarbattis/articleshow/85573653.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Kanpur||Absence of MSY, Akhilesh in Kalyan’s last rites triggers row||Lucknow: Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and national president Akhilesh Yadav may have ‘missed’ visiting the family of former chief minister Kalyan Singh to offer their condolences on the BJP veteran’s death, but the development triggered politics around their ‘absence’. Attacking the SP leadership on the issue, BJP MP from Kannauj, Subrat Pathak, said their absence reflected their ‘Talibani’ mentality. According to political observers, the absence of Mulayam and Akhilesh got more ‘conspicuous’ as Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati visited Kalyan Singh’s family and paid floral tribute to the veteran leader. Samajwadi Party, however, dismissed the issue as an unnecessary controversy accusing the BJP of making an ‘event’ out of something as serious as the demise of a senior and respected leader. SP insiders said Akhilesh was in Saifai on Saturday evening when Kalyan Singh was pronounced dead by doctors at SGPGI in Lucknow where he was undergoing treatment for quite some time. “The SP chief expressed his heartfelt condolences on Twitter minutes after the news came in. He later spoke to Kalyan Singh’s son, Rajveer, over the phone as well. He is about to visit him personally soon,” said a well-informed senior SP leader. “By the time the SP chief returned to Lucknow on Sunday after attending his pre-scheduled engagements in Saifai, Kalyan Singh’s mortal remains had been flown to his hometown in Aligarh,” he added.  “Mulayam had joined hands with Kalyan Singh when the latter had quit the BJP and later parted ways. It is highly unlikely that political differences were the reasons that prompted Mulayam and Akhilesh to distance themselves,” a political observer said. According to sources in the SP, office-bearers of the party’s district unit had been directed to attend the last rites of Kalyan Singh in Aligarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/absence-of-msy-akhilesh-in-kalyans-last-rites-triggers-row/articleshow/85576228.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Dance schools and institutes in the city were closed for more than a year owing to the Covid-induced lockdown. Though many such centres have now reopened after the phase-wise unlocking announced by the state government, they are are facing facing reduced number of students due to the pandemic. An instructor at a dance institute at Takiyapar in Danapur said: “The number of students in the institute has reduced because of the pandemic. Students are still scared to come for offline classes even when we are conducting classes with 50% students only.” Ayaan Singh, who teaches dance at an academy in Raja Bazar area, said: “We are conducting online as well as offline classes. We are strictly following the Covid-19 protocols in the offline classes and have divided students into batches to avoid crowding.” Shail Kushwaha, instructor at a dance academy at Boring Road said: “Initially, it was very difficult for us to start offline classes with the same enthusiasm and energy, but we are getting good response now.” Vikas Kumar, a dance teacher of Jagdeo Path area said conducting online dance classes was not easy. “The most difficult task is to teach small kids. Network issues and technical glitches added to the problem. Now we are also conducting offline classes with only eight students in one batch,” he said. Dance enthusiasts also rued technical issues affecting their classes. Patliputra Colony resident Riya Singh said: “I have been attending online dance classes since last year, but we always face technical glitches or network issues. The classes will be offline from September and I am excited for it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/students-feel-elated-to-hit-dance-floor-again/articleshow/85573690.cms||---

The union had given a two-day ultimatum to the director, health services and other higher authorities of Chandigarh administration. All paramedical and managerial employees working under NHM participated in the protest, including nursing officer, pharmacy officer, ANM, lab technician, dental technician and other class IV employees. “Due to the strike, Covid vaccination was hampered. Since tomorrow is ante-natal check up day at all dispensaries, the clinic will be affected due to non- availability of ANMs,” said Amit Kumar, general secretary, NHM employees union. “We have sent the file to the NHM and thereafter, it shall be forwarded to MHA for approval. The Chandigarh administration has given in principal approval,” said NHM mission director, Dr Amandeep Kang. She added, “We had given their last two years incentive of 7% each this time, which they had not been getting.” After the six-hour strike, all employees marched from the OPD to the emergency department and apprised the general public about alleged discrimination of wages with NHM employees. “We are working in pay scales lower than the DC rate as well. The demand has been raised since 2013,” said Kumar. He added, “The protest will continue on Tuesday from 9am to 3pm and may be extended further if demands are not met on priority basis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vaccination-stalled-as-nhm-staff-protest-wage-discrimination/articleshow/85574769.cms||---

Only 50% of the students have to attend classes on alternate days and they are required to wear masks and maintain social distancing on the school premises. Although many schools are reporting thin attendance, it has been gradually increasing with every passing day since August 16 when offline classes of primary sections resumed.The schools are also adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour like hand sanitisation and infrared thermal scanning at the entrance. Dushyant Singh, a class 6 student of St Michael's High School, said: “Students are attending classes as per even-odd roll numbers. Buses are being sanitized. Attendance is low but I feel more focused on studies in the school.” Krishna Kumar Tiwary, a class 7 student of Dr D Ram DAV Public School, Khagaul, said: “I am very comfortable and satisfied with my offline classes. Covid safety norms are being followed in school.” Anivesha, a student of standard 2 at Army Public School, Danapur, is very happy to join offline classes. “Now I can meet my friends and teachers and clear my doubts properly,” she said.

---||Pune||AEFI reporting lacks seriousness: Sr virologist||Pune: Virologist Dr Jacob John on Monday said the overall methodology of reporting Adverse Events Following Immunisation after the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in India lacked professionalism and seriousness to know the reality. “There is a state mechanism for AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunisation) monitoring under the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) and it seems to be the ‘active’ part in AEFI monitoring. By its own admission, the Central AEFI Committee announced that the state AEFI monitoring system was not functioning satisfactorily,” Dr John told TOI, against the backdrop of alleged under-reporting of adverse events by many states. The AEFI Committee relies on adverse event reports received on the CoWIN web platform. Dr John said this was a passive system as it might represent a very small but unknown proportion of all serious AEFI. The AEFI Committee released its last report on July 18. Earlier, it had come out with reports on April 2, May 17 and July 12. Dr John said the committee apparently made its own assessments as to what was serious among the reported cases, what was vaccine-related and what was the cause of death. He pointed out that one report had identified a death due to serious AEFI and diagnosed anaphylaxis. But anaphylaxis was an eminently treatable condition and death due to anaphylaxis spoke of incompetence of the vaccination centre and the local healthcare service, he stressed. In a few other reports, a large number of serious AEFI cases were attributed to anxiety. Dr John said that was “suspect” because anxiety was not serious AEFI. Dr John said of the 498 serious AEFI in a review, a total of 26 cases of blood clotting were reported, none associated with death. “Blood clotting and no death suggests poor follow-up or outright hiding of death. All these were reported after administering one particular vaccine. But that was not followed up with detailed instructions to all vaccination centres on how to diagnose clotting very early so that it can be properly treated to save lives,” said Dr John, the former head of clinical virology department of Christian Medical College. Public health researcher Dr Anant Bhan said AEFI data collection, analysis, reporting and action being taken on them was extremely important, especially because these vaccines were still under emergency use authorisation. “It is also critical because new vaccines to be introduced might not have any or limited local data on safety and efficacy,” he said, stressing on efficient AEFI surveillance protocols. Another public expert, R Jotkar, said AEFI data on CoWIN was shown as 0.006%. “If all adverse events are being reported needs to be monitored at the state-level. It is likely people may ignore reporting in instance of minor AEFI, leaving only major AEFI being captured in the system. The collation of AEFI from secondary sources to the CoWIN system might largely be uneventful,” said Jotkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/aefi-reporting-lacks-seriousness-sr-virologist/articleshow/85576992.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Five-member extortion gang held in Kurnool||TIRUPATI: Five persons, include two women, involved in blackmailing and extorting money by clicking compromising pictures of their victims and threatening to post them on social media were arrested by Kurnool police on Monday. Explaining the modus operandi of the gang, Kurnool SP Ch Sudheer Kumar Reddy said the two woman members used to call up people and lure them. “Once they fell into the honeytrap, the victims were invited to a house at an isolated place. The male members of the gang then used to capture their pictures while they got cosy with the women. The gang would then blackmail the victims by threatening to release the pictures on social media and various online platforms if they did not pay up,” Sudheer Kumar said, adding that the gang extorted money from two victims in Kurnool in a span of just 20 days. In the first incident, reported at Kurnool IV Town police station, the gang lured a local resident and extorted Rs 1.2 lakh. In the second incident reported on August 9, the gang trapped another resident and forced him to sign on promissory notes and cheques worth Rs 8 lakh. After the two victims filed complaints, a special team was formed. No sexual act has been reported in either case as the male members of the gang used to barge in just at the right moment, threaten the victims and click their pictures. The arrested have been identified as Sakunthala, Anjanamma, Kishore, Naga Raju, and Giddaiah. The accused said they received the mobile numbers of the victims from one Prakash Reddy and Das, who are believed to be the masterminds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/5-member-extortion-gang-held/articleshow/85573729.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Scientists informed that it is more nutritious compared to the traditional varieties of the grain. It may be recalled that over 30 finger millet varieties have been developed by the researchers at the VC Farm so far. “The variety in demand — KMR 340 — was released in 2018. It is now gaining popularity among finger millet growers. Last year, we sold over 100 quintals of seed,” explained SN Vasudeva Rao, research director, Zonal Agricultural Research Station, V C Farm. “This variety was developed by the researchers led by CR Ravishankar,” he explained. “It is more nutritious compared to the traditional varieties of finger millet. It has huge demand from the bakery sector,” he added. According to the authorities, this variety of finger millet is grown both in the irrigated land and in rainfed farming. The harvest period is 90 to 100 days. In irrigated land,40 to 45 quintals of finger millet yield is estimated per hectare of land while it is 30 to 35 quintals in the rainfed fields. Currently, this variety is grown by several farmers in the Mandya. According to the farmers, the white variety of finger millet is not new to the growers. “First, there were black finger millet varieties. Later red finger millet varieties were developed. The farmers have been growing the white finger millet varieties for the last 7-8 years by procuring the white finger millet variety seeds from private companies. The seeds are very expensive,” said Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Badagalapura Nagendra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/farmers-turn-to-white-finger-millet-variety-developed-by-mandya-scientists/articleshow/85570641.cms||---

Former Union secretary E A S Sharma, who was elected the honorary president of the forum, opined that the capital value system in property tax calculation is unconstitutional and governments cannot take such anti-public decisions. “Governments who are waiving off taxes for corporate companies on one hand are imposing huge amounts as taxes on the common man in the name of reforms,” Sharma said. MLC K S Lakshman Rao, who was elected president of the PPSAV, said governments cannot bring in tax reforms without the approval of the state finance commission. “This is against the 73rd and 74th Constitutional amendments. The state government didn’t even propose or discuss the tax reforms in the assembly and we strongly condemn the high handedness of the government,” he said. Senior high court advocate Sunkara Rajendra Prasad said the capital value system is another form of wealth and income tax. The government is acting against the rules and implementing tax reforms through the back channel, Prasad said.

About 600 doctors and nursing staff of different medical colleges and district hospitals have been imparted virtual training by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences - Patna (AIIMS-P) on the treatment protocol for protecting children from the virus. Dr Lokesh Tiwari, head of the paediatrics department of AIIMS-P and nodal officer of the training programme, said since the line of treatment for children against the pandemic could be a bit different from that of the adults, the training was imparted as a capacity-building exercise. “A seven-day offline training of health personnel will also be arranged soon. The AIIMS-P has marked a 30-bed Covid ICU for the third wave,” he added. Dr Tiwari said in the event of a third wave, children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome could be in the high-risk group. The Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) is also busy strengthening its healthcare facilities to face the likely third wave of the pandemic. Sixty beds have been marked for the third wave and dozens of new medical equipment have been installed in the intensive care units of the hospital “Though liquid oxygen plant is generating enough oxygen for the existing patients in different departments, another pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plant capable to generate oxygen from the environmental air will also be installed,” PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said. He added while suction machine provided by the state government has already reached the hospital, ventilators, warmers, humidifiers and infusion pumps are likely to be available soon. Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), which witnessed crisis of oxygen during the second wave, has now become self-reliant as far as oxygen availability is concerned. “A 136-bed paediatric ward is ready at the hospital. New cardiac monitors, ventilators and of other equipment will be supplied by Bihar Medical Infrastructure Corporation Limited soon,” NMCH superintendent and paediatrician Dr Binod Kumar Singh said. IMA: Strengthen private hosps too: Since the private health facilities had also played a significant role in providing healthcare services when the second Covid wave was at its peak, there is a need to strengthen them too, national president-elect of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh said. He said while the beds in Covid wards of government hospitals were full to their capacity, many private hospitals of Patna were seen declining admission of patients only due to the shortage of oxygen. “Taking a lesson from the past, the government in association with the state IMA should identify properly-maintained and medically-equipped private health facilities and ensure proper oxygen supply to them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hospitals-gear-up-to-face-imminent-third-covid-wave/articleshow/85573641.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Business||RBI panel calls for co-operative bank mergers||MUMBAI: An RBI panel has suggested expediting creation of an umbrella organisation to enable small urban cooperative banks (UCBs) to acquire scale by becoming part of a network. The panel has also said that the RBI should use the route of mandatory mergers to resolve problematic cooperatives and be neutral to voluntary mergers. The panel has also called for changes in the Banking Regulation Act empowering the RBI to declare securities issued by UCBs as covered under the Securities Contract Regulation Act to facilitate their listing on stock exchanges. These recommendations were made by the expert committee on primary (urban) cooperative banks under the chairmanship of former RBI deputy governor N S Vishwanathan. The RBI had constituted the panel in February to address the issues on regulation of cooperatives. The panel has suggested a four-tier regulatory structure for UCBs. The level of regulation would depend on their scale of deposits and the capital requirement and regulatory norms would get stringent with size. Tier-1 would comprise banks with deposits up to Rs 100 crore, tier-2 with deposits between Rs 100 crore and Rs 1,000 crore, tier-3 between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore, and tier-4 with deposits of over Rs 10,000 crore. The capital adequacy ratio for these banks would be between 9% and 15%, while tier-4 banks with deposits over Rs 10,000 crore would face the same norms as scheduled commercial banks. Besides capital, the extent of loans they can offer under different categories, like gold and home loans, would depend upon their size.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-panel-calls-for-coop-bank-mergers/articleshow/85577898.cms||---

Not only passengers, but also a large number of staff of airlines, services and security personnel were unaware about the World Sanskrit Day,” said LBSI airport Aryama Sanyal, who recently assumed office. Since early Sunday morning, the celebration of this special day on Shrawan Purnima (full-moon day of Shrawan month in Hindu calendar) was evident, especially on the flight information display boards and public address system. Lines in Sanskrit, meaning “located on western bank of Ganga, Kashi, which is adorned by Lord Vishwanath and depends on Goddess Annapurna, bestows wisdom, salvation and good luck. Keep coming to Kashi from the country and abroad as it always welcomes you,” were on display along with its Hindi translation on huge LED screens, attracting the attention of the visitors. The display of the above lines and their melodious recital in Sanskrit by 9-year-old twin sisters — Devyani Bhardwaj and Shivaranjani Bhardwaj — soon became the prime attraction as people gathered near the display boards to listen to the soulful rendition. Sanyal, who utilised her connections made in Indore during her previous posting, said, “I knew these twins from Indore. They are daughters of Nitish Bhardwaj, who portrayed Lord Krishna in the television serial Mahabharat, and managing director of Madhya Pradesh Finance Corporation, Smita Bhardwaj.” “The girls have been learning Sanskrit since the age of four. Before reaching grade 4 at the age of nine, they had earned quite a fame for themselves. As I thought they could be inspired by their command over Sanskrit, their recital was used for promoting the language on this special occasion at Kashi airport. This ageless city is known as a seat of Sanskrit learning and the ancient language is deeply embedded in its culture,” she added. “When Sanyal expressed her wish for doing something special on the World Sanskrit Day at Kashi airport, I discussed the matter with my daughters’ teacher Pravesh Vainsho. He requested vice-chancellor of Gujarat’s Shree Somnath Sanskrit University (Veraval) Prof Gopabandhu Mishra. Prof Mishra then wrote these special lines on Kashi. My daughters recited the lines and a video was prepared to be displayed at LBSI airport,” Smita Bhardwaj told TOI on Monday. On the rare talent and interest of the girls in Sanskrit, she said, “As the heavenly language is in vogue in my family, my daughters too developed a keen interest for the language.” “They have not only learnt Sanskrit, but also authored books like ‘Sun Salutation’,” she said adding, “Apart from winning many contests, prizes and awards up to the national level, they have also received appreciation letters from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and legendary personalities like The Dalai Lama.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/lbsi-airport-comes-alive-as-9-year-old-twin-sisters-eulogise-kashi-in-sanskrit/articleshow/85576123.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

After harvesting the crop, makhana growers generally shell out to middlemen, with the black kernel, which in local parlance is called ‘gudiya’, intact. These ‘gudiyas’ are then processed by trained workers for the production of puffed makhana, which are then packaged and sold in markets and also exported to several other countries, including the Gulf and Middle East. Rahul Kumar, assistant director of horticulture, said, “The district, which comes under the Kosi region, is one of the prominent producers of makhana in the state. Katihar produces 3,000 metric tonnes (MTs) of makhana annually. Besides, the district has been selected under the PM-SME scheme for production of makhana. We provide 35% financial assistance to entrepreneurs for setting up makhana processing units in the district.” Praveen Kumar, a farmer of Musapur under Korha block of the district, said, “We are growing makhana on nine bighas of land and harvesting will commence in September. However, surplus production has resulted into decline in prices. Prices of unprocessed makhana have come down from Rs 16,000 per quintal to Rs 14,000 or Rs 15,000 per quintal this year. The prices also depend on the quality of gudiyas.” Sanjay Kumar Mishra, another makhana grower from ward 9 of Phulwaria panchayat,, said, “The price of raw makhana was Rs 16,000 per quintal, but overproduction caused fall in the prices.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/price-fall-makhana-growers-hit/articleshow/85573911.cms||---
---||Patna||Two Maoists held in Jamui||PATNA: The Jamui police arrested two alleged Maoists from Giddaur police station area late Sunday night for their involvement in issuing threats to blow up Chaura railway station last month. The movement of trains was stopped for two hours due to the threat. Acting on a tip-off, a police team conducted raid at a suspected hideout of the Maoists and arrested Bhairav Yadav alias Gehuan and Sunil Yadav when they were planning to carry out a major operation in the area. A large number of gelatin and detonators were seized. Jamui SP Pramod Kumar Mandal said Sunil was earlier arrested and sent to jail in connection with Maoist-related incidents in the district. Bhairav told the police that he was paid Rs5,000 by Sunil for issuing threats to the railway station manager. During interrogation, it came to light that the conspiracy to issue threats to blow up Chaura railway station was hatched by Sunil’s associate Surang Yadav during their stay in the Sheikhpura district jail. Bhairav was released from jail recently. Mandal said the district police were on the lookout for the two Maoist activists ever since the incident came to light on July 30. Jamui, which shares its border with Jharkhand’s Giridih district, is considered among the worst Maoist-infested districts in Bihar. “We have stepped up surveillance in areas considered to be the hotbeds of the Maoists and raids are being conducted on specific intelligence inputs,” the SP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-maoists-held-in-jamui/articleshow/85573069.cms||Ramashankar

All members of the delegation, including CM Nitish Kumar, were surprised when the PM asked this question to Tejashwi minutes before the departure of the Bihar leaders. “Modi also revealed at the meeting that he had enquired about Lalu’s health by calling the attending doctors when the RJD chief was critically ill and undergoing treatment in hospital,” one of the delegation members told TOI over phone on Monday. While informing Modi about Lalu’s health position, Tejashwi said, “Though there is improvement in my father’s health, he has not fully recovered yet.” After the talks on caste census, Modi met all 11 leaders from Bihar one-by-one and even asked them informal questions. When former CM and HAM (S) president Jitan Ram Manjhi’s turn came, Modi asked about his health and family members. The PM also told Manjhi that his son and Bihar’s SC/ST welfare minister Santosh Kumar Suman had recently come to Delhi to meet him. Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) president and state’s animal and fish resources minister Mukesh Sahani presented a replica of fish, made of silver, to the PM. Sahani told the PM that since fish is considered a “lucky charm” in Bihar, he thought of presenting it to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/how-is-laluji-pm-to-tejashwi/articleshow/85573000.cms||---

This makes CP the first oral care brand to launch such an initiative at scale. The technology is first being rolled out on Colgate’s Active Salt and Colgate Vedshakti variants. In future, these brands will only be manufactured in recyclable materials. Products in the new recyclable tubes have already been dispatched across select markets and will be nationally available across outlets by September. This will be followed with its other brands in the portfolio. In a statement to TOI, Colgate-Palmolive India MD Ram Raghavan said, “Our desire to reimagine a healthier future for the people we serve and for our planet remains our number one priority. With this category-leading initiative, along with our consumers and our nation, our planet will also have a future to smile about. We hope that all toothpaste manufacturers will meet recycling standards for their tubes in order to maximise the positive impact it can have on all of us.” This initiative is in partnership with EPL. Colgate is also sharing its recyclable technology with others to achieve a circular economy. Traditionally, toothpastes come in tubes that are made from plastic and aluminium, which is difficult to recycle. In the Rs 15,000-crore oral care segment, Colgate leads with a share of around 53%. In May this year, Unilever had announced plans to convert its entire global toothpaste portfolio to recyclable tubes by 2025. The plan is to roll it out in India later this year. In India, Unilever competes with CP in oral care, although it is a distant No. 2. A Hindustan Unilever spokesperson said, “The work on the launch of recyclable tubes for our toothpaste brands in India is currently under way.” Experts believe as consumer awareness about the environment grows, sustainable practices adopted by a brand will determine its competitive edge over others. In India, given that trash segregation at consumer level is at a very nascent stage, industries currently rely largely on trash separations at dumping grounds. Similar to India, CP has launched globally the recyclable tubes version in some of its popular brands in parts of North and Latin America, Europe, Asia and Australia. All sub-brands in any country will be completely replaced by recyclable tubes by 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paste-to-come-in-recyclable-tubes-colgate/articleshow/85577972.cms||Namrata Singh

These oceanographic and defence technologies were developed by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), Chennai. These include a robo coastal observer, a low-cost buoyant apparatus for remote data collection in water bodies. Another technology is an ‘autonomous underwater profiling drifter’ (AUPD). AUPD is a concept that enhances the real-time capability for measurement of temperature and salinity, with reference to depth, through an upper oceanic depth of 2,000 metres. For deep sea observations, deep sea AUPD is applied, which can measure up to an ocean depth of 5,000 metres. Speaking to TOI, regional manager and head, NRDC-IPFC & TISC, Innovation Valley, Vishakhapatnam, Dr B K Sahu, said the Intellectual Property Facilitation Centre, Visakhapatnam supported 226 patents and 75 trademarks of various MSMEs, industry academia in the last three years. “It has transferred and commercialised 45 innovative technologies. The office has been working towards technology licensing, IP facilitation and capacity building and awareness programmes,” said Dr Sahu. Dr Sahu emphasised the need for innovative technologies to fulfil India’s mission of self-reliance and to mitigate the demand of technologies for society that are affordable, available and adaptable. “We received a national award as the best technology innovation centre from union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on August 17,” said Dr Sahu. Dr Sahu said they are helping innovators and entrepreneurs create, protect, and manage intellectual property rights such as patent, trademark, design, and geographical indication of goods. “Interested people, who want to reap the benefits of technology transfer, trademarking, patenting, etc., can contact the office. We are there to help. The Centre acts as a bridge between R&D institutions and industry, and connects the dots,” said Dr Sahu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/nrdc-vizag-transfers-oceanographic-tech/articleshow/85573385.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

According to the notification, the panchayati raj officers will look after the development works instead of the BDOs. The panchayati raj officers have been nominated as executive officers of the samitis. The BDOs were earlier appointed as executive officers of the respective panchayat samitis due to delay in the panchayat election. State panchayati raj department minister Samrat Choudhary said on Monday that the notification about the upcoming panchayat election would be issued on Tuesday. Once the notification is issued, release of funds for works in the panchayats would be stopped with immediate effect except for the ongoing Nal Ka Jal scheme. He clarified that the model code of conduct would come into effect after the issuance of the notification for the election to the three-tier panchayati raj institutions. Around 2.59 lakh representatives will be elected for the posts of zila parishad, mukhiya, ward member, panchayat samiti member, sarpanch and panch. Earlier in the day, the state election commission categorized the symbols for different posts on which the elections would be held. Altogether 36 symbols have been selected for the post of mukhiya. Similarly, 20 symbols have been selected for ward members. Likewise, 10 symbols have been released for panchayat samiti members and 20 for zila parishad members, respectively. The commission has, however, reserved 12 symbols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bdos-relieved-of-panchayat-samiti-charge/articleshow/85572876.cms||Ramashankar

Nitish even appreciated Tejashwi for coming up with the idea of meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issue of a caste-based census. After meeting PM Modi, Nitish and Tejashwi came out of the PMO walking together while other leaders followed them. The two could be spotted talking to one another till others who were a part of the delegation came out. आज जातीय जनगणना के मुद्दे पर मुख्यमंत्री श्री नीतीश कुमार जी सहित 10 पार्टियों के शीर्ष प्रतिनिधिमंडल के साथ प्रधान… https://t.co/9Ue5siitdG— Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi) 1629733665000"On the issue of caste census, CM Nitish Kumar along with a delegation of 10 parties met PM Narendra Modi. The Prime Minister listened to us seriously. We expect positive results from the central government," tweeted Tejashwi. Crediting Tejashwi for Monday’s meeting, Nitish said, “Opposition leader (Tejashwi) had held a meeting with all the parties over this issue. He had proposed that a meeting should be held with the PM and I found his proposal to be right.” Even Tejashwi, who was standing beside Nitish, thanked him for accepting his proposal and leading this delegation. Asked by the mediapersons about this closeness between the JD(U) and RJD, Tejashwi said his party has always supported the state government over issues of public interest. The fresh “bonhomie” between the two parties after the closely contested assembly election is creating ripples in the political circles in the state. A political expert said the closeness between Nitish and Tejashwi may put pressure on the BJP. Political pundits added through Monday’s move, Nitish has made it clear that he will not compromise with his ideologies, even when in an alliance with the BJP. “You never know, Nitish may have intentionally come out together with Tejashwi to give a message to the BJP. Through such a gesture, Nitish has also put pressure on those in the JD (U) who may have been planning to revolt,” said a political analyst. Senior JD(U) leader KC Tyagi said the caste-based census was a long-pending demand. “All factions of the socialist movement are coming together. This is a welcome move,” he added. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan has also appreciated the stand taken by all the parties in Bihar for the caste-based census. “For RJD, power had never been important. Our party believes in working for the oppressed and the downtrodden, a model set up by our national president Lalu ji.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-tejashwi-bonhomie-sets-tongues-wagging-in-bihar/articleshow/85572935.cms||Sheezan Nezami

It is part of the NH-82 from Gaya to Biharsharif being constructed as four-lane highway by Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited (BSRDCL). Officials in road construction department (RCD) said the NH-82 is being made four-lane from Gaya to Biharsharif. Presently, it is a two-lane road, which faces frequent traffic snarls. However, the portion between Rajgir and Vanganga could not be four-laned because of reserve forest land and archaeological structures. Accordingly, a four-lane elevated corridor has been planned without disturbing the archaeological structures. “MoRTH has approved the alignment of 8.7-km-long four-lane elevated road in addition to four-lane at grade road. In view of important archaeological sites along the road, it is proposed to have cable-stayed section. With approval of alignment, pre- construction activities such as forest clearance and utilities shifting can be initiated. State Wildlife Board has already approved the project,” additional chief secretary (road construction) Amrit Lal Meena said, adding that MoRTH gave its nod to the project last week. Meena said CM Nitish Kumar had directed for an elevated road on NH-82 from Vanganga to SDM office section in Rajgir. "In compliance of the CM’s directive, RCD prepared an alignment proposal, which has been approved by the MoRTH. The elevated section will have ramp up and down near Ropeway Mor at Rajgir. People travelling from both sides will have smooth travel to the ropeway,” Meena said. The archaeological sites or structures getting connected with the elevated road include Vishwa Shanti Stup, Banganga Hills, Wheel Chariot, Swarna Bhandaar, Maniyar Math, Qila Maidan and Cyclopean Wall among others. Besides, the newly opened nature safari and zoo safari will get smooth connectivity with the construction of the elevated road. RCD officials said the proposed road will provide connectivity from major cities, including Patna, Rajgir, Nalanda, Nawada, Harnaut, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Bokar, Koderma, Gaya, Hazaribag, Barhi, Jehanabad, Bakhtiyarpur, Barh, Mokama and Ramgarh. It will provide direct connectivity between Biharsharif and Vishwa Shanti Stupa at Rajgir and further to Bodh Gaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nod-to-9-km-long-elevated-road-between-rajgir-and-vanganga/articleshow/85573797.cms||---

Talking to reporters on his maiden visit to his Hajipur Lok Sabha constituency after being inducted into the PM Narendra Modi cabinet, Paras said the conferring Bharat Ratna would be a real tribute to the departed leader. Paras, who had to face a hostile crowd at Hajipur, said he would leave no stone unturned to fulfil the dreams of his elder brother. “It’s my prime responsibility to accomplish the task given to me by him during the 2019 parliament election,” he said while enlisting his priorities for the people of Hajipur. A man sprinkled black ink on the vehicle in which he was travelling. Paras was also shown black flags for delay in visiting his constituency when people were facing hardship due to floods. A woman was also misbehaved by the security guards of the minister when she came across the cavalcade and suffered injuries in the process. Paras said he was committed to carrying out development works in his constituency. “A lot is required to be done for the people of Hajipur. Since I have been allotted food processing industries ministry, the benefits will be delivered to the people of Hjipur,” he said. Though he avoided questions on his nephew and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan, Paras reiterated that the 12, Janpath Road bungalow in Delhi was offered to him (Paras) soon after his induction into the Union cabinet. The bungalow had been allotted to Ram Vilas as a Union minister and his son Chirag has been asked to vacate it. When told that Chirag was planning to contest from Hajipur next time, Paras said, “Let him do so.” Earlier, Paras held a meeting with the senior district administration officials and inquired about the relief and rescue operations in the flood-hit blocks in Vaishali district. LJP vice-president Suraj Bhan Singh and Nawada LJP MP Chandan Singh were present at the Patna airport to receive Paras. He looked a little upset over poor show of strength compared to the one by Chirag’s supporters on his first visit to the state after the split in LJP caused by Paras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/committed-to-hajipurs-development-says-paras/articleshow/85573310.cms||Ramashankar

The bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh also asked the commission to invite candidates ten times the number of a vacant post in Mains examination which it had not done earlier. The court also asked the commission to get rid of the minimum qualifying marks criterion for permitting candidates to appear in the written mains examination. The criterion was not mentioned in the advertisement for the recruitment of APOs published on February 6 last year. The minimum qualifying marks criterion is guided by a general administration department resolution passed in 2007. The court has directed the commission not to invoke the resolution rules in this recruitment process. The high court order has brought relief to a large number of law practitioners as more candidates would now get the chance to write the Mains exam. The preliminary examination for APO recruitment was held on February 7 this year and the results were declared on April 27. The commission had issued a clarification on April 28, mentioning about minimum qualification marks. Altogether 3,995 candidates were found eligible by commission to appear for Mains written examination on the basis of minimum qualifying marks. After the high court order, the BPSC will have to invite more than 5,500 aspirants. Within an hour of the HC order, the commission issued notice announcing that it has postponed the main written examination for recruitment of APOs which was scheduled to take place at different centres in Patna from August 24 to August 27. The bench was hearing a batch of writ petitions filed by Utpal Kant, Bagesh Kumar Srivastava, Dilshad Ahamad and 31 others. The petitioners were represented by counsels Arjun Kumar and Rupesh Kumar. The court allowed petitioners’ prayers in limited way. They had urged the high court to direct the BPSC to invite candidates ten times the number of vacant seats as mentioned in the advertisement. They had also sought removal of the criterion of minimum qualifying marks as nothing was mentioned about it in the advertisement. Several candidates were not falling in the eligibility criteria to write the Mains examination due to minimum qualifying marks criterion introduced after clarification. Advocate general Lalit Kishore along with Sanjay Pandey, who appeared for the BPSC, had argued that the recruiting body has completed several recruitment processes earlier as per the minimum qualifying marks criterion guided by GAD resolution. However, the court remained dissatisfied and gave relief to the petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/apo-recruitment-hc-asks-bpsc-to-revise-results-of-prelims-exam/articleshow/85573361.cms||Debashish Karmakar

TMBU vice-chancellor Neelima Gupta will submit its outcome to state and central governments, so that steps can be initiated for permanent rehabilitation of flood victims and solution for the perennial flood problem. The Center for Regional Studies (CRS) under TMBU has been asked to conduct the survey. “The survey would be questionnaire-based and have details of flood victim family members, marital, social and economic status, food and drinking water availabilities, difficulties in attending to nature’s call, education in the family, skills, job status, topography of the region where they live, physical and mental health status and cost of restructuring of houses due to damages caused by the floods,” Gupta said. Chandra Prakash Singh, director of CRS and senior teacher in the department of Rural Economics, told this newspaper that the modalities of the survey are ready and it is likely to start this week itself. “It will focus on the socio-economic conditions of the flood victims besides their overall details, including educational level. The survey would also focus on physical and mental health of the victims and what they feel when they migrate after destruction each year due to floods. It will also focus on their vocation and livelihood besides agriculture in diara (reverine) areas and about probable losses due to drowning of standing crops in floods,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tmbu-to-study-conditions-of-flood-victims/articleshow/85573183.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The intensity of showers is likely to be more in north Bihar as compared to southern parts of the state. In fact, Patna Meteorological Centre has issued forecast for rainfall in entire north Bihar till Friday. Districts in north-central and north-east Bihar, including Kishanganj, Supaul, Araria, Madhepura, Purnia and Katihar, are also likely to receive rainfall at most places on Thursday and Friday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has also issued a yellow alert for heavy rainfall at isolated places in the state till Friday. The yellow warning by IMD asks the authorities concerned to be watchful for extreme weather developments. Possibility of flooding in the low-lying areas has also been predicted along the foothill of the Himalayas. “Good rain and thundershower activities are likely over east Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar over the next four to five days. Intensity of rain may increase significantly over east UP and Bihar around August 26 and 27. There may be chances of flooding over foothills in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar due to heavy downpour,” private weather agency Skymetweather reported on Sunday. Skymet further said East Champaran, West Champaran, Sitamarhi, Kishanganj, Araria, Supaul, Forbesganj, Khagaria, Purnia and Bhagalpur may continue to receive good rain. Hills of Nepal may also witness heavy downpour, which may increase the water flow over foothills of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar leading to flood-like conditions, it said. The rainy spell in the region has been attributed to favourable position of monsoon trough line and a cyclonic circulation. The IMD stated that monsoon trough line was passing through Bikaner, Bhiwani, Delhi, Bareilly, Gorakhpur, Darbhanga, Jalpaiguri and Assam on Monday evening. Besides, a cyclonic circulation was lying over northwest Rajasthan and neighbourhood. Besides, strong and moist southerly or south-westerly winds are very likely to continue to blow from Bay of Bengal to north-east India till August 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/met-n-bihar-likely-to-receive-widespread-rainfall-till-friday/articleshow/85573189.cms||---

While the paddy transplantation was, by and large, completed by the last week of July across the state, the rainfall received in the 15 districts from June 1 to August 22 has been less than normal, water resources department (WRD) sources said. The overall average actual rainfall received in the state from June 1 till August 22 has been 829.4mm against the normal of 730.3mm. The rainfall received in the 23 districts is more than 800mm. Further, the normal rainfall for the entire monsoon season (from June 1 to October 15) is 880mm. Ironically, the rainfall received in the 15 districts has been less than the normal. The districts concerned are Madhepura, Saharsa, Araria, Kishanganj, Purnia, Sheohar, Begusarai, Bhojpur, Patna, Nalanda, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura, Munger, Jamui and Banka. The WRD flood bulletin has forecast moderate to heavy rainfall across the state from Tuesday till August 27. Further, the satellite images released regarding the cloud cover in the state on Monday pointed out that moderate (up to 60mm) to heavy rainfall (more than 60mm) is expected in the southern and eastern districts of the state. “Paddy is considered a water-loving crop. If the plots of land with paddy transplantation have water and there is also not heavy rainfall, then it is very good for farmers. Otherwise, weeds grow, which results in stunted growth of paddy plants,” a WRD official said. “The threat of flood has receded, as the Ganga is flowing below the danger level from Buxar to Gandhi Ghat in Patna. Its water level has also been falling in its downstream from Hathidah onwards to Munger, Bhagalpur and Kahalgaon,” he added. The water level in the Kosi, Gandak, Bagmati, Burhi Gandak and Kamla also showed the falling trend. The water discharge through the Birpur barrage across Kosi river, through Valmiki Nagar across Gandak and Indrapuri barrage across Sone has also fallen. “In all probability, the threat of fresh floods seems to have receded,” the WRD official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rain-brings-cheer-to-farmers-in-bihar/articleshow/85573134.cms||Abhay Singh

The civic body has identified 800 open spaces for the initiative. Speaking to the media on Monday, GVMC commissioner G Srijana said development work on these spaces will be completed by September. “The GVMC would spend about Rs 13 crore on these open spaces. These will get a fence/compound wall, walking track, etc. This will also lead to the better protection of the open sites. The GVMC has also decided to develop 10 theme parks and 10 community parks this year. While open areas measuring less than one acre would be converted into a green space, the larger bits will be developed as parks,” said Srijana. The commissioner explained activities being taken up under the Clean Andhra Pradesh programme (CLAP). “The city will get about 650 new vehicles for garbage collection and transfer,” said Srijana. Earlier, GVMC mayor G Hari Venkata Kumari gave a call for Vizagites to celebrate Vinayaka Chavithi with clay idols instead of those made with plaster of Paris.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-to-create-parks-in-open-spaces/articleshow/85573529.cms||---

---||India||PM Modi didn't deny the need for caste-based census, says Nitish Kumar||NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday tossed the issue of caste-based census in the Centre's court, saying it was for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take a call on estimating the respective strength of castes. After leading an all-party delegation from Bihar for a meeting with the PM to demand the practice of caste-wise headcount, which was discontinued in 1931, Nitish told reporters, "The Prime Minister listened to all members of the delegation on caste census. We urged the PM to take an appropriate decision on it. We briefed him about how resolutions have been passed in the state assembly twice on caste census." The interaction with reporters was marked by the rare sight of the Bihar CM praising his opponent, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, for mooting the idea of taking an all-party delegation to the PM. Yadav, on his part, thanked Kumar for heeding the suggestion. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave all the members of the delegation a patient hearing and "did not deny what we said (need for a caste census)". "The people of Bihar and the entire country are of the same opinion on this issue. We are grateful to the PM for listening to us. Now, he has to take a decision on this," the Bihar chief minister said. Although BJP members have not been averse to a caste-wise count, the party is wary of making a specific commitment to hold one because of the logistical nightmare it is set to present in view of the gigantic nature of the task and its complexities. Sources say that it will certainly not be easy to club it with the forthcoming decennial census for which all the preparations have already been made. The exercise has already been delayed because of Covid restrictions. A section in BJP also seems to be concerned about the possibility of such an exercise putting a spade in the project to knit a "Hindutva" constituency cutting across castes. "A message is being spread in Bihar that BJP is against a caste-based census, which is wrong. We have never been against it. However, clubbing a caste headcount with the general census might not be possible," a senior functionary said and added that the government may initiate the process at a later stage. Kumar said it was a central minister's statement discounting the possibility of conducting a caste-based enumeration of population which served as the trigger for the move to organise the all-party delegation. "It made us anxious as there is unrest among the people. Following the statement, all parties, including the opposition, took the initiative to meet the PM," Kumar said. He was referring to junior home minister Nityanand Rai's written reply in the Rajya Sabha in July that there was no proposal for releasing caste-based population data. Kumar said all parties from Bihar spoke in one voice on the need for a caste-based census and asserted that statistics will help in formulating development schemes effectively as many of them have not benefited so far in line with their actual population. Tejashwi Yadav said, "Our delegation called on the PM not only for a caste-based census in Bihar but in the entire country. We are awaiting a decision on this now." BJP's Janak Ram, who was part of the delegation, said the PM heard out everyone's view like the "guardian of a family".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-didnt-deny-the-need-for-caste-based-census-says-nitish-kumar/articleshow/85580110.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s IT hub to help small hospitals consult big ones||CHANDIGARH: As a package for the third wave, the Government of India has sanctioned Rs 50 lakh for an IT hub, which shall connect dispensaries with civil hospitals and district hospitals with PGI. This network of tele-consultation will enable doctors take referral advice from bigger hospitals like PGI. “This is part of the third wave package, which has been approved especially for the paediatric population. However, it will apply to all patients during and after the third wave,” said director, health services, DHS, UT, Dr Amandeep Kang. A total of 34 dispensaries have been converted into health and wellness centres. Additionally, there are three civil hospitals, besides PGI and GMCH-32, which are referral tertiary care hospitals. The dispensaries shall be connected with civil hospitals, which will be further linked with the district hospital, Government Multispeciality Hospital-16. The district hospital will be directly connected to PGI for referrals. For the third wave, Rs 5.4 crore has been approved for Chandigarh, which has to be released by the Centre. “There will be video-conferencing with doctors in these hospitals, which will be linked online. The idea is to stop unnecessary referrals and patient visits, which can be managed online,” said the DHS. She added, “We expect this to start by October as we have trained manpower. Only computers and other accessories have to be purchased.” Dispensaries will be linked to other hospitals for teleconsultation for the first time. “Such connectivity shall prevent delay in treatment or referral,” said the DHS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/it-hub-to-help-small-hospitals-consult-big-institutes/articleshow/85574856.cms||Shimona Kanwar

He would pay a visit to key defence establishments like the Headquarters Maintenance Command of the Indian Air Force (IAF), and Brahmos Aerospace unit in Butibori. Singh is also expected to visit the RSS headquarters, said sources. The minister is also scheduled to hand over the first batch of multimodal hand grenades made by Economic Explosives Limited (EEL), headed by city businessman Satyanarayan Nuwal, to the Army. These are the first ever hand grenades made by a private company in the country. The multimodal grenades are set to replace the World War-II-make M36 grenades used by the Army at present. The M36 were made by ordnance factories, which are also working on a new grenade. The latest grenades have both defensive and offensive use for soldiers. EEL has made the weapon based on the design by Terminal Ballistics Laboratory Limited (TBRL), a part of the Defence Research and Development Organisation. EEL, which is part of Solar Industries Limited, was the first to bag the order for making these grenades for the Army. The order worth Rs409 crore involves making 10 lakh grenades over a period of time. The development assumes importance in the light of government’s decision to corporatize Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), throwing it open to competition with private sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rajnath-to-hand-over-nagpur-made-grenades-to-army/articleshow/85578904.cms||---

A total of 10 patients would be inoculated on every day, starting August 24,” said the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s Covid immunisation chief, Suryakant Devkar. Bedridden patients can avail of the benefit of free Covid vaccination after prior intimation and submission of required medical documents to the PMC’s email address bedriddenvaccination.pune@gmail.com. “We have observed that in quite a few cases, patients are not attaching doctor’s medical certificate citing the condition that is keeping the patient bedridden. Besides, quite a few are not attaching another medical certificate supporting fitness for Covid vaccination. Without these mandatory certificates, we cannot offer Covid vaccination to the bedridden citizens,” Devkar said. Family members of bedridden individuals will have to send PMC the beneficiary’s (bedridden family member's) name, address and contact number as well. PMC had initially asked the relatives of beneficiaries to ensure the presence of a family doctor during the 30-minute post-jab observation period, which is mandatory. “Now, we have decided that our health staffers would observe the patient for half-an-hour post-vaccination,” Devkar said. The PMC has been vaccinating residents of old-age homes and persons with disabilities in care facilities for over two months. But the demand has grown for home vaccination for bedridden individuals. “The objective is to extend the benefit of vaccination to everyone,” said mayor Muralidhar Mohol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jabs-at-home-for-bedridden-in-civic-limits-from-today/articleshow/85577031.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Chennai||Kodanad case: Plea in Madras HC seeks interrogation of Edappadi K Palaniswami & VK Sasikala||CHENNAI: As political slugfest over the Kodanad murder-cum-burglary case continued, two new cases — one favouring, and the other opposing, further investigation of the crime — have been filed in the Madras high court. While one case sought permission to interrogate former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, another former CM J Jayalalithaa’s confidante V K Sasikala, her sister-in-law J Ilavarasi and others in connection with the murder, the other filed by a witness sought to stall the ongoing trial at an Ooty court. The petition, filed jointly by Deepu and A Santhosh Samy of Thrissur and M S Satheesan of Vattanthara to interrogate nine people, including Palaniswami and Sasikala, was, however, rejected by the Nilgiris sessions judge on April 30. Assailing the rejection, they have now moved the high court saying police had filed the chargesheet in a hasty manner, and that it was difficult to believe that only a few watches and a glass doll had been stolen in the murder-burglary incident. ‘Prime culprits left out in Kodanad case’After the demise of Jayalalithaa, Kodanad estate was under the control of Sasikala and Ilavarasi and they alone are in a position to depose about the valuables missing after the crime took place, they said.When they sought legal aid, an office-bearer of the AIADMK lawyers’ wing appointed to assist them in conduct the case, they said, adding that it made it clear that the entire proceedings had been influenced and monitored by persons holding power in the former ruling party (AIADMK). Investigation in the case failed to conduct a transparent inquiry and it miserably left out prime culprits, they said. However, another petition filed by N Ravi of Coimbatore, a prosecution witness in the case, sought an early completion of the trial, and wanted day-to-day proceedings so it could be completed within a stipulated time. He said Kanagaraj was known to him, and added: “On April 28, 2017 at 8pm, while I was watching a movie at Brookfield cinema theatre in Coimbatore, he called me on my mobile phone and said he and his friends had committed murder at Kodanadu estate bungalow in the course of committing robbery. I suggested that he surrender before police, and Kanagaraj surrendered before Sankagiri DSP.” Claiming that he had been threatened by various sources that further investigation in the case was going to take place and that I must give a witness statement according to the requirement, he said: “I came to understand that in the above murder case trial, the prosecution had nearly examined 41 witnesses… So far, from April 2021 to till today not even one defence witness was examined before the trial court and the adjournment are being sought on various grounds from time to time.” He, therefore, sought a direction for the early examination of witnesses and completion of trial. On Monday, after an urgent mention was made by counsel for the petitioner, Justice M Nirmal Kumar agreed to hear the plea on August 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kodanad-case-plea-in-hc-seeks-interrogation-of-eps-sasikala/articleshow/85577141.cms||---

The European firms have evinced interest in participating for the bidding and demanded more time for applying for the tenders.. The deadline for the bids, already extended four times, has been extended again after demand from these companies. The tenders were to be opened on August 17. Now, they will be opened on August 24. The project is being carried out with the help of Japan’s international funding agency JICA. The process is being carried out through offline mode. The civic administration has given the documents to 17 firms, mostly European. It includes information about the firm, the previous works, financial capacity and technical capacity. They European firms had demanded extension of around a fortnight to a month for the bids. But only a week’s extension has been approved. According to civic officials, the previous tenders were cancelled around three years ago due to allegations of inflated tender price. Now, the civic body has restructured the tenders as per the current rates. The project will be worth Rs1,236 crore. It includes operation and maintenance cost of around Rs216crore and Rs1020crore project price. Earlier, the project cost was around Rs990crore. Apart from checking river pollution, the project will cater to cleaning and improvement of riverbeds as well as setting up of infrastructure for solid waste anagement. Altogether 11 new solid waste treatment plants are to be built under this initiative. “The deadline for the tendering process will be over on Tuesday. The details about the response will be known after that. We are hopeful of a good response,” said Jagdish Khanore, a senior PMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-in-europe-hit-bid-for-river-project/articleshow/85577092.cms||---

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari asked the owners of the alleged illegal structure to approach the corporation but made it clear that there would be no stay in the ongoing demolition work. Senior advocate Krishnan Venugopal, appearing for owners of the properties, pleaded the court that his clients got noticed from the municipal corporation and pleaded with the court to grant him a hearing. The bench, however, said that as per its earlier order all representations had to be made to the corporation which would take a call. Venugopal also alleged that Haryana government has filed application before another bench of apex court for its approval to begin mining in the Aravalis in Gurgaon and Faridabad and the court should take into account state governemnt application before deciding the issue of Khori Gaon.

---||Ahmedabad||Naroda to get Ahmedabad’s longest flyover||AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad city’s longest overbridge will come up in the Naroda Patia area in the eastern part of the city by 2025, to address the traffic congestion issues in the area. The four-lane overbridge will be 2.5km long and will be built at the cost of Rs 165 crore. The proposed overbridge will connect Naroda Patia and Galaxy Crossroads. “The demand for an overbridge at Naroda Patia was pending for the last three years, as congestion at Naroda Patia Y-junction near the old national highway, Devi Cinema and Galaxy Cinema was increasing and it was becoming a nightmare for commuters,” an officer of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) said. The official said Gujarat Municipal Finance Board (GMFB), the state government authority for civic finances, had approved a Rs 55 crore budget for a small flyover at Naroda Patia junction. However, this solved issues at only one junction. “A revised proposal was then made for a longer overbridge, which would cross over all three junctions. After the proposal was made, a feasibility study was done. The proposal and feasibility report was given in-principle approval at the meeting of the AMC’s roads and buildings committee on Monday,” he said. The official added that GMFB, which has already approved Rs 55 crore, will provide the additional Rs 110 crore under the Chief Minister’s Swarnim Jayanti Urban Development Scheme. The civic body has already written to GMFB and the urban development department, requesting the additional funds. The consultants hired for the overbridge project have prepared a design, carried out soil testing investigations and made the feasibility report. According to the feasibility report, on completion, the overbridge will make commuting smoother for more than 1,50,000 commuters every day and reduce the area’s traffic congestion by 75%. It will also have parking facilities under it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/naroda-to-get-citys-longest-flyover/articleshow/85577289.cms||---

The lockdown gave a farmer from a village in Puttur an opportunity to mould himself into an entrepreneur. Other than taking up agriculture, he worked as a cook. When the catering industry came to a standstill due to the lockdown last year, he used the time as an opportunity to try out new delicacies, and the flavoured holige or sweet flatbread prepared by him clicked. Shrikrishna Shastri,30, from Balnadu village in Puttur, told TOI, “The holiges I prepare are always in demand. Last year, I first tried making holige from jackfruit and it was a hit. This inspired me to try out various other flavours. The next experiment was preparing holige from dry cocoa beans, a fast selling product. In a month, I have sold about 1,000 holiges of this flavour so far,” he said. Since people have already experimented with areca tea and other items, he tried preparing holige (like puran poli) from arecanuts. Though it is difficult to powder the nut, with time, he has been successful, and sold about 200 holiges of this flavour. “I looked around my farm, and then thought of other flavours. Betel leaves caught my attention. People have already tried out a lot of delicacies of this flavour, including ice cream and sweets. Those who enjoy pan flavour will certainly love this holige prepared from pan leaf paste,” he said. Shrikrishna has also tried preparing holiges from cashewnuts, and is planning to introduce more flavours in the coming days. The shelf life of his holiges is around 20 days, and the cost varies from Rs 15 to Rs 30 per holige, depending on the flavour. Though he will not reveal the recipe, the other ingredients used are maida and sugar. His success has given him the confidence to start a ready-to-eat home products unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/farmer-makes-unique-flavoured-holige-during-lockdown/articleshow/85542826.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The man, a civil contractor, had Covid-19 in August last year. He took almost a month-long Covid treatment, including steroids. Almost four months after Covid recovery, he started complaining of pain in the left hip, followed by the right hip. Inamdar Hospital’s orthopaedic surgeon Murtaza Adeeb operated the man’s left hip on July 28 and the right four days later. The sequential total hip replacement surgery was done at Inamdar Hospital in Fatimanagar. “Post-surgery, I was in the hospital for eight days. I have started walking with full weight-bearing on both the legs,” the man said. He is all set to return to work after a yearlong fight with Covid-19 and the post-recovery complications. After alcohol and rheumatoid arthritis, orthopaedic surgeons are observing a rise in cases of Covid-linked avascular-necrosis (AVN) of the hip. “This man’s case is perhaps among the first few cases where a patient has undergone total hip replacement for Covid-linked hip AVN,” said Adeeb. Avascular necrosis is the death of bone tissue because of lack of blood supply. Also called osteonecrosis, it can lead to tiny breaks in the bone and its eventual collapse. Persistent pain in the hip, joint or groin area is the common complaint. Doctors say steroids, used to treat the infection, are a known risk factor in young patients getting avascular necrosis. Not all patients on steroids will develop AVN, though. It occurs in only those sensitive to certain steroids or those having a predilection for developing AVN. “Usually, non-Covid linked hip AVN takes more time to progress. The progression is quicker in Covid-linked AVN. These cases are likely to rise among Covid recovered with history of prolonged use of steroids,” said Adeeb, who has diagnosed about five cases of post-Covid AVN after the second Covid surge. Lokmanya Hospital’s owner and chief orthopaedic surgeon Narendra Vaidya said, “There has been an increase in cases of AVN hip. Covid virus itself and high steroid use are primarily seen as the reasons.” SaiShree hospital’s chief orthopaedic surgeon Neeraj Adkar said, “Prior to the Covid pandemic, we would see one to two cases of AVN hip per month. The number has gone up to three to four cases post-pandemic, especially after the second wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/after-coronavirus-infection-30-yr-old-undergoes-hip-replacement-surgery/articleshow/85577132.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The order for attachment of the properties of Ramprastha Promoters and Developers and Blue Bell Proptech Pvt Ltd to recover the amount was issued by a two-member bench headed by Justice Deepa Sharma. The Gurugram administration will now complete the procedure and the commission has set November 12 for the next date of hearing. “Issue warrants of attachment of properties of the judgement debtors for recovery of the decreetal amount for November 12, 2021,” the order said. A spokesperson of the builder said, “We have not yet received the orders. We will go through the direction and will comply with the order of the commission.” The NCDRC in its order dated March 19, 2021 had ordered the full refund of the amount paid by the four flat buyers with 9% interest for delay in giving possession of the properties within four weeks. After the builder failed to comply with the order the complainants had approached the NCDRC in June 2021 seeking stern action against the builder. The flat buyers had booked the properties in the residential project named “RISE” in Sector-37C in Gurugram in 2011 and 2012. The promoters had promised to hand over the flats in September 2015, according to the builder-buyer agreements. Justice Sharma had turned down the arguments of the builders that the project had got delayed due to Punjab and Haryana high court orders putting a complete ban on the use of the underground water for construction and that the builders were allowed only to use recycled water for construction. She had also ruled that only a four months’ extension due to some unforeseen was permitted and hence the promoters were bound under the said agreement to hand over the possession of the unit by September 2015 extendable to four months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/panel-orders-attachment-of-ggn-builders-assets/articleshow/85577145.cms||Dipak K Dash

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Forest department probe indicts NT Sajan||KOZHIKODE: The enquiry conducted by the forest department into the complaints against conservator of forests NT Sajan has indicted the IFS officer of serious wrongdoings, including filing a baseless report to the department that amounted to derailing the investigations into Muttil illegal tree felling case. The 18-page report of the probe conducted by additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF-FL&R) Rajesh Ravindran said that Sajan acted in a ‘highly undesirable, deplorable and grievous manner unbecoming of a civil servant’. It added that Sajan was involved with the prime accused in Muttil case (Augustine brothers) and their accomplices while filing the baseless report on February 15, which, by all indications, point to being written to serve vested interests. Though the inquiry report filed by APCCF on June 29 recommended immediate major disciplinary action against Sajan, no disciplinary action was taken by the government, except that he was transferred from Kollam to Kozhikode. The delay in taking disciplinary action against the officer has also given rise to charges that the government was shielding him. The forest department had constituted an enquiry based on complaints by Meppadi forest range officer MK Sameer, who had taken the illegally-felled timber from Muttil into custody, against Sajan that he tried to frame the field staff of Muttil range officer in the felling of trees at Manikunnumala. The enquiry found that the tone and tenor of the report in seeking stringent action against the field staff, alleging their collusion in organizing felling within forest land, was preposterous. “The contention that the land from where the trees were felled at Manikunnumala is part of vested forests is incorrect and has since been clarified as such in the detailed report of the custodian of vested forests on the matter,” the report said. “It is clear that NT Sajan IFS had acted in a highly undesirable, deplorable and grievous manner, unbecoming of a civil servant, in submitting his Report dated 15/02/2021 to PCCF (V&FI) virtually derailing the investigations into OR 1/2021 of Meppadi Forest Range and turning the attention on to a subject that was false and baseless. That in so doing he was involved with the prime accused in OR 1/2021 of Meppadi forest range and their accomplices make it even more worse, warranting immediate initiation of disciplinary action for major penalty against him,” stated the enquiry report by Ravindran. The report also added that Sajan had acted in ways highly unbecoming of a government servant violating the basic tenets and etiquettes expected in his job. “The alacrity with which he had moved about in his purported investigation into felling at Manikunnumala (alleged to be in vested forests), the irrational ways in which he chose to ignore the obvious field realities, his staunch reluctance to consult the revenue and forest authorities for their version on the secret information received by him, the blind reliance and trust he had reposed on the secret information being provided to him by the prime accused in the offences related to rosewood felling in LA patta lands of Wayanad, the frequent contacts he had had with the accused during the period, all point to his unmistakable and deliberate involvement in the issue in a way detrimental to the interests of the department,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/forest-dept-probe-indicts-nt-sajan/articleshow/85575037.cms||---

Water availability from the reservoir may deplete to levels where its supply will be affected if it does not rain soon. Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) data shows Vadodara has a rain deficit of 47% this season. VMC relies heavily on the Ajwa Reservoir that supplies around 27% of the water requirement of the city. A bulk of the supply from the reservoir goes to the eastern and southern parts of the city. In wake of the concerning situation, VMC mayor Keyur Rokadiya has written a letter to the minister of state for Narmada, Yogesh Patel, who is also an MLA from the Manjalpur constituency in the city. Rokadiya has requested Patel to ensure the supply of water to Ajwa from the Narmada project canal near the reservoir. “Presently, there is sufficient water in the reservoir. But it there are no rains in the coming days, we may need Narmada water,” said Rokadiya. The letter requests that the water should be provided without any charge. VMC’s executive engineer for water supply Amrut Makwana said that the pressure of water from the reservoir gradually goes down as it’s level recedes because the water is drawn with gravity. “In the past, it did supply water till it reached a level of 203-feet, but the low pressure reduces supply,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/hit-by-rain-deficit-vadodara-city-staring-at-water-shortage/articleshow/85572392.cms||---

Mali taunted the CM, posting on social media: “Captain sahib by starting fight with Navjot Singh Sidhu’s advisers you have shown what your political worth is left now.” He also asked people to speak on: “Who is Captain’s adviser on national security, Punjab administration and economic issues”. He also raised a finger at Amarinder’s adviser Bharat Inder Singh Chahal, saying he knew a lot about him as he worked with him (during previous tenure) as public relations officer. “It is also being said that all the transfers in Punjab are being done according to Sukhbir Badal’s wishes and you are only signing. What is the reality, only you know,” he posted. He concluded his post writing, “For now this much only”, an apparent warning that he could post more such things in future. In the evening, even Mali posted on his FB that “99.09 discussion with Sidhu was about agenda of Punjab, solutions to issues, peace and social amity, to implement farm movement’s vision and to defeat attempts to implement Modi’s agenda.” He also posted meeting with Sidhu was scheduled even before the CM’s meeting but news is being run that advisers have been summoned to Patiala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/but-mali-sticks-to-his-guns-takes-on-captain-directly/articleshow/85577175.cms||IP Singh
---||Kanpur||Kanpur: Teen accused of religious conversion held||KANPUR: The police arrested a teenager, who along with two others was accused of forced religious conversion, on Sunday. The arrest was made on the complaint of a local resident on whose allegations, locals had paraded an e-rickshaw-puller through the streets and publicly assaulted him on August 11. Police are on the lookout for two others who are on the run including a relative of the e-rickshaw puller. Before the August 11 incident, a complaint of molestation and SC/ST act was lodged against the accused. To recall, a woman resident of Kacchi Basti eight had accused three neighbors including a 16-year-old minor, besides Saddam and one Mukul of molesting her daughter and getting her converted for 20 thousand rupees. The police had registered a case on July 31, but in the absence of evidence during preliminary investigation, the police did not file a section of conversion in the FIR. In protest against this, the local activists later created a ruckus at Ram Gopal crossing in Kachchi Basti in Barra on Wednesday evening. When Afsar, a relative of one among the molesters passed by with a seven-year-old girl, the activists who were creating a ruckus dragged and thrashed him severely. Later, a video of the incident also went viral. In the video, Afsar’s minor daughter was seen desperately trying to save and clinging to him. Later, the police rescued Afsar and brought him to the police station. The Barra police had filed an FIR against a local man, who runs a marriage band, his son and around 10 unknown people, based on a complaint by the assaulted man Afsar Ahmed. Police had later informed that the three main accused were arrested late August 12 night in connection with the August 11 evening incident of assault and humiliation with Afsar Ahmed, an E rickshaw-driver, in the Barra area of the City. On August 13, three more persons were arrested while three accused arrested earlier were granted bail. Inspector Barra Harmeet Singh said that a 16-year-old teenager accused in the molestation case has been taken into custody and after being produced before the Juvenile Justice Board, has been sent to the Children’s Shelter Home. “Searches for two other accused in the case, Mukul and Saddam, are underway,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/teen-accused-of-religious-conversion-held/articleshow/85576191.cms||---

---||Pune||Good bacteria in nasal cavity can influence Covid severity, says study||PUNE: The existing good bacteria in the nasal environment of a Covid-19 positive person can influence the severity of the infection, a study by the city-based National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) and B J Medical College has revealed. Scientists say this could also explain why certain individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic — the concept being somewhat like the presence of good bacteria in the gut, which help one’s immunity fight infections. The study has also observed higher abundance of specific opportunistic pathogens in those infected with Covid-19, suggesting that the inflammatory environment caused by the infection leads to an increase in bacterial pathogens that may result in secondary infection. A secondary infection can occur when a different infection, known as the primary infection, makes a person more susceptible to disease. “The increase in pathogenic bacteria in the nasal microbiome (the microorganisms in a particular environment) of Covid-19 patients is due to the accumulation of mucus, known to favour the growth of these organisms, and hyper-inflammatory environment (extensive inflammation in the body) that supports their growth,” said Avinash Sharma, scientist, NCCS, who led the study. Sharma told TOI that the increase in various opportunistic pathogens in the nasal environment might also promote the entry of the virus via the route. He said, “There was a reduction in good bacteria, known to have a positive impact on the immune system, in the nasal region of Covid-19 patients. This in turn causes opportunistic pathogens to colonize the site. The study is significant as it can help determine how the virus actually promotes increase in opportunistic pathogens, which may enhance the severity of other diseases.” As part of the study, researchers collected nasopharyngeal swabs from clinically suspected patients of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their family contacts. Sharma said it was intriguing to investigate the microbiome shift in the asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. “Abundance of certain bacteria increased in the nasal environment of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to non-infected ones. Symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals were further classified based on their age groups and gender. We also found a contrasting change in the abundance of microorganisms within the asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in all the age groups. The difference in existing microbiome could thus also influence the severity of Covid in patients, though this needs further research,” Sharma said. The study has found that in most cases, the abundance of ‘Streptococcus’ (harmful bacteria) increased, while beneficial bacteria such as Veillonella, Rothia, and Prevotella 7 decreased in infected individuals. Dr Kaushal Sheth, honorary secretary of The Association of Otolaryngologist of India, told TOI, “The severity of Covid-19 could be influenced by the existing commensal pathogens since these essentially reinforce the mucosal barrier by decreasing the inflammatory reactions in the nasal mucosal lining, thereby preventing the entry of the virus." Sanjay Pujari from the Indian Council of Medical Research’s national task force on clinical research for Covid-19 and director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, told TOI, “The study makes some interesting observations and is first of its kind in India. Its findings on changes in nasal microbiome of Covid patients are likely to lead to the generation of further hypotheses to be tested in a longitudinal follow-up study. That, in turn, will confirm changes occuring in the nasal microbiome in different categories of Covid patients over the course of the illness.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/good-bacteria-in-nasal-cavity-can-influence-covid-severity-study/articleshow/85577205.cms||Neha Madaan

VHP regional secretary (gauraksha) Lal Mani Tiwari told TOI that a mobile squad of VHP's gauraksha unit on Monday 'raided' Kanha gaushala in Shankargarh and found a series of irregularities in the gaushala. He added that there were no proper arrangements of fodder and drinking water and that many cows were struggling to survive due to neglect. Tiwari further added that bodies of as many as 12 cows were dumped inside an open pit by the gaushala authorities. He also claimed that many cows in the gaushala had died of starvation earlier. The gaushala is home to about 1,500 cows and calves. Tiwari said that the person in -charge of the gaushala was hardly visiting the place which resulted in a series of irregularities in the gaushala. Tiwari, meanwhile, said that authorities were not sensitive towards the issue and that senior PMC authorities were also working as "a mute spectator". VHP leaders said that there was no upkeep of records at the gaushala and threatened to launch a massive agitation if things did not improve in the stipulated time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/vhps-gauraksha-squad-raids-shankargarh-gaushala/articleshow/85576281.cms||---

Mayor Amarjit Singh Jeeti Sidhu gave financial relief to the family of sewerman Harpal Singh on Tuesday. The mayor had passed a resolution in a regular meeting announcing Rs 10 lakh relief to families of the two sewermen who died at work. Sewerman Harpal Singh's wife Balwinder Kaur and their children were given Rs 10 lakh in the form of cheques in the presence of senior deputy mayor Amrik Singh Somal, deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi, MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg, joint commissioner Baldev Singh Dhillon and executive officer Harpreet Singh. Mayor Amarjit Singh Jeeti Sidhu said although the deceased was not a direct employee of the MC, but he died while cleaning sewerage in the city, so it was the duty of the MC to provide financial relief to his family. Balwinder Kaur, wife of the deceased was given a cheque of Rs 5 lakh while his two minor children were given cheques of Rs 2.5 lakh each. The mayor also announced that a job to a dependent from Harpal's family was being considered. He said similar financial relief would be given to the family of the second deceased sewerman soon.

---||Ahmedabad||HUID: 2.5 lakh Gujarat jewellery units protest||AHMEDABAD: About 2.5 lakh jewellery units including retailers, wholesalers, and jewellery-making establishments across Gujarat observed a total shutdown on Monday to protest the implementation of Hallmarking Unique Identification (HUID). Jewellers said that the new rules are against the principles of ease of doing business as hallmarking centres are unable to cope with order volumes. That, jewellers said, caused huge pile-ups at centres and severe delays in deliveries on part of the jewellers. A day’s shutdown, according to industry estimates, meant a loss of gold and silver business worth Rs 200 crore across the state. Representatives of various jewellery associations held a peaceful demonstration on CG Road in Ahmedabad on Monday morning. “Before the HUID implementation, we were able to deliver a fresh order within five to seven days,” said Zaveribhai Zaveri, president, Gujarat Jewellers’ Association (GJA). “Manufacturing takes four to five days unless intricate work is involved and another day for hallmarking. However, with HUID in place, the turnaround time has gone up to 15 days.” Zaveri added: “We are not able to take urgent order requests of customers. When business has barely begun recovering, we’re losing at least 10% of customers to delayed deliveries.” Hallmarking was made mandatory from June 16 across the country in a phased manner and the government has identified about 256 districts from 28 states and Union territories for the first phase of implementation. Jewellery businesses remained shut in response to a nationwide strike call by about 350 jewellery associations, according to All India Gems and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC). Zaveri said that soon after the implementation of HUID, at least 15 meetings were held between Union government representatives and the jewellery industry stakeholders, which evoked no action on part of the government. In Ahmedabad, the usually bustling Manek Chowk, a century-old jewellery market, bore a deserted look on Monday. Similarly, the Ratanpole Jewellery market that houses various small jewellery stores and manufacturing units remained shut. Industry estimates suggest that in Ahmedabad alone, gold and silver business worth at least Rs 25 crore was hit due to the day’s shutdown. Gems and jewellery industry stakeholders suggest that the new rules are adding to the compliance burden of jewellers. “The HUID process is cumbersome and requires separate entries for each piece of jewellery and it only increases our compliance burden,” said Hemant Choksi, a bullion trader. “Smaller jewellers cannot afford this because several jewellery-making units and wholesalers do not even have a computer.” Jewellers also fear that the government may use the data being uploaded for HUID to crack down on jewellers for any mismatch in stock that is hallmarked and sold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/huid-2-5l-guj-jewellery-units-protest/articleshow/85577336.cms||---

Last week, the BMC stepped up the number of tests on a couple of days to almost 55,000, but the number of positive cases went up only marginally. “The Covid situation is in control, but we are having a meeting on Tuesday to review preparations for the third wave,” said a senior BMC official. Health minister Rajesh Tope said that based on a letter received from NITI Aayog in June regarding the potential third wave, the state has begun its preparations for it. “We have taken the third wave prediction seriously. We have ramped up bed infrastructure, medical supplies and even oxygen production. There is no need to panic, we have to continue to follow Covid protocols and vaccinate in large numbers,” Tope said. He also hinted reopening of temples where crowd control is a problem will not happen soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-daily-covid-cases-in-state-lowest-since-feb-15/articleshow/85577248.cms||---

Private shack operators — who function out of private properties — are gearing up too. Allottees are looking to make the most of the last year of their three-year licence period, considering that the last two seasons were unsuccessful owing to pandemic-induced restrictions. “A majority of the allottees are preparing for the new season and will set up their shacks as soon as their licences are renewed,” said president of the Shack Owners’ Welfare Society (SOWS) Cruz Cardozo. He said that the new tourism season is expected to take off by September-October if the Covid-19 situation does not worsen. A beach shack licence is issued for a period of three years and is required to be renewed each year during the validity period. The three-year validity of the current licences ends in the 2021-22 tourism season. For the 2022-23 season, the tourism department will have to undertake a fresh exercise to choose new allottees through a lottery system. The existing allottees, therefore, have only one season in hand to recover their investments that run into lakhs of rupees. Besides the expenses of setting up a shack — which is in the range of Rs 2-3 lakh or more for some — a shack licence fee is significantly high and will depend on the category of the beach stretch where it is allotted. The licence fee charged for shacks allotted on stretch ‘A’ this season is close to Rs 1.3 lakh, while those on ‘B’ stretches are required to pay Rs 1 lakh. Besides licence fees, the allottees have to pay fees to various other authorities. “If we add up the income of the past two seasons, it will not be equal to a single season prior to the pandemic. So, where are we supposed to generate funds from to pay fees amounting to more than Rs 2 lakh?” Cardozo said. He also questioned the payment of Rs 13,000 to Goa Electronic Ltd (GEL). Shawn Lobo, who operates a shack in South Goa, said the cost of setting up the structures is also high as they depend on labour force from other states. “It is not easy to find local labourers for the job,” he said. Raj Naik, who runs a guest house and restaurant at Benaulim, told TOI that even as he has begun refurbishing with the hope that he will start operations by September, he is apprehensive of the hurdles he will have to cross to obtain all permissions. Incidentally, it is the private shack operators who have an upper hand where starting early is concerned because other beach shacks can start setting up only after the tourism department completes the demarcation process. “The season is supposed to be from September to May, but the government procedures end in November and we lose two months of the beginning of the season,” a beach shack operator complained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shack-operators-pin-hopes-on-new-tourism-season-for-recovery/articleshow/85577257.cms||Bindiya Chari

Their priority was the construction of the Ram temple. He visited Gorakhnath temple several times and I also met him during his visits,” Dwarika Tiwari of Gorakhnath temple said. Kalyan Singh also attended the award ceremony of Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad Foundation on December 10, 2013 in Gorakhpur. Addressing the event, he had praised the education based on nationalist ideology being provided at the institutes run by the Foundaion. State convener of BJP Panchayat Prakoshth, Ramesh Singh, said Kalyan Singh revered Gorakshpeeth and Mahant Avaidyanath. “In 2006, when he was in Gorakhpur to attend his brother’s marriage, he visited Gorakhnath temple to meet Mahant Avaidyanath after he came to know about his infirm health. He also came to Gorakhpur for a BJP rally in 2014 and took blessings of Peethadhishwar Mahant Avaidyanath,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kalyan-had-strong-ties-with-gorakhshpeeth/articleshow/85576155.cms||Arjumand Bano

Anil Malhotra, advocate at the Punjab and Haryana high court, in his complaint, said, “Imposing penalties for offences under the Motor Vehicle Act and Rules is not within the domain of private agencies in government institutions. Kindly please inquire into the matter from the PGIMER authorities for appropriate action in accordance with law.” The lawyer alleged that on Saturday, when there was a heavy downpour, he parked his car in a non-parking area of the hospital. “As I had undergone spine and knee surgery recently, to avoid slippery surfaces, my driver parked in an area adjoining the neurology department, where I had to consult a doctor. We were not stopped at that time.” There was no response from PGI authorities on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lawyer-files-plaint-after-pgi-tows-his-car-for-wrong-parking/articleshow/85575049.cms||Shimona Kanwar

In Canacona taluka, which prides itself for the abundance of talented idol makers, preparations begin nearly two-and-a-half months in advance. Idol makers at the 40-50 idol-making chitrashalas (art workshop) in Char-Rasta, Khola, Mashem, Loliem, Gaondongrim, Cotigao and Polem, are now busy giving final touches to the Ganesh idols. “Almost 80-90% of the work in Chitrashalas has ben completed. Only painting the idols is now remaining, which some chitrashalas are done with 50% of the work,” says Manoj Prabhugaonkar, one of the artisans who makes these idols at Mashem. However, the pandemic has affected their work this year. Work of Manoj, Rupesh and Rajesh Chari, known as ‘three Chari brothers’ from Char-Rasta, has reached North Karnataka too, and their services are sought in making huge Sarvajanik Ganesha idols and other decorations. However, one of the three brothers said that the present Covid situation doesn’t permit them to cater to orders from outside Canacona. At Prabhugaonkar’s workshop, which is thatched with polythene sheets to avoid rain seepage, usually six to eight artists work day and night to complete the idol orders. However, this year the workshop has only Manoj working with just two hired labourers and some of his friends, neighbours and family members lending a helping hand as he gives shape and colour to around 180 idols. He said, “My labourers mainly come from the ghats of North Karnataka, but due to Covid restrictions, they have not come. I have fixed clients and have to make 180-200 idols every year. Without any help this year, I have to work overtime and I feel it’s the same for most of the idol makers in Canacona.” With the Covid restrictions still in force, the idol makers here have not taken any orders of Ganesh idols from the sarvajanik mandals and are treading cautiously only to complete smaller-sized idols as of now. “Since the Ganeshotsav celebration is hardly three weeks away, the government has issued Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the celebration at public places, which the worshippers will have to adhere to,” said an idol maker in Canacona. We have decided to celebrate the Ganeshotsav as per the instructions and guidelines that have been issued by the authorities and it will not be on a grand scale like earlier, said a member of one of the Ganeshotsav Mandals in Canacona.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/artists-work-overtime-to-complete-ganesh-idols/articleshow/85578944.cms||Albert Fernandes
---||Ludhiana||Punjab: Navjot Singh Sidhu summons advisers after row on Pakistan and Kashmir remarks||PATIALA: Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president (PPCC) Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday summoned his advisers Malwinder Singh Mali and Dr Pyare Lal Garg, whose remarks on Pakistan and Kashmir sparked a controversy, to his residence here to discuss the matter. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had on Sunday warned against “atrocious and ill-conceived comments that were potentially dangerous to the peace and stability of the state and the country,” referring to the statements made by the duo. Even Congress in-charge Harish Rawat weighed in on the issue. Garg had questioned Amarinder’s criticism of Pakistan while Mali gave a controversial remark on Kashmir. Mali also posted an objectionable poster of late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on social media. After coming out of the meeting, they said agendas related with the welfare of Punjab were discussed with Sidhu. Mali said what he said in his social media post was final. When asked about Congress leader Manish Tewari’s comment regarding their views, Mali said that he has “a right to give his suggestion, just as I have the same right”. Tewari had said that such persons should not be a part of the Congress party as Kashmir was an integral part of the country. Mali added that there the process of dialogue should be followed, so that mistakes, if any, committed by him or anybody else, can be rectified. “I respect everyone’s views,” he said. Quoting a Gurbani hymn, he said, “This is a land of Guru Nanak. There should be a dialogue. Kich kahiye kich suniye (say something, hear something)”. Earlier in the day, Mali said, “There is nothing anti-national in my social media posts. My views (remarks) that have kicked up a controversy are the same as they were in 1989. The government recruited me much later. I will remove the picture (sketch of Indira Gandhi). There are my write-ups published with such views. I had an alliance with Navjot Singh Sidhu’s agenda.” Garg said his statement was made in personal capacity. “We have tabled our suggestions on agendas of Punjab and told our views for the welfare of the state. It is up to Navjot Singh Sidhu to accept or not. Whatever Mali had said or posted on social media has been done in his individual capacity and what I say is in my individual capacity. I criticise every government and even applaud those who perform well. We will appreciate whosoever is on the right path and criticise and oppose all those who are on the wrong path because we want development of Punjab.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/day-after-capt-objects-sidhu-summons-advisers-after-over-pak-kashmir-remarks/articleshow/85577305.cms||---

The announcement came even as an outfit representing these teachers has given a call to boycott such surveys. The two separate announcements emerged after the talks between the government and Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, Gujarat, failed to reach any conclusion. The mahasangh is a teachers’ union. The mahasangh and other groups have questioned the government’s intention in conducting a survey on the quality of teachers in government and grant-in-aid schools. State education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama held a meeting with teachers’ association leaders on Monday, but neither side accepted the other’s views. After the meeting, Chudasama said that the government will go ahead with the planned teachers’ capability survey as it’s necessary to improve the quality of education in the state. “There is nothing against the teachers in the survey. Like running any other professional capability mapping survey, we decided to conduct this,” Chudasama said. “This survey is voluntary, so those who do not want to take part can stay away.” About the talks, Chudasama added, “The demand of association leaders that the survey not be held is unreasonable. The government appeals to all teachers to participate in the survey in the larger interest of the students.” The government said that of the 1.80 lakh primary school teachers across the state, about 1.18 lakh have agreed to take part in the survey. The survey is not mandatory, the government has clarified while asking all teachers to participate in it. The survey is not a test and the details are not going to be incorporated into the service books of the teaching community, according to a state government media release. However, mahasangh functionaries said that 2 lakh of its members will observe a day’s fast on Tuesday as a mark of protest. They said that the survey is nothing but an exam and is an insult to the teachers. They want the government to scrap it as teachers are supposed to conduct exams for students, not take exams themselves to prove their capabilities. “All teachers will not only boycott the survey but a day’s fast will also be observed to protest the government’s decision,” said Ghanshyam Patel, chairman of Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, Gujarat. “We have been very clear about our stand regarding the survey from day one and will keep opposing it till the government reconsiders its decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/teachers-capability-survey-govt-firm-union-to-boycott/articleshow/85577341.cms||---

The victim, a woman from Bicholim, complained that the accused gave her a lift on her non-geared scooter, offered her food and a soft drink that on consuming left her drowsy and motionless, following which she was robbed. The investigating officer submitted to the court that the accused, Pooja Naik Kharde has similar cases registered against her at the Old Goa police station. “In the case at hand, this applicant is involved in similar crimes as the present one and she is said to have committed these crimes at different places. For this reason her previous application for bail was rejected by this court as the court felt that in such a situation, it will not be unreasonable to hold that in the event if the applicant is released, she will continue to indulge in similar offences. There is no change in circumstances. Hence, this application is dismissed,” additional sessions judge Sherin Paul stated. TOI had earlier reported that the same woman in November last year was arrested for administering intoxicating tender coconut water at Calangute to a woman and thereafter stealing her double-layered gold chain or golden beeds locally known as ‘Kotmirichi mala’ worth Rs 1.5 lakh and cash of Rs 7,000. At the time Calangute police were able to recover 42gm of melted gold at her instance from a goldsmith, but were not able to recover the cash.

He said AICC president Sonia Gandhi to explain why the Punjab Congress was hand-in-glove with Pakistan top forces which have been fomenting subversive and disruptive activities in Jammu and Kashmir and in other parts of the country. “Have Sidhu’s advisers taken a clue from the Taliban forces?” he said, adding that if this was the state of affairs inthe Congress, a case of treason be registered against the advisers of Sidhu who are reflecting Sidhu’s state of mind indirectly. “The entire country knows how much friendly Sidhu is to Imran Khan and Gen Bajwa and now his advisers are serving his cause covertly which is a threat to the nation’s integrity,” the BJP leader alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhus-advisers-pak-agents-bjp/articleshow/85577363.cms||---

The authority had invited bids for contract of design and construction of the depot on design built lump sum price basis for double-line high speed railway involving various works. They included works for site formation, abutment, retaining walls, box culvert, roads, cable duct, general inspection train shed and maintenance depot at Sabarmati. Sources said that the project amount is more than Rs 350 crore. The bullet train project authority rejected the bid by Montecarlo and the contract was awarded to SCC-VRS (JV). Montecarlo approached the Delhi HC with the contention that its bid was rejected without giving any reason despite it being the lowest and though it satisfies the technical as well as financial criteria mentioned in the bid document. It challenged the communications rejecting its bids.

---||Goa||Fishermen use change in oceanographic conditions to advantage, haul in bumper catch at Caranzalem||PANAJI: Fishermen at Caranzalem beach have been witnessing a bumper catch in recent days, with experts at the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) attributing this unusual phenomenon to the massive congregation to oceanographic factors, especially low dissolved oxygen content pushing the fish close to the coast. “The water column of 100-1,000m in the entire eastern Arabian Sea has anoxic environment wherein the oxygen is very low. During the Southwest monsoon, the oxygen-minimum water gets pushed to the coastal area, due to which seasonal hypoxia occurs. The fish then rushes away from the oxygen-minimum water and runs upstream,” NIO director, Sunil Kumar Singh, told TOI. He further said that the fishermen in the state have been able to identify the phenomenon and accordingly venture into the waters for fishing, and hence can net a huge catch. “This has been happening annually for the past few years for some time during the Southwest monsoon,” Kumar said, adding that it is a natural phenomenon as oxygen-minimum water gets pushed to the coastal area which in turn pushes the fish to the riverside or coastline. A video of the huge landing of fish being caught by traditional fishermen on Thursday went viral as the ramponkaars could be seen trying to fill their baskets with the bumper catch. The fish that was netted consisted majorly of pelagic fish like sardines, khapa burate, pedve, etc, and medium to larger-sizes of demersal fish like patashe, skates, rays, dhoma and bale to a lesser extent. The abundant availability of food organisms such as zooplankton might also be driving the fish close to the coast which are caught by the beach seine nets, said NIO’s senior principal scientist, Dr A R Sreepada. “The availability of younger stages of crustaceans in large numbers close to the coast might be attracting carnivorous demersal fishes and getting caught in beach seines,” he added. Massive landings of fish on the Carnazalem-Miramar stretch during the August-September months has become a regular phenomenon during the last few years. The NIO said that this requires thorough scientific investigation “encompassing physical, chemical, biological oceanographic parameters,” “The stakeholders may be sensitised on the utilisation of non-commercial smaller-size fish by converting them into a useful product called fish silage instead of discarding them on the beaches which give rise to bad odour,” Sreepada said. Researchers at the institute are working on a project on the valorisation of fishery waste into useful products. Recently, the results of recovery of amino acids having application in enhancing plant growth from fishery waste have been published in scientific reports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fishermen-use-change-in-oceanographic-conditions-to-advantage-haul-in-bumper-catch-at-caranzalem/articleshow/85577366.cms||Nida Sayed

The teachings of Sree Narayana Guru attain global significance in this context, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday. “Bloodshed in the name of religion and caste is on the rise across the world. The human crisis, brought about by this, is currently pounding humanity in our neighbouring country, Afghanistan. At times, communal hatred flares up in alarming proportions in our own country too. Communal hatred of people is at play in the case of Palestine and the issue of Rohingya refugees. It was the undercurrent of Kashmir and Punjab issues too. All these could be kept in check if people understood Guru’s message that all human beings are equal and no discrimination among them is possible,” he said, while inaugurating Sree Narayana Guru Jayanti celebrations. Guru gave the world a message that would help them avoid the fire of communal and religious hatred. His message should reach wherever people fight over caste and religion, he added. “He made a proposition that human beings are one and the same. Never before have we come across a situation where religious-communal and terror organizations strangled humanity in the present proportions. We should be able to march ahead by holding humanity above caste and religion. Only then, we can say that we do respect the Guru,” the chief minister said. Vijayan said that efforts should be made to understand the personality and mind of the great guru. Kerala produced several spiritual gurus, but, only one Sree Narayana Guru could rewrite the history of his motherland. His message had its impact on other communities as well. Yogakshema Sabha of Brahmins and NSS of Nair community got their source of energy from the message of Sree Narayana Guru, he said. Pinarayi Vijayan said a closer look at the installation of Siva idol at Aruvappulam would prove that it was not a spiritual act, but a physical act against social inequalities and caste discrimination. “He proved that the right to worship is not the exclusive right of a few. He didn’t mean any greater spiritual meanings beyond that. Soon, he proclaimed that school is the main centre for worship...it would be improper to view the Guru as a mere seeker of spirituality,” he added. Vijayan expressed hope that the celebrations planned next year could be celebrated with much fanfare in a Covid-free environment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-gurus-message-key-to-peace-in-difficult-times/articleshow/85575241.cms||---

Stating that AIMIM is not supporting anyone including Taliban, he said the Modi-government should invite AIMIM to the all-party meeting where the External Affairs Minister will be briefing about the Afghanistan situation. “We (AIMIM) also want to know what is the policy of India towards Afghanistan and Taliban,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/what-is-centres-policy-on-taliban/articleshow/85577404.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt urges organisers to call off dahi handi||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday appealed to organisers of dahi handi events to call off festivities due to the pandemic. He urged them to "set an example to the world that Maharashtra has prioritised saving of lives over (conducting) festivities". Gokulashtami or dahi handi falls August 30. It requires physical proximity among scores of govindas who form the human pyramid. Most participants are under the age of 35 and yet to be fully vaccinated, experts say, putting public health at risk given the imminent third wave. Although the Dahi Handi Samanvay Samiti was amenable to Thackeray's suggestion, opposition parties seized the opportunity to question government policy. The MNS in Thane announced it will d efy the order and conduct the festival. BJP MLA Ashish Shelar demanded that "localised dahi handi be permitted with participants who have taken both doses of the vaccine". Civic elections are due next year, taking this high stakes game one notch higher. On Monday, Thackeray held a virtual meeting with dahi handi committees statewide. He said though cases are receding, the threat is far from over. He asked organisers to sustain the festive spirit by organising camps to donate blood and Covid treatment gear. Arun Patil, working president of the Samanvay Samiti said, "We are not pleased at the cancellation of course, but what can one do when health experts and doctors who have saved so many lives during the pandemic advise you to call off the event? After all, the third wave is unpredictable. We had sought to hold localised events but we realise we cannot risk lives." Most dahi handi events are organised by politicians from various parties who were present at the interaction. The CM said, "Countries across the world are reporting a third wave despite vaccinating their populations. The Niti Aayog's report on the severity of the third wave and requirement of ICU beds has increased our concerns. We share the same sentiments about our tradition and culture, but in times like these we prioritise people's lives." Thackeray said the second wave was receding in some districts, but peaking in others, and curbs were eased only to ensure livelihoods were less affected in this 'window period'. He took a swipe against opposition parties which threatened to protest against the restrictions. At the meeting, state Covid-19 task force chief Dr Sanjay Oak said physical distancing cannot be maintained during dahi handi, and most young participants are not fully vaccinated.

While its population of 1,500 has been shifted to relief camps set up by the district administration in higher ground, the villagers fear not much will be left of their village once the water recedes due to massive soil erosion. Preparing for the worst, most of the residents of Bachepara had already demolished their ‘pucca’ houses before the flood water entered their village in order to save their bricks and other material like doors, windows, etc and ferried them to a higher place on bullock carts and tractor trolleys. On its part, the district administration is carrying out surveys for sanctioning compensation to the people who have lost their homes and their agricultural lands washed away by the Ghaghara. More than 120 families of this village have been affected. Dhaurahra’s sub divisional magistrate Renu (who goes by her first name) told TOI, “This village has been largely affected because the river has changed its course. Most of it is lost because of soil erosion. The affected families have been shifted to higher places safely. We have conducted a survey of the village and compensation will be rewarded to the affected families.” SDM Renu added, “We have also distributed ration kits and offered the families to permanently shift to another place but they are reluctant and want to return to their village after the Ghaghara water level settles. We are now planning to build flats, where these families can be shifted during the floods and a place has been finalized for the same. Most of the development works cannot be carried out at this village and others because they are situated in the flood-prone area. This is the reason why power lines have also not been provided to these villages.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-village-is-on-verge-of-vanishing-under-swollen-ghaghara-river/articleshow/85572559.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Central team collects Luni water to check pollution||JAISALMER: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Sunday collected samples from the rain-fed Luni river to keep tabs on the waterbody’s pollution levels. The team collected water samples from a stretch of 22km. The Times of India had on August 6 published a report about the river getting polluted in Balotara in Barmer district. The mandate for keeping a check on the pollution levels in a state river lies with the state. Luni is a state-specific river. TOI had learnt that locals were unhappy with the way Rajasthan Pollution Control Board was dealing with the matter and so that made a plea to the newly appointed environment minister Bhupendra Yadav of taking strict action to controlling water pollution. A local NGO, Pradushan Nivaran Evam Paryavaran Sanrakshan Samiti, leading a campaign against pollution informed the team about the sources of effluents being released in the water. Samiti member Om Prakash Saini said the CPCB bench officer Praveen Jain was apprised about the damages caused to the fields near the river due to chemical pollution. MLA Hamir Singh Bhayal was also present. The CPCB team visited Mahesh Nagar, Rampura, Ajit and nearby areas. Farmers unanimously demanded to stop the flow of chemically polluted water from Pali and Jodhpur districts into the rivers. Samiti president Tulsaram Choudhary said they had demanded district collector, divisional commissioner and state pollution control board to stop discharge of chemicals into the river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/central-team-collects-luni-water-to-check-pollution/articleshow/85577417.cms||---

Stating that caste-based census was carried out before independence and one is essential to be taken up now, Owaisi said the reality is that OBCs who comprise 50% of population in the country are getting 27% reservation and those who comprise 20% of the populace are enjoying 50% quota. He also lambasted union minister Hardeep Singh Puri for linking the matter of Sikhs and Hindus fleeing the Taliban-controlled Afghanistan with the CAA .

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Prospect of travel in festive season raises Covid fears||Mumbai: There are fears that intra-state travel and socialising in the coming festive season could push up Covid-19 cases in the city and Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Lakhs of people travel to their hometowns in Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Pune, Satara, Kolhapur to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi. Some of these districts still report cases in big numbers even as detections in Mumbai have dropped below 300. Pune, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli are recording more than 300-600 cases daily. As far as variants are concerned, the highest number of emerging Delta-plus cases have been found in Ratnagiri. “If Covid-appropriate behaviour is not followed, people travelling from the city could be carrying the infection back,” said Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and head of the state’s Covid death audit committee. “That’s how variants could enter the city too. We have to take utmost care about inter-district travel and ensure that all Covid protocols are followed,” he said. Dr Shashank Joshi, the state Covid taskforce member, said Kerala too saw a surge after festivities. “We need to be mindful that festivities become public health challenges as there is congregation and overcrowding,” he said. “Further, with Delta in transmission, the infection can spread very fast if precautions are not taken,” he said, urging people to celebrate at home as much as possible. It is also unlikely there will be inter-district travel curbs for the festive season. "We are closely monitoring infection rate in the Konkan districts--Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg-- which see a lot of travel from the Mumbai region during Ganpati. Also, district administrations can be empowered to add local restrictions in case they see a surge," said an official. Additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said people can only be urged to get tested promptly if they develop symptoms. He said Mumbai will use genome sequencing to trace variants in people with travel history. Officials hope that guidelines to downsize the festival will be sufficient to dial down spirits. They believe further curtailing of festivities will be tricky as most parties are trying to appease native sentiments ahead of the BMC elections slated early next year. "There are a lot of people from Konkan who vote in Mumbai and their sentiments ahead of the elections will be important. The government will have to work out a balance,” said an official. A solution could be to allow fully vaccinated people to travel or seek RT-PCR negative reports as is mandated in air travel as well, said Dr Rahul Pandit, a taskforce member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-prospect-of-travel-in-festive-season-raises-covid-fears/articleshow/85577528.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Border Roads Organisation (BRO) personnel equipped with heavy machines are facing difficulties in reopening the highway due to constant rolling down of boulders and debris. "A temporary walkable road has been built for the movement of locals of Niti valley, who are being helped by the SDRF and NDRF personnel stationed there," Nand Kishore Joshi, district disaster management officer, told TOI. Moreover, Chinook choppers have been pressed into service to transport supplies to personnel along the border. They are operating from the nearest base in Joshimath, an official said. Nearly 300-350 people in 12 villages of Niti valley have been disconnected from the rest of the state due to the Malari highway blockade, Joshi said, adding there is no shortage of supplies in the villages. According to district authorities, the falling of boulders and debris from the hills has stopped and the road is likely to be reopened in the next 24 hours. In the past 24 hours, Chamoli district received 7.7 mm rainfall, which is second highest in the state after Pithoragarh, according to the regional Met centre. On the other hand, the Met office has issued an alert of heavy rainfall in seven districts in the next 48 hours. As per the 'yellow alert', "heavy rainfall with intense spells" is likely to occur at isolated places in Nainital, Champawat, Bageshwar and Pithoragarh districts on August 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/malari-highway-connecting-china-border-blocked-for-last-10-days/articleshow/85572624.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The All India Congress Committee (AICC) is likely to announce the new names this week itself. The party high command has called both the leaders to New Delhi for discussion. The high command had also received complaints from senior leaders in the state Ramesh Chennithala and Oommen Chandy that they were not consulted while preparing the list of the new presidents. Both Chandy and Chennithala had complained to the high command that their nominees were not considered by Sudhakaran while preparing the list. Even former KPCC presidents V M Sudheeran and Mullappally Ramachandran also raised the same complaint that they were not consulted. Hence the high command is likely to consider the requests of the senior leaders before finalizing the names of the district Congress presidents. Sudhakaran had submitted a panel of names in each district to the AICC. He had made it clear that the list was prepared purely based on merit and no group affiliations were considered. AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar had contacted both Chennithala and Chandy following their complaints. Now, the leaders in the state are eagerly waiting to know whether the party high command will concede to the demands of the group managers or will act neutrally. During the appointment of Sudhakaran as the party president and Satheesan as the opposition leader, the Congress high command was not ready to bow to the demands of the group leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/high-command-to-hold-talks-with-kpcc-chief-oppn-leader/articleshow/85575231.cms||---

Locals who informed the civic authorities were in panic as water from the river was their main source of drinking water.The water body created due to weir-cum-causeway on Tapi river is named Narmad Sarovar. Water flows from bank to bank in the river throughout the year due to regular discharge of water from Ukai reservoir. Recently, due to heavy rains in the catchment area, a lake was formed in the area with water level going up to 6 meters. As soon as the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials got news of the dead fish and snakes on the shore of the river, they swung into action. The health department teams visited the spot and collected water samples. “Actions will be taken by concerned departments like fisheries or GPCB. But SMC’s health department team is closely monitoring the situation,” said an SMC health official. “If more fish are found in the next couple of days we will start an investigation with the support of other departments,” the official added. In the past, thousands of dead fish were found on Dumas beach. Marine experts said that due to a drop in dissolved oxygen in water, sometimes the fish die in large numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/dead-fish-snakes-raise-stink-in-tapi/articleshow/85572985.cms||---

According to the minor girl’s family, the five men entered their house on Sunday night when they were sleeping and took away the girl after stuffing a piece of cloth into her mouth. The girl’s father said in his complaint to police, “My daughter was sleeping in the verandah of the house on Sunday night. Others were sleeping upstairs. The five youths entered the house and abducted my daughter. They stuffed her mouth with cloth and took her to some shop owned by one of them where they raped her. They left her in an unconscious state near my house. After regaining consciousness, she returned home on Monday and narrated everything.” Police said that based on the complaint, a case has been registered against all the five accused, Waseem, Najeeb, Shafeeq, Nazim and Sanib. One of the accused has been detained for interrogation. To prevent a possible communal flare-up, police have been put on alert in the area. But, police said that medical examination of the girl didn’t confirm sexual assault. Superintendent of police (SP) of Rampur, Ankit Mittal, said, “The girl’s medical examination was conducted. And no evidence of sexual assault has been found. The girl’s statement will be recorded before a magistrate on Tuesday.” The SP city added, “Preliminary investigation in the case has revealed that the girl was in contact with one of the accused, who has now been detained. One other person named as accused by the family is out of town for quite some time. However, considering the seriousness of the case and allegations made, thorough investigation is being done.” Circle officer Dharam Singh said, “An FIR has been registered against the five men under IPC section 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 376-D (gang rape) and under relevant provisions of the SC/ST Act and POCSO (prevention of children from sexual offenses) Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/dalit-girl-14-kidnapped-from-home-gang-raped-by-5-in-rampur/articleshow/85572648.cms||Maria Khan

What is the hurry or need to open for all classes in one go? Did they not learn anything from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, which is seeing an increase in positive cases after schools reopened,” asked K Venkata Sainath, joint secretary, Hyderabad Schools Parents Association. “We feel this move is completely unnecessary. The state should have instead resumed physical classes for classes 8 and above,” he added. K Praveen Raju, president, Independent Schools Management Association said there is a need to address the loss of learning, the development of a child is far greater than Covid-19 cases. “It is right to resume physical classes for all students. Let parents decide whether or not to send their children to schools. We, the management, are anyway going to continue to provide both online and offline classes,” Raju said. College management and teachers too have welcomed the move. During the pandemic, when classes were being held online, many teachers and colleges had raised concerns over poor attendance and grasping of syllabus among students. “Online classes cannot substitute physical classes. The learning outcome among students, especially those pursuing professional colleges, was dropping. Teachers were overburdened due to the online classes. Adding to the misery, many institutions were not paying or only partially paying their employees. The physical reopening will certainly weed out all these issues,” said A Santhosh Kumar, president of Telangana Schools Technical Colleges Employees Association. Many students, especially those in the first year, are keen to go back to their classrooms. Managements said that the reopening of institutions will give practical exposure to students which was missing for more than a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/institutes-welcome-move-to-reopen-but-parents-guarded/articleshow/85582995.cms||---

The board would also set up a user-friendly, convenient and transparent web portal for solar rooftop applications so that applicants can monitor the status of their requests without any difficulty. The single point of contact comes as per the provisions envisaged in the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules 2020 passed by the Union government. KSEB has given shape to various mechanisms for enabling hassle-free implementation of the rules, which came into force on December 31, 2020. The decision to set up a single point of contact for the rooftop solar installation scheme is one of the first set of consumer-friendly initiatives being adopted by the electricity board. The single point of contact would ensure that consumers won’t have to approach various offices or sections in case s/he decides to set up a rooftop solar system. All services, from application submission to the commissioning of the plant, can be availed over a single point of contact. The rule requires the licensee (KSEB) to display the details of the single point contact prominently on its website. An officer not below the rank of an executive engineer in the office of the chief engineer (renewable energy and energy savings) would be appointed as the corporate-level single point contact in case of the grid connected solar installations. “The official acting as the single point contact shall be conversant with all laws, rules and procedures related to solar installations and services,” a KSEB order in this regard said. The board has been receiving good response from consumers for setting up the grid connected solar plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kseb-eases-procedures-for-setting-up-solar-power-units/articleshow/85575280.cms||B S Anilkumar

Also, Shukoor had later telephoned another friend of his and told him where the body has been disposed of. We found the body in the search conducted at the spot mentioned by him,” he added. Police said that the deceased Prajeesh and both the accused were friends and were working as carpenters. Police had received a complaint of teak timber worth Rs 4 lakh going missing from an under-construction house at Mouvanchery on July 11. Based on the information received from Prajeesh during questioning, police had arrested Shukooor and A Riyas. However, the two managed to secure bail and Shukoor nursed a grudge against Prajeesh for revealing the information about his role in the timber theft to police. The other accused in the timber theft case, Riyas, was let off by the police after finding that he had no role in the murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/youth-killed-in-kannur-body-dumped-in-canal/articleshow/85575309.cms||---

The accused - in both cases - claimed to be working in a foreign country. In the first incident, one of the victims, a resident of Nehru Colony, had received a call from a fake courier agent who told her that their friend had sent $40,000 from the USA and to receive that Rs 26,000 had to be deposited as conversion charges. Another incident took place with one Anil Uniyal who met a woman on a matrimonial site. The woman claimed to be living abroad and promised to come to India this month. The woman called after a few days and claimed that she was carrying gold and had to pay some tax and her credit card was not working. She later demanded Rs 60,000 from the victim which he paid. He later realised that he was tricked and lodged a police complaint. An FIR under IPC section 420 has been registered at Nehru Colony and the matter is being investigated. In both the complaints, the two persons were duped nearly Rs 2 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/two-duped-by-online-fraudsters-who-befriended-them-on-matrimonial-site/articleshow/85572690.cms||Abhijeet Singh

District collector Lok Bandhu and SP Anand Sharma visited the refinery on Sunday and took stock of construction. Bandhu and Sharma also directed officers to complete the work on time. Later, the district collector had a meeting with the refinery officers and reviewed in detail the entire project. Bandhu said he advised officers to bring additional labourers to add momentum to the construction. He said Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) had assured him to increase manpower. Currently, 13,000 labourers were working at the project site. During the visit, the district collector directed HPCL officers to improve the health services and directed them to provide better doctors, ambulances and increase toilet facilities and add more fire tenders. The district collector said there was some issue of land allotment and assured all possible help on behalf. He said land was needed for developing some colonies and other facilities. He told HPCL to send a proposal so that it could be sent to the state government. Bandhu said he and the SP also reviewed the arrangement from a security angle and looking at the possibility of increasing crime, a temporary police checkpost had been set up. Apart from this it was also felt that CCTV cameras are needed. They have asked HPCL to set up more surveillance equipment. At many places near the refinery, road side shacks and eateries have been set up on the government land which can become a reason for accidents. Looking at this, directions have been given to remove these encroachments from the government land. Balotara SDO, tehsildar and other administrative officers have been directed to review the progress of the refinery every 15 days and to resolve any problems faced there. The SP gave detailed directions to verify the identity of labourers who will be employed in the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/barmer-collector-sp-visit-pachpadra-refinery-ask-officials-to-hasten-work/articleshow/85577492.cms||Vimal Bhatia

The 55-year-old Jafar, who is settled in Erattupetta in the district, had been researching for many years before coming out with the book ‘Malabar Porattam, Charithravum Nattucharithravum’ published by DC Books last year, which speaks about the life and principles of Variyamkunnath Kunhammed Haji. Through the book Jafar is trying to say that Kunhammed Haji, the stepbrother of his grandfather Muhiyuddinkutty Haji, was a mistaken person and he was truly secular. “Though he was labelled as anti-Hindu, in reality he was not. Those leaders who took part with him in the movement against the British include Hindu leaders also. There are no evidence to prove that he was anti-Hindu,” said Jafar. He also said that Moideenkutty Haji, father of Kunhammed Haji, had chosen Erattupetta in Kottayam district to go into hiding after the British were in the hunt for him for his participation in a rebellion against the British. He was later caught and deported and was jailed in the Andaman Islands. During his stay in Erattupetta for nearly eight years, he had married a woman from a Muslim family there, in which the couple had a son named Muhiyuddinkutty Haji. Jafar is the grandson of Muhiyuddinkutty Haji. “During my research I found out that Chakkiparamban Moideenkutty Haji had earlier married another Muslim woman and Kunhammed Haji was born to the couple,” he said. Jafar says that the British police used a special task force titled M-5 to mislead the people about Kunhammed Haji. “The special police force wore Khilafat uniform and indulged in violence. They were paid by the British for doing so,” he said. The British succeeded in creating a division between the Hindus and Muslims then, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kunhammed-haji-was-truly-secular-says-researcher/articleshow/85575321.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

The move contrasted with the Mirwaiz Umar Farooq-led Hurriyat faction's defiance in the face of a crackdown on an alleged racket involving "sale" of medical and engineering seats in Pakistan to Kashmiri students and funnelling the proceeds into secessionist activities in J&K. The Mirwaiz, who is under house arrest, said on Monday that his organisation had been transparently sending Kashmiri students to study medicine or engineering not only to Pakistan but also Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Turkey. "The propaganda is completely unfounded, and can be verified by those students or parents whom we have recommended for admission, many among them being from the economically weaker sections," he said. While both Hurriyat factions had shut their Raj Bagh offices after the nullification of Article 370 in August 2019, the Mirwaiz-led Awami Action Committee reopened its premises in February 2020. The Mirwaiz faction's self-owned property in one of Srinagar's tony residential neighbourhoods was allegedly procured in 2000 through hawala channels. A total of 26 secessionist groups operating under the umbrella of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference used to have offices in Raj Bagh until the events of August 2019. Since then, the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat's official address has been the annexe of Geelani's residence. Sources said the signboard of the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat's and Mili Trust, formed by Geelani, were removed on Sunday evening at the behest of his doctor son Nayeem. This was almost immediately after news spread of the Centre possibly planning to clamp a ban on a clutch of separatist overground organisations under Section 3(1) the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The Hurriyat came into existence in 1993 with 26 groups. Among the Hurriyat constituents, the Centre banned the Jamaat-e-Islami and JKLF under the UAPA in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-ban-murmurs-geelani-home-drops-hurriyat-board/articleshow/85580306.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Kochi||Kerala forest research institute to launch project for ‘invasive-free’ campus||KOCHI: With alien invasive species fast changing the landscape and vegetation of Kerala, scientists at Kerala forest research institute (KFRI) are proposing a concept of ‘invasive-free’ campuses for institutions in the state. With many of the backyard plants and trees that existed a few decades ago almost having vanished from the landscape, there is a growing awareness of the changing biodiversity of the state. “We do know that the once native and familiar flowers, plants and insects are not seen. It has been replaced by alien species that have now become the common plants and trees of Kerala. Called bio invasion, it is a concept where the traditional species are completely wiped out by the new and strong species,” said Sajeev T V, senior principal scientist and coordinator of the nodal centre of alien invasive species research and management, KFRI. “We had planned to launch this project in colleges and schools wherein we would be making slide presentations with visual support to introduce the subject of alien and invasive species to the students. Once we show them the plants, we will ask them to remove all those weeds and introduce native species,” said Sajeev, who has been nominated as national contact person for the Asia-Pacific Forest Invasive Species Network (APFISN by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC). He said that spreading awareness through students who will learn to identify and then slowly pass on this knowledge to their homes and neighbourhood is one way of bringing about the change. “Since colleges have not opened, we have postponed the project till the situation becomes normal,” he added. The biggest challenge brought forth by invasive or exotic species is that they grow fast and have a high tolerance level for a wide range of environmental conditions. Hence there has to be constant monitoring and clearing to remove the invasive species. Even the waterbodies in the state are also invaded by water hyacinths with origins from South America. The African payal is yet another such species, native to Australia but has been noted in Kerala in 1956 as a pest. Once the aquarium culture caught up, this became a regular aquatic plant in Kerala. Nila grass or mimosa diplotricha is yet another familiar plant. According to studies by KFRI, it is in the wild and open spaces that these invasive species spread fast. Agricultural lands are much safer from these weeds because of constant maintenance and clearing of lands. A recent study by researchers at Kerala University had noted that the high magnitude flooding events in August 2018 and 2019 resulted in the escape of at least ten alien fish species that were recorded for the first time from the natural waters of Western Ghats. The study pointed out that illegal farming systems, aqua-tourism destinations, amusement parks as well as reservoirs facilitated the escape of alien species.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kfri-to-launch-project-for-invasive-free-campus/articleshow/85575394.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

In its revised projection, the Rajesh Tope-led department has also said while the state government has made a provision of Rs 1,200 crore in supplementary demands, an additional Rs 4,000 crore will be required. The funds will come from the DPDC, CSR, SDRF, MLA and MP fund, a senior official explained. Additional chief secretary Pradeep Vyas has written a comprehensive letter to all the district collectors, zilla parishad CEOs and district civil surgeons about the estimates that have been enhanced from the June projection, the and plans to battle it. “Since all districts may not peak on the same day, the highest number of active cases in each district is required to be added and based on that, the state will have to prepare for a peak of 12.95 lakh cases in the third wave against 8.6 lakh cases during the second wave,” he said. Out of the 12.95 lakh peak cases, it is estimated 8.4 lakh will be under home isolation and 4.5 lakh will require hospitalisation (see box). “Out of the maximum expected peak cases, it is presumed that 65% will be under home isolation, while 17.5% will go to private health facilities, and the remaining to public health facilities,” said a senior official. The official said during the first and second waves, the state witnessed a shortage of ventilators and oxygen beds, oxygen, crucial medicines and ambulances too. Now, revised directives have been given to district collectors across the state to ensure those issues do not recur. Vyas made it clear planning for infrastructure will be based on the maximum active cases reported by a district during the second wave. His formula: take the maximum active cases and add 50% for the expected number of peak active cases during the third wave. Considering the Centre’s guidelines and opinion of the state task force, paediatric beds are to be established in each health facility — 5% of the total beds in dedicated Covid hospitals, 10% in dedicated Covid healthcare centre and 15% in dedicated Covid care centre. “More mild cases are observed in paediatric age groups. Further, the paediatric bed should be exactly similar to adult beds and no small cot should be placed. Ventilator should be only in ICU and not in any other place,” wrote Vyas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-3rd-wave-plan-60l-may-fall-ill-another-rs-4k-cr-needed/articleshow/85577571.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Sena men, led by city unit chief Parag Gudadhe, reached BJP office in Rajapeth around noon raising slogans against the BJP and Rane. No BJP office-bearer or party worker was present there at that time. The irate sainiks poured petrol, brought in bottles by them, on the posters installed in front of the office and set them afire. They also pelted stones at the office and broke water can kept at the entrance. Talking to media persons, Gudadhe said the agitation was in protest against Rane’s remarks against CM Thackeray. “BJP leaders must mend their tongue. We were patient hitherto because our leader is the CM. We won’t tolerate any indecent criticism of our leader any more. Today, we only damaged the office and set it on fire. Tomorrow we will beat BJP leaders if they don’t mend ways,” he warned. On getting information about the protests, BJP leader in Amravati Municipal Corporation Tushar Bhartiya reached the spot and condemned the sainiks’ unruly behaviour and called it undemocratic. “It is sheer vandalism,” he said. Meanwhile, a complaint has been lodged with Rajapeth police and district administration too. No arrests were made till the time of filing this report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sena-men-protest-against-rane-remarks-in-amravati/articleshow/85594066.cms||---

Shah was at Atrauli in Aligarh, Singh’s birthplace and bastion, to pay his last respects to the BJP veteran who died on Saturday. “I spoke to Babuji (as Singh was fondly referred to) the day the Ram Mandir shilanyas (foundation laying) ceremony was done. Beaming, he told me, ‘My life’s aim has been fulfilled’,” Shah said at Atrauli, Singh’s hometown from where he won assembly elections 10 times in 40 years. “He was an important leader of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. He did not hesitate for a moment before giving up his chair for the Ram Janmabhoomi.” Singh had been the chief minister of UP for a year and a half when the Babri Masjid was demolished by kar sevaks on December 6, 1992. That evening, Singh had stepped down. Last year, Singh and another senior BJP politician LK Advani were acquitted by a special CBI court in Lucknow in the demolition case for lack of evidence. Singh, credited with BJP’s rise in UP, had left the party twice — once in 1999 and then in 2009 — but eventually gone back to its fold. “With his death, the deprived and the downtrodden have lost their well-wisher … It is a big loss for the party. It is difficult to fill the void he has left behind,” said Shah. With him at Atrauli were UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Union minister VK Singh. The funeral procession started from the Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar Stadium in Aligarh and then stopped at Atrauli. By the time it reached Bulandshahr, where he was cremated at Basi Ghat, more than 50,000 people had lined the streets. “Babuji amar rahe (long live Babuji)” rang through the air as people showered garlands and flower petals on the hearse. Paramilitary forces and police were deployed to manage the crowd. At Basi Ghat, Yogi, along with deputy CMs Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya, defence minister Rajnath Singh and Union minister of women and child development Smriti Irani, paid homage to Singh. His son Rajvir, the Etah MP, performed the last rites. Maurya, who is also the state’s PWD minister, said the road before the Ram Temple in Ayodhya will be named after Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/over-50k-line-up-to-pay-homage-to-kalyan/articleshow/85572916.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The former minister said on Monday that no one should claim credit for the project. The credit belongs to the country as it is taxpayers’ money that is invested, he said. Simha is under fire from his own party leaders and opposition Congress over his claims that he is implementing the 10-lane highway. Former Congress minister HC Mahadevappa, BJP MLC AH Vishwanath and Mandya MP Sumalatha Ambareesh have criticized Simha for his statements in this regard. Ramadas said that it is not right to say the project is implemented by anyone. “This development work belongs to all. In my constituency too, road repair works are under progress. But I am not claiming credit for them as they are taken up by government agencies. The same is applicable for national highways” he said. He made it clear that he is not a senior who can give advice to former minister AH Vishwanath over his anti-party statements. “Party state president will make a decision. I don’t react to his statements,” he said. He advised his party colleagues to ensure Covid-19 appropriate behaviour (CAB) while participating in the ongoing Janashirvada Yatra. “Spreading Covid-19 is a sin. I know how difficult it is to contain it,” he said. On the MCC mayoral election, he said he will follow the party’s instructions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/simha-cant-claim-credit-for-highway-project-says-ramadas/articleshow/85571456.cms||---

The target has been fixed to complete the work by December 2023, said NWR general nanager Anand Prakash. He was here on a two-day visit and was accompanied by DRM Geetika Pandey, additional DRM Manoj Jain and senior PRO Gopal Sharma. There are some obstacles over the rates of purchasing power from the Rajasthan government for electrification of rail lines. The matter has been taken up at the level of chief minister and chief secretary. Prakash, while addressing the media said that it is expected that soon a decision will be taken in this regard. The general manager said that work is on in many areas and has been completed in many sectors. He added that electrification work is going on at a good pace in many sections of Jodhpur division. He also said, “Even after completion of electrification work, diesel engines will be used in some important sectors as they will come in handy in times of emergency such as problem in electric lines and in case of a war-like situation across the border the diesel engine will be used to carry food to the Army and to carry the armed forces to the border. Regarding increasing the speed of the trains, he said doubling rail line work in Rewari-Palanpur in NWR has been completed and electrification work is also going on. At present work is pending in 30-40km stretch and is expected to be completed by December this year.Discussing on doubling works between Rai Ka Bagh and Phulera, he said the work has been completed till Degana, Makrana but rail line for doubling has to be laid in Jodhpur’s Benad area. However, the Army says that it is their land and refuses the department to work while the railways claims it is their land. Due to this the work of doubling tracks is getting delayed in this sector. This issue has been raised at ministerial level. It is hoped that by December 2022 this work will be completed. Discussing the issue of cattle being mowed down by trains in Jodhpur division, he said DRM Pandey has taken many initiatives to stop this and at present work on trenches under MGNREGA is on for which the railways is providing material and other facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nwr-electrification-to-be-complete-by-december-23/articleshow/85577625.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It has taken the count of Covid-19 cases linked to this emerging variant to 103 in Maharashtra. The fresh batch of cases has been mainly identified in the Vidarbha region. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said six cases each have been found in Amravati and Gadchiroli, five in Nagpur, four in Ahmednagar, three in Yavatmal, two in Nashik and one in Bhandara. Most were confirmed Covid cases and patients recovered a few weeks ago. The state report doesn’t mention any new cases in Mumbai since the 11 cases were detected earlier. The state public health department has already directed these districts to increase testing. On Monday the state registered 3,643 new coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours - the lowest since February 15. According to the public health department note, a total of 105 more people succumbed to the disease while 6,795 patients recovered. The state's recovery rate now stands at 97.05% while the fatality rate is 2.11%. The total number of active patients in the state are 49,924. Districts such as Nandurbar in north Maharashtra do not have a single active Covid-19 case.

With the NITI Aayog’s latest report predicting a third Covid-19 wave in September, with a surge in cases and an eventual load on health infrastructure, the state government has started preparing for the anticipated surge by instructing district administrations to prepare for 1.5 times the number of active cases at the peak of the second wave. State health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said that the state was readying for increased oxygen supply and medicines and was ready for the impending third wave even as there are reports from NITI Aayog. State health officials said that there are guidelines issued to each district to ensure that there is three times readiness for oxygen supply for every district. The state had already issued a note directing to be ready for about 1.5 times the number of patients that the state saw during the peak of the second wave. The health department attributes that 65% would require home isolation and the remaining 35% would require hospitalisation divided into ICU care, ventilators and also oxygenation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/27-new-delta-plus-cases-in-state-most-from-vidarbha/articleshow/85577697.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The skill, which he acquired through regular practice of more than three years, has now set his path to win a place in the India Book of Records. Haridas, 37, secured the record for spending the longest time (1 hour 31 minutes) without blinking his eyes. His feat has been recognized by India Book of Records and he received the medal and certificate in July. Haridas, an assistant professor in the department of computer science and engineering, Ahalia School of Engineering and Technology, Palakkad, started practicing Trataka three years ago after being curious about it when he read about the yogic practice’s abilities to improve concentration power and memory. But if we ask how he managed to pull it off, Haridas has only one answer, “practice makes a man perfect”.  “Though I have been practising Yoga, I got to know about Trataka only three years ago. Benefits of Trataka include strong willpower and memory. It is also believed that Trataka has the power to improve eyesight. So I wanted to learn it and tried doing it by gazing at a black dot on the wall. Initially I could not even keep my eyes open for five minutes due to pain and heavy flow of tears. But later on I practised it almost everyday and slowly improved the timing to 5, 10 and 20 minutes. Over the last one year, I could do it for more than 45 minutes, and two months ago I was able to hold it for 1.15 hours,” Haridas said. Though it was just a routine, Binu thought of applying to India Book of Records in June. “I think my achievement is a world record and I have approached Guinness World Records and Limca Book of Records,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/trataka-practitioner-sets-record-for-not-blinking-eyes-for-over-an-hour/articleshow/85575467.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Backpacker hostels turn office for youngsters in times of Covid||JAIPUR: As the concept of work from home (WFH) gains popularity and acceptance, increasing number of youngsters are opting to work from remote locations, especially from backpackers’ hostels. The backpackers’ hostels were opened to cater to tourists for a few days where they could share dormitories. However, with WFH culture since pandemic, such hostels are now providing various facilities to the people who want to stay for more than a week. Many people from metro cities like Delhi and Mumbai are coming to various cities in the state and staying in backpackers’ hostels where they provide good Wi-Fi, work space and a good crowd to hang out with after office hours. These stays are now called ‘Workation’. Gypsy Child Hostel in Udaipur has been continuously getting enquiries from people and with the current scenario they are making required changes in their hostel. Ruchika Wason, the owner of Gypsy Child hostel said, “We have installed Wi-Fi routers in every dorm and provided good furniture in private rooms for WFH. Some people prefer quiet space for working, hence, we are in the process of converting one of our dorms in three bedrooms with all the facilities.”  After the first lockdown, this trend was seen in Rajasthan but when the second wave hit, travelling was prohibited. Now, with things getting back to normal, people have started arriving at different locations like Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Pushkar. Most people are those who work in IT sector. Moustache Hostel, which is located in Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Pushkar and Jaisalmer, offers different packages to people staying for more days. As the travel industry was plummeting, Moustache Escapes came up with some sustainable solutions. A spacious dormitory at Moustache HostelAbhishek Khandelwal, the managing director of Moustache Hostel said, “Internet connectivity was the most important thing to make our hostels workation friendly. The next thing was to come up with longstay deals at a discounted rate since people wanted to stay for long durations. We added meal combos to our menu to make sure nobody went hungry. We made weekend deals for those who wanted short hikes.” The Hosteller, another group of hostels, for more than one week stay has different packages with good deals. Ankasha Borthakur, the marketing manager of Hosteller said that hostels with different vibes provide good working space. As people are fed up of living in closed boundaries, young generation till early 30s is preferring to work from places with good views and different kinds of crowd that they can interact with.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/backpacker-hostels-turn-office-for-youngsters-in-times-of-covid/articleshow/85577690.cms||Parul Kulshrestha

---||Kochi||Kerala: ‘Ensure CBSE students not deprived of admissions’||KOCHI: Kerala CBSE Schools Management Association submitted a memorandum before state governor Arif Mohammad Khan regarding the difficulties faced by CBSE students trying to pursue higher education courses after Class XII. The officials requested the governor to ensure that CBSE students will not be deprived of their chances to get admission to degree courses due to tougher competition this year following higher pass percentage in Class XII in all streams of education compared to previous years. A team comprising the association’s general secretary P S Ramachandran, vice-president J Abraham and state committee member Jacob George visited Khan on Thursday and submitted the memorandum. They said that the number of high performers in state schools was much higher than that of CBSE, giving the former an upper hand in the degree admission procedure. So CBSE students are likely to be deprived of their chances in getting admission to their favourite courses and colleges. They said that the governor has assured them to look into the matter and inform concerned authorities. CBSE Trivandrum region, comprising schools in Kerala and Lakshadweep, topped the Class 12 final results with a record 99.89% pass as the results were announced by the board in July. Class 12 exams for CBSE were not held this year due to Covid-19. The marks were tabulated through a special assessment scheme in the absence of a final exam due to the pandemic. Indian School Certificate (ISC) also announced the results through a similar assessment scheme. However, the state government, which conducted the exams, announced the Plus Two results with 87.94% pass and 48,383 students securing A+ grade in all subjects. Ibrahim Khan, president of the association, said that CBSE students have already been facing tough competition in getting admission to degree courses, including professional courses, and this year the competition just got tougher. “If the marks of Class 12 are considered, the state school students will get the advantage due to the liberal marking system. There is a huge disparity in the range of marks secured by CBSE and state school students and the latter have much higher marks. So conducting admission based on the Class 12 marks is not ideal and admission to degree courses must be based on entrance exams,” he said. Earlier, the association demanded before the court that Plus Two marks should not be relied upon for admissions being done on the basis of KEAM. The matter is subjudice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ensure-cbse-students-not-deprived-of-admissions/articleshow/85575521.cms||---

---||Kochi||Forest dept probe indicts NT Sajan||Kozhikode: The enquiry conducted by the forest department into the complaints against conservator of forests NT Sajan has indicted the IFS officer of serious wrongdoings, including filing a baseless report to the department that amounted to derailing the investigations into Muttil illegal tree felling case. The 18-page report of the probe conducted by additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF-FL&R) Rajesh Ravindran said that Sajan acted in a ‘highly undesirable, deplorable and grievous manner unbecoming of a civil servant’. It added that Sajan was involved with the prime accused in Muttil case (Augustine brothers) and their accomplices while filing the baseless report on February 15, which, by all indications, point to being written to serve vested interests. Though the inquiry report filed by APCCF on June 29 recommended immediate major disciplinary action against Sajan, no disciplinary action was taken by the government, except that he was transferred from Kollam to Kozhikode. The delay in taking disciplinary action against the officer has also given rise to charges that the government was shielding him. The forest department had constituted an enquiry based on complaints by Meppadi forest range officer MK Sameer, who had taken the illegally-felled timber from Muttil into custody, against Sajan that he tried to frame the field staff of Muttil range officer in the felling of trees at Manikunnumala. The enquiry found that the tone and tenor of the report in seeking stringent action against the field staff, alleging their collusion in organizing felling within forest land, was preposterous. “The contention that the land from where the trees were felled at Manikunnumala is part of vested forests is incorrect and has since been clarified as such in the detailed report of the custodian of vested forests on the matter,” the report said. “It is clear that NT Sajan IFS had acted in a highly undesirable, deplorable and grievous manner, unbecoming of a civil servant, in submitting his Report dated 15/02/2021 to PCCF (V&FI) virtually derailing the investigations into OR 1/2021 of Meppadi Forest Range and turning the attention on to a subject that was false and baseless. That in so doing he was involved with the prime accused in OR 1/2021 of Meppadi forest range and their accomplices make it even more worse, warranting immediate initiation of disciplinary action for major penalty against him,” stated the enquiry report by Ravindran. The report also added that Sajan had acted in ways highly unbecoming of a government servant violating the basic tenets and etiquettes expected in his job. “The alacrity with which he had moved about in his purported investigation into felling at Manikunnumala (alleged to be in vested forests), the irrational ways in which he chose to ignore the obvious field realities, his staunch reluctance to consult the revenue and forest authorities for their version on the secret information received by him, the blind reliance and trust he had reposed on the secret information being provided to him by the prime accused in the offences related to rosewood felling in LA patta lands of Wayanad, the frequent contacts he had had with the accused during the period, all point to his unmistakable and deliberate involvement in the issue in a way detrimental to the interests of the department,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/forest-dept-probe-indicts-nt-sajan/articleshow/85575556.cms||---

About 30 trains, including those bound for New Delhi, Amritsar, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi, Haridwar, Rishikesh, were cancelled. Some of the important ones were 02014, 02029, 02030 Shatabdi Express trains running on New Delhi and Amritsar route, 04034 Jammu Mail special running on Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra to Delhi route, 02053, 02054 Jan Shatabdi Express running on Amritsar-Haridwar route and 04692 Amritsar-Nanded superfast special. According to an official of the Ferozepur division, since August 20 and till 11am on Monday, cancellation requests for tickets amounting to Rs 53.65 lakh for 12,300 passengers were received. Meanwhile, city businessmen are getting jittery, as cancellation and diversion of trains are affecting their travel plans to other states, especially Delhi, and also leading to delay in movement of goods and raw material.Vinod Thapar, chairman of the Knitwear Club, said, “Trains like Shatabdi Express are lifeline for Ludhiana’s industry, specially garment and textile. Travelling to Delhi by road takes a lot of time and is costly too. Trains are convenient and we can return by evening after finishing our work. But unfortunately, Shatabdi Express 02014, 02030 (from Amritsar to Delhi) and 02013 and 02029 (from Delhi to Amritsar) remained cancelled, leaving hundreds of businessmen hassled.”Kulpreet Malhotra Bunty, a member of United Cycle and Parts’ Manufacturers’ Association, said, “Cancellation of trains is a setback for us as movement of our goods takes place in parcel wagons. Therefore, it is our request to the government to sort out all issues with the protesting farmers and ensure regular movement of trains else we will end up incurring heavy losses.”According to Abhinav Sehgal, joint secretary of Ludhiana Business Forum, “Cancellations are unfortunate as just one-and-a-half month ago trains like Shatabdi Express, Shri Shakti Express resumed after remaining cancelled for almost two months on account of low passenger turnout. Last year too, trains remained cancelled for months and the industry suffered huge losses as our businesses are dependent on this cheaper and reliable transport mode. Government must solve the issues with the farmers soon.” 27 trains will remain cancelledAs per the railway authorities, 27 trains will remain cancelled on Tuesday. These will include 02014, 02029 and 02030 Shatabdi Express trains, 04067 and 04068 Shane Punjab Express trains, 02053 and 02054 Amritsar-Haridwar Janshatabdi trains, 02266 Jammu Tawi Sarai Rohilla Duronto, 05734 Amritsar-Katihar Express.

---||Kolkata||They made us stand in queue, grilled us with whip in hand: Afghan returnee||KURSEONG/ DARJEELING/ KOLKATA: Some are still having nightmares of weeklong terror, while some shared contrasting experience of diplomatic decency by the Taliban. But the feeling that united almost all Bengal returnees from Afghan soil was that of relief to be finally back home from a state of commotion, chaos and uncertain future. Sitting at his Kurseong Naya Bazar home, Kishan Gurung, an ex-serviceman who was deployed at Italian embassy in Kabul, remembered the horrifying last week spent at his workplace which, according to him, was “rougher than all the years of experience in the Indian army”. “We were trying to escape Afghanistan since August 15 and managed to reach the airport by August 17 but were stopped by the Taliban. We were more than 90 people and the Taliban held us at gunpoint and began questioning each of us with whip in hand,” said Gurung. They made one Afghan national get down on his knees while pointing a gun at his head. Seeing all this, an Afghan woman got heart attack and died right there. Gurung still shivered to recall how one of them carrying a whip had asked him about his nationality. “I somehow said in Hindi that I was from Hindustan. The man asked if there was no job in India. I didn’t reply. He asked if I would come back again to Afghanistan. I said I wouldn’t and he left me,” said Gurung. He and many others were turned back from the airport and had to spend the next few nights on the lawn of a hotel sleeping inside garbage bags to protect them from the cold. “Waking up to gunshots had become a routine and we fed on just biscuits and water. We tried to head to the airport again on August 20 but the sight of several bodies strewn on the road made us turn back,” he said. Gurung and the rest of the group were rescued by NATO officials on Saturday and were taken to the airbase where from they were flown to Kazakhstan. He landed in Delhi four hours later where from he flew to Bagdogra. “It still feels like a nightmare. But I am relieved to be back home with my family,” he said. On Monday, there were at least 44 other Afghan returnees who landed at Bagdogra. Subash Subba (44), another ex-armyman and a resident of Kalimpong who had recently left home to take up a job of a security guard in Kabul, said: “We were in touch with the Indian embassy since August 15 and on Friday, we finally managed to reach the Kabul airport where we had to wait for 24 hours. Later, the officers of the Indian Air Force arrived and helped us board the flight to Delhi.” Sambhu Bomzan, a resident of Rohini in Darjeeling, said: “The situation is pathetic back there. Everyone is fleeing in fear.” Another returnee from Darjeeling, Rajesh Thapa, said the Taliban are firing in the air and on streets from open jeeps. “We had the tickets to fly on August 16 but we could not board the flight. Many people are still stuck there,” said Thapa, who worked as a security guard Sarbajit Mukherjee, a resident of Kolkata’s Jatin Das Road and a professor of international relations at Kandahar University, said there is panic among a section of Afghan nationals who either used to work as translators or were closely associated with the US Embassy. He, along with some other Indians, had a smooth passage out of the country. “Those who used to work with the US administration are fearing that the Taliban will be vindictive towards them and that is causing the rush outside the Kabul airport,” said Mukherjee, who had returned home on Sunday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/they-made-us-stand-in-queue-grilled-us-with-whip-in-hand-afghan-returnee/articleshow/85575526.cms||Roshan Gupta
---||Kochi||Teacher from Kottayam moots Constitution clubs||KOCHI: Stressing on the need of promoting citizenship education among students, Binu PG, a 40-year-old freelance teacher from Kottayam, proposes the idea of starting constitutional clubs in schools. He has already approached governor Arif Mohammad Khan and the Raj Bhavan has forwarded his request to the Office of President of India in March 2020. Even though the pandemic has affected the follow-up of the request, Binu is optimistic that a positive decision would be taken by the government. Binu, who has been travelling across India as a teacher, said that the students need to be taught the constitutional values at a very young age and the best way to do it is by inculcating citizenship education in the school and include it in the curriculum. He said that as India celebrates its 75th year of Independence, it would be the ideal time of implementing such a historic move in the field of education. “Constitution is the supreme law of the land. It is not just a book. The things written in it and the values it uphold make the country India. However, sadly many of younger generation have no idea about the constitutional and the citizenship values. I have been taking classes on the Constitution for nearly 10 years. All students must be taught it and it will help them to be better citizens abiding by the law,” said Binu who is a teacher for 15 years and had even worked as the project officer of National Service Scheme in Kerala. He said that the constitution club aims to develop student’s ability to participate in societal activities and promote constitutional literacy. “It will help students evolve into informed and thoughtful citizens and thereby strengthen democracy. It will change passive citizens to active citizens,” he said. Besides constitutional clubs, Binu in his letter to the governor requested the government to take necessary steps to highlight the contributions of B N Rau, who was a civil servant, jurist and constitutional scholar. “Government of India should give deserving importance to the role of Rau in drafting the Constitution. Even B R Ambedkar appreciated very openly about the contributions of Rau. But, unfortunately now Rau’s role and contributions do not receive the deserving recognition,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/teacher-moots-constitution-clubs/articleshow/85575587.cms||---

In line with the increase in ‘on-demand’ content and a shift in content consumption patterns due to the pandemic, the British Council has strengthened its digital library offering for users across Hyderabad and India, enabling easy access to UK and global content. “As someone whose primary identity is that of a bookworm, the onset of the pandemic had me concerned as to how I would access the library.

---||Mumbai||BMC to urge testing on first day if symptoms show up||MUMBAI: The civic body will shortly come out with an advisory asking Mumbaikars to get tested for Covid on the first day of developing symptoms, including cold, cough, fever, among others. They should not wait even if they don’t have any of the classic signs of the ailment. The reason: emerging mortality data has pointed towards a delay in seeking tests, and thereby time lost in starting treatment. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani confirmed that the BMC will be emphasising on early testing since minimising testing delay has the highest impact on reducing onward transmission and curbing severity. The city has 244 testing facilities that offer both RT-PCR and antigen tests. “All data point towards the fact that early testing and treatment can make a big dent in mortality rates,” he said. “If there is a delay right from the testing stage, it leads to delay in starting treatment and hospitalisation. We want to avoid that cascading effect,” Kakani said. The civic hospitals have begun an exercise to gauge the time taken between swab collection and hospitalisation. Preliminary findings have shown a gap of a few days. In Andheri’s SevenHills Hospital, dean Dr Balakrishna Adsul said deaths have been predominantly in individuals who have delayed testing and treatment. “In some cases, people have got tested on the ninth and 10th day, by which time the disease had spread to the lungs,” he said. Early testing is not just for clinical reasons but also has epidemiological importance, said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force. “Now, with monoclonal antibodies we can prevent severe disease by early detection,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-urge-testing-on-first-day-if-symptoms-show-up/articleshow/85577753.cms||---
---||Agra||Rural areas in west UP reel under viral fever, 6 die of mystery disease in Mathura||Agra: After Covid-19, there has been a spike in viral fever cases in rural areas of western UP. More than 70% of patients coming to the out-patient departments of government hospitals over the past one week have complained of suffering from fever, cough, cold, dehydration and body ache. Health department has issued an alert at all the community health centres in the rural areas following the death of six people, including five children, in Mathura’s Konh village in Farah block over the past one week due to a “mysterious” fever. At least 80 have been admitted to hospitals in Mathura, Agra and Rajasthan’s Bharatpur. The cause of death is still not clear, said officials, adding that there is a possibility that they were suffering from dengue as their blood platelets were found to be low along with fever. Dr Rachna Gupta, Mathura’s chief medical officer, said a team of doctors visited the village and took samples for diagnosis of malaria, dengue and Covid-19 from both patients admitted in hospital and their relatives. A 38-year-old man succumbed to fever at Tiwaha village in Agra’s Fatehabad block while undergoing treatment. Neeraj Rajput, a local resident of the village, said, ‘There is not a single house at the village without a patient. A team of doctors visited the village on Sunday and provided medicines to some of the patients. Most patients are at home due to lack of facilities at the local CWC.” Firozabad district chief medical officer Dr Neeta Kulsrestha confirmed that a 14-year-old child had died of dengue in Mustafabad area. “Medicines are being distributed to the sick in rural areas.” Dr Saubhagya Katiyar of Shahjahanpur district said, “Over 70% of patients coming to the OPD are suffering from viral fever. Children are most vulnerable to viral infections. “ Attributing the rise in viral fever to “changing weather conditions”, chief medical officer of Agra district Dr Arun Kumar Srivastava advised maintaining sanitation and hygiene, covering mouth and nose at public places, avoiding direct contact with a sick person and staying hydrated to keep the viral fever at bay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rural-areas-in-west-up-reel-under-viral-fever-6-die-of-mystery-disease-in-mathura/articleshow/85573060.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Sister of present Thakore Saheb Mandhatasinh Jadeja, who was crowned the king in 2020, has filed a suit in the Rajkot civil court alleging that he had made her sign a release deed which construed that she had relinquished her right on the inheritance property. Jadeja’s sister Ambalika Devi, who lives in Jhansi, filed the suit in June this year. She also challenged her late father Manoharsinh Jadeja’s will of 2013 which Mandhatasinh produced before an additional collector to mutate the entry in revenue records. The next hearing on the suit is scheduled on August 31. Manoharsinh Jadeja died in 2018. Along with Mandhatasinh, she has made her mother Mankumaridevi and two sisters as respondents in the case. The property of the rulers of the erstwhile princely state of Rajkot runs in crores as per current valuation. Ambalika Devi argued in her suit that as per the law, her father can’t deprive her of the right of inheritance property through a will and requested the court to declare the notarized will null and void. She had come to Rajkot to meet her her mother and brother along with her sons and husband after her father’s death Her advocate Ketan Sindhava said. “The suit alleges that during this 2019 visit, Mandhatasinh made her sign release deed saying that it was with the purpose of making the entry of inheritance mutation easy in revenue records and for the easy administration of Ashapura temple. She was also made to execute two power of attorneys. She was in the dark and ill informed while signing these documents.” She also alleged in her suit that it’s a conspiracy against her and a betrayal of the brother-sister relationship. She also alleged that she got the hint of it when her son was insulted during the coronation ceremony of Mandhatasinh as Thakore saheb of Rajkot.  Mandhatasinh had initiated a mutation entry in the revenue department to make himself owner of the property of Sardhar based on the will and release deed. Ambalika Devi had received a notice from the deputy collector regarding the entry and she had raised an objection to it. The hearing of this objection is completed and order is expected soon. Mandhatasinh’s advocate Nirav Doshi said, “We have produced the evidence before the collector which includes the will of Manoharsinhji. We have also paid Rs 1.50 crore to Ambalika Devi as per the will and we have a record of this payment. The release deed which she signed is very clear and runs in 47 pages. This deed is registered and her husband and sons are witnesses of this deed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/property-dispute-breaks-out-in-rajkots-royal-family/articleshow/85573148.cms||---

Though the threat of the third wave looms large, main areas of the city are brimming with people who are brazenly flouting Covid appropriate behaviour. Over the past 50 days, the city’s pandemic situation has changed drastically with no death being reported since June 30. While a committee of experts constituted under the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) has warned of an imminent third wave which could peak around October and sought better medical preparedness for children who might be at similar risk as adults, the health department officials said people should remain alert and continue following Covid appropriate behaviour. “The city has not reported Covid deaths for quite some time but the third wave may emerge any time. Covid appropriate behavior and vaccination is important to keep the third wave away,” said a senior health department official. While talking about the preparation for Covid, health minister Raghu Sharma said, “I have visited three districts in the state and reviewed the preparations for the third wave. More such visits are planned in the coming days.” Currently, the pandemic situation seems to be under control in the state with just seven persons testing positive for the virus in the state on Monday taking its overall tally to 9,54,030. Districts which reported new cases are Jaipur (4) and one case each was reported from Alwar, Bikaner and Jhalawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-covid-death-in-jaipur-for-50-days-cases-dip-sharply/articleshow/85577802.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal’s 183-year-old tryst with Afghans||KOLKATA: Long before Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘Kabuliwala’ found a place in the Bengali mindscape, Afghanistan had a physical presence in the city in the form a war memorial, commemorating the death of 20,000 soldiers in the First Anglo-Afghan War. The ammunition factory that later came up here also had a role to play in sparking off the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857. The Afghan War Memorial was built in Dum Dum in 1841 after the British lost the first Anglo-Afghan War. The structure resembling the Shahid Minar is located inside the premises of ordnance factory. In 1838, an army of 21,000 British and Indian troops under the command of Sir John Keane set out from Punjab and reached Quetta in 1839. The troops conquered Kandahar and parts of Kabul but in 1841, the Afghans struck back and killed almost 20,000, forcing the British army to beat a hasty retreat. “Most of the troops were from the headquarters of the Bengal Artillery. This is why the war memorial was built here,” said Moumita Saha, a researcher and a member of People’s Green Society. After the defeat in the first Anglo-Afghan war, East India Company decided to set up an ammunition factory in 1846 where Dum Dum bullets were manufactured. The Sepoy Mutiny started in 1857 over the way the bullets were greased here. “Had the British India company not lost the war so badly they would not have built the war memorial and then the ammunition factory where the bullets were manufactured. So it can be said that the two incidents have a historical link,” said Sayan Mukherjee, a student of erstwhile Presidency College who presented a research paper on the topic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengals-183-year-old-tryst-with-afghans/articleshow/85575590.cms||Zeeshan Javed

As he resumed work on Monday, Kakani said a crucial takeaway for him was “early testing, treatment and vaccination”. Vaccinated with two doses, Covid was not the first thing that crossed his mind when he developed high fever with shivering on August 12. He suspected malaria, but took a blood test as well as an RT-PCR. The reports came positive within 24 hours and he was hospitalised at SevenHills in Andheri. Kakani said he had taken his second vaccine dose on March 11 and believes that complete vaccination protected him from serious symptoms. He had started feeling better since the third day. “Doctors can ensure a better outcome when people reach them early,” said Kakani. His samples have been sent for genome sequencing since it was a case of breakthrough infection. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/civic-covid-spearhead-kakani-recovers-advises-early-testing/articleshow/85577884.cms||---

The department has proposed 25% capital subsidy with a maximum of Rs 30 lakh for setting up projects offering aero, acqua and land-based tourism activities like hot air ballooning, parachuting, paragliding, parasailing , boating, angling, jet skiing, trekking, rock climbing, various kinds of safaris, quad biking, birding etc. The capital subsidy will also be available for expansion of the existing adventure tourism projects but will be restricted to the investments made on the extension of the existing unit only. The subsidy for the expansion projects will have an upper ceiling of Rs 25 lakh. In order to estimate the cost of the civil works including electrification among others for determination of capital outright investment subsidy, the project has to obtain certificates from PWD, district collector in case of land, bills for equipment and receipts for training of human resource. It has been made mandatory for projects owners to have insurance for activities to cover all legal and other ancillary expenses in case of any accident or damages. Eligible applicants who receive the subsidy will be required to maintain a register to produce during inspections. A committee comprising director and joint director of tourism department, and financial advisor will scrutinize the cases recommended and received by the field offices. As per the draft, the committee will meet at least once every two months and make its recommendations on every case within 60 days. In case the committee discovers a shortcoming in the application, further information is obtained from from the applicant through the field officers before holding of the next meeting of the committee. The recommendation of the committee will then be submitted to the administrative approval whose decision shall be final and binding. Subsidies or incentives sanctioned under the scheme will be disbursed to the applicant after the commissioning of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/adventure-tourism-projects-in-raj-likely-to-get-rs-30-lakh-subsidy-to-attract-visitors/articleshow/85577769.cms||---

We are deprived of orders for years,” said Rajappa Rajkumar, president, BHEL Small Scale Industries Association (Bhelsia). “We are producing components only for 25% of the actual capacity of 400 units in and around Bhel Trichy. While diversification is our long-term plan, we need new orders in between to survive for the next few years,” Rajkumar added.

The mock parliament, attended by children, youths and representatives of various political parties, elected a speaker and four ministers for finance, agriculture, environment and industries portfolios to familiarise the roles and responsibilities of the executive authorities and functioning of houses in the parliament.Alleging that the Union government has passed the controversial farm bills without holding proper discussions with opposition parties, the CPI said that the people’s parliament was organized to raise the importance of democracy and proper functioning of the parliament. The mock parliament held at Kura Theru junction near Woraiyur was attended by representatives of the DMK, CPM, Congress and JD(S).A group of people opted to do the role of the representatives of the opposition parties. “The Union government is claiming that the opposition parties are stalling the functioning of parliament, that is false propaganda,” K Suresh, district secretary, AITUC, said. Debating the demerits of farm laws, the participants passed a resolution to withdraw the farm laws passed amid the nationwide protests. The mock parliament also paid homage to farmers who lost their lives in the protests. “At the end of the meeting that went for about an hour, we sent the resolutions passed to the ministry of parliamentary affairs for registering our discomfort,” Suresh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cpi-holds-peoples-parliament-urges-govt-to-hold-talks-with-oppn/articleshow/85577763.cms||---

Under the design scheme, interested MSMEs will be guided to master additive manufacturing (production using 3D printers) and reverse-engineering practices to design and produce even complex toys. As constraints in designing and mass production of components were cited as the disadvantages of MSMEs in manufacturing toys, the Union MSME ministry has formulated the design scheme to offer expert advice and cost-effective solutions. Under the scheme, the National Institute of Technology (NIT) across the country will serve as the implementing agency and will offer technical support for the MSMEs to produce toys on a large-scale. “Subsidy for technical and machinery upgradation for producing toys will be provided by the Union ministry. NIT-Trichy will serve as the implementing agency to support local MSMEs,” S Dharmaselvan, joint director, MSME DI, said. Cuddalore, Thanjavur, Coimbatore, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts that already have toy manufacturing units can focus on the design scheme, while districts such as Trichy that have a robust MSME presence has opportunities for the existing MSMEs to diversify their presence using technical support from the educational institutes in the region. “Prospects are high for the Trichy-based MSMEs to manufacture toys made of metal and plastic materials. We are planning a series of sensitisation drives involving the MSME department to encourage the MSMEs to make toys,” N Kanagasabapathy, chairman, Trichy Trade Centre, said. The local production of toys will also reduce the cost of the products that are being imported so far. Toy tricycle has been identified as one of the viable products to design and fabricate in Trichy. The price of locally made toys will be 40%-50% lower than the imported toys, MSMEs said. The micro and small industries can avail 60% to 70% of the design intervention cost as subsidy. Financial support will be paid in three different stages till successful completion of the design. Already, as the state MSME department has identified traditional toys and games for indigenous production such as Thanjavur doll and other board games, design and additive manufacturing support offered is touted to help the MSMEs capitalise on indigenous toy production.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/msme-ministry-to-extend-support-for-local-manufacturing-of-toys-in-trichy/articleshow/85577773.cms||Deepak Karthik

Nanakana Public School principal Harmeet Waraich said, “It is important to practice what we preach. First, teachers have to get themselves vaccinated and then share the experience with students. Also, schools can demand vaccine certificates from students. Even colleges and universities have made it compulsory to provide the certification. In the end, we all have to convince them and educate them. The number of unvaccinated students is low in private schools and so, it would not be difficult to convince all.” District education officer, secondary, Lakhbir Singh Samra said, “We have a target to cover students who are above 18 till the end of August. Schools have been asked to organize special vaccination drives, which will be coordinated by block nodal officers.

They are also alleging corruption in the work, while the ruling party is asserting that the area is being developed in a beautiful manner. Municipal corporation officials said as part of the smart street project, the road is proposed to have a pedestrian way, arrangement for parking, proper curves at turns, and a reduced central verge area. However, the opposition is not convinced.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson Ahbab Singh Grewal said, “Work is being done in an unplanned manner. We have an office there. They didn’t check any building for parking. Most of the buildings don’t have parking and those who have are using it as a storage space. The road width has been reduced by 50% and they have left about 10 feet for parking on both sides. They have made footpaths of around 30 feet on each side. They should have left more space for parking. Unlike before, there are heavy traffic jams on this road. Besides, there has been corruption in the project. The tiles have been procured from a relative of a Congress leader.”Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon said, “People are coming to us with complaints. Area should be developed considering it is a market, where people will bring in vehicles. Design of the road is not user-friendly. First, they charged money from people to make a commercial road and after commercial activity picked up on a large-scale, they are messing up in the name of a smart road.”“The minister is not working in the interests of the people. There is corruption in the work, especially in procurement of tiles. Installation of tiles is also being done in a haphazard manner,” he added.Ram Gupta, owner of an electronic showroom on Malhar Road and BJP member, said, “Earlier, this road was wide enough to accommodate four vehicles, but now only two can ply and that too with difficulty. Customers are not coming because of parking issues. Work that was hit because of Covid has come to a standstill now. There are traffic jams on the road all through the day. We had left space for parking in front of our store as per norms, but now they have constructed a footpath, so we are unable to park our vehicles. We had apprised the mayor of the issue, which has, so far, not been addressed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/malhar-road-project-drives-into-criticism/articleshow/85573180.cms||Shariq Majeed

The shortage of police personnel runs from field staff to ministerial staff. There is a vehicle crunch too as 50% police posts in the state are without light motor vehicles (LMVs). All this came to light during the question hour of Monday’s sitting of ongoing monsoon session of Haryana assembly here. The government has maintained that recruitment drives are underway and processes are on to fill vacancies. There is a sanctioned strength of 71,069 personnel in Haryana Police. This includes 144 IPS officers, 35 additional SPs, 329 DSPs, 1076 inspectots, 11,466 head constables and 43,706 constables. Only 50,230 posts are occupied and there are 20,839 vacancies. Vacancies include 35 posts of IPS officers, nine addditional SPs, 61 DSPs, 229 inspectors, 3,793 head constables, and 12,659 constables. Of the 682 sanctioned posts of ministerial staf, 474 are occupied. Forensic Science Laboratory, Madhuban in Karnal, is amonag the worst hit as only 97 posts are occupied, while the sanctioned strength is 214.  Home department said 25 light motor vehicles have been provided to 59 official police posts and 135 LMVs have been provided to 270 unofficial (unsanctioned) police posts of the state. The number of PCRs is sufficient. When contacted, officials of Haryana home department confirmed the figures, but refused to comment by saying that the reply had been given in assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/30-posts-in-haryana-police-vacant-govt-reply-in-assembly/articleshow/85577830.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Kochi||CM: Guru’s message key to peace in difficult times||Thiruvananthapuram: An important lesson for the contemporary world from Afghanistan is that those who kindle the fire of religious fundamentalism will be gutted by the same flame. The teachings of Sree Narayana Guru attain global significance in this context, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday. “Bloodshed in the name of religion and caste is on the rise across the world. The human crisis, brought about by this, is currently pounding humanity in our neighbouring country, Afghanistan. At times, communal hatred flares up in alarming proportions in our own country too. Communal hatred of people is at play in the case of Palestine and the issue of Rohingya refugees. It was the undercurrent of Kashmir and Punjab issues too. All these could be kept in check if people understood Guru’s message that all human beings are equal and no discrimination among them is possible,” he said, while inaugurating Sree Narayana Guru Jayanti celebrations. Guru gave the world a message that would help them avoid the fire of communal and religious hatred. His message should reach wherever people fight over caste and religion, he added. “He made a proposition that human beings are one and the same. Never before have we come across a situation where religious-communal and terror organizations strangled humanity in the present proportions. We should be able to march ahead by holding humanity above caste and religion. Only then, we can say that we do respect the Guru,” the chief minister said. Vijayan said that efforts should be made to understand the personality and mind of the great guru. Kerala produced several spiritual gurus, but, only one Sree Narayana Guru could rewrite the history of his motherland. His message had its impact on other communities as well. Yogakshema Sabha of Brahmins and NSS of Nair community got their source of energy from the message of Sree Narayana Guru, he said. Pinarayi Vijayan said a closer look at the installation of Siva idol at Aruvappulam would prove that it was not a spiritual act, but a physical act against social inequalities and caste discrimination. “He proved that the right to worship is not the exclusive right of a few. He didn’t mean any greater spiritual meanings beyond that. Soon, he proclaimed that school is the main centre for worship...it would be improper to view the Guru as a mere seeker of spirituality,” he added. Vijayan expressed hope that the celebrations planned next year could be celebrated with much fanfare in a Covid-free environment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cm-gurus-message-key-to-peace-in-difficult-times/articleshow/85575615.cms||---

Decades of struggle and timely state intervention ensured that TN was ahead of others. The original communal government order (GO) passed by the provincial government led by the Justice Party in the Madras Presidency was designed to check the near monopoly of brahmins in government jobs and seats in public higher education institutions. (on the ground that brahmins constituted only about 3% of the population while the backward communities constituted 89%). It all began with the Justice Party government of Raja of Panagal, which introduced caste based reservation in 1921. The first communal GO was passed by the Madras Presidency government. It provided for reservation of 44% jobs for non-brahmins, 16% for brahmins, 16% for muslims, 16% for Anglo-Indian and Christians and 8% for scheduled castes. Since then the reservation policy had been in operation in Tamil Nadu. These opportunities in government were to be shared among non-brahmins, brahmins, Hindus, Mohamadans, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, Europeans and others. After Independence, in Tamil Nadu, the first backward class commission headed by A M Sattanathan, submitted its report in 1970. Based on its recommendations the backward class (BC) reservation was enhanced to 31% from 25% and SC/ST to 18 % from 16 % and this took the state’s total reservation to 49%. Again pursuant to the order passed by the Supreme Court dated October 15, 1992, the second backward class commission was appointed. The commission’s report led to the reservation for BCs being raised to 50%, taking TN’s total reservation to 68%. Based on a Madras high court judgment in 1990, the state fixed 1% quota for scheduled tribes and this took TN’s overall reservation to 69%. The Supreme Court of India in the case reported State of Madras vs Champakam Dorairajan (1951) rejected the contention based on the communal GO dated June 16, 1950, which laid down the rules for selection of candidates for admission into the medical colleges and held that the classification made in the communal GO is opposed to the Constitution. To override the decision of the Supreme Court, Clause 4 was introduced in Article 15 of the Constitution with the aim of making it constitutional for the state to reserve seats for BCs, Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in educational institutions as well as to make other special provisions as may be necessary for their advancement. Article 31 (B) was inserted as well by way of abundant caution to save the particular act in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, notwithstanding any decision of a court/tribunal that any of those Acts is void for contravention of any fundamental right. The objective and principles upon which the Ninth schedule was initially introduced was primarily on land reforms and agrarian reforms and land acquisition to abolish the zamindari system and bring about social reforms. Since the land reform legislation impinged upon the fundamental right to property of landlords, this proved to be the biggest obstacle in implementing reforms. To remove such an obstacle, Article 31(B) read with Ninth Schedule was incorporated under the provisions of the Constitution through the First Amendment Act, 1951. In 1992, judgment of a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in what is known as the Mandal case (Indhra Sahani vs Union of India) held that total reservation under Article 16 (4) should not exceed 50%. Shortly after this judgment the Tamil Nadu government moved the Madras high court for continuing its present reservation policy as hitherto followed during the academic year 1993-94. The court ruled that the reservation policy could continue, but the quantum of reservation should be brought down to 50% during the next academic year i.e. 1994-95. In the special leave petition by the state, the Supreme Court passed an interim order reiterating that the reservation should not exceed 50% in the matter of admission to educational institutions. Major legal problems erupted pursuant to the order passed by the Supreme Court that the state government cannot breach the 50% cap on reservation. By this time various political parties and social forums representing BCs requested the state to consider all the ramifications of the Supreme Court order. Since the state did not get any reprieve, CM J Jayalalithaa began looking for alternate legal recourse. Since the policy needed a strong legislative support, it was clear that apart from bringing legislation in the state assembly, the bill needed Presidential assent for notifying the law under the proviso to Article 31(A), and thereafter the said law must be included in the Ninth Schedule. Article 31(B) of the Constitution was incorporated under the provisions of the Constitution through the first amendment Act 1951 and once the proposed Tamil Nadu Act is included in the Ninth Schedule it could not be challenged. In a special session of the Tamil Nadu assembly held in 1993, it was unanimously resolved calling upon the Union government to take steps immediately to bring in suitable amendments to the Constitution so as to enable the state to continue its policy of 69% reservation. The bill passed by the Tamil Nadu assembly came into effect after President Shankar Dayal Sharma gave his assent to the bill and the TN Act was notified as Act 45 of 1994. Thereafter on July 22, 1994, the state requested the Union government that the law be included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution. There have been pleas that have been filed in the Supreme Court against the inclusion of the Tamil Nadu Act in the Ninth schedule on the ground that it is unconstitutional and against Article 14. The continuance of 69% reservation would depend upon the outcome of the pending cases. (The writer is a former advocate general of TN who was instrumental in including the state enactment in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/how-reservation-policy-shaped-over-decades-ensured-tn-stayed-ahead/articleshow/85575607.cms||---

---||Kolkata||A different view: ‘Taliban guarded our complex’||KOLKATA: Taliban militia warned teachers at Kardan International School in Kabul not to step out for their own safety but did not create any trouble when some of them, including Nimta resident Tamal Bhattacharya, decided to travel to the airport to take an Indian Air Force flight back to India. “My parents were worried and fell sick thinking about my fate after Taliban militia swept into Kabul. I had a very different experience. They (the Taliban) may be acting tough elsewhere but we were spared. They guarded the complex where we were staying, played cricket with us and called as 'ustad'. I am thankful to God for their merciful behaviour,” 34-year-old Tamal Bhattacharya told TOI on Monday, hours after he was reunited with his anxious parents in Kolkata. He was among the 194 Indians who were brought back to the country in a special flight of Indian Air Force on Sunday. A mechanical engineer, Bhattacharya had joined the school in Kabul barely five months ago to teach two science subjects. Bhattacharya and four others set out for Kabul airport on Thursday. “There was a curfew-like situation and all establishments were shut. Eventually, we reached the north gate but were unable to enter the airport and went to a wedding hall and joined other Indians waiting to be evacuated. On Friday evening, we went to the airport but could not enter. The next morning, the Taliban took us to a manufacturing unit where we were held for sometime. It was tense,” he said. After being released, the 150-strong group managed to enter the airport on Saturday evening and were evacuated by IAF that very night. Bhattacharya says he wants to return to Kabul and commence teaching when the situation normalises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-different-view-taliban-guarded-our-complex/articleshow/85575624.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

With the festival season already in sight, traders’ associations believe that purchasing dry fruits will be a costly affair as prices are expected to increase further. They believe there would be shortage or even no supply of dry fruits if an alternative arrangement was not made as early as possible. According to Lucknow Kirana Traders Association, in the past 15 days, business of Rs 250 crore has been affected in the city. Lucknow traders transport dry fruits from Mumbai and Delhi which are imported from Afghanistan. “Afghanistani raisins and cashews are the most popular dry fruits imported. However, with the supply reduced and prices hiked from Delhi and Mumbai, we are forced to increase the price rates here,” said Akhilendra Gupta, member, Yahiyaganj Kirana Association. As per records, almonds prices have almost doubled while cashew prices have been hiked by Rs 200. Similarly, raisins and makhana prices have also been hiked by Rs 30 each. Kirana association members said that in the festival season the business of dry fruits is around Rs 200 crore in the city. “The increased rates will not only drill a hole in customers' pockets but also result in huge loss for traders,” said Vikram Garg, secretary, Aminabad Kirana Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/prices-of-dry-fruits-skyrocket-as-taliban-stop-supplies-loss-looms/articleshow/85577854.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

Both these prisoners will go back through the Atari border on August 28. Official sources said 17-year-old prisoner Bhagchand Koli, who is in a juvenile centre in Barmer and resident of Peerkot village of Dhoronaro tehsil in Amarkot district of Pakistan, entered India by jumping over the fencing at Munabao border in Barmer on September 9, 2020. He was caught by the BSF and was handed over to police. It was suspected that he was spying for Pak intelligence agency ISI and was sent to Jaipur for intensive inquiry but on finding nothing objectionable, the Rajasthan government issued a no objection certificate. Since then, the process of returning him back to Pakistan was going on. Barmer SP said all agencies had inquired him and since he was was minor when he entered, he was kept at the juvenile centre. The other prisoner in Gwalior jail is Abbas Ali Khan. Recently, the Madhya Pradesh High Court has also ordered to deport him. According to official sources, Inderganj police had arrested Khan on March 13, 2006. He was arrested for spying for Pakistan and for making fake documents. The court sentenced him to 14 years imprisonment. The decision was challenged in the high court but it dismissed the appeal and ordered him to complete the full term. He completed his sentence on Feb 14, 2021. According to the high court order, he was to be handed over to Pakistan at the Wagah border, but the process could not be started to deport him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-pakistani-prisoners-to-be-sent-back-on-aug-28/articleshow/85577858.cms||---

Its report submitted to Prime Minister’s office noted that “paediatric facilities—doctors, staff, equipment like ventilators, ambulances, among others—are nowhere close to what may be required in case a large number of children become infected”.District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said, “It cannot be said with surety whether the third wave will come and involve different people, including children. We are, however, ready for any challenge.”A health officer said, “An ultra-modern paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with five PICU beds and eight multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MISC) beds have been set up at civil hospital. Doctors and nurses have been trained with the help of doctors from a private hospital. This ward has ECHO and cardiology backup from a private hospital.”The district epidemiologist said they have written to private hospitals to make preparations, especially in the paediatrics units.Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said all arrangements were in place. “A 100-bed ICU, of which 50 each are PICU and neo-natal intensive care unit (NICU) beds, has been set up by DMCH. At civil hospital, we have set up 13 beds,” he added. An official of CMCH public relations department said they have a 50-bed facility for children afflicted with Covid. “There is a need to gear up paediatric set-ups. During the second wave, we were not in a position to cater to the huge and severe cases, but now we have to make necessary arrangements. There is a need to have adequate number of paediatric wards, ventilators and paediatricians, especially those trained for intensive care,” said former DMCH principal and paediatrician Dr Daljeet Singh.Expert said there is a need to vaccinate the eligible children, as vaccine has been approved for 12-year-olds and above.Paediatric data compiled by the health department from January 1 to June 4 (which included second wave period) shows that 2,702 Covid cases were reported in Ludhiana. Maximum were in 15-18-year age group. Least cases were in 1-5-year age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/with-focus-on-paediatric-care-dist-prepares-for-third-wave/articleshow/85573186.cms||Shariq Majeed

Initially the plan was to go to Italy but that didn’t materialize as they could not reach the airport on time. We are now relieved that she could be evacuated from Kabul,” said her brother John Crasta. He added that Sr Theresa has been attached to the Sisters of Charity and has been serving in a school for differently-abled children in Kabul for the last three years. She had planned to return to Delhi on August 17 but the fall of Kabul to Taliban derailed her journey and she was stranded at the institutions located in Kabul. Meanwhile, Kannur native Deedil Rajeevan, who was evacuated from Kabul to New Delhi on Sunday, reached Kannur on Monday. Deedil said that they had lost hope when armed Taliban militants blocked their vehicle enroute to Kabul airport and took the buses carrying Indians to a remote location. He said that though they were not harmed and were let off later, the long wait after the militants took their passports and phones into custody, was very stressful,” he said. Deedil thanked the central and state governments and the Norka department for the help in making their evacuation possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/keralite-nun-sister-theresa-crasta-evacuated-from-kabul/articleshow/85575692.cms||---

Their request comes in the wake of the state government’s orders, allowing only fully-vaccinated teachers to teach in schools. Of the 7,360 teaching staffers in government schools of the district education department, 7,171 (97.43%) have got the first dose of vaccine and 4,899 (66.56%) the second. Of the 23,453 teaching employees in private schools of the district, 19,987 (85.22%) have received the first dose and 10,078 (42.97 percent) the second. Teachers said they are waiting for the second dose and the health department should help them.Deep Raja, an SST teacher at GSSS, Panjgrain, Machhiwara Block, who is also a member of master cadre union, said, “We were against the vaccination drive earlier, but when it was made mandatory, teachers went for it. Most of the teachers have received the first dose. They are now waiting for the second, which will be administered after the mandatory gap period.”Another teacher said, “There were verbal orders by the education department that teachers can receive the second shot after 28 days. It is not possible for us to book a slot on Co-Win portal on our own. The department must manage this.”According to the data, of 1,118 non-teaching staff in government schools, 1,050 have received the first dose. Of 1,436 mid-day meal workers, 1,147 (79.87%) have got the first dose.Of 4,581 non-teaching staff in private schools, 3,322 have got the first vaccine dose. In the past some days, 25 students and two teachers have tested Covid positive after the health department started testing in schools.District education officer Lakhbir Singh Samra said, “The gap between vaccine shots should definitely be reduced for teachers. But whether it should happen or not can only be decided by the health department. Schools are allowing partially- and non-vaccinated teachers to conduct online classes.”District immunisation officer Dr Puneet Juneja said, “There are no such government guidelines for teachers. Even, for international travelers, including students who are planning to travel in September, the vaccine will be available till August 31. Teachers are considered frontline workers, they should have got themselves vaccinated on priority back then.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/teachers-seek-second-vax-dose-after-28-days/articleshow/85573182.cms||Mehak Jain
---||Kolkata||‘Indian govt should go for a dialogue with Taliban’||KOLKATA: Former Indian foreign secretary Krishnan Srinivasan wishes that the Indian government should go for a dialogue with the Taliban. “There is talk that India may be already in touch with the Taliban, but it is not known where and when and at what level. It is also not clear why these contacts have been kept confidential by the government,” he said. Srinivasan said that since the Taliban are apparently the de facto authority in Afghanistan and control most of the country a dialogue can give some advantages. “There will be no alternative but to deal with them, since whether or not there is a functioning embassy in place, India will have interests to protect, such as ongoing development projects, Indian nationals and Afghan and other country nationals who wish to travel to India. “ In the longer-term, assuming the Taliban consolidate their hold on power and gain widespread legitimacy, there will be a basic requirement to transact normal government day to day business unless India takes a decision to keep the regime in Afghanistan and Afghan people in general at arm’s length.” The former diplomat felt that assuming this is not the case, “Contacts with the Taliban will be necessary even for the resumption of the work of the embassy and the return of the ambassador.” The former foreign secretary regrets the manner, in which the Kabul embassy was closed down suddenly amid the crisis.  “We have not been told the full circumstances for the rapid exit from Kabul. On the face of it, it was a serious error, since many other missions, including ones from countries formerly engaged in combat with the Taliban, have remained in place,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-should-go-for-a-dialogue-with-taliban/articleshow/85575687.cms||Debasish Konar

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: New courses in Kota, Bikaner universities to prepare youths for the job market||JAIPUR: With changing times, need was felt to introduce those subjects in higher education that will help students get good employment opportunities. With this idea, Rajasthan University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Bikaner and Rajasthan Technical University, Kota have introduced some new courses, that will help students with jobs in future. RTU, Kota has introduced four degree courses this year for students to have better exposure and specialisation in new emerging fields. University administration said that students will be able to choose their specialisation in these emerging courses, the scope of which has increased over the years. RTU, Kota vice-chancellor RA Gupta said that usually, students just do computer science engineering but after learning computer science engineering with machine learning, designing, internet of things courses, it will be easier for them to adjust in the world. “These are ongoing fields and by giving an engineering degree based on these specialisations, students will have better opportunities in the job market. Earlier, it was just engineering but with the new courses, students will be exposed to focused learning,” said Gupta. New students taking admission this year will be able to opt for these specialisations from the beginning of the courses, but the subjects will begin from the third year. Hence, till second year, they will have an option to change their field of specialisation. Similarly, in Rajasthan University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Bikaner, certificate courses are designed to train students in some important fields. Canine orthopedics, canine ophthalmology and dentistry, and wildlife management have been introduced. As students usually get training on big animals, pet treatment is also an emerging field wherein animals are kept in houses not for commercial use. VC of the Rajasthan University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Bikaner Satish Garg said, “We have started a course on wildlife management this year in which different aspect of managing a wild animal, its feeding process, diet and other aspects will be taught. Other courses’ structures are also ready and will be introduced soon. The demand of the specialists have increased over the years and we expect that our students will have an upper hand after doing these courses.” The Wildlife Management course started this year will be of 40 hours and will cost Rs 5,000. All the certificate courses will be taught to students in final year or fourth year that students can take up in addition to their degrees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/new-courses-in-kota-bikaner-varsities-to-prepare-youths-for-the-job-market/articleshow/85577892.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation stops water body fill-up, foils land sharks’ attempt to grab 5 bighas off Bypass||KOLKATA: KMC’s environment department on Monday stepped in to stop land sharks from filling up a pond in the Mukundapur locality. Civic officials who rushed to the spot after getting an anonymous tip-off lodged an FIR with Purba Jadavpur police and also put up a notice, warning stern action if any further attempt was made to fill up the water body. The KMC environment department inspection team that reached the spot found the 5-bigha pond had been first walled up using corrugated sheets. Inside, water was pumped out during the night and trucks rolled in during the day, carrying debris that was then dumped into the water body. “The pond was part of a larger water body. A portion of it was sold to a developer, who then cordoned it off before it began to be filled up. This was happening in daylight. We received an alert and found a portion of the pond had already been filled up,” said a civic official. TOI had only last month reported a similar filling up activity behind late actor Soumitra Chatterjee house in Golf Green. Green activists said encroachment at the East Kolkata Wetlands had also intensified after the pandemic. Dilip Sinha, a resident of a housing complex located close to the pond, expressed shock over the desperate attempt to grab the wetland. “When the site was barricaded, I smelt a rat. But we couldn’t make out what was going on in the darkness of night. Now it is obvious that in absence of a vigil, the land sharks will become active and will go the extra mile to accomplish their task,” Sinha said. Another resident of Netai Nagar, an area located near the site, said local residents knew about the pond filling but couldn’t muster the courage to protest against a powerful land mafia. “Now that the civic body has initiated action, hope that the pond will be saved,” the resident said, requesting anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-stops-water-body-fill-up-foils-land-sharks-attempt-to-grab-5-bighas-off-bypass/articleshow/85575716.cms||Saikat Ray

The company is beginning operations in the city with a capacity of 600 beds. Besides new markets like Jaipur, the startup will continue to strengthen its presence across more than 16 cities where it currently operates. The managed accommodation sector in India has largely been fragmented and unorganized, suffering from infrastructure and service quality gaps like ill-maintained and cramped buildings, poor quality food, lack of access to daily facilities and more. Anindya Dutta, MD and co-founder, Stanza Living, said, “After gaining major market share across leading student and working professional hubs like Delhi NCR, Dehradun, Indore, Vadodara and more in North India, entering Jaipur is a natural progression for the business.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Another reminder why sedition law needs to be scrapped||By P SelviRecently, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin announced that all the cases filed against people for protesting would be withdrawn. Most of the cases were related to the Chennai-Salem expressway, Kudankulam nuclear power plant, hydrocarbon extraction projects, and the three new farm laws passed by Parliament last year. Stalin said the cases were being withdrawn to uphold the rights of protesters and to protect freedom of expression. Activists say more than 10,000 cases were registered across five districts over protests against the Salem-Chennai expressway. Between 2011 and 2013, around 9,000 protesters of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant were charged under several sections of the law including sedition. Sedition, an offence under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), appears to be the flavour of the season as more petitions are filed before the Supreme Court challenging its validity. The petitioners contend that alternative, less intrusive laws dealing with safety and security, public disorder and terrorism are now available and hence the sedition law is unnecessary. The colonial-era law punishes any person for certain acts that would bring the government established by law into hatred or contempt, or create disaffection including disloyalty and feelings of enmity. The explanation under the section excludes ‘disapprobation’ (or disapproval) of government measures that do not excite or attempt to excite hatred, contempt, or disaffection (e.g. a person criticising vaccine distribution policy to states is protected by the explanation). The continuation of sedition in the penal statute is a threat to free speech, and muzzles any form of dissent. Significantly, the Constituent Assembly did not include sedition when it drafted the Constitution as a restriction on freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. In fact, sedition was not even included as a restriction even when ‘friendly relations with foreign states’ and ‘public order’ were, under the First Constitutional Amendment, 1951. But the Supreme Court, in the case of Kedar Nath Singh vs State of Bihar (1962), upheld the constitutionality of sedition and limited its application to acts that incite or "tend to" incite violence or create disorder or disturbance of law and order. It is this expression – ‘tend to’– that has been used expansively to include any situation, without any checks and balances. Moreover, the judgment does not restrict sedition to only against the state, it allows individual actions that tends to lead to violence as sedition. The judgment relied on the 1898 Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) when sedition was non-cognizable. But after the CrPC was replaced by the existing Code of 1973, the offence is cognizable giving police unbridled power. However, the jurisprudence of free speech has evolved since 1962. Sedition could be challenged on the grounds of manifest arbitrariness and proportionality principle (maintaining the balance between action and purpose for which powers have been conferred) that have undergone expansion in the past few years. Anybody can file a false complaint and have the person arrested. But cases for malicious prosecution are seldom filed, police officers are not prosecuted or tried with departmental action, nor does the victim get paid compensation. Two private members’ bills on sedition have been pending in Parliament, but the judiciary appears well-placed to strike it down altogether. As Amartya Sen said "voice is a crucial component of the pursuit of justice" and we argumentative Indians known for our loquaciousness, should not be silenced.

While majority of work is completed, the civic body is working to cast three concrete cement slabs over the railway line and launching the segments near Civil Lines circle. The work to connect the new elevated road with the existing Ajmer Road elevated road, which was constructed by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has also been started by the civic body. A JDA engineer said, “As per the plan, there was provision made to connect both elevated roads. Commuters travelling the entire 2.8km stretch will ascend at Shyam Nagar, Sabzi Mandi, before the junction using existing ramp of the Ajmer Road elevated road.” Under the project, four ramps would be constructed for traffic to ascend and descend from elevated road. Once completed, a commuter will reach Ajmer Road via Hawa Sadak within 10 minutes. Commuters travelling from Ambedkar Circle will have an option to ascend at Nandpuri near Hilton Hotel using the ramp. An engineer said, “Two ascending ramps for commuters plying between Ambedkar Circle and Ajmer Road will benefit many. If the ramp was not constructed at Nandpuri, people living in the area would have avoided using the elevated road as they had to take a U-turn from Sodala to reach their destination.” Similarly, the JDA has constructed the 1.8km-long elevated structure for commuters plying from Ajmer Road end. The elevated road ascends in front of Hirapura power house and descends near Kathputli Nagar. “The work has reached its last stage. The work is expected to be completed by November end,” added the official. The multi-crore project has missed several deadlines in the past due to various reasons. The civic body had announced to complete the project by November 2020. But, in the aftermath of Covid-19, the work was stalled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sodala-flyover-to-be-ready-by-nov-end/articleshow/85577905.cms||---

Scientists say this could also explain why certain individuals infected with SARS-COV-2 are asymptomatic—the concept being somewhat like good bacteria in the gut, which help fight infections. The study also observed higher abundance of specific opportunistic pathogens in those infected with Covid-19, suggesting that the inflammatory environment caused by the infection causes an increase in bacterial pathogens that may result in secondary infection. “The increase in pathogenic bacteria in the nasal microbiome (the micro-organisms in a particular environment) of Covid-19 patients is due to the accumulation of mucus, known to favour the growth of these organisms, and hyper-inflammatory environment (extensive inflammation in the body) that supports their growth,” said Avinash Sharma, scientist, NCCS, who led the study. “There was a reduction in good bacteria, known to have a positive impact on the immune system, in the nasal region of Covid patients. This in turn causes opportunistic pathogens to colonize the site. The study is significant as it can help determine how the virus actually promotes increase in opportunistic pathogens, which may enhance the severity of other diseases,” Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/good-nasal-bacteria-could-make-covid-infection-less-severe-reveals-study/articleshow/85577965.cms||Neha Madaan

For the past 15 days (except on August 15), the state reported more daily vaccinations in rural areas than in cities. In the rural areas, more than 33.7 lakh doses were given in the last 15 days (Aug 8-22) in comparison to 13.6 lakh shots in urban zones. The focus of the health department in Covid vaccination has now shifted to rural areas. With panchayat elections are scheduled in some of the districts, the health department has scaled up vaccination in rural areas to provide a shield to people. Facilitators such as health workers or ASHAs also mobilise beneficiaries in rural areas and those residing in urban slums to get jabs at the nearest vaccination centres. While talking about the vaccination drive, health minister Raghu Sharma told TOI that the Centre had allocated around 55 lakh doses for August. “We need 2 crore doses in August, which we have demanded from the Centre,” said Sharma. Despite difficulties in reaching some of the areas which are remote, the health department’s teams are working hard to provide jabs to the beneficiaries in difficult areas. The number of beneficaries vaccinated in the state is now close to 4 crore. Till 7pm on Monday, the number of doses administered in the state stood at 3.99 crore, of which 3.02 crore are first doses 96.7 lakh second.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/villages-beat-cities-in-vax-drive-this-month-4-crore-jabbed-in-raj-so-far/articleshow/85577928.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

The ambulance emergency medical technician (EMT) wasted no time and went ahead with the delivery. After the baby was born, the ambulance staff admitted the mother and the baby to the nearest hospital. On Sunday evening, 102 ambulance EMT Anurag Patel and pilot Anuj Yadav were returning after dropping off a patient to a hospital when they were stopped by a man near the Alambagh Metro station. The man told them that his wife, Lalita (30), was in labour and had to be taken to a hospital immediately. But given the woman’s condition, the duo conducted the delivery on the spot with help of the emergency delivery kit available in every 102 ambulance. The woman and her baby were admitted to the Mother and Child Hospital in Chandernagar in Alambagh. Inderjeet Singh, regional manager of GVK EMRI, the outsourcing company for 102 and 108 ambulances, said, “The ambulances are provided with emergency delivery kits for such situations. The staff is fully trained to perform such deliveries with the available resources.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ambulance-staff-turn-saviours-help-woman-deliver-on-road-in-emergency/articleshow/85577930.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

BJP state president Satish Poonia tweeted, “In Ayodhaya, naming a road to Kalyan Singh is a tribute to a supreme devotee of Lord Ram.” In another tweet, he said, “It is the BJP. Here we are not ruled by one family. At our party, work is recognized. I would like to thank the Yogi government for naming the road to the temple ‘Shri Kalyan Singh Marg’ to recognise his great contribution to the temple.” Former chief minister Vasundhara Raje in a tweet said, “Nothing can be a bigger tribute for a true Ram Bhakt that a road to Ram Temple is being named after him. I hail the decision.” Meanwhile, Raje yet again demanded a survey of the crops damaged in western Rajasthan in view of the drought-like situation. She urged CM Ashok Gehlot to announce compensation on the basis of the survey. She tweeted, “Western Rajasthan is under the grip of drought. If the media reports are to be believed, only 10%-15% of land remained for sowing. Overall Rs 2,000 crore loss has been estimated for farmers. Also, power cuts and poor voltage added with high temperatures have further broken the back of the farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/naming-ayodhya-road-after-kalyan-singh-a-true-tribute-state-bjp/articleshow/85577924.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops plan traffic diversions as 300-metre stretch to be shut for Posta flyover work||KOLKATA: With barely four days to go before the shutdown of the 300-metre stretch between Ganesh Talkies and Girish Park on Vivekananda Road to facilitate the second phase of the demolition of Vivekananda (Posta) flyover, cops have firmed up the traffic diversion plans.  Worried that Rabindra Sarani might not be able to bear the extra pressure, cops have decided to stop the entry of buses and hand-pulled carts on this stretch. The traffic diversions are likely to begin from August 27. The Jorabagan traffic guard said that all the possible traffic diversions have been finalized and they are waiting for the final approval from Lalbazar. Sources said extra personnel from the adjacent traffic guards have been kept ready to implement the plans even as the headquarters will monitor bus diversions either from Esplanade or from the Poddar Court areas. Cops said the KMDA has sought a blockade of three months on this stretch. As per plan, cops will be diverting the vehicles coming from Posta and heading towards Girish Park from the Ganesh Talkies crossing. “All the vehicles will turn left towards Rabindra Sarani and then right towards Beadon Street, instead of going straight before reaching CR Avenue. Smaller vehicles can use Beadon Square as an alternate route,” said an officer. The traffic diversion, as compared to the diversion of Strand Road in the first phase, will be equally challenging due to a sheer volume of traffic. “Since commercial activity in the area is lesser than that of Posta, we hope to achieve our aim without much trouble. The challenge will be restricted to the first few days till motorists get accustomed to the diversions,” said a senior officer. The fact that the agency appointed by KMDA is unlikely to start the work before September 1 will give cops some time to make adjustments once they begin the dry run from August 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-plan-traffic-diversions-as-300-metre-stretch-to-be-shut-for-posta-flyover-work/articleshow/85575792.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

According to the victim, Bhavin Thakkar, he was traveling in his car when three persons on bike collided with his vehicle near Khatri chowk. Soon, they started an argument with Thakkar. After a few minutes one of them threw chili powder at Thakkar’s face and the three then fled with the car. According to Thakkar there was a bag, containing the money, inside the car. However, there was no GPS system fitted in the bag or the car. The place where the incident happened is not an isolated area. Superintendent of police Kutch (east) Mayur Patil said, “Around Rs 50-60 lakh were looted from an angadia firm owner. The victim saw three persons but more could be involved in the loot. We have barricaded the main roads.” According to police, the looters left a bike, which they had stolen earlier, on the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/angadia-firm-owner-robbed-of-rs-50-lakh/articleshow/85573342.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Student scholarship numbers in Rajasthan plummet during Covid||JAIPUR: The state government is finding it difficult to distribute scholarships to all targeted students under different vulnerable categories including Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes and OBC forcing several of them to drop out in want of support. Data accessed by the education department said that over 4lakh beneficiaries under the pre-matric scholarship haven’t received money amounting to Rs 114.13 crore in 2019-20. Similarly, out of the total scholarship amount of Rs 380 crore in 2020-21, the state could distribute only Rs 108 crore by the end of December 2020. Reports say the estimated number of students eligible for the scholarship was 12 lakh enrolled in grades 6-10. The estimated amount required to provide scholarships to all students was Rs 250 crore. “State needs to allocate an additional Rs 98 crore to pay scholarships to 4 lakh students of 2019-20,” said a source. TOI called up Samit Sharma, secretary of the social justice and empowerment department, but couldn’t connect with him. The implications of the anomaly are costing the student from vulnerable groups. Vikas Meghwal (19), who lives in a slum in Jaipur,,is yet to receive a post-matric scholarship of Rs 6,000 annually in 2020-21. “I wanted to take admission in a polytechnic college only if I got the scholarship,” said Meghwal, whose father works as a caretaker of a retired couple. Monika Kumari, a class 10 student from Noornagar village in Alwar, fears not being able to continue education after her matric. “It is discouraging not to get the scholarship money, particularly during the pandemic when my father was without work for months. Also, we go through a very tedious process of paperwork to apply for a scholarship. It goes waste when we don’t see any results,” said Kumari. Priyanka Meghwal, a student of class 10 and a resident of Jodhpur’s Nayapura village in Osian tehsil said, “The scholarship money would have helped me in buying a data pack to attend online classe.” Reacting to the situation, KB Kothari, former policy planner in Unicef said, “I understand that the state is facing a huge problem in verification of beneficiaries due to Covid but still it has to be prioritised in order to retain them else it would impact the gross enrollment ratio (GER).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/student-scholarship-numbers-in-raj-plummet-during-covid/articleshow/85577941.cms||---

The deceased were identified as K Krishnudu (SI), Y Babu Rao and P Antony (head constables), and P Janardhana Rao (constable-driver) of the AR wing in Srikakulam district. The tragic incident happened when the police personnel on escort duty were returning to Srikakulam after handing over the body of army jawan G Jairam, who had died in West Bengal, to his family members at Bhairi Sarangapuram village under Mandasa mandal in the district. Srikakulam SP Amit Bardar said the front tyre of the vehicle burst near Summadevi Peta. “The Bolero went out of control, rammed into the median, and crashed over to the other side of the NH and banged into a lorry coming from the opposite side of the median. The vehicle was completely smashed under the impact of the collision. All four died on the spot. We suspect tyre burst was the primary reason behind the accident,” he said. The collision was so powerful that the bodies remained trapped inside the vehicle for quite some time. It took a lot of time for the cops to cut the metal and take out the bodies from the badly mangled vehicle. DGP Gautam Sawang has directed the DIG (Visakha range) and the Srikakulam SP to conduct a detailed inquiry and submit a report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/4-cops-killed-in-road-accident/articleshow/85573257.cms||Nalla.Babu

Almost 16 to 20 of these private colleges are situated in and around Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts.“Crowding medical colleges in one area will not help the people at large. This court hopes that in future, the state government as well as the NMC would not give approval for any medical colleges in and around Chennai or in any other city which has already got sufficient medical colleges like Puducherry,” observed the judges. The court passed the order while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed in 2020 by K R Vasudevaa of Madurai district who sought for a direction to include the 11 new government medical colleges in the counselling conducted for MBBS/BDS admissions for the previous academic year 2020-21.The judges took note of the state government submissions that though the medical colleges have been inaugurated, construction works are going on and it is not possible to commence the classes, without any infrastructures. The deans of the medical colleges have submitted online applications on November 27, 2020 to NMC approval. Based on the applications, NMC would have to make inspection and on satisfaction approval would be given.The judges observed that when that is the requirement under law, there cannot be any direction to include these 11 new medical colleges for counselling in the year 2020-2021. “No doubt 1,650 medical seats would be added. But that cannot be a ground to give direction, especially, when the NMC has not inspected the colleges and take a decision with regard to the approval,” observed the judges, adding that the prayer sought in the petition was premature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/high-court-directs-state-to-create-infra-for-11-new-medical-colleges/articleshow/85578001.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Then CM Siddaramaiah and PWD minister HC Mahadevappa along with Union minister Oscar Fernandes initiated the project. AH Vishwanath and I too toiled to bring the project.

He stated that his ancestors including his father served as priests of the temple.As per the customary and traditional practice, wearing slippers and commercial activities such as laying roads in the temple was not allowed. From time immemorial, only a pathway in three-feet width pathway was in existence for the people to reach the temple.He stated that the temple has been under the control of the HR and CE department since 1975. In this backdrop, the Thiruppathur block development officer and the panchayat president of Poonakurichi village had laid a road illegally to the stretch of 225ft on the temple land without obtaining permission from the HR and CE department officials. The road had not only affected the customary practices, but has also paved the way for tipplers to consume alcohol during the night hours.He stated that after he submitted a representation, the HR and CE department authorities visited the spot on July 5 and passed an order the next day directing the BDO and panchayat president to remove the road. But, despite the order, no steps were taken. He stated that he had also submitted a representation to the district collector, however, no action was taken. Since the government counsel sought to get instructions in this regard, justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy adjourned the case to August 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/retd-judge-knocks-on-hcs-door-to-remove-illegal-road/articleshow/85578028.cms||---

Imamuddin, 58 — a tailor — and his 25-year-old son Shanu — a battery shop owner — were arrested when they were busy working at their shops on Bhargen road under Raja Ka Rampur police station on Saturday evening. The father-son duo alleged that police dragged them out of their shops and beat them up in public and at the police station. Besides, police kept them in the lock-up overnight with handcuffs on and released them only after the intervention of their lawyer on Sunday afternoon, they alleged. “We kept asking policemen the reason behind arresting us, but they didn’t answer. They also did not show the arrest warrant to us. They beat us and abused us, sending my entire family in a state of mental trauma. We urge senior police officers to take serious cognisance of the matter and take suitable action against sub-inspector Mohit Rana,” said Shanu. His lawyer Amit Johri said, “Imamuddin’s daughter Rizwana had in 2013 filed a police complaint against her husband and in-laws under the Dowry Prohibition Act and charged them with domestic violence. The case is sub judice. Last week, the district and sessions court had issued an arrest warrant against Rizwana’s husband Shan Mohammad, his parents Kallu and Aneesa Begam. Instead of arresting them, police arrested the complainant’s father and brother. They were released when I objected to their arrest. I will take up the matter in the court on August 31.” Meanwhile, Etah senior superintendent of police Udai Shanker Singh on Monday ordered an investigation into the matter. “Aliganj circle officer will conduct the investigation, and based on his report further action will be taken. The preliminary inquiry revealed that the entire episode took place due to confusion with the names and details of the accused and the complainant. Suitable action will be taken to ensure such incidents are not repeated in the future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/etah-police-arrests-complainants-as-court-issues-warrant-against-dowry-accused/articleshow/85573344.cms||Deepak Lavania

Most of them had been walking around their residential areas for the past four months, since the beginning of the second wave. At the parks around Thiruparankundram and Harveypatti, children were seen playing on the swings and play equipment in the morning.President of the walker’s club A A G Rajkumar and secretary Pon Rajan said that they had specified that people without masks should not enter the park without masks. “All our members have complied, but others are not taking precautions and we are trying our best to create awareness among them,” they said. Sanitizer is provided at the gates and handwash is also kept near the wash basin. The children’s section would be opened in a day or two, they said.The Eco Park, the biggest park in the northern part of the city, also saw happy morning walkers. Workers were also seen cleaning the park throughout the day. Madurai Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said that they had already done two rounds of mass cleaning of all the parks in the city.However, the mother of a two-year-old girl, K Ananthi, says that she was not in a hurry to take her child to the park. “As it is predicted that the third wave would affect children, I don’t think it is a good decision to take children to any of the public places or functions now,” she said.A few people who came to the Rajaji Park were disappointed though as they had brought their children with them, only to be told that it was closed. The commissioner said that the park would be open to the public, but rides were undergoing safety checks and they would not be opened for a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/public-parks-in-madurai-city-reopen-to-lukewarm-response/articleshow/85578097.cms||---

The bandh was called by the All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC) and the national task force on hallmarking. Agitating jewellers said that while they did not oppose the hallmarking of gold ornaments, they resented the imposition of the HUID process. Jeweller Ishu Datwani said, “It will not only increase work, for which more clerical staff will be required, but it is also not in the scope of things as far as BIS is goes. Earlier, we would get jewellery back in a day. Now, it is taking over 10 days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hallmark-rule-sparks-strike-by-jewellers/articleshow/85578111.cms||---

This year, just two days before Independence Day, the local lad climbed atop Mount Kun (7,077 meters), one of the highest peaks of the Himalayan range along the Line of Control in Ladakh. He now aims to climb Mount Everest. Originally hailing from Chhapra district of Bihar, Amit said, “Initially, we had planned to raise the Tricolor at Mount Kun peak on August 15 to mark the Independence Day but extreme cold weather and unpredictable climatic conditions over 20,000 feet forced us to expedite our expedition. In fact, just 10 hours after reaching the summit the climate deteriorated to an unbearable level.” An alumnus of Patna University, Amit developed interest in trekking into mountainous terrains around 2017 after visiting Uttarakhand. “Like millions of others I have been born and brought up in Gangetic plains but hardly gave thought to how important mountains and glaciers are to maintain ecological balance. Once you reach the summit, the scenic beauty mesmerizes you but at the same time makes you realize that efforts need to be made to secure it for future,” said the banker, who was 115kg till a few years back but the passion for mountaineering helped him to get in shape. “Of course, fitness is required for such difficult expeditions but mental endurance and positive mind-frame in the toughest and harsh weather conditions is more important for mountain climbing,” added the father of a one-and-half-year-old toddler. Amit was part of a seven member team led by Baljeet Kaur, who returned to Lucknow on August 19. Earlier in the second week of May, mountaineers Baljeet Kaur of Solan district of Himachal Pradesh and Gunbala Sharma of Rajasthan became the first Indian women to scale Mount Pumori (7,161 metres) in Nepal on May 12 amid pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-banker-scales-one-of-himalayan-peaks/articleshow/85578156.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The anointment happened 10 days after Arunagirinatha Gnanasambantha Desika Paramacharya, who was the 292nd pontiff, died. Arunagirinatha died on August 13. There were controversies over the succession as fugitive godman Nithyananda staked a claim. Guru Mahasanidhanam Kailai Masilamani Desika Paramacharya Swamigal, the 27th head of Dharumai Adheenam, declared that junior pontiff Harihara Sri Gnanasambanda Desika Swamigal, who was appointed by Arunagirinatha on June 6, 2019, as his successor, would become the 293rd pontiff. The official taking over of charge was put off till the end of the 10th day ceremony for the late pontiff. The guru puja was performed on Monday morning. Then the 293rd pontiff was anointed through a series of rituals. This was done in the presence of the 27th head of Dharumai Adheenam and heads of other mutts. Many mutt heads including Kundrakudi, Thirupananthal, Siruvai, Kancheepuram South zone and Porur adheenams participated in the ceremony. Joint commissioner of the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple K Chelladurai, HR and CE officials, were also present. Public stood in long queues and sought the blessing of the new Adheenam. After assuming charge, the new Adheenam signed six files which included the file to revive the Ushakala kattalai, a ritual that had been suspended. He announced that the Nithya and Maheswarar pujas would also be conducted in the mutt and free meals (annadhanams) would be provided by the mutt as well as in the four temples coming under it. The new Adheenam also offered worship in the Sri Meenakshi temple and later went on a procession in the evening. Madurai Adheenam is said to have been established by Saivite saint Thirugnanasambandar 1,500 years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sri-la-sri-harihara-becomes-293rd-pontiff-of-madurai-adheenam/articleshow/85578130.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Kota official wants women to give up family land rights||JAIPUR: A revenue official in Kota district has courted controversy and invited the wrath of rights activists after issuing an official release appealing to women to voluntarily relinquish their rights on parental land on the eve of Raksha Bandhan. The letter, made public on August 21 by the office of Digod tehsildar Dilip Singh Prajapati under the heading, ‘Raksha Bandhan ko yaadgaar banaiye, bahino se swechhik hak tyag karvaiye (Make Raksha Bandhan memorable, get sisters to voluntarily relinquish their rights)’, started a storm in the desert state. “When a khatedar (landowner) passes away, the names of his son, daughter and wife are entered in his place as his natural heirs. In several religions and families, it has been the tradition for generations that sisters and daughters don’t take their share from parental agricultural land and immovable assets and instead take their share from the property of in-laws,” the release said. The letter further argued that though women sometimes voluntarily relinquish their land rights, the process does not get completed due to negligence. It further alleges that at times when the land is acquired by the government, the cheque for compensation often gets issued in the name of sisters or daughters. “Circumstances give birth to sins and, in such situations, some sisters don’t return the amount of the cheque to their brothers. And in the end, the siblings die after not being on talking terms for their entire life,” it says. Prajapati also says that in case a woman dies, the names of her husband or children are given as owners, and even though the person connecting the two families have died, the son-in-law ends up being the owner of the land and sells it at throwaway prices. The result is long-drawn court battles, even murders. Following this, various social organisations, including PUCL Rajasthan, wrote an open letter to the chief minister and demanded the immediate withdrawal of the press note and suspension of the official for serious indiscipline. They said that it was not only a violation of the law on property, Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (amended 2005), but contempt of Supreme Court order in the case of Vinita Sharma Vs Rakesh Sharma and others. They also called for action against the Kota collector for serious lapses in monitoring the tehsildar, causing a setback and trauma for all women of the state and the country. Justifying his release, tehsildar Prajapati said that he had only made an appeal for “voluntarily relinquishing”. “Men and women are equal in the eyes of the law and the names of women are included in revenue records. But women who want to voluntarily relinquish their rights can do so. I have seen court battles for generations. This is just an appeal and not an order. I mentioned Raksha Bandhan because all women come to their parental homes at this time,” he said. However, the district administration has not yet taken note of the appeal made by Digod tehsildar. "We will look into the matter on Tuesday and initiate action accordingly as it was a holiday on Monday," said Kota district collector Ujjawal Rathore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kota-official-wants-women-to-give-up-family-land-rights/articleshow/85578173.cms||Joychen Joseph

While the final semester results for undergraduate programmes were declared a few weeks ago, a section of students waiting for the state government to open online admission portal of government arts colleges started applying from Monday. Students wishing to join arts colleges across the state can apply through www.tngasapg.com or www.tngasapg.in. The portals will remain open till September 1. The Government Arts College, Coimbatore, offers 21 postgraduate programmes and has 552 seats. There is good demand for MCom and Computer Science, a senior faculty member said. “Demand for pure science subjects like Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics has always remained high. There are only a few colleges that offer PG programmes in Psychology and Political Science, that attract a large number of applications.” Though the state government insists that arts and science colleges start admission together, usually aided and self-financing colleges fill their seats much ahead of the process begins in government colleges. Most of the self-financing and aided colleges in the city almost completed the admission process soon after the results were declared for final year undergraduate courses three weeks ago. Asked if such a scenario would affect the admission process in government arts colleges, principal of the Government Arts College K Chitra said they received close to 20,000 applications for 1,500 undergraduate seats and are expecting 10 times the number of available seats in the postgraduate programmes. “A section of students wait for admissions in government colleges. The low fee structure and qualified teachers make our college much sought-after, especially for PG programmes,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/online-admission-begins-for-pg-courses-in-govt-arts-colleges/articleshow/85575943.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a letter to the KRMB chairman, Telangana irrigation engineer-in-chief (ENC) C Muralidhar Rao stated that the project was detrimental to the interests of projects taken up Telangana. Rao explained that Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-I (KWDT-I) had not considered any diversion of water from Srisailam reservoir and stipulated that in future allocations in-basin projects should be given priority over outside basin diversions. “But in 1994...the erstwhile Andhra Government proposed Veligonda project to divert 3,000 cusecs of flood water during monsoon to outside basins like Gundlakamma from Srisailam reservoir through a tunnel...,” Rao said. Telangana has been expressing strong objection to the projects diverting water to the outside basin from Srisailam reservoir, through Pothireddypadu head regulator and SRMC, HNSS lift scheme, KC canal lift scheme and Veligonda tunnel project. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has also conveyed strong objection to the Union government on such diversions and requested to stop diversions immediately. Telangana has also requested KRMB to implement the provisions of KWDT-I without any further delay from the current water year by taking into account only 20 per cent of water for domestic supply as consumptive use. “...Due to the delay in decision by KRMB, Telangana lost its share of about 31.952 tmc per year for Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board and Mission Bhagiratha,” the ENC said in his letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stop-ap-from-executing-work-on-veligonda-t-to-krmb/articleshow/85578791.cms||Roushan Ali

The villagers had blocked the highway too in protest on Saturday. Collectors of two district under which the villages fall have now ordered an inquiry into the land survey. KUDA chairman Marri Yadav Reddy has denied any knowledge of land survey in about 1,600 acres in the two villages. Villagers alleged the cops booked them for the highway protest but did not register their complaint against the ‘surveyors. A group of 4-5 ‘surveyors’ had been coming to the villages for the past few days and collecting details of land from villagers. The issue came to boil on Saturday after villagers questioned the ‘surveyors’ who declined to show any ID proof. The villagers managed to seize their record book and an ID from one of the men showed them to be workers of a Pune-based Science and Technology Park. Alarmed, a group of about 1,000 villagers marched to NH-163 and blocked it. Cops booked the farmers and removed them from the National Highway. On Sunday, villagers claimed that a man identifying himself as Satyanaryana of KUDA called them to cooperate. Villagers said that the man cut the call when he was told to come with ID proof and instead filed a case against them at Hasanparthy police station. According to villagers, revenue and police officials did not respond to their pleas for an inquiry. Hence, on Monday, the villagers tied rakhis to their crops and then about 500 of them went and met the two collectors — R Hanumanthu of Hanumakonda and M Haritha of Warangal. The two collectors, who reassured the farmers about their land, ordered the RDOs to investigate and advised the farmers not to share any details with strangers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rakhis-tied-to-crops-to-protest-illegal-survey/articleshow/85578816.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

The three-year-old sub-adult was identified as Gabbar of Pilkhan family from TWS by wildlife photographer S Ajinder Singh after forest officials shared a camera trap image of the big cat with him a few days ago. Singh, who has been closely monitoring the migration pattern of big cats from Maharashtra to Telangana, said Gabbar has crossed the Penganga river, which acts as border between both the states. It was identified by a distinctive stripe pattern on one of its legs. From Bheempur, it has now moved into Penganga Wildlife Sanctuary (PWS) in Maharashtra, which is also a part of the tiger corridor that eventually leads Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR). “Now that it has entered PWS, there are chances that it might find its own territory in this particular forest which is about 400 square kilometres but it is more likely that it will come face to face with another male tiger that is currently in that area and get into a territorial fight. If there is a conflict, the loser will move out of the forest and naturally advance towards KTR,” Singh said. Once it heads south, the tiger will proceed towards Kawal by passing through Bazarhathnoor, Ichhoda and Nirmal. “This is a very healthy tiger corridor between TWS and Kawal if the movement of the tiger is monitored properly. If there are no obstructions in the corridor, chances are that the big cat can reach KTR within 20 to 25 days from PWS,” said Singh. Last year, a tiger named ‘i’ from Tipeshwar Tiger Reserve was also sighted near Bheempur mandal and stayed in a non-forest area of Adilabad for nearly 14 months. Although it was expected to head towards the Kawal reserve, it eventually settled in PWS, forest officials said. “So far, we do not have any direct evidence of tiger movement in Telangana. We will definitely start monitoring its movement once we know for sure that there is a tiger in our corridor,” said V Chandrasekhar Rao, forest divisional officer, Adilabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-a-year-tiger-spotted-in-adilabads-bheempur/articleshow/85578645.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Madurai||Refund or adjust fees collected from KV students: MP||Madurai: Madurai MP Su Venkatesan has urged Union minister for education Dharmendra Pradhan to advise the Kendriya Vidyalaya administration to either refund or adjust (for the ensuing quarters) the fees collected for the April-July quarter when the schools were not functional. In a letter to the Union minister, Venkatesan stated that fees were charged by KVs even for the period when students were not having classes or any academic activities at all. “For Class X, the classes were over in February this year and holidays were declared. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, declaration of results got delayed and students joined Class XI only in the second week of August. However, students who joined Class XI were asked to pay fees for the period starting from April 1,” he wrote.The MP further observed that fees were charged for the first quarter of this year (April to June) and that some parents said that Rs 3,150 have been collected with break-up details -- Tuition fees - Rs 1,200, Vidyalaya Vikas Nidhi - Rs 1,500, computer education - Rs 300 and Computer science - Rs 150.“At the same time, for the second quarter (July to September), the same amount has been charged though classes have officially begun only after the second week of August. I feel it is not proper on the part of Kendriya Vidyalaya to charge fees for this period when no academic activities were undertaken,” said Venkatesan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/refund-or-adjust-fees-collected-from-kv-students-mp/articleshow/85578203.cms||---

They said that agents were charging high prices citing a shortage of supply. Members of the association told TOI that betel leaves were being sold at very high prices by commission agents at the Pan Mandi Darusalam Agapura as a result of which traders were facing problems. “Depending on the quality of betel leaf, it was earlier sold in the price range of Rs 200 to Rs 800 per bag. However, now it is being sold at an exorbitant price of Rs 2,200 per bag. This is unfair on pan shops owners,” an association member said. pan (betel leaf) is a preferred commodity and is a very common item in Old City with several shops serving a variety of pans with different flavours. The surge in pan prices and restrictions imposed by concerned authorities has become a hindrance for pan shop owners. Drawing attention towards the deepening financial crisis after lockdown, pan shop owners have requested the state government to intervene in the matter and restrict middle-men from arbitrarily charging exorbitant commissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pan-shop-owners-write-to-govt-seek-control-on-prices-by-agents/articleshow/85578754.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Congress not to hold public meet in Gajwel today||HYDERABAD: Congress has deferred its decision to hold a Dandora public meeting in chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s Gajwel assembly constituency on Tuesday. Instead, the party is organising a two-day Dalita Girijana Atma Gaurava deeksha in the CM’s adopted village of Mudu Chintalapalli in Medchal Malkajgiri district on August 24 and 25. A section of the party leaders wants the public meeting to be organised at a later date. They said the party is not a strong force in Gajwel and nearby Siddipet and Dubbak constituencies. “Any failure to make the Dandora public meeting in the CM’s constituency a success will have a lasting impact on the party and also affect the morale of party workers,” a leader said. The functionary said that the public meeting in Gajwel should be organised with a well-planned strategy by the party top guns to make it a grand success instead of rushing ahead with it and “making a fool of themselves.” However, some leaders said the party should go ahead with its August 24 Dandora meeting. “The morale of the rank and file of the party is on a high after the success of two Dandora meetings. If the party backs out at the last minute from holding the meeting in Gajwel, it will have a demoralising effect on the party cadre,” observed a senior leader. It may be recalled Congress had announced that it will organise Dalita Girijana Atma Gaurava Dandora public meets in various assembly constituencies and held the first two Dandora meetings at Indravelli in Adilabad and Raviryala in Maheshwaram constituencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-not-to-hold-public-meet-in-gajwel-today/articleshow/85578749.cms||Roushan Ali

On Day One, attendance was moderate in all the districts. However, students said that they are thrilled to return after a long break. In Hassan, Kodagu, and Chikkamagaluru districts, only PU colleges opened today. In Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts, high schools and PU colleges opened with fanfare. In many schools, the management had strung balloons and drawn rangolis to welcome the kids with the teachers and School Development and Monitoring Committee (SDMC) members ushering in the students. Schools in villages saw poor attendance. “There was no change in the behaviour of students. They were confident as always. There is a need to start midday meals so that they feel motivated to come,” felt several teachers who spoke to TOI. In many schools covid protocol was not strictly adhered to causing concern among parents. In most schools students were subjected to thermal screening, and were seen wearing masks. As there was no school van facility, many parents dropped their children at the school. In Mandya district, DC Aswathi S interacted with students of Hebbakavadi school. She advised students to attend classes with confidence. District minister KC Narayana Gowda also visited a school and reviewed the physical classes. He directed officials to ensure basic facilities in all schools. He distributed sweets, masks, and hand sanitizers to students. In Shivamogga 465 high schools, and 134 pre-university colleges opened. Out of 38,000 PU students and 50,005 high school students, around 50% of students attended classes on Day 1. Shivamogga district minister KS Eshwarappa was present at the government PU college for girls in Shivamogga city and welcomed the students in a traditional way. Eshwarappa said they have been criticized for their decision to reopen schools and colleges early. “The government took a bold step. Parents should send their children to school without fear as cases are dropping,” he added. BOX 10-day deadline for toilet In Hassan, district minister K Gopalaiah’s visit to the Government PU College at Shantigram was godsent. When the minister came to know that there is only one toilet for girls in the college, he took the principal to task. The principal cited Covid lockdown as the reason. Upset by the lame excuse, the minister demanded an explanation as to why no efforts were made to build a toilet prior to the pandemic. The school has been given a 10-day deadline to build one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/students-return-to-campuses-after-a-long-gap-excited-but-wary/articleshow/85571121.cms||---

---||Agra||PhD scholar held with journo Kappan in jail hospital, kin say condition serious||Agra: A PhD scholar, 26, arrested along with Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan and two others in October last year for alleged sedition, was in a hospital for the last two days recuperating from what Mathura jail authorities described as “seasonal fever”. The family of Atiqur Rehman, however, claimed that he was suffering from a serious heart disease and needed immediate surgical intervention. Rehman, Kappan and two others were arrested on October 5 in Mathura when they were headed to meet the family of a Dalit woman (19), who was allegedly raped and killed in Hathras district. UP Police claimed that they were trying to disturb law and order and instigate violence in the state. All the four accused were booked under stringent sedition and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and sent to jail. Their applications seeking bail have been rejected. “Rehman was suffering from fever. He is presently taking treatment at the jail hospital. Though his condition is fine, he will be under observation for a few more days,” said Mathura jail superintendent Brijesh Kumar. The family, meanwhile, was worried. It claimed that Rehman was admitted to the jail hospital after he started feeling breathlessness due to the Aortic Regurgitation (AR) -- a heart condition in which the aortic valve does not close tightly allowing the blood to flow from the aorta, the largest blood vessel, into the left ventricle. Rehman’s wife Sanjeeda Rehman, who lives in Muzaffarnagar, told TOI that he has been suffering from the disease since he was eight years old. His surgery was scheduled for November 2020, but he was arrested a month before. “He needs the surgery urgently as complications could lead to heart failure,” she said. Rehman’s bail application was rejected by a Mathura court on November 13, 2020. “Rehman was taking treatment at AIIMS Delhi’s Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery department where doctors had diagnosed ‘severe’ AR. Bentall surgery was required for this disease,” she said. “The estimated cost of the surgery was Rs 2lakh. His operation was due in November, 2018. But, due to poor financial conditions, we could not arrange the money. When we somehow managed money for the surgery, the next date was scheduled in November 2020. But Rehman was arrested one month before the operation,” Sanjeeda said. “He can die, if the surgery is not conducted timely. His heart can fail any time,” she added. Rehman’s uncle Shekhavat Khan said, “He was taken to SN Medical College, Agra earlier due to some complications because of his heart condition. His condition is not good.” Rehman’s lawyer Madhuvan Datt Chaturvedi told TOI that he will move an application in local court on Tuesday to shift him to Delhi AIIMS. His bail application is also listed in Allahabad high court and hearing on it will take place on August 25. “We hope the high court will consider his medical condition and allow him to get surgery done at AIIMS,” Khan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/phd-scholar-held-with-journo-kappan-in-jail-hospital-kin-say-condition-serious/articleshow/85573459.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Fix plan to hire people with disabilities for NREGA work, says court for specially abled persons||JAIPUR: The court for specially abled persons has issued a notice to the state’s rural development and panchayati raj department directing it to formulate a plan for finalising a fixed number of PwDs (persons with disabilities) to be recruited for MGNREGA work in the state annually. In Rajasthan, the state government has already increased the number of days of work for PwDs under the scheme by 100 days. Giving a reminder to the department, the court directed it to take action in the matter as per rules and inform the court about the same. Based on the petition filed by the Rajasthan wing of Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh, the court of the chief commissioner for PwD, government of India, had already directed the department of empowerment of PwD, under ministry of social justice department, to introduce a central policy to ensure 4 per cent reservation for specially-abled persons in MGNREGA work. In a petition filed by Hemant Bhai Goyal, vicepresident of Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh, it was stated, “It is submitted that there is no provision for reservation for PwDs in employment under NREGA scheme. Due to this, persons with disabilities are not getting the much-needed employment opportunities under the scheme.” “It is well known that the community is reeling under the problems of unemployment, illiteracy and financial weakness. There are limited opportunities in government jobs and they do not get jobs easily even in the private sector. The bankers, too, don’t issue loans to them for self-employment,” he added. “Therefore, you are requested to direct the department concerned to bring a policy to ensure 4 per cent reservation for specially-abled persons in MGNREGA work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fix-plan-to-hire-people-with-disabilities-for-nrega-work-court/articleshow/85578176.cms||---

---||Mysuru||Now, enjoy a pristine view of MM Hills over a zipline||MYSURU: The Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary authorities have started zipline adventure activity to attract tourists. The zipline, said to be the longest in the state, will allow tourists to enjoy the lush green forest from more than 150 feet above the ground level. The zipline has been constructed at Sri Mahadeshwara Maradigudda Tree Park in Kollegal in Chamarajanagar district. The 25-acre park is maintained by Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Division, Kollegal. The zipline initiative was taken up by foresters during the recent lockdown at a cost of Rs 20 lakh. The zipline has been constructed between two hillocks with cable suspension hanging above 150 feet from the ground. At 216 metres, the line is also the longest in the state. Bheemeshwari Adventure and Nature Camp in Mandya District has a 40 metre-long zipline. To allow tourists to capture the moments during zip lining, the forest department will provide a camera attached selfie stick. Forest staff will download the pictures and send it to the tourists free of cost. While the fee is Rs 50 for adults and Rs 30 for children, Rs 5 is charged for vehicle parking. Vinay, a nature explorer from Bengaluru, said all safety measures have been adopted at the facility. “Tourists will be given hand sanitizer and made to wear helmets and safety belts before ziplining. The ticket price is very less here compared to other places where charges range from Rs 800 to Rs 1000. The staff will explain how to glide. We can record our experience with the camera provided,” he said. Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary DCF V Yedukondalu told TOI, “Our aim is to allow people to enjoy the nature. All safety measures including double line cables have been installed and we are maintaining Covid protocols.” Yedukondalu said an agency has been hired to provide technical support who trains the staff and every 15 days inspects the cables and other equipment. “We have also developed the tree park with various medicinal plants and trees. We have set up open gym with more than 50 items at the hilltop and at the foothill for the public,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/now-enjoy-a-pristine-view-of-mm-hills-over-a-zipline/articleshow/85571033.cms||Lakshmikantha BK

---||Mumbai||Let no child die of malnutrition: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Let no more children die due to malnutrition in Maharashtra’s tribal areas, said the Bombay high court on Monday, warning it will take a serious view of it. The high court has told the state government to take immediate measures to improve the situation. “From today till the next date if we find any child has died, we’ll hold your health secretary responsible... The health secretary should rise to the occasion,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing a 2007 PIL on malnutrition deaths in 11 tribal districts, including in Melghat. Advocate Jugalkishore Gilda, for a petitioner, said there have been malnutrition deaths since 1992 and certain directions were issued by HC. In 2007, the PIL was filed again. Gilda said in November 2018, the HC had passed an order in respect of grants by the Central government. Gilda said no audit has been done and the situation has not improved. Children, expectant mothers and those post-delivery continue to die due to malnutrition and lack of medical facilities. “For areas like Dharni and Melghat, the nearest hospital is 130km through the Ghat section and takes 2.5 hours (to reach),’’ said Gilda. He said in health, the Niti Aayog has placed Maharashtra even below Bihar. Melghat-based activist Bandu Sane said 73 children have died between April and July 2021 and more than 11,000 are underweight. He said specialized doctors are not available on the field. “Don’t give us bullet trains and airports but bus depots and pediatricians,’’ he urged. State advocate Neha Bhide said continuous measures are taken to comply with the court’s orders. “If your machinery is so well-equipped, why 73 deaths took place and children are dying till date?” said Justice Kulkarni. Since the bench was hearing this matter for the first time, it sought details from the petitioners on an affidavit. The judges also asked the state to come with its “facts and figures” and that the advocate general would appear in the matter. “It is a serious matter. We’ll make a direction to send doctors, including paediatricians and gynaecologists, to all tribal districts. We want the situation to improve from tomorrow,” said the Chief Justice, adding, “we’ll monitor the matter”. The judges also said they want the latest position on the funds received from the Centre. “What you have done to monitor funds reaching them? How you are monitoring the situation and still deaths are occurring?’’ said Justice Kulkarni. The matter will be heard after two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-if-kids-die-of-malnutrition-will-hold-health-secy-responsible/articleshow/85571146.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Shah was at Atrauli in Aligarh, Singh's birthplace and bastion, to pay his last respects to the BJP veteran who died on Saturday. "I spoke to Babuji (as Singh was fondly referred to) the day the Ram mandir foundation laying ceremony was held. Beaming, he told me, 'My life's aim has been fulfilled'," Shah said. "He was an important leader of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. He didn't hesitate for a moment before giving up his chair for the Ram Janmabhoomi." Singh had been UP CM when the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992. That evening, he had stepped down. "With Singh's death, the deprived and the downtrodden have lost their well-wisher. It's a big loss for BJP ," said Shah. With him at Atrauli were UP CM Yogi Adityanath, MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Union minister VK Singh. The funeral procession started from the Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar Stadium in Aligarh and then stopped at Atrauli. By the time it reached Bulandshahr, where he was cremated at Basi Ghat, over 50,000 people had lined the streets. "Babuji amar rahe (long live Babuji)" rang through the air as people showered garlands and flower petals on the hearse. At Basi Ghat, Yogi, along with UP deputy CMs Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya, defence minister Rajnath Singh and Union minister Smriti Irani, paid homage to Singh.

Consequently, NMC’s ranking in the ensuing Swachh Bharat Survey will be affected.Only cities with ODF++ certification can apply for the Water Plus status. As the NMC already had ODF++ certification and had retained the status in consecutive surveys, it was believed that the civic body would easily obtain the Water Plus certification. Of the 13 municipal corporations that participated in the survey, Navi Mumbai is the only city from Maharashtra to get the Water Plus certification while NMC scored 500 out of the 700 marks in the Water Plus category. The result of Water Plus was announced last week but the civic body learnt about its poor performance only on Saturday, according to a senior official from solid waste management department. The NMC has decided to challenge the low scores awarded to it.As per the result announced by the urban ministry, the NMC scored 3% and was termed as failed in the category of treated water re-use. The civic body also failed in checking trash dumping in nullahs across the city.The civic body scored zero in operation and maintenance costs of sewer networks/sewerage treatment plants recovered through dedicated revenue streams or by users.It scored satisfactory marks in ODF++. Of the 39 public toilets the Central team inspected, most received excellent or very clean markings, said the official.The NMC is the country’s first municipal corporation to treat sewage, the official claimed. Currently, the city treats around 330MLD of the over 500MLD sewage generated daily. “The NMC also generates R 60 crore revenue per annum from the sale of treated sewage to two thermal power stations,” said the official.As per the official, all these efforts validate NMC’s claim for getting cent percent markings in the Water Plus category.The NMC has approached the Swachh Bharat Mission’s Maharashtra state director’s office and demanded revaluation of city’s marking. “We have urged the state director to approach the union urban ministry to challenge the markings. We should have got 100% markings in this category,” he said. The NMC secured good remarks in complaint redressal status, resolving complaints pertaining to choked sewers, leakage in sewage, water logging, septic tank cleaning etc. 550MLD sewage generated, 330MLD treated* For the Water Plus certification, a city needs to ensure that a minimum of 25% of treated water is reused * Nagpur city is generating over 500 MLD sewage, treating 330 MLD and reusing 320 MLD water by supplying it to power plants near Nagpur city||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-treating-half-of-citys-sewage-yet-fails-to-get-water-plus-status/articleshow/85573520.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Dehat district Congress committee vice-president and former municipal chairman of Bhinder Devendra Singh Shaktawat has levelled serious allegations against Preeti Singh Shaktawat, wife of Late Gajendra Singh, for tarnishing the image of the party in Vallabhnagar constituency. In a letter to chief minister Ashok Gehlot, he expressed dissent over giving undue importance to Preeti and being projected as the likely candidate of the party for the forthcoming Vallabhangar bypolls. Shaktawat said he was open to Congress nominating a candidate who followed the ideals and principles of Gulab Singh Shaktawat. He threatened that if the party gave ticket to a wrong candidate, then he would be forced to leave the Congress and contest the elections as an independent candidate. Many senior Congress workers including block president Bhinder Dr. Kamalendra Singh Bemla, block president Vallabhnagar Sunil Kukra, city president Bhinder Puran Vyas were also present at Monday’s press conference. Shaktawat said he was a loyal, dedicated worker of the Congress. His father Gulab Singh Shaktawat, freedom fighter and former home minister of Rajasthan government, had been a pillar of this constituency. Vallabhnagar constituency was the home turf of his father till his last breath and his decades of hard work without any malice had brought the party in Vallbhnagar to the fore. After the death of his father, the party expressed confidence in the Shaktawat family and his younger brother Gajendra Singh Shaktawat was made the Congress representative in 2008. The loyal Congress workers worked hard to keep the Congress on top position but of late there was a dip in Congress party’s popularity in Vallabhnagar constituency. The party had to face defeat in the 2013 assembly elections and in the Lok Sabha 2018 elections. Shaktawat added that in 2018, Gajendra Singh tried to topple the state government. During those two years, party related tasks were looked after by his wife Preeti. During this period, many officers accused her of extortion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/family-feud-over-bypoll-ticket-in-vallabhnagar/articleshow/85578226.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Military literary fest recalls war statesmanship of women||Lucknow: There are many women rulers who defied patriarchal norms, but when it comes to the land of Awadh and Bhopal, one cannot forget Begum Hazrat Mahal, who is remembered for her courage to stand up against the British forces, and the Bhopal Begums, who ruled the princely state for over a century. Remembering forgotten women heroes and their stories of valour, the second session of the Military Literature Festival titled ‘Different Strokes: Bhopal and Lucknow - Military Tales from Two Grand Cities’ covered pieces from the upcoming books of panelists historian Rosie Lewellyn Jones and Lt Gen Milan Naidu. City-based writer-journalist Mehru Jaffar moderated the session. Jones, who has authored Lucknow 1857 and Naidu, who has written Nizaam I - Bhopal, spoke about Awadh and Bhopal, their military statesmanship during 1857 and how women freedom fighters and leaders took charge. In Awadh, showing exemplary leadership, Hazrat Mahal, the wife of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah and the regent of Awadh in 1857-1858, had raised a large army with the support of the people against the British forces even as Wajid Ali had offered support to the British from exile. On the other hand, Bhopal state had sided with the East India Company and Sikandar Begum, who was adept in martial arts, crushed all those who revolted against the British. “Women like Qudsia Begum, Shahjehan Begum and Sultan Jahan Begum, who ruled Bhopal, had brought prosperity and economic development. There is no comparison between the two cities when it comes to 1857 or women politicians of those time,” said Lt Gen Naidu. He added further that since Sikandar Begum was supporting the British in 1857, Rani of Jhansi Lakshi Bai asked her to stop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/military-literary-fest-recalls-war-statesmanship-of-women/articleshow/85578263.cms||Aditi Singh

The arrested person was identified as S Ravikumar, 22, of Rajnandgaon district, a construction worker. He was staying with other construction workers at a godown on Kovaipudur Pirivu. On Sunday night, Ravikumar, who was drunk, visited a nearby hotel to buy food. Meanwhile, constable Arumugam, 35, reached there. When a hotel employee handed over a food packet to the cop, Ravikumar, who was waiting there for his turn, picked up a quarrel with Arumugam. “Ravikumar attacked the cop using a knife. Arumugam sustained injuries on his right hand and lower jaw. He caught hold of Ravikumar and informed Kuniyamuthur police. A police team took him to the station,” a police officer said. Based on Arumugam’s complaint, Kuniyamuthur sub-inspector Ganesh registered a case against Ravikumar under sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

---||Nagpur||Why privatisation failed to improve civic amenities: NGO’s poser to NMC||Nagpur: Highlighting deteriorating civic amenities even after privatizing various works including water, solid waste management and public transport, an NGO Sangharsh Vahini has put a question mark over Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) role.Sangharsh Vahini organized a seminar on how local self-government should function and the duties of an elected representative for the city’s uplift. In a press statement, the NGO said water resources department provides water to all local bodies at the rate of Re1 per unit. The NMC entrusted the water supply and operations to a private firm — Orange City Water (OCW) and the civic body is charging Rs16 per unit from the citizens. Every year, the NMC increases water tariff by 5% just to help the private firm grow, the NGO alleged.The NGO also drew attention to the Aapli Bus service being provided by the NMC through private operators. Despite this, condition of the public transport is not satisfactory.Similar is the issue with solid waste management. Earlier, there was only one company to manage the affairs. Now the NMC has replaced the old firm with two companies. Instead of improving day-to-day garbage collection, the city’s solid waste management has deteriorated, said Sangharsh Vahini.“It is true that despite privatization of all these services, the NMC has not received any additional revenue and instead with deteriorating services, its liabilities have increased,” said Mukund Adewar of Sangharsh Vahini.Another speaker and Vahini member Dinanath Waghmare asked what has the city achieved in the last 15 years in the name of development?About 36% of the people below poverty line and living in slums are deprived of basic rights. Out of 231 schools in Nagpur city, 83 have been closed and 68 are on the verge of closure due to government’s apathy, he alleged.Another speaker Pradip Gaikwad claimed that the ongoing development works like Metro, cement roads, flyovers etc have increased pollution in Nagpur and reduced the life of citizens by 5 years. On the other hand, the authorities are insisting on cutting down over 2,500 trees in Ajni Van to construct commercial complexes and malls in the name of development, he said.The speakers also questioned civic body’s poor revenue generation. The NGO pointed out that NMC has projected an income of Rs2,500 crore from the city, having population of over 30 lakh, whereas Pune with a population of 34 lakh has an income of Rs7,600 crore. Nashik city, with a population of 15 lakh, has Rs2,600 crore income, despite having nearly half the population compared to Nagpur. NGO member Prabhakar Mandhare appealed to the citizens to remain vigilant and stand up against any injustice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/why-privatisation-failed-to-improve-civic-amenities-ngos-poser-to-nmc/articleshow/85573540.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Indore||Indore: Mob thrashes bangle seller for using 'fake identity'||INDORE: A 25-year-old bangle seller from Uttar Pradesh was beaten up by a group of people in Indore on Sunday evening, apparently because he used a fake name while selling his goods to women. The video of the beating went viral on social media, triggering a sequence of events that led to a late-night protest at a police station, the arrest of the suspected attackers and a notice to the Indore collector from National Commission for Minorities (NCM). As Monday dawned, another FIR was registered against 28 of the protesters, and in the evening, the bangle seller was charged under Pocso Act for allegedly making indecent advances at a schoolgirl on Sunday. He was yet to be arrested till Monday night. Home minister Narottam Mishra described the incident as a "dispute between two communities". "The youth has been doing business under a Hindu name though he belongs to a different community. He was selling bangles to womenfolk, which caused the incident," Mishra said, tweeting that action had been taken "against both sides". The bangle seller is also accused of forging identification documents. Two Aadhaar cards were found with him, said Mishra. Police said he had three ID cards in the name of Tasleem, Asleem and Bhura. Indore collector Manish Singh said that the Social Democratic Party of India and Popular Front of India were involved in instigating the protest at a police station. Three of those booked for the protest were PFI members, said police. NCM sent a notice to Singh, seeking a report on action taken against the attackers and what the administration plans to do to prevent such incidents.  "This is one of several such incidents of communal assault in the district and the commission strongly feels that the district administration is not appropriately handling such incidents," the commission said. The collector said these are "localised incidents" and the administration will not spare anyone trying to disrupt social harmony. The bangle seller was accosted by a mob and beaten when he was peddling his wares on Sunday afternoon.  He claims that the attackers took away all his bangles and money. At night, protesters gheraoed Banganga police station, apparently prompted by a statement that no case had been registered against the attackers.

---||Nagpur||EOW to track property lineage of 188 brothel keepers of Ganga Jamuna||Nagpur: Economic offence wing (EoW) of the crime branch has been pressed into action by city police chief Amitesh Kumar to probe into the property lineage of 188 brothel keepers in the red-light area of Ganga Jamuna. The area is said to have a settlement history of three centuries old.On August 11, Kumar had deployed police and barricaded the lanes of the red-light area bringing an abrupt halt to the activities of female sex workers (FSW) thriving here. Though welcomed by the neighbouring localities, the action has also raised controversy surrounding the question of livelihood of the sex workers residing here. Two prominent groups had nearly come to blows on Sunday over the issue of the closure of the red-light area.Kumar, who has imposed section 144 of Criminal procedure code (CrPC) at Ganga Jamuna, has sealed two brothels and issued show cause notice to another seven. “Police department would extract the detailed records of the property ownerships, transfers and other mutual transactions of the 188 brothels of the red-light area. The real owners of the properties would be ascertained with this exercise,” he said.“Some of the brothel keepers are possessing power of attorney as a claim of the ownership but they are not the real owners. Many brothel keepers have worked out some mutual understanding with the owners to evade legal hassles but we will soon unearth those facts and initiate proper action,” said the top cop.CP said the owners of the properties of red-light area can use their premises for any legal trading practices but not prostitution. “We are working on five legal issues. First of all, prostitution would not be allowed at the public places. Secondly, the illegal brothels and the ongoing flesh trade in them has to stop. Thirdly, soliciting would not be allowed. Fourthly, minors would have to be removed from the flesh trade and lastly, even the adults cannot be forced into sex work,” said Kumar.Working upon his ‘five-point-agenda’, Kumar said there is legal brainstorming being done to earmark the entire area ‘a public place’ under the relevant provisions of law to further tighten the screw on the brothel-keepers, pimps and sex workers. “If a woman, whose livelihood is purely depending on sex work, approaches police then we will help her to find alternative livelihood through government schemes, NGO interventions and even corporate social responsibility,” said Kumar.The top cop clarified the barricades being used to assist the deployed police bandobast to ensure there are no entry of the outsiders into the red-light area for prostitution. “Barricades are not regressive or restrictive for the movements of the residents of Ganga Jamuna,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/eow-to-track-property-lineage-of-188-brothel-keepers-of-ganga-jamuna/articleshow/85573559.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Lucknow||Allahabad high court nixes Uttar Pradesh constable’s petition to grow beard||LUCKNOW: A Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court has declined to allow a police constable to grow beard and held that refusal to cut the beard despite being given direction in this regard by the higher officials is a violation of circular issued on October 26, 2020 by the director general of police. “As such, it is not only a wrong behaviour but the same is misdemeanour, misdeed and delinquency of the cop,” the court observed. The bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan passed the order on a writ petition filed by a police constable Mohammad Farman. Observing that growing beard by a member of disciplined force may not be protected under Article 25 of the Constitution of India, the bench held, “This is a domain of competent authority to issue guidelines in respect of wearing proper uniform and keeping the appearance in a manner required for the members of disciplined force and no interference should be done, inasmuch as, maintaining and wearing proper uniform as well as maintaining physical appearance is one of the first and foremost requirements of the members of disciplined force.” The petitioner had challenged his suspension of November 5, 2020 and chargesheet issued against him on July 29, 2021. The senior superintendent of police, Ayodhya, had taken action against him for maintaining beard despite being given instruction to shave it following the DGP circular of October 26, 2020 which prohibited a cop in police force to keep beard. Rebutting the plea that maintaining beard is fundamental right of the petitioner, the bench observed, “Article 25 of the Constitution of India does not confer absolute right in this regard. All the rights have to be viewed in the context and letter and spirit in which they have been framed under the Constitution. As a matter of fact rights guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution of India have in-built restrictions.” Dismissing the petition on August 12, 2021, the bench directed the authorities to conduct and conclude the departmental inquiry against the petitioner in accordance with law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-nixes-up-constables-petition-to-grow-beard/articleshow/85578312.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

He reached Hindon Airbase from Kabul on a special flight on Sunday morning and a little later his home in Gangagarh village in Bulandshahr. A father of three, Baghel had uploaded a video appeal on social media seeking help from the Indian government and PM Modi to rescue him and other Indians from the mill they were employed and trapped in. “The situation was really frightening there as the sound of explosions was incessant. It was only after my video went viral, I found hope and later officials from the Ministry of External Affairs contacted our company’s owner on Friday. We were escorted in a bus with heavy security to Kabul airport. I am really grateful to our government and the media that highlighted my case at the highest level in the government that took immediate steps to evacuate us,” Baghel told TOI. Baghel worked in Meli Afghanistan Steel Mill Company along with 14 other Indians. All have been rescued. “Most of the workers belonged to UP and Bihar,” he said. Though Baghel values his safe exit from the war-torn country, he says he might go back when the situation becomes normal. “Why not? Taliban's fight is for control and once they gain it, factories will in any way start working. I will certainly go back once the situation becomes normal,” he said. In a video sent by Baghel on Tuesday morning, he could be heard appealing to the Indian government and PM to rescue them. “We are stuck in Afghanistan and still inside the mill premises. We appeal to the Indian government and PM Modi Ji to rescue us as we are in big trouble. A lot of shelling is taking place and our passports are also with the company,” Baghel was heard saying in the video.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/days-after-making-appeal-for-help-in-video-from-kabul-bulandshahr-technician-gets-mea-help-reaches-home-safely/articleshow/85573590.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Nagpur||No takers for paid vax: Pvt hosps ask NMC to buy their stock for use at free centres||Nagpur: Though the number of city private hospitals joining the Covid vaccination programme has increased to 25, with all three vaccines available, the drive appears to have suddenly lost steam in paid centres. Contrary to this, vaccination is going at a brisk pace at the over 150 government centres in the city.In the last few days, the total achievement of 25 private centres was at around 400, which is almost equal to what just one or two private centres were reporting some time back.Buoyed by the good response and enthusiasm of citizens, more private hospitals joined the drive and ordered large number of doses. Left with huge stock of doses now, private hospitals are saying the civic body must purchase these doses to avoid wastage and ensure its drive does not stall.The ultimate goal, they say, is to achieve total vaccination. Last month, Pune Municipal Corporation had purchased surplus doses from private hospitals to keep the drive going when supply from the government fell short.However, municipal commissioner Radhakrisknan B ruled out the possibility of the civic body buying doses from private hospitals having surplus stock. “Government is supplying us sufficient doses. We have requested to increase our quota to plan sessions even better,” he said.The civic chief added that already over 11 lakh first doses have been administered in the city. “Around 18 lakh is eligible population. Rest could be those who still have hesitancy, working outside, or may have tested positive. We are in a good position right now. We are aiming to reach out to at least 17 lakh,” he said.Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) convener Dr Anup Marar said many private hospitals proactively responded to the government’s appeal and procured Covid vaccines under the 25% private allocation scheme. They were to deliver them at Rs150 plus cost of vaccine as stipulated by the government, to help vaccinate maximum Indians before the anticipated 3rd wave.“Unfortunately, it looks like people are not ready to pay even the subsidized charges. Moreover, NMC is having problems ensuring consistent supply to handle the overwhelming crowd for free vaccination in their centres. In such a scenario, NMC should ideally approach all private centres, who are flush with vaccines, and give them the option to offload their vaccine stock to them at purchase price,” Dr Marar said.He added, “This will be a win-win situation for all as it would be grave injustice and national loss if precious vaccines having only 9-month shelf life available at private centers expires. It should rather be used judiciously for needy citizens at NMC centres.”The VHA convener suggested that NMC can even pay for the vaccine as per purchase rates to private hospitals and citizens can be asked to pay only Rs150 as vaccination charges to all private hospitals. “This will add to NMC list of vaccination centres and give a big push to the drive as many will be ready to pay Rs150 rather than Rs780. This system was successfully followed during Phase 2 of vaccination drive.”BOXVaccination in cityTotal | 15.96lakhGovt centres | 14.83lakhPrivate | 1.12lakhVaccination of entire Nagpur districtTotal | 28.70 lakhFirst dose | 21.11 lakhSecond dose | 7.59lakhMonday’s data for cityGovt | 11,315Pvt | 737||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-takers-for-paid-vax-pvt-hosps-ask-nmc-to-buy-their-stock-for-use-at-free-centres/articleshow/85573594.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Lucknow||‘Realisation curriculum’ in 150 Uttar Pradesh schools from next session||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh government is set to introduce a ‘realisation curriculum’, as a pilot project in at least 150 schools across 15 districts from academic session 2022-23. In July 2018, Delhi government had launched the happiness curriculum. It has been renamed as ‘realisation curriculum’ in UP and will be implemented in primary (from classes 1 to 5) schools initially. The government has appointed a media expert, Saurabh Malviya, as a nodal officer for the project. Malviya has been entrusted with the task of getting teachers on-board for a brainstorming session (to be held this week), organising a physical workshop and selecting a core team comprising 30 best brains who will finalise the draft of the realisation curriculum. The contents will be finalised by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) before textbooks are printed, said an officer. The curriculum will be implemented in Varanasi, Deoria, Gorakhpur, Siddharthnagar, Prayagraj, Amethi, Ayodhya, Lucknow, Moradabad, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Agra, Mathura, Jhansi and Chitrakoot from academic session 2022-23. “Like any other subject, students will have a realisation period every day. Much like getting well-versed in subjects like English, mathematics or history, students also need to lead a happy and peaceful life. This realisation curriculum is just a stepping stone towards establishing a better, positive and vibrant society,” said an officer associated with the project. To make the project successful, the government has also roped in Shravan Kumar Shukla, a UP government school teacher from Gorakhpur, who was the core member of the happiness curriculum in Delhi. He will make a presentation before the teachers during the brainstorming session scheduled later this week. In February 2020, Shukla’s happiness curriculum got him international acclaim when the then-US First Lady Melania Trump visited a happiness class in Delhi and spent time with children. Shukla, who was on deputation to Delhi since 2016 to develop the concept, returned to his home state this January. Shukla said the purpose to launch the curriculum in UP was to support students in their journey to sustainable happiness through engagement in meaningful and reflective stories and activities. “Happiness is key to all relationships. Since childhood, I have believed that all human beings share similar values. Sadly, instead of nourishing those human values, the education system today has put happiness thoughts on the backburner,” Shukla told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/realisation-curriculum-in-150-up-schools-from-next-session/articleshow/85578365.cms||Isha Jain

I also invest in research, which precedes the innovation step, because I believe that if you want to create a knowledge economy, the knowledge creation and the ownership of the knowledge is equally important,” Gopalakrishnan, who is the chairman of the CII Centre of Excellence for Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Start-ups (CIES), said during a masterclass. The master class built the case for startups as an investment option for investors in India. Currently, the investors comprising Indian family offices, HNIs (high net worth individuals) and UHNIs (Ultra high net worth individuals) tend to invest in conventional asset classes like stocks, real estate and gold. By 2025, India is expected to have more than 10,000 ultra-rich individuals with an estimated wealth worth $700 billion.

There have been several incidents of seized and recovered valuables getting misplaced, misappropriated and stolen from the police station.City police chief Amitesh Kumar said that a meeting was convened in October last year over the issue. “An audit and scrutiny of all the seized and recovered properties across the police stations was conducted. The constables in-charge of seized and recovered properties and senior police inspectors were told that instead of storing the materials at police station they must hand them over to citizens,” said the CP. The top cop said that zonal DCPs were asked to coordinate and supervise the process.Valuables worth over Rs9.49 crore, recovered in 645 cases, were returned under the supervision of zonal DCP Neelotpal, followed by properties worth more than Rs 4 crore through zonal DCP Noorul Hasan.Kumar said that the police station officers were asked to collect court orders and complete legal formalities within short time without bothering the citizens concerned. “Police stations many times traced the owners to give them back their valuables,” he said. The CP further said that two camps were organized where more then 100 mobile phones were returned. “Priority was given to returning recovered gold, followed by the vehicles and other valuables,” he said.In another initiative, Kumar said that 2,043 vehicles parked at the different police stations for more than 20 years were also auctioned after no claimants came forward. “We have deposited more than Rs1 crore in the government treasury by auctioning these vehicles,” said the CP.Police also disposed of 21,822 offences and accidental death cases in the last 11 months from September 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-hand-over-recovered-properties-worth-over-rs24cr-to-citizens/articleshow/85573656.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Delhi||Delhi's pollution fight: All you need to know about country's first smog tower||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated a 24-metre-high anti-smog tower at Connaught Place on Monday. It is believed to be able to clean up to 1,000 cubic metres of air every second and render around a square kilometre more breathable.  The CM said IIT Bombay and IIT Delhi, both collaborators in the project, will carry out studies to determine the efficacy of the tower in curbing PM10 and PM2.5 pollution. Photos: Delhi gets India's first smog towerThe tower, with Tata Projects Limited, NBCC and University of Minnesota as the other collaborators, is powered by 40 fans and consists of over 5,000 filters. While smaller “anti-smog” towers were installed in the past in Lajpat Nagar, Krishna Nagar and Gandhi Nagar, the one at Connaught Place is the largest prototype. “This is a big step in Delhi government’s fight against air pollution,” said Kejriwal, while inaugurating the installation. “Supported by technology from USA never seen before in India, this anti-smog tower is the first of its kind in the country. The tower will be able to clean 1,000 cubic metres of air per second and it is expected that the area will see a rapid change in the quality of air because of the tower.” He said that once the two IITs analysed data and submitted a report on the pilot project’s effectiveness and if the result prove satisfactory, the model could be replicated in other parts of Delhi. Tata Projects erected the anti-smog tower, with NBCC providing consultancy. The IITs and Minnesota University, which installed a similar tower in China, provided expertise for the Rs 20-crore project. Kejriwal said the efforts of Delhi government had brought down the city’s annual average PM10 concentration from 324ppm in 2014 to 187ppm this year and PM2.5 level from 149ppm in 2014 to 101ppm in 2021. Ratings below 100ppm for PM10 and 60ppm for PM2.5 are considered acceptable. The CM said he will receive reports of the performance of the tower every month. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai, present at the inauguration, said the state government was committed to fighting pollution. “Once the monsoon season is over, the tower will function at full capacity and then experts from IIT-D and IIT-B will begin their research on its efficacy,” said Rai. Experts, however, argue against the concept of anti-smog towers, asking instead for the funds to be used to boost public transport or to reduce the sources of pollution. Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, pointed out that there was no scientific evidence even abroad on smog towers being a viable solution to filtering poor outside air. “The effectiveness of the smog tower should be analysed rigorously by the state government and the data should be made publica,” said Ganguly. “Only once evidence on usefulness is available should the state and other parts of the country consider investing in more such towers.” Ganguly said that rather than investing in unproven technologies, Delhi had to set an example by redirecting the funds to strengthen the monitoring of construction sites and industrial units, improving waste management in the city and prioritising health risk communications. There were similar thoughts expressed by Santosh Harish of the Centre for Policy Research. He said the costs incurred in smog towers were better spent in cutting emissions at source. Ronak Sutaria, CEO, Respirer Living Sciences, noted that there were expenses involved not just in erecting the tower, but also running it. A low-power 2-metre industrial fan generally consumes 24 kilowatt per hour of energy, meaning each is roughly like a 24-tonne air conditioner, Sutaria said. “There are 40 fans running in the smog tower,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/40-fans-5k-filters-24m-high-smog-tower-opens-in-cp/articleshow/85573665.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Police identified him as A Saddam Hussain of RP Colony at Chittur in Palakkad. “Saddam, who reached Tirupur a few days ago, wanted to go home. The penniless man stole a motorcycle from Dharapuram bus stand and headed towards Palakkad on Saturday. But it ran out of fuel at Unjavelampatti near Pollachi. From there, he hitched rides to reach Anaimalai on Saturday night. He noticed an auto owned by L Zaheer Hussain of Market North Street and stole it. He headed towards Pollachi and gave ride to people on the way. He earned Rs 250, but spent it on food. He then decided to visit Aliyar Dam, but was intercepted by a police team,” Anaimalai police sub-inspector Selvaraj said.

---||Lucknow||Absence of MSY, Akhilesh in last rites triggers row||Lucknow: Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and national president Akhilesh Yadav may have ‘missed’ visiting the family of former chief minister Kalyan Singh to offer their condolences on the BJP veteran’s death, but the development triggered politics around their ‘absence’. Attacking the SP leadership on the issue, BJP MP from Kannauj, Subrat Pathak, said their absence reflected their ‘Talibani’ mentality. According to political observers, the absence of Mulayam and Akhilesh got more ‘conspicuous’ as Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati visited Kalyan Singh’s family and paid floral tribute to the veteran leader. Samajwadi Party, however, dismissed the issue as an unnecessary controversy accusing the BJP of making an ‘event’ out of something as serious as the demise of a senior and respected leader. SP insiders said Akhilesh was in Saifai on Saturday evening when Kalyan Singh was pronounced dead by doctors at SGPGI in Lucknow where he was undergoing treatment for quite some time. “The SP chief expressed his heartfelt condolences on Twitter minutes after the news came in. He later spoke to Kalyan Singh’s son, Rajveer, over the phone as well. He is about to visit him personally soon,” said a well-informed senior SP leader. “By the time the SP chief returned to Lucknow on Sunday after attending his pre-scheduled engagements in Saifai, Kalyan Singh’s mortal remains had been flown to his hometown in Aligarh,” he added. Political observers are of the view that the SP leadership’s failure in making it to the funeral could hardly have any political angle. “Mulayam had joined hands with Kalyan Singh when the latter had quit the BJP and later parted ways. It is highly unlikely that political differences were the reasons that prompted Mulayam and Akhilesh to distance themselves,” a political observer said. Addressing a press conference in Lucknow in 2016, years after Mulayam and Kalyan had parted ways, the SP patriarch had publicly admitted that he had “good relations” with Kalyan. According to sources in the SP, office-bearers of the party’s district unit had been directed to attend the last rites of Kalyan Singh in Aligarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/absence-of-msy-akhilesh-in-last-rites-triggers-row/articleshow/85578405.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Delhi||Afghans’ tearful plea: Give us refugee status||New Delhi: Lahore Khan left Afghanistan after being brutally assaulted by the Taliban around eight years ago. The militants shot dead Khan’s employer, a government contractor, and stabbed Khan, who worked as a driver, numerous times. Some villagers found him and took him to hospital. He then came to Delhi for treatment and his family later joined him in India. On Monday, the former driver was among the hundreds of Afghans demonstrating in front of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees demanding refugee status and a support letter for resettlement in countries that have announced they would accept refugees from the embattled country. “Though I am safe in Delhi, the future of my nine-member family is uncertain,” said Khan, who now earns daily wages as a labourer. Also raising her voice for a more secure tomorrow was Khatera Shakija, a single mother of an 11-year-old girl. They have been living in Delhi for a decade. “Around 18 years ago, my father and some neighbours were dragged out and shot dead. When my husband was killed in a bomb explosion, I decided to come to India to ensure a better life for my daughter,” said Shakija. She lost her job at a catering service when it shut down two years ago and ever since the mother and daughter have been struggling to survive.Whatever financial help the refugees were getting from their relatives or businesses back home has dried up after the Taliban takeover. “We had given our house on rent to tenants in Kabul and were surviving on the monthly amount. Now, our house has been captured by the Taliban and none in my family has a job in Delhi,” said Tamanna, 22, who came to India around six years ago. She said UNHCR had rejected their applications for refugee status. “If we are denied a second time, we fear deportation to Afghanistan,” she mumbled.Nargis Sirat’s family too hasn’t got refugee status in the four years they have been in the city. “We cannot return to Afghanistan,” she despaired. “The militants are forcing young girls to marry them and any opposition is met with their families being tortured and killed.” Cloth merchant Zulmi Hakami left Afghanistan because the militants were pressuring his two sons to join them. “We have nothing here,” he said with a blank expression.Angry at Mohammad Umar’s eldest son, Nakeebullah, working with the US Special Forces, the Taliban shot dead his second son, Izzatullah, on Eid last year in Paghman. A frightened Umar, 70, brought his 13 family members, including grandchildren, to Delhi a year ago, leaving behind their house and properties. For a year now, the third son, a car mechanic, has failed to find any job. Said the old man, “We lacked nothing, but are impoverished refugees now. Izzatullah’s wife and his two children live with us. My wife and I both are ailing. How can we survive without jobs?” Umar wants UNHCR to relocate his family to another country for a better future. Among those who wished similarly to go abroad was eight-year-old Mohammad Ramin, who poignantly said he had to reach the United States so he could have a future.Ahmad Gia Ghani, head of Afghan Solidarity Committee, which organised the day-long protest, said, “The asylum seekers should be recognised as refugees. We want UNHCR and its partners to fully cover essential living costs due to the cessation of all financial sources the Afghan refugees depended on. UNHCR must provide them with support letters to embassies of countries now admitting Afghan refugees.” The committee said the protest would continue though Monday night and would be called off only after the UNHCR responded.A UNHCR official told TOI, “Transferring refugees from an asylum country to another state that has agreed to admit them and ultimately grant them permanent residence depends on a series of interviews and checks and clearances. This takes time, often up to several years. Less than 1% of refugees are currently resettled globally due to the limited opportunities. So, only the most vulnerable refugees can be prioritised for resettlement.” The official added, “We are scaling up our support for Afghan refugees and asylum- seekers. The programme for registered vulnerable individuals includes food, cash assistance, education and psychosocial aid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/afghans-tearful-plea-give-us-refugee-status/articleshow/85573703.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 75,000 pending RTI pleas and plaints as 4 benches headless||PUNE: Nearly 75,000 Right to Information (RTI) appeals and complaints are pending in Maharashtra as the government is yet to appoint commissioners for Nashik, Pune, Nagpur and Amravati, activists said. As per the data on the state information commission’s website, the number of pending complaints and second appeals was already over 74,240 for the eight benches till May this year. The activists have appealed to the government to implement the Act in letter and spirit. According to the data, 63,045 pending appeals have been uploaded on the website of which the Pune bench has the largest pendency of 16,961, followed by Aurangabad with 10,919. Altogether 11,195 complaints are pending, with the Mumbai bench registering a pendency of 1,768 complaints. Former chief information commissioner (CIC) Shailesh Gandhi, also an RTI activist, said that the RTI seems to be just an Act on paper with hardly any implementation because of such huge pendency in the state. “We expect the commission to draw up a plan showing how with the 11 commissioners could meet the directives of the high court in two years’ time,” Gandhi said. “If they are not given adequate resources, they should demand these from the government. The responsibility of meeting the directives of law is with them.” While the information commissioner’s (IC) post in Nashik has been vacant since February 2019, Pune has not had an IC since November 2018, and Nagpur since June 2018. With the recent retirement of the Amravati commissioner, another post has fallen vacant. Unlike in other states, the IC posts in Maharashtra have been created as per geographical zones. Thus, IC posts have been created for Mumbai, Brihanmumbai, Konkan, Nashik, Amaravati, Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad. State CIC Sumit Mullick told TOI that officials are trying to hear as many cases as possible online and offline. “As of now, we have only four information commissioners and if all the 11 required posts are filled, we should be able to speed up hearing of cases. More cases are being filed daily, so obviously the numbers are increasing,” he added. Sources in the state government said that they had invited applications for the IC posts, but changes in some rules have delayed the appointments. The search committee is expected to shortlist the names and sent them to the chief minister-led committee for appointment, as per the norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-75000-pending-rti-pleas-and-plaints-as-4-benches-headless/articleshow/85578414.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Kolhapur||15 Covid facilities in Nashik’s rural hospitals temporarily shut||Nashik: With the constant drop in Covid cases in rural Nashik, the district health department has temporarily closed 15 of the 24 dedicated Covid health centres (DCHCs), that were converted into DCHCs during the second wave. The district administration had converted 24 rural hospitals into DCHCs to accommodate the rising number of patients during the second wave. However, since the end of May, the number of patients being admitted to these facilities has been consistently reducing so the decision of closing down the DCHC and taking non-Covid patients has begun in a phased manner. Resident medical officer Prashant Khaire said of the 28 rural hospitals, 24 were converted into DCHC after the spike in the Covid cases from March. However as cases began to drop from June, DCHCs were also closed down in a phased manner. As of now, nine rural hospitals of Chandwad, Peth, Wani, Pimpalgaon, Sinnar, Yeola, Manmad, Malegaon and Dang Saundane are operating as DCHCs. This is, however, a temporary arrangement, said the medical officials. If cases start to increase the rural hospitals will again be converted into DCHC to accommodate the Covid patients. Various measures are being taken by the district administration keeping in mind the third wave, which is predicted to affect children more. Meanwhile, the district Covid hospital has around 40 patients admitted there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/15-covid-facilities-in-nashiks-rural-hospitals-temporarily-shut/articleshow/85571168.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Nagpur||Health workers in Vidarbha keen to get booster dose||Nagpur: As experts world over talk about the third or booster dose of Covid vaccine, some health workers in the city said they too are keen to get it now.Many doctors and health workers, who got second shot of Covishield or Covaxin in February, have already completed six months from their last shot and they think booster dose will provide additional protection. “My last dose was in February. So, the six-month period has elapsed,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. “There is no harm in taking booster dose. But the problem is limited supply and a lot of people haven’t received even the first shot in the country,” he added.However, many countries are recommending booster dose to certain populations having co-morbid conditions. Israel has started giving Covid booster shots to all above 50. Russia has already launched the booster dose. Germany, France and the UK will start administering booster doses in September. Soon, India will also have to launch the booster-dose-related policy, said doctors.“I would not call it a booster dose. The primary series itself should have 3 doses like in hepatitis-B vaccine,” said Dr Shinde. “Booster dose will provide us better immunity against Delta. Now onwards, Delta will be the dominant strain in the world,” he concluded. Epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte said third dose can be offered to those who had never contracted natural infection during the course of two waves. “Also, we can conduct antibody test and then decide where to give the booster or not. This is very much possible in the case of health workers, at least,” he said. Nearly 7,000 employees of Serum Institute of India have already received booster doses. SII chairman and managing director Dr Cyrus Poonawalla has said that taking a booster dose of Covishield is desirable. “I think, those who worked in the Covid wards during the last two waves and set to work in the projected third wave should have additional protection. Health workers should be allowed to get a booster soon,” said Dr Avni Kundalkar, a resident doctor. As the paid vaccine is now available, many non-medicos, who will complete six months post-vaccination by October-November, can also demand the booster dose. At least paid the third dose is likely to be a reality by December in India.The Action Plan* Presently, booster shots of vaccines are administered in many viral infections like flu, tetanus, diphtheria* Covid-19 also being a viral infection, doctors think there is no harm in taking booster dose* Initially, those who have completed six months after getting second shot can go for boosters* As doctors/health workers were first to get vaccine in India, they will be first to get boosters too * Those who never got infected during last two waves should get priority for booster dose* Israel is giving boosters to 50+ population, several other countries recommended it to vulnerable people* In India, booster dose can be a reality in near future, but vaccine shortage is major obstacle||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/health-workers-in-vidarbha-keen-to-get-booster-dose/articleshow/85573681.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

According to a forest officer, the elephant came to raid the potato crop around 4am on the day. “When it attempted to damage the fence with its truck, the animal touched the live wires and got electrocuted.” When the villagers spotted the carcass of the elephant, they alerted forest officers, who rushed to the spot and buried the same in the forest area after performing autopsy. “We have registered a case against the land owner - 55-year-old M James, of Jorahosur village near Jeerahalli - for erecting the electric fence without obtaining permission from the concerned officials and arrested him,” the officer said. Pointing out that the farmland was located close to STR, the officer said James had drawn a line from the domestic electric supply to power the fence. “He would power the fence at night and disconnect the line during the day. He has been doing it for several months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/illegal-electric-fence-claims-elephants-life/articleshow/85576147.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Maharashtra: First-year junior college registrations drop by 25,000; CET muddle to blame||PUNE: Fewer applications have been filed this year for admission to first-year junior college despite the promising SSC results. Official data indicates that 25,000 fewer students registered for admissions to junior colleges this year compared to last year. The last date for filing applications was August 22 and the first merit list is set to be announced on August 27. At least 77,077 students registered on the portal for admission. Meena Shendkar, joint deputy director of education, said that about 8,000-10,000 students backed out even after registration. “As a result, it looks like there will be enough options for the students and many vacant seats,” said Shendkar. Online admission for FYJC is conducted in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad, Mumbai, Amravati, Nashik and Nagpur while in other parts of Maharashtra the process is offline. By the end of the last date for registration this year, over 77,000 registered and 68,759 students had locked their profiles. Last year, about 1.02 lakh students had registered for the admission process and nearly 87,000 candidates had filled and locked the forms. At the end of the final admission round last year, about 70,000 students had confirmed their admissions and 36,000 seats were vacant. Ramesh Patole, principal of an SSC board school in Pune, said registrations are low and vacancies may rise. “The ITI and diploma admissions started soon after the SSC results were declared and it was announced that admissions will be based on SSC marks; majority of the students applied there. At that time, the government had announced a common entrance test for FYJC admissions so students preferred courses where admissions were based only on SSC marks. This looks like the main reason for the drop in registrations,” said Patole. Earlier, the CET had been scheduled for August 21 Patole added that the CET was scrapped on August 10 after the Bombay high court termed it a “gross injustice”. The court further directed the state government to immediately start the admission process on the basis of students’ SSC scores and complete the process in six weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fyjc-registrations-drop-by-25k-cet-muddle-to-blame/articleshow/85576169.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Shiv Sainiks took out a protest march here on Tuesday and slapped the effigy of Rane with chappals and shoes to express their anger over his comments against Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. In a counter-move, BJP also staged protests to flay the arrest of Rane. District chief of Shiv Sena, Sandeep Girhe, gathered his supporters at Ramnagar office and took out a protest march up to Old Warora Naka Square. The protesters carried ‘hens’ in their hands and shouted slogans against Rane. The activists slapped effigy of Rane with sandals to express their dissent. Strong police force was deployed at the square to deal with the situation. Cops immediately seized the effigy before agitators could set it on fire. Later, a Shiv Sena delegation submitted a memorandum to SP Arvind Salve in this regard. Meanwhile, BJP mayor Rakhi Kancharlawar and city president Dr Mangesh Gulwade led protests at Gandhi Chowk against the state government for arresting the Union minister Rane. Dr Gulwade charged Maha Vikas Aghadi government with taking such steps to cover-up its failure on all fronts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rane-remarks-fuel-sena-protests-in-chanda-bjp-retaliates/articleshow/85596478.cms||Mazhar Ali

The two divisions together account for 48% of total active cases in the city. At present, there are total 494 active cases in the city, of which, 236 are from these two divisions. The number of active cases in Cidco has dropped from 162 cases around a month back to 123 active cases at present, while the number of active cases in Panchavati has dropped from 150 to 113 cases. Medical superintendent of the Nashik Municipal Corporation Bapusaheb Nagargoje said the infectivity of the coronavirus has reduced and the infections have become mild. This has led to a significant drop in new cases in the last one month and consequently, the active cases have reduced too. “These two divisions are densely populated as compared with the four other divisions. Hence, maximum cases of Covid-19 were found in these two divisions during the first and the second wave of the Covid-19,” said Nagargoje. “Though the number of Covid-19 cases has dropped significantly in the last month, there is still a projection of the third wave of the pandemic in next few months. Hence, people need to follow the Covid appropriate behaviour,” said Nagargoje. The city had only 500 active cases by the first week of February this year. But the number of new cases began increasing from the second week of February and it climbed further in March and April. The number of active patients had gone up to 28,000 cases on April 23. Even then, around 48% of the total active cases were from Cidco and Panchavati divisions. The downward trend in new cases began in the month of May. Now, the number of new cases has dropped significantly across all six divisions of the NMC. It has led to relaxations in the restrictions on public movement. Health officials have said that Covid-appropriate behaviour must be followed by all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/active-case-tally-drops-in-2-worst-hit-nashik-divisions/articleshow/85571226.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Exam fever hits teachers in Maharashtra, many reluctant to take mandatory test||MUMBAI: It is not just students who feel anxious about their tests. The exam anxiety has hit teachers too, many of whom are reluctant to take the compulsory one-time test to be eligible to continue teaching in their schools. While the registration process for the offline Maharashtra Teachers Eligibility Test (MAHATET) for aspiring and existing teachers of class I to VIII is on till August 25, not many want to take the test. School principals and management are urging teachers to write the test and have warned them of dismissal from service if they don’t. The test is mandatory across the country under the Right To Education Act. TimesViewThe Teachers Eligibility Test is mandatory under the RTE Act. Despite having qualifications like DEd and BEd, less than 7% teachers in the state have managed to clear it. It is time the state has a well-defined syllabus. To test an aspiring teacher’s knowledge and skill through a standardised test is understandable. It’s unfair that experienced teachers too have to prove their skills.Teachers who joined work post-September 3, 2010, have to take the test. However, those who joined before the set date are exempted. While states have their own tests, teachers can even take the Central Teachers Eligibility Test (CTET). Teachers are expected to take the test within two years of joining work. The exam is now slated for October 10. Teachers of class I-V will take paper 1 and teachers of class VI to VIII will take paper 2. Teachers can also take both the tests to be eligible to teach in primary and secondary sections. The passing mark is 60% for general category and 55% for reserved categories. Teachers in private schools have been warned of termination of services if they do not take the test. “We have been asking our teachers to appear for the tests. As the pass percentage is very low, teachers are jittery,” said a principal. In some schools, teachers on the verge of retirement will also have to take the test to get the retirement benefits. “There are teachers who have joined our school after 2010. Though they have vast teaching experience, technically they have to pass the TET,” explained a principal. The TET exam conducted by the state since 2013 has seen a pass percentage of not more than 7%. Teachers say there is no set syllabus for the TET. But school managements want teachers to take TET as it raises the points when the school is graded by the state. Teachers not wanting to take the exams are being asked to give in writing that they are untrained and unqualified teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/exam-fever-hits-teachers-in-mrashtra-many-reluctant-to-take-mandatory-test/articleshow/85578444.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Delhi||Hand over keys of Markaz residential area: HC to police||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday ordered Delhi Police to hand over the keys of the residential portion of the sealed Nizamuddin Markaz to its occupants, saying there is no order of sealing or seizure of the premises.The premises were locked by the authorities in the wake of an FIR in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat congregation held there last year.Justice Yogesh Khanna granted partial relief to Khadija, the mother of Jamaat leader Maulana Saad, directing that the keys be handed over to her within two days and clarified that for now, the occupants cannot enter any non-residential portion of the property.“We cannot allow people to reside in guesthouses or any other place other than their own house,” said the judge who further stated that “preservation of site” pursuant to a criminal proceeding did not mean locking up the place.“What is this? What is Section 60 (of Evidence Act on oral evidence), Section 310 (Code of Criminal Procedure on local inspection)? What sections have you put? Preserving a site does not mean you lock it. You take photos and move from the site. What was recovered? Case was only that people were residing there,” the court observed while issuing notice on the plea.The senior citizen has challenged a trial court order denying access to her residence and sought a status report from the police on the existence of any order on the locking of the residential premises. The high court noted that the petitioner was living in the premises with eleven family members and said that they could not be allowed to stay in guesthouses.Senior advocate Rebecca John, appearing for the petitioner, said that these sections were not applicable to the present case and that her client’s residence could not be snatched away. She contended that Section 310 gave no power to the police to lock up a residence.The plea submitted that neither the petitioner nor her family is aware of any orders made with regard to sealing of the property.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Schools and colleges to reopen from September 1||HYDERABAD: After a gap of nearly one-and-a-half-year, schools and colleges are set to reopen in Telangana from September 1. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday directed officials to reopen all government and private educational institutions from kindergarten to postgraduate level (KG to PG) and anganwadi centres in the state from the first of September. The CM also directed medical and health, municipal administration, panchayat raj and rural development officials to sanitise all educational institutions and hostels in villages, mandals, districts, towns and the state capital by August 30. The education department will come out with guidelines in a day or two on the functioning of schools and also issue clarity on whether the offline classes are mandatory or the online classes would continue, leaving the option to the parents to take a call. Due to the pandemic, the educational institutions had remained closed since March 2020. Except for reopening briefly in February 2021, the institutions were shut down again in March this year following a surge in Covid-19 cases. However, online classes were being held to ensure that the academic year was not lost. The CM took the decision at a review meeting after medical and health department officials submitted a report that the pandemic was very much under control in the state. “Keeping in view of various factors and after a detailed discussion at the meeting, the government has decided to reopen the educational institutions from September 1 after taking measures for the safety of students,” the CM said.  Zilla parishad and mandal parishad chairpersons will inspect the educational institutions and submit a report on sanitation, KCR said. At the meeting, the CM said the education sector in the state was in the doldrums due to closure of institutions. Apart from students and parents, the fate of teachers of private schools and affiliated institutions remained uncertain.  Measures taken by various state governments which reopened educational institutions were also discussed at the meeting. The health officials pointed out at the meeting that due to prolonged closure of educational institutions, there was a rise in cases of psychological (mental) stress among students. “It is the responsibility of municipal administration and panchayat raj departments to take up sanitation in government schools. Even sarpanches and municipal chairpersons should ensure cleaning and sanitisation of water tanks, classrooms and washrooms in the government educational institutions,” KCR said. The high-level meeting was attended by ministers, chief secretary, advisors to the government and senior officials of various departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/schools-and-colleges-in-state-to-reopen-on-sept-1/articleshow/85579096.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Kolkata||Colleges, universities across Kolkata allow final-year students to return books to libraries for clearance certificate||KOLKATA: Colleges and universities across the city have started allowing students limited access to libraries and laboratories. For the time being, final-year students who have completed their final examinations have been directed to return all books and obtain library clearance, which is a prerequisite for awarding the mark sheet or final certificate from the affiliating university. The authorities have allotted students specific dates and time to return their books and obtain the clearance certificate. Jadavpur University has given time till August 31 to final-year students to obtain their library clearance certificate. “It is important to obtain the certificate as only then, will the final passout certificate of the university will be awarded. Once this stage is cleared, we might think of starting lending books, following all Covid-safety guidelines. But we have to obtain permission from the education department,” said an official at Jadavpur University. On-campus activities across Bengal have been suspended since March 2020 after the pandemic broke out and soon, the education system shifted online. Earlier this year, the government allowed colleges and universities to resume limited on-campus activities but it had to be suspended as the second wave struck. The library at Presidency University is currently opening every Wednesday so that students can return books. “Students are allowed to return library books from the lawn of Derozio Hall from 11.30am to 2 pm on Wednesdays. Health protocol to combat Covid 19 is being strictly followed,” said an official at Presidency University. Calcutta University has kept the library open since August16 for all final-semester postgraduate students to return their books and obtain clearance certificate. “The students can come between noon and 4pm and return the books. We are not charging any late fee amid the pandemic, but the clearance certificate is mandatory to get the results,” said a professor. Universities are also allowing research scholars and some PG students to use some laboratory facilities, but they have not been “opened officially”. A section of students at Calcutta University, Jadavpur University and Presidency University have been demanding that the government allow students to use libraries and labs on the campuses. “How are science students expected to study without using the labs? They cannot even borrow books for reference. The education department must allow students to use these facilities,” said Debayan Dey, a second-year student at Jadavpur University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-univs-allow-final-yr-students-to-return-books-to-libraries-for-clearance-cert/articleshow/85576198.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Sources said the evidence on record suggested at least two accused might have sexually assaulted the girl, while the othershelped cremate her secretly.The cops are likely to charge the accused men with gang rape, kidnapping, murder and destruction of evidence.The internet history of one of the accused showed extensive surfing of pornography, a senior officer said adding that a forensic advice was awaited on whether he specifically watched child pornography. The accused reportedly confessed during a forensic psychology examination that they had shown an adult clipping to the girl on their mobile phone.Cops will rely on DNA analysis apart from forensic examination report of the water cooler that showed no signs of short circuit.On August 1, the girl had left her home at around 5.30 pm to fetch water from a nearby water cooler at the cremation ground. Around 6 pm, one of the accused told the girl’s mother that she was electrocuted after coming in contact with the water cooler and had died soon after. The accused also told the mother that involving the police would complicate matters and that the family should cremate the child’s body without delay.However, the mother raised an alarm and called for help after the girl was almost cremated. Over 200 villagers gathered at the crematorium and handed the accused over to the police. Delhi Police registered a case against the four accused on the basis of the minor girl’s mother’s statement. She alleged that her daughter was raped, murdered and cremated without the family’s consent.The police had earlier registered a case of electrocution, but based on the statement of the victim’s mother, the charges of rape were added in the FIR. Four people, including the priest, were arrested.The Union home ministry had earlier reviewed the case and said that the chargesheet would be filed within a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/9-yr-olds-murder-cops-to-chargesheet-4/articleshow/85573755.cms||---

---||Lucknow||When Kalyan Singh asked ‘King Lear ki kya kahani hai?’||LUCKNOW: Mai Kalyan Singh bol raha hoon.” The baritone on the other end of the landline phone was unmistakable. No doubt, it was him. But still, unbelievable. After all, no chief minister calls up an unknown newspaper desk hand early in the morning. That was the last week of September 1999. Mobile phones had arrived but still beyond one’s reach.  I stood holding the telephone receiver, not sure what to say. He solved my problem. “Apki khabar ke liye dhanyawad (thanks for your report),” he said. I began to realise what was going on. He was talking about the reports I filed after an election trip with him to Rohilkhand region of Uttar Pradesh – Bareilly, Kheri and Rampur.  Lok Sabha polls were just a month away and I had been assigned the task of accompanying UP chief minister Kalyan Singh on his chopper tour. The then TOI-Lucknow editor had an unorthodox way of deploying his reporters. Any other editor would hardly have thought of sending the junior-most sport desk sub-editor on a campaign trail with the CM.  That our chopper, on way back, had to force-land between two farm fields in Hardoi due to bad weather is a different long story. But what’s relevant here is that I covered his four rallies and wrote two reports – one on the rallies and the other on our narrow escape – which had appeared in the newspaper a day earlier.  “He probably liked it,” I thought. But so many reporters accompany him and write about election rallies. Does the CM call each one of them?  Did he call me to encourage as I was too young a reporter to accompany a CM on an election tour?  I was grappling with random thoughts while he was still on the call.  “Ye King Lear ki kya kahani hai (What’s the story of King Lear?),” he suddenly asked. He was referring to my story -- ‘King Lear continues to haunt Kalyan Singh’ -- which appeared that day (a day after the rally reports) and was based on his informal conversation with me during the day-long tour.  This story was not on my menu. It took birth after my editor asked about the trip and whether I could strike a conversation with the CM.  That was the time Kalyan’s ties with BJP’s central leadership had started straining. He believed that a section of UP BJP leaders was conspiring against him and trying to tarnish his image. He also appeared peeved by the way the Central leadership was treating its tallest leader in the state.  He was full of angst and talked a lot about it, albeit to a rookie reporter. “How did he sound?” the editor asked.  “Bitter and helpless,” I said and then gave a few glimpses of Kalyan’s state of mind.  “Write it,” he advised.  “But it’s all informal conversation. He might not like it,” I tried to reason.  “We will find a way to present it. He won’t be quoted,” he said.  So, I started delving into my memory. Since Kalyan was talking casually, I didn’t find it appropriate to take notes.  The story that I wrote was about his resentment against his own top leaders, of course, by ascribing ‘people close to him’ and how it might impact BJP’s performance in the Lok Sabha elections.  The King Lear analogy, however, was not mine. It was my editor who did it while editing. When he showed me the final copy, I found it outstanding. So, it appeared the next day as front page flyer in TOI, Lucknow, and pushed the protagonist to reach out to me asking about the King Lear’s story (The CM office had asked for my telephone number from our chief of bureau, I came to know later).  Although he was asking me, I was sure the CM had already discussed the story with his staff and the comparison with the tragic hero had upset him. But, still I gathered courage and tried to make it as simple as possible.  “It’s the story of a king who is betrayed by his own people and loses his kingdom,” I said. The effort here was also to justify the headline of my report.  “Ekdum sahi. Aapne bilkul theek likha (What you have written is absolutely right),” he said emphatically, ending my trepidation, and hung up after thanking me again.  Two month later, in November 1999, he was removed as the UP chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/when-kalyan-asked-king-lear-ki-kya-kahani-hai/articleshow/85578473.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana number 1 in India in annual growth rate of own income||HYDERABAD: Telangana ranks first in the country with the highest average annual growth rate (AAGR) of state’s own income as per the latest data on economy of states from the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation. Currently, the state’s own annual income is Rs 66,688 crore and a growth rate of 11.52% since its formation in 2014. Odisha is second with AAGR of own income at 9.74%, Jharkhand is third (8.9%), UP fourth (8.6%) and neighbouring AP fifth (8.38%). Among the bigger states, Gujarat is last at 2.59%. Announcing the latest estimates from the Union government, state finance minister T Harish Rao stated on Monday that Telangana has seen a 90% increase in state income collection from 2014-15 to 2020-21. Telangana’s own income during the formation year (2014-15) was Rs 35,146 crore. “Many development-oriented policies, fiscal measures and welfare schemes that enhanced livelihoods, particularly in the agriculture sector, are the cause for the state’s steady growth in enhancing its own income,” he said. The finance minister said that Telangana’s superlative work can be gauged from the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) and income growth rate, which were the two major indicators of a state’s financial performance. Telangana’s growth rate overtook Karnataka’s in 2017-18 and it has outpaced the neighbour since then. “Telangana has earned the greatest yearly average growth in GSDP among all southern states at 11.7% post-2014-15,” he added. Harish Rao also dismissed criticism that the state was overburdened with debt. “We are one of the few states with a loan load that is considerably below the permissible limit of 25% imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act. We are at 22.83%,” the finance minister said. But many other large states have crossed this limit, including Andhra Pradesh, and have accepted loans in excess of 30%, surpassing the FRBM ceiling, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-no-1-in-country-in-annual-growth-rate-of-own-income/articleshow/85579108.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The victim was identified as Siva Pradeep, son of Eswaramoorthy of Kadaiyur. Eswaramoorthy and his brother Rakkiyappasamy own a marriage hall and rice mill at Kangeyam. They are constructing a food park at Veeracholapuram Pirivu. Siva, a BBA graduate who was taking care of the family business, often visited the construction site. “On Sunday around 1pm, the young man was returning home from the site with his driver Saddam Hussain when a seven-member gang in a car stopped them. Four of them introduced themselves as police personnel from Ramanathapuram district and asked Siva and Saddam to accompany them. The gang took the duo to Sirumalai in Dindigul district and contacted Eswaramoorthy on his phone. The miscreants demanded Rs 3 crore to free his son. They threatened to kill Siva if Eswaramoorthy informed police,” a police officer said. Following the gang’s instructions, Eswaramoorthy and Rakkiyappasamy handed over Rs 3 crore to the gang members on the Oddanchatram – Dindigul Road on Sunday night, and the gang released Siva and Saddam. After reaching Kangeyam, Siva approached police, who formed eight special teams to nab the kidnappers. “The teams collected CCTV footage from Sirumalai police check post and a hotel. We arrested Sakthivel, 37, Augustin, 45 and Balaji, 38, from Mattuthavani bus stand in Madurai on Monday morning and recovered Rs 1,69,50,000 from them. They were brought to Kangeyam police station. We arrested Basheer, 32, of Krishnagiri and recovered Rs 20.44 lakh from him,” said inspector general of police R Sudhakar. “Augustin, the mastermind behind the kidnapping, is facing a similar case at Othakadai police station in Madurai. We hope to arrest three more gang members and recover the remaining amount from them soon.” Sakthivel and Balaji, who worked as crane operators at the food park construction site, had told Augustin about the wealthy family, Tirupur district superintendent of police G Shashank Sai said. “The kidnappers stayed in rented rooms at Kangeyam to carry out a recce before executing their plan. They planned well, but police acted swiftly to arrest them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bizmans-22-year-old-son-abducted-freed-after-paying-rs-3-crore-ransom/articleshow/85576215.cms||A Subburaj

The number of patients recovering is on the rise,” he said. The district has so far witnessed 759 patients suffering from mucormycosis, of them, 638 have recovered so far. Treatment for the infection runs over 15 to 60 days and hence the numbers of active cases remain similar for a long period. A good number of people also had to undergo major surgeries. “We have performed surgeries on 493 people that required removal of eyes, nasal portion and others,” he said. As many as 400 patients suffering from the infection were from Nashik city limits and were treated in various hospitals. While 82 patients were treated in the SMBT Medical College, Igatpuri, 68 patients in Dr Vasantrao Pawar Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, Nashik, 55 in the civil hospital, 17 in General Hospital Malegaon and eight in dedicated Covid health centres. He said the infection usually affected the sinus cavities, brain or lungs and therefore can be quite common in people suffering or recovering from Covid “The infection is common among people with diabetes or those who are on immunosuppressant drugs, who have been given steroids or also undergoing chemotherapy, that weakens the body’s immunity. All such people should be vigilant against the infection,” said Khaire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-of-active-mucormycosis-cases-drops-to-41-in-dist/articleshow/85571291.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Firoz Shaikh (48) was arrested soon after he landed at Mumbai international airport from Dubai and handed over to the crime branch which had issued a lookout circular against him. The case pertains to a complaint lodged in 2019 by a Customs officer’s wife. The crime branch had recorded Rajput’s statement and he was a witness in the case. According to the complainant, she had got insurance money after her husband’s death. In 2014, a common friend introduced Ahmed Shaikh and his son Firoz Shaikh to her as builders. The Shaikhs said they had a project in Belgaum and promised her good returns if she invested Rs50 lakh. She paid them Rs 48.5 lakh for a three-year period. “As per an MoU with the Shaikhs, they were to give her three flats in the project if they failed to return the money. In 2016, they defaulted on payment,” said an officer. When she went to ask for her money, she was threatened with dire consequences.

As per guidelines of the state government issued regarding holding physical classes, schools will have to ensure that all Covid-related norms are being followed. Only 183 schools — including zilla parishad, government-aided and un-aided schools under the control of Education Officer (Secondary) — had started functioning on July 15, and since then the number of schools slowly started increasing. “Now, we have 429 schools holding physical classes,” Pushpavati Patil, ZP education officer, said. The number of schools jumped up from 379 during the past 15 days. “A large number of schools were seeking permission from the education department for starting schools. The schools have to get a nod from the parents (at least 70%) on allowing schools to function physically. Besides, the village schools committees, the gram sabha also has to pass a resolution allowing the schools to meet physically,” he added. Another education officer said the number of the children in schools was limited to 50 per cent. “The schools collectively have as many as 1.5 lakh students, out of which around 78,000 students attended the schools,” he said. According to the official, 14 schools had to be shut down as fresh Covid cases were detected in the villages, no schools have been closed from August 5. The education officers have warned the teachers and students against lowering their guard against Covid infection as there was a warning of third wave. Headmasters’ Association secretary SB Deshmukh has demanded physical classes for students from Std V to VII should also be started soon. “Now vaccine for children has been permitted by the central government. It should carry out vaccination of children on priority basis with the help of schools and open up the schools for normalcy at the earliest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/50-schools-in-rural-areas-holding-physical-classes/articleshow/85571277.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Pune||60% chance of below normal rain this year, says private forecaster||PUNE: Private forecaster Skymet on Monday downgraded its monsoon forecast and stated that there was a 60% chance of below normal rainfall this year for the entire rainy season. The forecaster stated that monsoon rain was likely to be 94% of the long period average (LPA) with an error margin of + or -4%. India’s monsoon LPA for the four-month rainy season period from June to September is 880.6mm. The national weather forecasting agency, India Meteorological Department (IMD), has not yet made any statement in the context. “We can’t make any comments right now. But another monsoon update can be expected by the end of August or beginning of September,” IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra told TOI. “The IMD has been providing a monsoon forecast every month,” he said. The IMD had in a press release at the beginning of August stated that rainfall over the country as a whole during the second half (August-September period) of the 2021 southwest monsoon season was most likely to be normal (95-105 % LPA) with a tendency to be on the positive side of the normal. It had said the monthly rainfall for August over the country as a whole was most likely to be normal (94-106 % of LPA). Skymet had on April 13 this year forecast monsoon 2021 to be “healthy normal” at 103% (with an error margin of +/- 5%) of LPA. The private agency stated that Gujarat, Rajasthan, Odisha, Kerala and the northeast India were likely to end up with deficient rain, while there were chances of a “drought” over Gujarat and west Rajasthan. The IMD had suspended the use of the word “drought” a few years ago, replacing the term with “deficient”. Skymet added that spatial distribution of rainfall over the rainfed areas of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh “has been adequate”. G P Sharma, president of Skymet Weather Services, told TOI, “We have been deliberating over the behaviour of monsoon 2021 since the last 10 days. It has been a visible trend that the monsoon has not been that active on many days. Every monsoon season is different from the previous years’. But this time, it has been a little more skewed. We have not seen so many ups and downs in the season in most years in the past as have been noticed in 2021. Monsoon has its own internal dynamics and the reasons for the subdued rain this season could only be broadly listed as of now. “ Jatin Singh, managing director, Skymet, said in a press statement: “The weakness in the monsoon could possibly be attributed to the prolonged negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in the Indian Ocean and extended break conditions in July and August. There is still no clear signal about the emergence of IOD in September.” On India’s monthly rainfall, Skymet stated that the rainfall in August was likely to be 80% of LPA (August LPA is 258.2 mm) and 100% of LPA in September (September LPA is 170.2 mm). India recorded an excess of 9.6% in its June rains. But the month of July began on a weak note, with a monsoon break till July 11. The month ended with below-normal rainfall for India with a -6.8% deficiency. Monsoon entered a break-like situation again in the first fortnight of August. Parts of central India recorded some rain after August 17 due to a low pressure system over the Bay of Bengal. But rainfall activity has now reduced over several parts of India, with monsoon rain being 9% deficient so far in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/60-chance-of-below-normal-rain-this-year-says-private-forecaster/articleshow/85576217.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Coimbatore||2 Bangladeshi nationals held for planning to incite communal clash||Erode: The Perundurai police arrested two Bangladeshi nationals on Monday on the charges of conspiring to create a communal clash between Hindus and Muslims. They have also launched a search for two other Bangladeshi nationals in connection with the case.The arrested were identified as N Mujam Mondal, 30, and N Ebadhul Ali, 22.The police launched an inquiry against the four after receiving a complaint from Mijamul Haji, 26, of Panikkampalayam near Perundurai on August 19. Haji is a consultant who supply construction workers to builders in the area. Perundurai police inspector A Thangam said, “Haji had said in his complaint that the four men from Bangladesh were conspiring to demolish a Hindu temple or to steal ornaments from the temple to incite a communal clash between the two communities.”Further questioning revealed that Haji came to know one of the accused, Jahangir, when he approached Haji for a job a year ago. About a month ago, Jahangir again approached Haji seeking a job for Mujam Mondal, Ebadhul Ali and another accused Aakash. “We found that Aadhaar and voter id cards produced by all the four were fake,” the inspector said. Subsequently, the police arrested Mondal and Ali.The four got together and hatched the plan after the Perundurai police arrested ten other Bangladeshi nationals on July 28 for staying without valid passports and visas. “Following the arrest, the four felt that Hindus were not allowing Muslims, especially Bangladeshi nationals, to work in Perundurai,” said the inspector, adding that the accused were planning to leave for Bangladesh after inciting a communal clash. The police booked the duo under Section 153A (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), (1)(a) (promoting enmity between different groups) of the Indian Penal Code, read with Section 14 of The Foreigners’ Act, 1946, and Section 3(3) of the Passport (entry to India) Act, 1920.The accused were later lodged at the Coimbatore central prison under judicial custody for 15 days. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/2-bangladeshi-nationals-held-for-planning-to-incite-communal-clash/articleshow/85576240.cms||---

According to details provided by Nashik Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) health department, the number of patients hospitalised in Covid hospitals has reduced from 595 patients on July 22 to 478 patients so far. According to the NMC officials, there has been a continuous drop in the number of fresh Covid cases in the city for the past two to three months. So, the number of patients undergoing treatment in hospitals has also reduced. “The infectivity of the coronavirus has reduced. Moreover, the Covid positivity rate has also reduced to 1%. The government restrictions, especially weekend restrictions, in April and May, helped to break the chain of Covid,” said Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of NMC. Apart from this, the number of daily Covid tests has also reduced from 7,000 to around 4,000 in the last two to three weeks. This is because of the drop in the number of people with symptoms. “Although the Covid scenario has improved, we are fully prepared for the Covid third wave expected in the next few months,” said the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/20-drop-in-patients-being-treated-in-hospitals/articleshow/85571326.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Coimbatore||Cinema halls remain closed, leave movie buffs disappointed||Coimbatore: Theatres in the city did not screen movies on Monday, as they preferred to wait and watch the people’s response to the government’s new relaxations. The state government had earlier allowed theatres to resume screening with 50% of seating capacity from Monday. Theatre owners said they required more time for cleaning and maintenance, as the facilities were remaining closed for months together. Many moviegoers, meanwhile, moved from one theatre to another to see if they were screening any movies. A movie enthusiast said prominent booking websites had clearly mentioned that theatres were yet to be opened. “But we couldn’t resist the compulsion within us to visit the theatres to try our luck.” An employee of KG Cinemas said the theatre was still being cleaned. “It may take a week or so for us to screen movies. Many moviegoers visited the theatre to see if we are open. We have asked them come after a few days to know the status.” V Saravanan, a movie buff from Peelamedu, said, “I am missing the theatre experience. While no new release was announced, I came here to watch any movie. The theatre owners’ decision not to reopen today has disappointed many people like me.” An employee of Shanthi Cinemas said the new movies could be expected only by this weekend, as producers were in wait and watch mode. “They want to see if enough people would turn up for shows.” Tirupur M Subramanian, president, Tamil Nadu Theatres and Multiplex Owners’ Association, said around 30% of the theatres in the state were operated on day one. “All theatres will start screening movies in another 10 days. Theatre employees have been vaccinated on a priority basis. Theatre owners will follow all the Covid-19 precautionary measures and issue free face masks to people to create a safe environment. There will be a 45-minute break between the shows to ensure thorough cleaning. There are around 40 movies awaiting release,” he said during a press conference in Tirupur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cinema-halls-remain-closed-leave-movie-buffs-disappointed/articleshow/85576278.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Tribute: Uttar Pradesh govt to rename roads in six districts associated with Kalyan Singh||LUCKNOW: As a tribute to former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh, the UP government on Monday announced that one road each in six districts — Ayodhya, Lucknow, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Etah and Prayagraj — would be renamed after the stalwart saffron party leader who passed away in Lucknow on August 21. Making this announcement, deputy CM Keshav Maurya said that officials of the public works department (PWD) have been asked to submit a proposal in this regard at the earliest. Maurya, who also holds the charge of PWD, tweeted: “Babuji (Kalyan Singh) gave up power but did not allow firing a bullet on kar sewaks”. Kalyan’s last rites were performed at Rajghat in Narora of Bulandshahr with full state honours on Monday. The announcement is being seen as BJP’s attempt to tap the legacy of Kalyan during whose tenure as UP CM Babri mosque was brought down by kar sewaks in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992. The incident had propelled the powerful leader from OBC (Lodh) community as a forerunner of Hindutva politics that led to steadfast anchoring of BJP in UP at the height of the Ram Temple movement in early 1990s. A PWD official told TOI that a proposal would be drafted soon for formal renaming of a road each in the six districts. Analysts see it as BJP move to position itself against an assertive opposition, especially the Samajwadi Party, in the run up to next year’s assembly elections. Sources said PWD is contemplating renaming the road leading to Ramjanmabhoomi in Ayodhya — where the Ram Temple is coming up — as Kalyan Singh Marg. The other five districts, too, have been strategically selected. Prayagraj is an important Hindu religious centre, while Lucknow is the state capital. Atrauli in Aligarh was Kalyan’s birthplace and he won nine UP assembly elections from the seat since 1967. He lost it only in 1980 to Anwar Khan of Congress. After leaving the BJP in 1999, he had formed Jan Kranti Party (Rashtrawadi) and won from Atrauli in 2002 assembly elections. He returned to BJP in 2004 to contest Lok Sabha elections from Bulandshahr and defeated RLD’s Badrul Islam. BJP veterans said Kalyan considered Bulandshahr as his “Karambhoomi”. He left the BJP for a second time in 2009, and successfully contested the 2009 Lok Sabha election as an independent from Etah. He returned to the BJP in 2014 and was appointed as the Governor of Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tribute-govt-to-rename-roads-in-six-dists-associated-with-kalyan/articleshow/85578520.cms||Pankaj Shah

The police have identified the suspect as Sachin Sakate. Autorickshaw driver Irfan Shaikh said that in March, he was waiting for passengers when a man identified himself as a policeman. He asked him to take him to Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital and took his phone to send a document to his senior. He said that after taking the smartphone from him the man went inside the ward. “I waited outside for around 15 minutes. When he did not come out, I entered the ward. The ward boy told me that the man took some pictures and went out. He left the ward through another door and kept me waiting at another door.” Shaikh searched for him in the hospital. “When I did not find him, I filed a police complaint online,” Shaikh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-arrested-for-posing-as-cop-stealing-smartphone/articleshow/85576255.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana BC welfare minister Gangula Kamalakar gets fake ED notice||HYDERABAD: In what is suspected to be the handiwork of miscreants to extort money, a fake ED notice dispatched to Telangana BC welfare minister Gangula Kamalakar has now sent the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a tizzy. ED has filed a criminal case against unknown individuals in the Central Crime Station (CCS) after finding out about a fake arrest order sent to Kamalakar saying that his two brothers would be arrested by ED. The fake arrest notice triggered a controversy with news circulating that it was related to a mining company linked to the Kamalakar family. Interestingly, the minister got the fake order in the backdrop of upcoming Huzurabad assembly byelection, where BJP and his other political adversaries accused him of committing irregularities in the mining business, a charge he has vehemently denied. Kamalakar has been playing a key role in the Telangana Rashtra Samithi campaign for the Huzurabad bypoll. Hyderabad police has registered a case under section 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using genuine any document or electronic record which he knows or has reason to believe to be a forged), 420 (cheating) of IPC against unknown persons. In its complaint, ED even wanted the Hyderabad police to find out from Kamalakar who sent him the alleged fake arrest order. “Kamalakar called up an officer in ED and said that he was contacted by a person with a message and told him that his brothers would be arrested by ED on August 13 and if he wants to avoid the arrest, then the accused (message sender) can help him in settling the matter with ED,” the Enforcement Directorate official said in their official complaint. Based on the ED’s complaint, when Hyderabad police contacted Kamalakar, he in turn questioned the police. It is learnt that the minister asked the police how can ED file a case when he is the recipient of the fake arrest order. Till now Kamalakar has not filed a complaint on the fake order. “We think it’s a work done by miscreants to extort money or to create nuisance as the minister is busy in pre-poll work in Huzurabad. If he lodges a formal complaint, it should help us to reach the bottom of the case,” one investigator said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/minister-gangula-gets-fake-ed-notice/articleshow/85579112.cms||Srinath Vudali

Fadnavis addressing a press conference in Mumbai, on Monday, said the government had no time to listen to the woes of the poor. “Officials are obtaining postings in such a manner that they have no time to listen to people’s grievances,” he said.

---||Delhi||Doubts raised over four-year undergraduate plan at Delhi University||NEW DELHI: Delhi University’s standing committee on academic matters expressed several reservations about the recommendation of the National Education Policy implementation panel proposing a four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP). In a meeting on Monday, they said 2022-23 as the year for implementing this was decided without proper consultation and that the colleges did not have the infrastructure to support an additional undergraduate year. Eventually, however, the standing committee passed the FYUP implementation despite the dissent and it will now be placed before the Academic Council meeting on Tuesday. The Academic Council meeting scheduled for Tuesday has among its agenda discussions on both FYUP and the adoption of the Academic Bank of Credit system, but there will be no discussions on Swayam and massive open online courses, both being deferred due to massive opposition in the standing committee. The standing committee document says that the NEP report had to be sent for discussions to all statutory bodies, such as course committees, staff councils and college faculties before it could be broached in the Academic Council. The statement adds, “The document clearly stated that multiple entry and exit and ABC will be implemented in DU in such a manner that only ‘core’ courses will be left untouched and students can earn credits for all other courses from other universities.” It points out that in the proposed BA Honours discipline with research, a student needed to earn 196 credits in four years. The core courses would comprise 84 credits, or 42.86%. “So, technically DU will be allowing 57.14% of the total credits to be earned in four years from other universities. This will have a direct negative impact on the workload,” the standing committee document says. Another big concern is that with discipline-specific electives being divided, students might not get in-depth knowledge of the subject they have opted for. The document raises questions like: “What exactly is the difference between a dissertation (6 credits) and a thesis (12 credits)? Who will monitor such differences? What is interdisciplinary dissertation? Does that mean interdisciplinary between the major and minor disciplines? While a student can pursue a major in economics with a minor in English literature, it is extremely difficult (sometimes even impossible) to find an interdisciplinary dissertation topic between these two disciplines,” the document adds. As part of the new four-year structure, the last year of the graduation programme will be devoted to writing a dissertation/ thesis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doubts-raised-over-four-year-ug-plan-at-du/articleshow/85576298.cms||Shradha Chettri

A large crowd thronged VOC Zoo on Monday to reminisce the good old days and unwind with family members. They, especially the children, looked visibly relieved, as they took a stroll along the 4.5-acre facility in the heart of the city. The zoo was closed for the public on March 17, when fresh cases of Covid-19 began swelling in the district. The zoo, which is home to a variety of birds, reptiles and animals, is home to 532 animals.Dr E Senthil Nathan, director, VOC Zoo, said more than 250 people had visited the facility till noon on the first day of reopening. He said the visitors were allowed in only after ensuring their adherence to the standard operating procedures.It is to be noted that the zoo used to record a footfall of anywhere between 1,500-2,000 on the weekends and 500 in week days during the pre-Covid days.A Manikandan, a resident of Rathinapuri, said, “I was finding it difficult to take my family out during the past one and half years, as recreational facilities mostly remained closed. We had a gala time today and could spend quality time together enjoying the outside world.”Other families that TOI spoke to on the day expressed a similar view. All of them were in a jolly mood. Most of the parks, which were maintained by the city corporation, were also opened for the public on the day. Corporation officials said 141 of the 324 parks in the city were opened for the public after cleaning them up. “We opened 43 parks in east zone, 17 in west zone, 16 in north zone, 45 in south zone and 20 in central zone on Monday. The remaining parks will be opened soon after cleaning them up,” one of the officials said.The government museum in front of VOC Zoo was also thrown open to the public on the day, when the makeshift eateries next to the zoo also came alive to serve the visitors, who were seen digging into their favourite delicacies.However, the botanical garden at the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University was not opened for the public on the day, as maintenance work was going on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/parks-zoo-come-alive-once-again/articleshow/85576266.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Saffron connection: His political moves outside BJP drew a blank||Lucknow: Kalyan Singh could not complete his five-year term as UP chief minister in both his stints but remained out of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) twice for around five years on both the occasions. A mass leader, Kalyan Singh is not only credited with uniting Hindus after Mandal Commission report led to division between upper and lower caste Hindus, but he also changed the fortunes of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh by leading the Ram Temple movement in the state. However, after his exit from the BJP, he could not sustain his reputation. On both the occasions, he floated his own political outfit but failed to leave any mark. He left the BJP after strained ties with party stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his sacking as chief minister in 1999. He returned to the partyfold in 2004. However, he again left the BJP in 2009 and rejoined in 2014, months before the Lok Sabha election. Kalyan floated the Rashtriya Kranti Party (RKP) in 2002 but couldn’t do much as a mass leader. He left the BJP before 2009 Lok Sabha elections after his request to change Ashok Pradhan’s candidature from Bulandshahr was rejected by the BJP. Kalyan’s camp had claimed that Pradhan was responsible for the defeat of Rajveer Singh (Kalyan’s son) on Debai assembly seat in 2007. Though Kalyan was declared BJP’s Lok Sabha candidate from Etah then, he contested the election as an Independent after quitting the BJP and won. He again floated a political outfit, Jan Kranti Party, and became its patron, giving the command to his son Rajveer Singh. Though RJKP contested UP Assembly polls, it failed to open its account and both his son and daughter-in-law lost the election. According to BJP sources, then BJP MP Lalji Tandon was the first to approach Kalyan on August 10, 2013. Later, senior BJP leaders Kalraj Misra and Rajnath Singh also met Kalyan and convinced him to join the ranks. Kalyan finally decided to join the BJP again. Since he was a Rajya Sabha member at that time, barring him, everyone from Jan Kranti Party joined the BJP. When the formal merger of the two parties took place at Atal Shankhnad rally in Lucknow, an emotional Kalyan said, “Whenever my life comes to an end, my body should be wrapped in the saffron flag of the BJP.” “I will shed every drop of my blood for the BJP. I admit that there had been some confusion and controversies in the past which made me part ways with the BJP. But I assure you and the party leadership that I would remain in the BJP till my last breath,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/saffron-connection-his-political-moves-outside-bjp-drew-a-blank/articleshow/85578574.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

The deceased were identified as K Krishnudu (SI), Y Babu Rao and P Antony (head constables) and P Janardhana Rao (constable-driver) of the AR wing in Srikakulam district. The tragic incident happened when the police personnel on escort duty were returning to Srikakulam after handing over the body of army jawan G Jairam, who had died in West Bengal, to his family members at Bhairi Sarangapuram village under Mandasa mandal in the district. Srikakulam SP Amit Bardar said the front tyre of the vehicle burst near Summadevi Peta. “The Bolero went out of control, rammed into the median, and toppled over to the other side of the NH and banged into a lorry. The vehicle was completely smashed under the impact of the collision. All four died on the spot. We suspect tyre burst was the primary reason behind the accident,” he said. The collision was so powerful that the bodies remained trapped inside the vehicle for quite some time. It took a lot of time for the cops to cut the metal and take out the bodies from the mangled vehicle. DGP Gautam Sawang has directed the DIG (Visakha range) and the Srikakulam SP to conduct a detailed inquiry and submit a report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-cops-including-si-killed-in-ap-road-accident/articleshow/85579113.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Vadodara||Technical glitches delay admissions in MSU faculties||Vadodara: Since the beginning of Covid-19 induced pandemic, online studies and online classes have remained the buzzword. Yet, students seem to be struggling with technology when it comes to even basics like filling up application forms for seeking admission in college. Faculties at M S University are not just dealing with deluge of applications this admission season but even incomplete application forms. University’s Faculty of Science for instance was forced to extend date for filling up first year forms as students had simply not uploaded documents required to process the applications. Faculty of Arts has its own set of worries. “There were application forms where blank pages were uploaded instead of Class XII marksheets. Many students had not uploaded their documents. While many have not filled up the minimum 10 choices they have to make, others have not even written PCM/ PCB theory marks correctly,” said professor Hari Kataria, dean of Faculty of Science.  The Faculty of Arts for instance has 2,000 plus applications from aspirants seeking admission in first year bachelor of arts but like in science, a majority of aspirants have simply not selected subjects of their choice. “The practical difficulty is that we have intake capacity of 120 in each division. If you have 300 plus applications in psychology, 400 in English and 200 in economics, how will we decide on what subjects students should be given as choice,” said a teacher involved in the admission process. Old timers point out that instead of themselves applying on admission portal, some students simply pay a fixed charge to cybercafé operators who at times even furnish their own email addresses and contact details in the online applications. But a section within the university also believes that overzealous university authorities too are to be blamed for the troubles. “The computer centre is already burdened and not been able to show its efficiency in a number of initiatives. It is very simple. If your admission portal does not allow a student to proceed with admission fees till he or she makes choice of subjects clear, things will automatically become smooth,” said a teacher of arts faculty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/technical-glitches-delay-admissions-in-msu-faculties/articleshow/85571369.cms||Prashant Rupera

---||Kolkata||Have to be judicious in school opening, no straight approach: Economist Amartya Sen||KOLKATA: A debate on reopening of school campuses amid the pandemic was also on in countries, like the US, and we would have to take judicious steps as there could not be any straight approach to that, said Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen, pointing out that there was more need to create opportunities for learning before focusing on the evaluation system now. Sen, who attended a webinar organized by Pratichi India Trust-Sahajog on Sunday night, said there could not be any uniform way to open schools during the pandemic, as the situation was fluid. “We have to carefully observe the condition before opening schools… It is true students get hugely impacted if schools are closed. On the other hand, we have to look into the possibility of students getting infected after schools are open. There is a debate over this in Boston, the city where I live. There are different opinions on this in India, too.” His opinion came at a time when at least eight states in the country have started in-person classes. The Union health ministry called the reopening of schools “a tightrope walk” and left the decision entirely to states concerned. Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier said that schools here would reopen after the Pujas in phases, depending on the situation. Sen pointed out that the situation had to be addressed at the micro level, analysing the local conditions. “Whatever will work in west Birbhum may not be applicable for east Bankura. We have to be careful while opening up schools. We have to judiciously assess the harms and benefits. You cannot quickly decide whether schools need to be closed or remain open,” he said. Asked about average grades being awarded to students during the pandemic, he said, “There are times when we put a lot of stress on evaluation. The primary stage is to provide opportunities for learning. Then we can assess how far the students were able to assimilate the knowledge and make progress.” Accepting that there could be loopholes in the evaluation system during the pandemic, Sen said they had to be addressed. “We should never think that evaluation is a very big issue. Evaluation is useful, but we have to decide on how far we are going to use that. There has to be discussions on evaluation and education we are providing to kids,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/have-to-be-judicious-in-school-opening-no-straight-approach-sen/articleshow/85576304.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Mumbai||‘Scam 1992’: Bombay HC stays probe against entertainment firm||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday stayed investigation by the Pune police till September 17, in offences registered against Sony Pictures for displaying a logo in a web series on 1992 securities scam that resembles the trademark of a bank. The interim order, by a bench of Justices S S Shinde and Nijamoodin Jamadar, was passed in a petition by Sony Pictures Network India Pvt Ltd, owner of SonyLIV app that aired the series, to quash the FIR registered in July, and a petition by Sameer Nair, CEO of Applause Entertainment that produced the web series. The complaint by Karad Urban Cooperative Bank alleged that in the third episode of web series ‘Scam 1992, The Harshad Mehta story’, a logo in a background calendar resembles the bank’s trademark, causing damage to its “financial, commercial and social” reputation. Citing grounds for relief, senior advocate Shirish Gupte for Sony said defamation is a non-cognisable offence and cannot be investigated by the police on the basis of an FIR. “Director and senior officers have been called to the police station,” he said. Gupte also said Trade Marks Act, 1999, provides for investigation by officer not below the rank of superintendent or equivalent. But in this case, it is being conducted by a police inspector. “It is a web series for entertainment. There is nothing in trade,” he added. Senior advocate Amit Desai for Nair said “it is a question of whether the FIR can be investigated at all”. He said the particular web series does not come within the scope of the Act, and no offence is made out under it. “We are not in the business of selling calendars,” he added. The judges asked the prosecutors to take instructions. “You take corrective steps else all investigation will be a waste of time,” said Justice Shinde. The judges said prima facie there is force in Gupte’s submission. “Tt is not necessary to elaborate the reasons. Suffice it to say that investigation of the aforesaid crime cannot be carried out by the investigation officer,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/scam-1992-bombay-hc-stays-probe-against-entertainment-firm/articleshow/85578587.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The land worth Rs 200 crore was sold for just Rs 34 crore by the BJP-led municipal corporation, it claimed. AAP workers also took out a ‘padyatra’ in all 272 wards of the city and leader of opposition in the north corporation Vikas Goyal alleged that BJP functionaries have sold the land to their own people at a throwaway price to fill their own pockets. BJP has been committing scam after scam, which has financially crippled the corporation, he claimed. The AAP functionary said that Novelty Cinema was a prime property in Old Delhi and not even a 100-metre shop in the same location could be bought for Rs 34 crore. “The MCD sold a 1,157-metre plot for just 34 crore,” he added. AAP workers demanded that the corporation should withdraw the decision to sell the Novelty Cinema land. Till our demands are not fulfilled, we will continue to protest, they said. The protest was peaceful. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that if AAP felt that the north corporation had sold the Novelty Cinema plot at a throwaway price then it should bring an offer at a higher price and the corporation would refuse the bid of Rs 34 crore. “AAP can pretty well make the government buy it at Rs 100 crore, a price half the market price being quoted by AAP functionaries,” said Kapoor. Kapoor claimed that according to the circle rate, the value of the plot was only Rs 18 crore 98 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-protests-against-sale-of-novelty-cinema-land-at-throwaway-price/articleshow/85576346.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The incident came to light on Monday after family members lodged a complaint with the police. According to circle inspector K Sridhar, the incident happened around 2 pm when the boy went out to play. An unidentified miscreant lured him on the pretext of buying him snacks. The accused then took him to an isolated field where he pinned him down and allegedly sodomised him. The boy who had fainted, regained consciousness later and returned home. While giving him a bath, his parents noticed blood oozing out of his anus. Further examination revealed stones of the size of pebbles stuffed inside his rectum along with chillis. The investigation has been handed over to Disha police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/six-year-old-sodomised-stones-stuffed-in-rectum/articleshow/85579125.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Kolkata||IIEST, BHU alumni help villagers shake off ‘beggar’ tag, usher in Durga Puja||KOLKATA: Gangte, 12km from Suri, often called a “beggars’ village”, could finally throw off the tag, thanks to the alumni of IIEST and Banaras Hindu University (BHU). Once snake charmers, the villagers were forced to give up the practice and take up begging to make ends meet. Many sought alms on local trains. But the pandemic-induced suspension of trains robbed them of earnings. An NGO that runs an orphanage there sent out an appeal, attracting the attention of IIEST and BHU alumni, who developed a self-sustaining model for the villagers to earn a living. For the first time, these “outcasts”, as they called themselves, have been gifted a Durga Puja by the alumni. When the proposal for the Puja was placed before Gangte people, the first reaction was one of disbelief. Being from a lower caste, the villagers felt they could not have a Puja in their village. But the alumni changed it. Right from getting an idol maker from another part of Birbhum to persuading a priest to visit the village of the “untouchables”, three from the help group took the lead. The villagers have been divided into groups with Puja responsibilities. The straw and bamboo frame of the idol is ready and on Monday, villagers helped the artisan add the first layer of clay. “The village pulsated as one as they cheered along. Kids from the orphanage kept the beat. It was an emotional sight,” said Debendra Narayan Chattopadhyay, an IIEST alumnus of the 1974 civil engineering department. Getting funds was not a problem as the IIEST and BHU alumni contributed. “We are working with the villagers to make them self-sufficient. Helping them organise a Puja has added to their selfworth. They had for years lived a life of the unwanted,” said Sumit Chakraborty, an IIEST 1978 batch student. Initially, the benefactors provided ration to the 70 families at Gangte. “But we were not lifting them out of begging. So, we bought a few bighas of land and gave them to grow vegetables. We taught them the knowhow so that they could grow enough for all to eat and still have much to sell in nearby villages. The model clicked,” said Dipankar Roy, a 1977 BHU batch. Though rice and wheat were still being given out, the cost have reduced to Rs 65,000 a month. “We have just started and don’t intend to stop here. As they say, we have miles to go,” Chattopadhyay said. BDO of Suri-2 block Shiladitya Bhattacharya said, “The way the alumni are working with villagers is inspiring. The Puja is the icing on the cake.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iiest-bhu-alumni-help-villagers-shake-off-beggar-tag-usher-in-puja/articleshow/85576381.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Lucknow||‘SDRF fund diverted to buy equipment for Kumbh Mela’||Lucknow: The Comptroller and Auditor General of India has said in its latest report that the UP government diverted Rs 67.87 crore from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for procurement of rescue equipment for the Kumbh Mela in 2019. The report said that the funds meant for the purpose should have been met from the state budget. It further points out that the PWD executed six works costing Rs 1.69 crore related to repair of roads and painting of roadsides trees without financial sanctions. The CAG has pointed out that the Kumbh Mela Adhikari (KMA) failed effectively in monitoring tents and furniture due to which the vendor claimed payment for compensation of Rs 21.75 crore on missing items. The report said that the actual amount payable on account for missing items was not ascertained by the KMA. The audit noticed over estimation of Rs 3.11 crore for road works and irregular award of work to under capacity contractors, besides avoidable expenditure on barricading works (Rs 3.24 crore) and Fiber Reinforce Plastic toilet works (Rs 8.75 crore); and excess payment (Rs 1.27 crore) to the contractors. The CAG further noted that the state government did not adhere to the prescribed timelines due to which 58 permanent and 11 temporary nature works (15% of works) were not completed by the start of Kumbh Mela. Further, due to inefficient procurement process by the home department, fire vehicles, baggage scanners, digital radio HF sets and drone cameras (cost: Rs 7.83 crore) procured for the Kumbh Mela were either not received or not utilised during Kumbh Mela. The report added that the issue of management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) were not effectively addressed. Due to non-operational MSW processing plant, there was a massive scrapheap of 3,61,136 MT at Banswar plant site before Kumbh Mela. This got further piled up by 52,727 MT between January 2019 and March 2019. The CAG also revealed shortcomings in preparatory phase, project execution, monitoring and financial management of Indo-Nepal Border Road Project (INBRP) in UP between 2012 and 2019. The project was implemented by the PWD. The report said the initial alignment of 640 km of Indo-Nepal Border (INB) road in the state was revised to 574.59 km after survey, including 257.02 km under 12 sanctioned Detailed Project Reports (DPRs). The remaining 16 DPRs for 317.57 km road were yet to be sanctioned as of December 2019. During 2012-20 (up to December 2019), UPPWD incurred an expenditure of ` 834.50 crore (Rs 591.72 crore from centre and Rs 242.78 crore from the state government) on implementation of the project. The report highlighted that the forest and wildlife clearances, which were prerequisites for commencement of work, were to be accorded for INBRP (till December 2019) due to faulty/incomplete proposals submitted by UPPWD and lack of coordination with the forest department. It further said that the pace of acquisition of land by UPPWD was tardy as 27 per cent land (113.10 hectare) was yet to be acquired (as on December 2019) which would have a concomitant effect on further delays in completion of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sdrf-fund-diverted-to-buy-equipment-for-kumbh-mela/articleshow/85578612.cms||Pankaj Shah

Heavy rain, which lashed Ooty town and other parts of the district for an hour, too played a spoilsport. The government botanical and rose gardens in Ooty and Sim’s Park at Coonoor, among others, were reopened for the public on Monday. The visitors to the botanical and rose gardens were welcomed with a flower. While the botanical garden welcomed 1,536 visitors, around 567 people thronged the rose garden. The Sim’s Park, meanwhile, recorded just 274 visitors. The Tea Park near Doddabetta and Arboretum in Ooty too didn’t record much footfall. Shiva Subramaniam Samraj, joint director, horticulture department, said given the pandemic situation, the number of visitors to the tourist spots was encouraging. “The downpour restricted the movement of tourists in Ooty and Coonoor towns.” According to the official, most of the visitors were newly-married couples and those from other districts in the state. The garden authorities have been instructed to follow standard operating procedures while letting the visitors in. “Visitors are made to sanitize their hands at the ticket counter. They are allowed in only after thermal scanning. To create awareness on the importance of wearing face mask and maintaining social distancing, we have placed awareness boards inside the gardens. Staff members have also been deputed on special duty to monitor the visitors,” an official source told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ooty-gardens-welcome-visitors-with-flowers/articleshow/85576314.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Farm protest supporters term laws anti-constitutional & anti-national||Lucknow: The central government’s farm laws are anti-farmer, anti-constitutional and anti-national, said senior journalist P Sainath in Lucknow on Monday, speaking at the first event in a series of dialogues to be held for spreading awareness on the ongoing farmer’s agitation. Kisan Andolan Samarthan Samiti (KASS) and Nation for Farmers plans to hold similar sessions across 13 cities in UP to ensure public and intellectuals also come out in support of farmers. “Agriculture is a state subject, and the centre has never before passed a legislation without the consent of states. Months before the laws were passed, corporate houses were building silos across the country, which means they knew what was coming. The Acts are against all citizens as they curb Article 32 of the Constitution that gives right to litigation,” he said. “The laws were passed with voice vote while eight MPs had been thrown out of the House. There is no provision for voice vote. The demonization of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) by corporations and media is biased since APMCs guarantee minimum price,” he added. “There are many faults in government schools and hospitals, but nobody talks of their closure, because they at least make it possible for the poor to get education and health. Bihar removed APMC in 2006 and farmers there are getting a minimum 15% lower than the national price. And if something is harmful to our farmers, it affects all those who have a stomach,” Sainath said. “Students, engineers, academicians and advocates are joining the protest going on for over eight months now. The issue is no more regional,” said KASS convener Shivaji Rai. ‘March from Champaran to Varanasi in Oct’: The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) will launch Lokniti Satyagraha Yatra, a foot march from Champaran in Bihar to Varanasi in October. It will cross Jai Prakash Narayan’s village Sitab Diara and culminate in Varanasi on October 20. “The Yatra will spread awareness about the movement in UP and Bihar. We have 10 questions for the PM which we will take to the people,” said SKM’s Akshay Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/farm-protest-supporters-term-laws-anti-constitutional-anti-national/articleshow/85578646.cms||---

---||Delhi||Centre needs to find ways to end blockades at Delhi borders, says Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday put the ball regarding the continuing blockades by protesting farmers at Delhi borders in the Centre's court, saying it is for the government to find a solution to end the road blockades, which are inconveniencing the public. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikhesh Roy reiterated that roads cannot be blocked for a long period causing disruptions and there should be a free flow of traffic. It asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to explore and find a solution in consultation with the Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments. “You have to find a solution,” the bench told the SG at the outset of the hearing. Mehta suggested that farmer unions could be asked to come before the SC and said he could suggest two names. But the bench turned this down, saying that other unions would say that they were not heard by the court. The bench adjourned the hearing for September 20 and asked the Centre to try and end the impasse going on for months. The court had earlier also said there cannot be continuing inconvenience for people for a long time by agitators by blocking roads and some arrangements had to be made so that the public do not suffer. The court was hearing a plea of a Noida-based woman who alleged it took her more than two hours to commute due to the road-block. She alleged in her petition that she is a single parent and it has become a nightmare to travel to Delhi and sought the court’s intervention. She said in her petition that the agitation was being done to defame the government and the country by opposing the laws which were passed by Parliament. The Supreme Court had last year ruled that the authorities, in future, should not permit Shaheen Bagh-type protests involving blocking of roads and public spaces, and said such expressions of dissent should be organised at designated places without causing inconvenience to the public at large. Anti-CAA protestors had occupied a stretch of the road for months before the Covid pandemic led to the block being lifted. Striking a balance between the democratic right to protest and the need to spare people the inconvenience resulting from blockades, the court had said that staging protests is a constitutional right and emphasised that an issue being sub judice could not be a deterrent for an agitation on the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-needs-to-find-ways-to-end-border-blockades-sc/articleshow/85574184.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Tribals to make money out of banana waste||VADODARA: Story books for school children in Chhota Udepur will soon be published on eco-friendly hand-made paper made from banana stems grown in this tribal area. The initiative will pave a new path of sustainability in publishing after a successful pilot project of making hand-made colourful papers from banana stems. The Adivasi Academy at Tejgadh in Chhota Udepur has started designing stories in the form of Pithora paintings which will be published in the form of books on these papers. The hand-made paper from banana stem was a result of an experiment done by an intern of the academy during the pandemic. “I have worked on hand-made papers in the past and since the academy was exploring making yarn or paper from banana stem waste, I started researching about it and made the paper,” said the intern Ravi Raj. He is now training a man how to make these papers. “Right now, we are designing these story books, but in the long run, the idea is to train banana farmers in the region to make the banana paper. We will be training them and providing them with the technology to make it so that they find a new livelihood out of discarded waste without investing any money,” said Dr Madan Meena, director of the academy. Chhota Udepur has banana farming in abundance and after one season of fruition, the plant is discarded. “While other plants decompose quickly, banana plants take a very long time to decompose and they do not even get burnt easily,” said Raj. Banana papers can be best used for documentation and archiving papers as its tensile strength is more than any other paper. “There are various usages of paper besides writing. Papers made from plant waste can be used for packaging, interior and art decoration,” Raj told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/tribals-to-make-money-out-of-banana-waste/articleshow/85571503.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Hubballi||HDMC polls: Rebel trouble hits BJP, Cong on last day of filing papers||Hubballi: National parties BJP and Congress must struggle with their own people ahead of the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation election. On the final day of filing nomination on Monday, there were far more rebels than the official candidates filing their papers. Now, convincing the dissidents to withdraw their papers will be a big challenge to both the parties. The rebels from both parties have filed nominations at almost all wards. Leaders of both BJP and Congress were trying to convince the rebels not to enter the poll fray on Monday. Many rebel candidates complained that they had been backstabbed and that their party had given tickets to those who were not in the party. Congress members filed nominations for all the 25 wards under Central constituency. However, in the morning, there was uncertainty of Congress contesting from ward number 36, 37, and 38. As soon after the party announced its candidates, they would not be available. Without announcing the candidates’ names, Congress directly brought them directly to the nomination centres and made them file the papers. According to sources, BJP members had tried to put pressure on Congress candidates in these wards and even threatened them. Fearing the threat, the aspirants are said to have switched their phones off and went incommunicado.Block Congress president Rajat Ullagaddimath said he managed to ensure party candidates filed their papers for all three wards in Unkal area where BJP leaders were putting pressure on the candidates. “Our candidates have filed nominations and we managed to send them outside the city,” he said. When asked Rajanna Koravi and Tippanna Majjagi of BJP said they are prepared to face the elections. Members of Aam Aadmi Party celebrated by garlanding their candidates after they filed their papers on HDMC premises. Covid norms ignored At the HDMC office and other places where candidates filed their nomination papers on Monday, authorities had a tough time enforcing Covid appropriate behaviour. No people were found maintaining social distancing and many were not wearing masks. Dharwad DC Nitesh Patil said the premises were crowded as it was the last day of filing the papers. “There are 16 Returning officials for the elections, one each for five wards. Despite this, people rushed on the final day. Hence the situation went out of control,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hdmc-polls-rebel-trouble-hits-bjp-cong-on-last-day-of-filing-papers/articleshow/85571466.cms||---
---||Delhi||Dr David Baker: A legend who spannedgenerations, making history on the way||Many of us, at least those inclined to wistful nostalgia, may have read and appreciated James Hilton’s Goodbye, Mr Chips, published way back in 1934. Later made into two films, including one starring Peter O’Toole, it centres on the life of Mr Chipping, a quintessentially English school teacher, who taught generations of students at an English public school and became synonymous with the institution. Chips, as he was popularly called, lived his life in the school and, after retirement, stayed on and died in the school. His life was the school and the students he nurtured. I don’t know if David Baker would have taken umbrage to being regarded as a Chips-like figure in the rarefied surroundings of St Stephen’s College—a distinctly odd, archaic but much-respected figure. He was incredibly soft-spoken, slightly nervous and with a distinct aversion to noise, and a stickler for old-fashioned propriety. He was an Australian from the days Australia was a mirror image of pre-war England, who came to India to write a doctoral thesis on the national movement in the Central Provinces and then stayed on at St Stephen’s till the end of his life. He started off as a lecturer in history and ended up as an institution. In time to come, he will become a legend. I first encountered Dr Baker in my first year as an undergraduate in 1972. He taught us British History—a very useful paper that spanned the period from the Tudors to the beginning of World War II. His approach was akin to that of a school teacher—nothing fancy, nothing outlandish but intelligently conventional. This was coupled with his tutorials—always held in his fastidiously tidy Mukarji East rooms. There he dissected our essays with a degree of ruthlessness that was initially unsettling but eventually rewarding. In that first year, he helped us—more than anyone else in my three years as an undergraduate student—to perfect our essay-writing skills. A 16-year-old making the transition from school to college needed some hand-holding and clear guidance. Dr Baker helped navigate us into the gates of higher education. After that we were on our own. His interest in us didn’t cease once his formal teaching responsibilities were over. He was Block Tutor of Mukarji East, a part of college those of us who resided in the more riotous Allnutt South (now reserved for women) found too sedate. But Dr Baker’s reach extended everywhere. The rather indulgent and ever-smiling Dr John Hala was nominally the Dean but it was Dr Baker who prowled the main corridors, stopping us to inquire how we were getting on and rebuking those who were out of line. He had acquired a moral authority that stemmed from genuine respect from the students. This interest in his students, past and present, never ceased. When my son joined St Stephen’s, also reading history, in the 1990s, Dr Baker had retired from his teaching duties, but he would dutifully inquire after me. He was the link between the generations—the familiar figure I would search for (apart from Rohtas in the dhaba) at the odd occasions I returned to college for some function. It was fitting that he spent his last years creating the college archives, an exercise that must have allowed him to look back at a life well spent. In his mind, were we what we are now, or did he remember the awkward 16-year-olds trying hard to be adults? Goodbye Dr Baker. We will always remember you.

But the Delhi government did not provide the required land. Due to non-availability of land, the schools could not be opened,” Manoj Tiwari, who raised the issue in the parliament earlier this year, stated in the letter. Tiwari said he had come to know that Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti had now requested Delhi Development Authority for land to open the new schools. “I feel there is a need to call a joint meeting of all departments and land-owning agencies concerned so that the process of opening the schools can be expedited,” said Tiwari.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: 139 non-gazetted officers arrested this year for graft||LUCKNOW: Continuing the crackdown on corruption in accordance with the zero-tolerance policy of the state government, the Anti-Corruption Organization (ACO) of Uttar Pradesh Police arrested as many as 139 non-gazetted officers on charges of graft this year since January. Director General of Police Mukul Goel said the crackdown by ACO has been weeding out corrupt officers from the system besides sending a strong message that corruption will not be accepted in any form. “We will not allow corruption in the system at any level,” he said. The DGP attributed the arrests to chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s policy of zero-tolerance towards corruption. Last year also, the ACO had arrested as many as 175 government officials for corrupt practices, Goel added. As per records, officials of the anti-corruption unit laid 20 traps since January and caught officials red-handed. There were two police personnel and 18 employees of other government departments, including education, district administration, Nagar Nigam etc., among those arrested. Recently, three government officials, sub-inspector Ram Milan Yadav, auditor in education department Vinay Kumar and Lekhpal Pooran Singh were caught red-handed taking bribes in the state. All three were nabbed on a single day. Superintendent of police, ACO, Rajiv Mehrotra, said, “As many as 105 officials were arrested under the Prevention of Corruption Act and 13 under other miscellaneous charges while 20 were nabbed red-handed.” Mehrotra further told TOI, “Even today, we nabbed a sub-inspector Dinesh Yadav red handed demanding Rs 10,000 bribe from a complainant who had registered a case of criminal intimidation in Kotwali area of Sultanpur district. Moreover, in a bid to encourage people to report corruption by government officials, the vigilance establishment has launched a dedicated ‘anti-bribery helpline. The helpline number (9454401866) will be available from 10am to 6pm for giving information about corruption while the complainant’s name will be kept confidential.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/139-non-gazetted-officers-arrested-this-yr-for-graft/articleshow/85578662.cms||---

About 1,800 members are e-voting since Monday morning to give their mandate. E-voting will be on till 5.30pm on Thursday when the Extra Ordinary General Meeting will be held from 4pm and results will be declared at the end of the meeting the same evening. Besides seeking members’ nod to rename its stands and other structures, RWITC wants to appoint a party to renovate and run the Turf Club House (TCH) in Pune. Party will pay upfront consideration to the club and will be permitted, in return, to take in some persons as TCH members at a price not exceeding Rs 25 lakh. The party must make a minimum offer of Rs 80 crore payable in 4 years. There is a third resolution which asks members to donate Rs 5,000 each for the next three years towards the Pandemic Relief Contribution. With curtailed racing activities due to the pandemic, RWITC has suffered a loss of nearly Rs 30 crore. The proximity of the Covid facility on RWITC premises forced restaurants like Gallops and Tote On Turf to close down and there are still no takers for the turf club’s lawns that host extravagant weddings and other social and entertainment events. Prominent club members are sending letters to members, making claims in favour and against the resolutions. Shivlal Daga, a member for over five decades, is not in favour of any xresolution. “There is too much ambiguity about the first two resolutions. There is no mention of the floor price for renaming structures or the tenure of the contracts for renaming and also conducting the TCH,” Daga, who also heads the Board of Appeal of the RWITC, told TOI on Monday. “Will there be no clash of interests between the person sponsoring the naming of TCH and whoever agrees to take the role of conductor?” he asked. Shiven Surendranath, president of the Western India Race Horse Owners’ Association, says members must support all three resolutions. “To use racing parlance: Members must back the resolutions as good things [certain winners]. And all objections must be over ruled and considered frivolous.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-voting-begins-on-plan-to-rename-rwitc-structures/articleshow/85578665.cms||Shailendra Awasthi

Sikkim has the highest PCI this year at Rs 4.24 lakh and Haryana (Rs 2.39 lakh) is at the second spot. In 2020-21, the Agriculture and Allied sector,employer of 55% of the state's population, grew by 14.3% at constant… https://t.co/F6e4qggTov— Harish Rao Thanneeru (@trsharish) 1629724153000Giving the details on PCI growth of the state, finance minister T Harish Rao on Monday said that the state withstood the debilitating impact of Covid on the economy to deliver a positive PCI growth rate of 10.8% in 2020- 21 as compared to India’s growth rate of minus 4%. “We could not have attained this if the state’s economy had not been solid,” the finance minister said. Explaining the state’s success in increasing the PCI year after year, the finance minister stated that Telangana eclipsed seven states in a matter of seven years to rise from the 10th spot in 2014-15 to the third in 2020-21. “Our state surpassed Gujarat in 2015-16, Tamil Nadu in 2016-17, Maharashtra in 2017-18, Karnataka, Kerala and Uttarakhand in 2018-19, and Himachal Pradesh in 2020-21,” he explained. According to the finance minister, Telangana also had the highest average rise (11.5%) in PCI of any state after 2014-15 and the highest PCI growth rate among southern states in both 2018-19 and 2019-20. “The difference in growth rates between Telangana and India was only 1.1 percentage points in the year of state formation (2014-15), but it has since increased to 5.8% in 2020-21,” he said. Apart from Sikkim, Haryana and Telangana, six other states have a higher PCI in 2020-21 than India’s at Rs 1.28 lakh. The states are Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, AP, Tamil Nadu, Tripura and Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-7-years-t-eclipsed-7-states-to-rise-to-3rd-spot-in-pci/articleshow/85578661.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Hyderabad||Special drive launched to make Hyderabad a 100% vaccinated city||HYDERABAD: With the aim to achieve 100 per cent Covid-19 inoculation in the next two weeks, the GHMC kickstarted a special vaccination drive in the city on Monday. The vaccination drive is likely to be carried out in 5,200 residential colonies, localities and slums across GHMC and Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) areas. The GHMC has deployed 175 mobile vaccination centres in its limits and an additional 25 vehicles in the SCB area. The civic body aims at vaccinating all eligible people by September 9. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar visited a vaccination centre at the Old CIB quarters in Khairatabad to oversee the arrangements made for the special drive. “During this special drive, a team would visit each household and identify those who have not been vaccinated. The team will motivate people to get vaccinated and they will be informed of the vaccination centre in their area with date and time in advance. The main objective of this special drive is to make Hyderabad a 100 per cent Covid-19 vaccinated city,” said Kumar. The GHMC’s entomology wing staffers, Asha and anganwadi workers will visit the households and prepare a list of those yet to be vaccinated and hand over the list to the health department. Officials said a sticker will be pasted on the door of every household in which all residents have been vaccinated. Also, to make sure all the eligible people are vaccinated, a verification strategy is also being put in place by the authorities overseeing the arrangements. After the vaccination process is completed in a colony, a team will be sent to that particular area to crosscheck the details. A ‘fully vaccinated colony’ certificate will be given to the resident welfare associations after all eligible people in their colony are inoculated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spl-drive-launched-to-make-hyd-a-100-vaccinated-city/articleshow/85578667.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Traffic Police: 19% rise in fatal accidents this year||KOLKATA: Compared to the pandemic-hit 2020, which witnessed long periods of shutdown, the number of accidents has increased considerably this year, according to a mid-year accident analysis data prepared by Kolkata Traffic Police. However, the number this year is much lower compared to 2019. This year, the number of fatal accidents has already touched 134 so far. As many as 124 fatal accidents have been reported in the city so far this year. That is almost an average of 17 deaths per month. This is an overall 19% rise in fatal accidents as compared to last year. TimesViewThe stats indicate we need to be more careful when we get behind the wheel. A lot of changes have occurred since early 2020 (before the pandemic struck) and again since late last year (after the first total lock-down), the most visible among them being the larger number of two-wheelers on the road. Motorists need to keep that in mind.Till August last year, 112 people had died on Kolkata roads in 110 accidents, at an average of 14 deaths per month. In the final count, as many as 193 people had died in road accidents in 2020. In 2019, the city had witnessed 179 deaths by the end of August at an average of 22 deaths per month. The total accidental deaths in the entire year stood at 267. According to a comparative analysis of cases in August, there have been 13 major accidents in which 14 people died in the first three weeks of this month. In last August, too, the same number of accidents led to identical deaths. This is lesser than 2019 deaths, when 16 died in as many accidents. A few findings in this year’s performance will keep the Lalbazar brass a bit worried. Eighteen lives have been lost since the withdrawal of transport regulations on July 1. That is a considerable number since all accidents took place within just seven weeks. Importantly, fatal squad probes have blamed drivers of trucks and buses in only 30% of fatal accidents reported in the city. Several private car owners and two-wheeler riders, too, have ended up as the primary accused in accident cases since July. There have been nine hit-and-run incidents during this phase, seven of which have ended in fatalities. Among the maximum number of victims are pedestrians, passengers getting off buses, cyclists and two-wheeler riders. Police blame the sudden jump in two-wheelers and four-wheelers on city roads as one key reason. “Most of them have bought these vehicles with two objectives — maintain social distance and reach office despite the unavailability of public transport. However, not many are very conversant with traffic rules, nor are they expert drivers. This is leading to accidents,” said an officer. The “negligent behaviour” of pedestrians and little idea about drivers’ blind spots — especially of bigger commercial vehicles — have also been blamed for accidents. Among other causes are unsafe driving practices and speeding, said sources in the fatal squad that investigates such cases. “We will also focus on pocket-to-pocket analysis and carry out traffic re-engineering rather than concentrating on dry overall statistics. Traffic volume and its flow this year have been erratic due to the pandemic and they do not provide the scope for usual comparisons. While there was definitely a drop in public transport — besides the full lockdown months — two-wheelers (both motorized and non-motorized) comprised the bulk of the traffic,” stated an officer. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha stated all possible steps were being taken to tackle accidents. “We are studying accident-prone and slow traffic-prone areas separately and responding to them by involving even the civic agencies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/19-rise-in-fatal-accidents-this-yr/articleshow/85574134.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The new scheme will be applicable for the period of the new industrial policy 2019. The scheme, which is an attempt to restart the unit, is for industries that have availed of government loans and incentives, and whose dues make it impossible to transfer immovable assets to other industrialists. The scheme is applicable to industries shut for over a year or have been declared insolvent by the courts. Also, it will be applicable to industries that have shut prior to April 1, 2019, provided they pay a one-time settlement towards their dues. Industries that have shut prior to April 2010, will be required to pay their dues over two years in two instalments. The announcement comes even as Union MSME minister Narayan Rane declared 350 industries as shut and three lakh people jobless.

---||Hyderabad||Centre failed to achieve economic growth, says Telangana finance minister T Harish Rao||HYDERABAD: Finance Minister T Harish Rao on Monday slammed the BJP government at the Centre saying that it failed to achieve economic growth, leaving the country trailing nations like Bangladesh, which outperformed with higher GDP growth rates and per capita income (PCI). Addressing the media, he alleged that BJP leaders including Union minister G Kishan Reddy and state BJP chief Bandi Sanjay are screaming from the rooftops that the state’s economy is being ruined. “I want to ask them what the Union government did besides increasing the petrol and diesel prices. Telangana did remarkable things in terms of growth and the Centre’s own wings have declared these growth rates,” he said. Harish Rao alleged that opposition parties were pursuing self-interest by unfairly targeting the TRS government. “Right from quality drinking water to irrigation facilities to electricity, we have resolved all the pending problems of the state, the opposition can point out our mistakes but not lower the dignity of the state by making false allegations,” he said. These allegations will prove to be self-goals for them, he added. The finance minister stated unequivocally that the Dalit Bandhu scheme will be implemented throughout the state at any cost. “We are working on the modalities and we will not backtrack,” he said. He added that the number of government job vacancies will be declared soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-failed-to-achieve-economic-growth-harish/articleshow/85578663.cms||---
---||Delhi||Can’t make Covid orphans run around, says Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Children orphaned during the Covid-19 pandemic can’t be expected to run around procuring documents to avail of welfare scheme benefits they are entitled to, Delhi high court underlined on Monday. “It would be unfair to expect children who lost their parents to procure certificates and documents. The Delhi government should adopt simple and easily implementable procedures,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said. The bench added that “when you don’t get food, every hour, every day matters”. TimesViewRules and procedures are meant to be followed scrupulously. But in extraordinary times like these, being sensible and sensitive is equally important. The high court is right. The government must find ways beyond the rule book to help those in dire need.The high court’s intervention came after it came across the case of seven siblings who lost their parents to the pandemic and are struggling to survive in the absence of full access to welfare schemes floated by the Delhi government and the Centre. Out of the seven siblings, five, including the only son, are minors, while the eldest one is 23 years old. The youngest child is four years old and needs to be admitted in a school, the court was informed by the counsel for an NGO. “Since schemes have been framed to grant benefits, particularly to children, the approach of the government has to be proactive to grant benefits.....we are hopeful that the chief secretary after holding meetings with all stakeholders will thrash out all such issues,” the bench noted further, seeking a status report. The court also roped in the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) to help in the process of documentation of such orphaned children and fast-track grant of benefits to them. The court was informed by advocate Prabhsahay Kaur, representing NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan, that the children were duly provided with basic ration and school books by the child welfare committee, but are still in dire need of care and support and it is not practically possible for them to repeatedly approach the committee for their daily needs like milk, ration, medicines, etc. Kaur further said the siblings were given a one-time assistance of Rs 10,000 and offered a small job, which one of them had to accept to meet their basic needs as no relative is taking care of them and they are struggling for basic existence even as they have refused to keep approaching authorities seeking help. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra submitted that implementation of the scheme for grant of ex-gratia is taking time as verification of documents is required to be done. “At the end of the day, they (children) want their rights. It is your policy, why should it take so long? It should come from your side without our nudging. Then that will be called progress.” The court was also informed that there are 6,200 children who have lost one parent during the course of the pandemic and 292 children who have lost both their parents and the figures are likely to change as and when the new data is collected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-cant-make-covid-orphans-run-around/articleshow/85576448.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Pleas grow louder to throw Rabindra Sarobar open to kids||KOLKATA: A cross-section of citizens, including two school principals, an NGO that deals with mental health of children, physicians and counsellors as well as parents of special children, has written to Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority, urging that children be allowed to access Rabindra Sarobar that has been off-limits to kids for over a year-and-a-half. “Children have suffered the most in the last year-and-a-half due to the pandemic — no schools, few engagements with friends and hardly any excursion. They really have no place to go as opposed to adults who go to work and meet friends. Many children are beginning to report issues related to motor movements and confidence, resulting in therapy intervention. We request the children’s park on the Tollygunge end of Rabindra Sarobar be opened for children in the late afternoons. Alternatively, you could also open the park to children on weekends,” citizens have pleaded in the letter to KMDA chief executive Antara Acharya. They have further suggested that as a precaution, only parents who have been administered at least one vaccination be permitted to bring their wards/children. "This will ensure that you don’t have casual visitors," the parents reasoned. Acharya said KMDA would look into the request but clarified that the agency was strictly following the government’s instructions. Social activist and local resident Mudar Patherya said it defied logic that children were allowed into closed AC spaces like malls but denied entry into open air parks. Psychologists said 18 months of confinement at home had made children reticent and dented their confidence. Pediatricians said health issues are also being reported, including a rise in obesity among children. “My relative’s child has confidence issues. A friend’s child has epilepsy issues. An acquaintance’s child has issues related to hand motor movement. The child of an acquaintance does not wish to meet outsiders. These issues need to be tackled. Opening up parks could help immensely. KMDA can make a start with Rabindra Sarobar,” said Patherya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pleas-grow-louder-to-throw-rabindra-sarobar-open-to-kids/articleshow/85574188.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Cops to go back to the classroom, hone skills to ‘communicate with confidence’||Kolkata: Beginning Tuesday, around 1,500 Kolkata Police personnel will go back to the classroom to upgrade their communication skills so that they can interact better with the public and international tourists, speaking with witnesses, interrogating suspects, dealing with court cases and other police agencies in India and overseas. The programme titled ‘Communicating with confidence’ will be conducted by British Council, which has also been training the West Bengal Civil Service cadre and government department staff since 2016. Their training module include business correspondence, meetings, presentations, networking skills and business vocabulary. Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra, who decided on roping in British Council after getting a positive feedback from the WBCS training programme, said the force looked forward to working with British Council and was confident that the specially designed, holistic communication course would add long-term value to officers. “This programme will not only enhance the public experience while interacting with Kolkata Police but will also increase output of our police officers while providing and seeking information, interviewing witnesses or suspects and dealing with court cases. Kolkata, being a major tourist hub and a gateway to India for many neighbouring countries, stronger communication skills and improved English language proficiency will help our officers overcome the language barrier while dealing with international tourists,” said Mitra. British Council director (east and north-east India) Debanjan Chakrabarti said the latest course material was designed for police, keeping their job requirements in mind. “The idea is to help improve their confidence in communicating directly or on telephone or over email. There will be a lot of stress on etiquette and body language including gestures, facial expressions and body movements," said . The officers — sergeants, sub-inspectors and inspectors — will undergo around 50 hours of training, attending around two classes a week over seven weeks. Timings will be flexible keeping in mind the professional constraints. The training will be staggered over a year to cover 1,500 officers who will be assessed before and after training. Certificates will be handed out at the end of the course. All the classes will be online and will comprise both live classes and materials to study and work on later. "There will be a lot of focus on extensive speaking in English. They will be encouraged to communicate with each other on the online training platform," Chakrabarti explained. Once the Kolkata Police training is completed, personnel with West Bengal Police may also undergo the programme, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-to-go-back-to-the-classroom-hone-skills-to-communicate-with-confidence/articleshow/85574175.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Opposition parties will have to make clever and shrewd moves, like PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, else BJP’s ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ will garner people’s support once again, Sena stated in its mouthpiece ‘Saamna’. Although the Sena lauded the initiative taken by Sonia which brought 19 opposition parties together, it warned against getting complacent. “There should not be ‘Charcha pe Charcha’. No one should be under the illusion that the Modi government will be weakened and quit the fray just because 19 parties have united,” the party said in its editorial. Sena also pointed out that Maharashtra and West Bengal showed that BJP can be defeated in the political battlefield and on the chessboard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-need-foolproof-plan-to-fight-bjp-in-24-sena/articleshow/85578733.cms||---

This is just the beginning as the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad has issued a thunderstorm and heavy rainfall warning for many parts of Telangana, including Hyderabad for the next five days. According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society figures up to 9 pm, Mallapur recorded highest rainfall of 88.8 mm followed by Seethaphalmandi 69 mm, West Marredpally 68.3 mm, Cantonment area 68 mm, Rajiv Nagar 66 mm among others. Many other areas in the central parts of the city such as Khairtabad, Banjara Hills, Shaikpet, Jubilee Hills, Begumpet, Ameerpet etc. recorded 40-60 mm of rains resulting in massive waterlogging. The Raj Bhavan road and the road leading to the CM’s camp office in Begumpet wad flooded, leaving many commuters inconvenienced. “I took an auto which was barely one km from my house. But, the driver left me midway as the stretch from Somajiguda towards the CM’s camp office was completely waterlogged. Why can’t the city tolerate even light to moderate rains,” said K Divya, a resident of Raj Bhavan road. The GHMC received 20 rain-related complaints, most of which were regarding waterlogging and overflowing drains. Many people took to social media to express their angst against the authorities. “Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation is a colossal failure. One rain and the city goes for a toss.

Meteorologists have predicted that the rainfall intensity is likely to increase under the influence of a trough over Telangana. “During next two to three days, Hyderabad is likely to witness light to moderate rains at few places. Thunderstorm will occur at isolated places. Currently, westerly and southwesterly winds are prevailing over Telangana,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, IMD, Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/many-areas-waterlogged-as-rains-pound-city/articleshow/85578678.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Security beef-up plan for morning walkers||KOLKATA: Following the directives from police commissioner Soumen Mitra, police stations have started arranging extensive security for morning walkers. Led by divisional DCPs, cops have identified various spots like Rabindra Sarobar, Alipore Agri-Horticultural Society, Lake area, Parnasree Lake and Subhas Sarobar where security needs to be enhanced. Cops will be posted at the gates of these places while mobile cops will keep tabs on the parks. Cops have been asked to stay on alert to prevent the incidents like snatching, especially in the morning and evening, when many people step out of their houses for fresh air.  The detective department will be sharing inputs on local snatchers with the divisions. Besixdes, cops have also been asked to bring the morning walking zones under the coverage of CCTVs. “Senior police officers have observed that the deployment of cops was less at lakes and parks. So, all anti-rowdy officers have been asked to remain alert,” said an officer posted in the south-east division. The Kolkata Police brass took a call on the matter after two snatchers had attacked three morning walkers at the Maidan. Since then, Maidan has come under a security cover by Lalbazar forces, the south division, mounted police and traffic cops. “The security has been enhanced for the safety of morning walkers across the south division besides the Maidan area. This includes the deployment of cops at the Alipore Agri-Horticultural Society and Rabindra Sarobar,” said DC (south), Akash Magharia. “While the Maidan snatching was a biggest incident and the accused were arrested within hours, quick arrests were made for the other cases too. In one case, a morning walker was targeted near Victoria and the accused was nabbed. In another incident, there were loopholes in the complaint,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/security-beef-up-plan-for-morning-walkers/articleshow/85574205.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Proponent told to upgrade septage treatment facilities||Thiruvananthapuram: The state-level expert appraisal committee (SEAC) under the department of environment has decided to recommend utilisation of CSR funds of the project proponent of the shopping mall at Akkulam for upgrading the existing on-site septage treatment facilities in households located on both banks of TS canal. The latest meeting of SEAC decided to forward this recommendation to the state environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA). A separate DPR will have to be prepared by the project proponent for this initiative. The recommendation comes in the backdrop of one of the conditions in the environmental clearance issued for the shopping mall project that the proponent would spend 1% of project cost for CSR activities, including rejuvenation of the adjacent TS canal. The SEIAA had in 2019 directed the project proponent to comply with the EC condition on rejuvenation of the canal. The proponent later informed the committee that they had approached inland navigation department and tourism department with a request to remit 1% of the project cost for Akkulam rejuvenation project since TS canal was part of Akkulam canal. SEAC observed that no action was proposed in the detailed project report of Akkulam rejuvenation scheme for controlling on-site pollution control/support for avoiding of discharge of sewage from households and institutions, by providing appropriate modified soak pits, for ensuring secondary treatment of existing septic tanks/conversion of existing leach pits type latrines into septic tanks with soak pits. Besides, as per the minutes of SEAC meeting held in July, there was no proposal for collection of septage periodically from the land based onsite sanitation facilities of septic tank/leach pits and linking it to the existing city level sewage treatment plant (STP) at Muttathara or a new proposal for establishing a standalone septage treatment plant. The committee then decided to request the SEIAA to direct the project proponent to prepare a separate DPR for exploring the possibility for utilising the CSR/CER (corporate environment responsibility) fund to clean the TS canal part, by upgrading existing on-site treatment facilities available in households and institutions, situated on the both banks of water bodies, by establishing ‘modified soak pits to existing septic tanks/upgradation of existing leach pits into a septic tank with soak pit systems’. According to SEAC, this will be helpful for avoiding discharge of untreated waste water into the canals and lake. SEAC has directed that the proposal has to contain support and facilities for ensuring periodical removal or collection and conveyance of septage (sludge from septic tanks) from on-site facilities of households and institutions to the Muttathara STP or to the new standalone treatment plant that will be established.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/proponent-told-to-upgrade-septage-treatment-facilities/articleshow/85574295.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Delhi||Sharjeel: Without criticism, society is a heap of sheep||New Delhi: If criticism dies, a society dies and turns into a heap of sheep, JNU student Sharjeel Imam, arrested for allegedly making inflammatory speeches at two universities during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), told a court on Monday. The observations were made before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat during hearing of Imam’s bail plea in the case. Advocate Tanvir Ahmed Mir, appearing for Imam, said there was nothing in his speech that “directly or indirectly calls for violence”; he was merely exchanging his thoughts with students. “What society will be a society if it’s not robust or what doesn’t react. It will be a heap of sheep,” he said. Mir said the right to protest and bring the country to a standstill was fundamentally not at any point in time equal to sedition. “What the speech conveys is — block the roads, do chakka jam and rail roko andolan so that people are not able to traverse… I was astounded to see the investigating officer calling him bigoted just because he seems to criticise the Constitution of India…” The advocate added, “We are proud of our unity, and not majoritarianism. Critical elements in our society are also necessary because in a society where criticism will die, the society will die. That is why, ultimately, the flag to uphold the Constitution in a democracy securely lies in your honour’s hands.” He said Imam was not a member of any banned organisation or a terrorist gang, but only a student. “The speech did not call for violence. He just called for a road blockade. He did not say that the Northeast should become a different state and declare independence. That would have been seditious,” he claimed. Mir argued that Imam couldn’t be “hammered with sedition” and per se a protest against National Register of Citizens, CAA couldn’t be termed seditious by no stretch of imagination in a democracy that we had in India. “Everybody has a fundamental freedom in subjecting any part of the Constitution to criticism or to support it. Courageous men in this country will not be slapped with sedition. This is what our solemn duty is. Sharjeel Imam’s view is not hostile,” he argued. Mir further said everybody had the right to subject constitutionality to criticism or support. “We cannot be sheep following a diktat,” he emphasised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sharjeel-without-criticism-society-is-a-heap-of-sheep/articleshow/85574318.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||What’s ‘liberal tourism’? HC asks Goa govt to clarify stance||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Monday directed the state government to clarify what it means by “liberal tourism”, as stated in the minutes of the expert committee meeting. The court’s direction came after the state submitted the minutes of the meeting, where it was “unanimously agreed and decided” that “liberal tourism should not be permitted under present circumstances”. The state has sought the court’s nod for fully-vaccinated persons to be allowed in without a Covid-negative certificate. The committee, in the meeting held on August 4, unanimously decided to grant entry to all fully-vaccinated persons who have completed 14 days after their second dose and who are asymptomatic, without them having to produce a Covid-negative certificate. On July 30, the committee, chaired by dean GMC Dr S M Bandekar, had decided that “in view of the Delta-plus strain in the country, liberal tourism should not be permitted under present circumstances”. A division bench comprising justices S P Deshmukh and M S Sonak asked the state for clarity on the term, and asked for an affidavit to be filed by the member secretary of the expert committee or the health secretary. The bench said that it would be “better” if the government “put on paper” what is included, what is not included, and who are the people the state wants to grant entry to, and said that this shouldn’t conflict with the expert body. Advocate general Devidas Pangam said that the term “liberal tourism” is used in context of activities, and would mean to return to the situation as it was before the Covid pandemic, when casinos and hotels were open. Currently, casinos are not open and big musical shows are not permitted, with only cinemas permitted to start with 50% capacity from Monday, Pangam told the court. “Several restrictions are in place,” he added. The bench said there “should not be any ambiguity” about who can be allowed into the state. After Pangam submitted a Maharashtra government notification (regarding entry) to the court, the bench asked the state government whether it wants to have an almost blanket entry along the lines of what is being done by the neighbouring state, who permit fully-vaccinated people without a Covid-negative test report. “..If it is as wide as the Maharashtra order, then how do you control…?” the bench asked. The bench added that it too feels restrictions should proportionately be reduced with the situation improving, but said that it doesn’t want things to be “so ambiguous”. The bench also stated that the state must clarify whether it wants to permit entry at its borders to everybody without restrictions “because the situation may arise, ‘I’m coming here as a tourist and not a liberal tourist’”. Pangam said that several activities which normally occur are not being permitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/whats-liberal-tourism-hc-asks-state-to-clarify-stance/articleshow/85576590.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Mumbai||In Mumbai Metropolitan Region, FYJC admission registrations drop by 16%||MUMBAI: Despite all education boards having a near 100% success rate in class X, the registrations for first-year junior college (FYJC) online admissions from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) have dropped by 16%. It has dropped further for SSC students by 18%. Principals believe that students may have migrated to their hometowns in the pandemic and plan to pursue their education there or may drop out altogether. The online registration, which is key to getting admissions in colleges of choice, ended Sunday. A little over two lakh students registered for FYJC admissions in the MMR, comprising Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Palghar, as compared to 2.4 lakh last year. Colleges had expected more students to enrol as 12,000 more SSC students were declared passed this year compared to last year’s 3.62 lakh. Principals said that the lockdown-induced migration of students and loss of jobs making it difficult to pay college fees could have led to a fall in the number of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) students dropping out of the admission process. “Students whose parents have lost jobs may either drop out or go to their native towns for higher education,” said a principal. With a near 100% success rate in all boards, the state had planned for a common entrance test for class XI admission. The test was scrapped by the Bombay high court and the online admission process began. SSC students feared seats being taken away by their CBSE and ICSE counterparts as is the case every year. This year, it has been different for non-state boards. In case of CBSE, 17% less students have registered for admissions to junior colleges in the Mumbai division. Around 10% less ICSE students have filled the online admission forms in city colleges. The drop in students from CBSE and ICSE not opting for junior colleges, could be attributed to more students choosing to stick to their respective education boards, said a principal. Every year, these students compete with their state board counterparts in college admissions. CBSE and ICSE schools this year had to increase their intake capacity to accommodate more students in class XI. An official from the education department said that they were expecting the numbers to go up. “But less time was given this year for the registration process. There is also a possibility that many who have taken in-house and minority quota admissions are not aware about the online registration process,” said the official, adding that new registrations will be allowed after August 30. More students may have opted for ITI admissions to acquire skills, said another official. The total intake capacity this year in the MMR remained the same as 2020—3.2 lakh seats in 843 colleges. The first general merit list will be out on August 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-mmr-fyjc-admission-registrations-drop-by-16/articleshow/85576672.cms||Sandhya Nair

Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy directed the officials to complete the process to start construction of houses as per the schedule. The chief minister held a review programme on housing at his Tadepalli camp office on Monday, where he reviewed the progress of housing works in all Jagananna Colonies, where house pattas were distributed a month ago. While some of the beneficiaries have started construction of their houses, the government plans to start construction for others. The officials told the chief minister that construction of houses by the beneficiaries themselves is high in Guntur, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts. They further told the chief minister that construction of houses by some beneficiaries is nearing completion. The officials said that they have saved Rs 5,120 crore in the reverse tendering for houses construction. The government is procuring cement, iron and other material on subsidised prices, while sand is supplied free, the officials said. The chief minister directed the officials to provide basic infrastructure like roads, drains, electricity and drinking water facilities in all these colonies. He cautioned the officials on quality of works in these colonies as they would remain a history in the state.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Schools hold virtual Onam celebrations||Thiruvananthapuram: Though this year’s Onam festivities were marred by the pandemic, the schools in the district resorted to different ways to lift the spirit of students. By presenting ‘Onakkodi’ and vegetable kits, Cotton Hill Government LP School ensured that all students of the school celebrated Onam in all its glory. With an aim that no student shall miss the chance of wearing a new dress during the Onam and no student should be left without having the sumptuous Onasadya, the PTA and teachers of the school with 1,206 students rolled out such a programme. “Families of some of our students have been facing severe economic crisis owing to the pandemic. So we thought of providing ‘Onakkodi’ and vegetable kits for students. Many good-hearted parents along with our teachers have pooled nearly Rs 3.5 lakh for the initiative launched as part of ‘Koodeondu Cotton Hill’. Nearly 400 students were gifted with dresses,” said headmaster K Buhari. Meanwhile, many other schools arranged virtual Onam celebrations. The School of the Good Shepherd (SGS), Akkulam, principal Anitha Rajeshkumar said that they could conduct a grand and vibrant Onam celebration without losing its traditional charm in virtual space. Often Onam celebrations conducted by schools confine to the participation of students, but this time, the parents could also take part in the programmes. “I was so delighted to see the efforts put in by the teachers, students and parents to bring in variety in the programmes. It was exciting to watch the spirit of students from Class I to XII. We have many north Indian students in our school who are not familiar with the traditions behind Onam. For such students, our celebration was indeed a novel experience,” she added. Government LP School, Kilimanoor, also hosted Onam programmes virtually. “Besides arranging ‘athapookalam’, students were asked to share the myths and stories related to Onam. We are planning to send the best performances to Victers channel,” said M C Abhilash, a teacher of the school. In fact, these online celebrations have become a great stress buster for the students. Steeve, a student, said that though the virtual celebrations fail to provide the vibe of offline celebrations, they are happy as it relieved the stress of being stuck up at homes without meeting friends and teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/schools-hold-virtual-onam-celebrations/articleshow/85574341.cms||---

Rajasthan, with 11.5% share and Andhra Pradesh, with 9% share, are at number two and three respectively. The production of milk in UP rose from 277 lakh metric tonnes in 2016-17 to 318 lakh metric tonnes in 2019-20, indicating an increase of 41 lakh during the period. According to statistics put out by the state government, UP has produced 1,242 lakh metric tonnes of milk in the past four years.

Besides, 15 investors have offered to set up their units in the state. “Investments in the dairy sector have also created massive employment opportunities in rural areas of the state,” he said. To promote milk production in the state, the state government has worked to save cows, besides setting up greenfield dairies in Kanpur, Lucknow, Varanasi, Meerut, Bareilly, Kannauj, Gorakhpur, Firozabad, Ayodhya and Moradabad.

Principals of private schools said that they had been instructed by the DPI officials to collate parents’ opinions on a Google form, which was to be submitted at the earliest. Teachers and principals of many schools in Mysuru have asked parents to proffer their views no later than 10am on Tuesday. Students of primary and higher primary classes have stayed off the campus since March 2020, and experts in the education sector have been urging the government to bring them back on the campus in view of the need for their holistic development. Staff at private schools said that the officials wished to learn if parents were in favour of their wards attending schools the entire day, for half a day or preferred to continue online classes. Primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh said, “It is an unofficial survey being carried out by the block education officer to ascertain parents’ thoughts on restarting classes. It is not part of any decision-making process. Parents are the key stakeholders, and our decision on reopening schools must factor in their opinion.” Nagesh pointed to the joy with which most students had returned to campuses on Monday. “They were delighted to be back at their schools and colleges,” the minister said. Parents are understandably pleased with their opinion being sought on reopening schools. “Decisions should not be imposed on us, since we are the real stakeholders. Parents must be consulted before any decision on reopening schools is taken. The decision to conduct such a survey is welcome,” said Santosh Kamat, a Mysuru-based parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/dpi-conducts-survey-seeking-parents-opinion-on-reopening-schools/articleshow/85571244.cms||Shrinivasa M
---||Goa||Goa: Schools can hike Class XI intake by 15%||PANAJI: The directorate of education (DoE) has permitted all government and aided higher secondary schools in Goa to up their Class XI intake by 15% each, only for the current academic year 2021-22. Parents had requested to increase the Class XI seats to ensure a smooth admission process, as nearly 24,000 students cleared Class X this year from the state board. With the Class X public exams cancelled, high schools carried out the students’ assessment, which saw nearly all the students clearing the class. tnn This meant higher numbers qualifying for Class XI admissions, leading to a rush for seats. “The government has now decided and directed to permit every government and government aided higher secondary school in the state to allow and admit additional 15% students apart from their normal intake capacity for the present academic year 2021-22 as per the prescribed rules in force,” director Bhushan Savaikar has said in a circular. The Class XI intake has been upped across streams. “The present circular will be strictly in force only for the present academic year 2021-22, for all the streams viz arts, commerce, science and vocational. However, no additional financial grants/incentives or teacher will be provided to the schools,” Savaikar has told the higher secondary schools. At 99.7%, the 2021 Class X state board pass percentage was almost six percent higher than last year’s pass percentage. Only 67 students did not clear Class X, but all of them too are eligible this year to appear for the supplementary exam and may also clear the class. “During the Covid-19 crisis, the DoE was requested by parents and students to intervene in the matter of admissions in various higher secondary schools across the state and the problems faced by them due to higher number of students passing in each section than usual,” Savaikar has said in the circular. Usually, DoE allows a 10% increase in seat to accommodate more students, but this year has seen an unprecedented situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/schools-can-hike-class-xi-intake-by-15/articleshow/85576621.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Will stay neutral during voting if Cong refuses mayor’s post, says SR Mahesh||Mysuru: The BJP is looking to capitalise on the widening gulf between the Congress and the JD(S), and stake claim to the mayor’s post in the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Council for the first time. Although the JD(S) and the Congress have an understanding in the urban local body, the rift between the alliance partners has only been widening after the Congress moved the court seeking the annulment of former mayor Rukmini Madegowda’s election. Former minister and senior JD(S) MLA SR Mahesh said that the party would remain neutral should the Congress refuse to cede the mayor’s post. “We have decided against allying with the BJP. Since the corporators in our party are insisting on the mayor’s post being given to us, we will discuss what our next course of action should be at a meeting on Tuesday. We will remain neutral during the mayoral poll on Wednesday if the Congress refuses our demand,” Mahesh said. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) working president R Dhruvanarayana, meanwhile, exuded confidence of the alliance in the MCC Council lasting the full term. “But we want the mayor’s post for the remaining six months of the term, in return for which, we are willing to offer both the mayor and deputy mayor’s posts to the JD(S) next year,” Dhruvanarayana said. Narasimharaja MLA and senior Congress leader Tanveer Sait, meanwhile, said that he had not received any intimation from the party leadership on his role in the mayoral election. Sait taking a backseat on the eve of the mayoral poll has added grist to the rumour mill of simmering discontent between him and former chief minister Siddaramaiah. The former CM was none too pleased when Sait decided to cede the mayor’s post to the JD(S). The row escalated, leading to KPCC president DK Shivakumar issuing a show-cause notice to Sait. Consequently, the party has vested the responsibility of overseeing the mayoral elections to Dhruvanarayana. The BJP, meanwhile, has decided to wait and see how the situation within the alliance unravels, and which way the JD(S) swings. Candidates file nomination Congress candidate Rajani Anaiah, S Leelavathi of the JD(S) and BJP’s Shobha Ramesh filed their nomination papers for the bypoll to MCC ward 36 (Yaraganahalli) on Monday. The election is slated to be held on September 3. Rajani, accompanied by Tanveer Sait, visited the Marigudi temple in Yaraganahalli before filing her nomination. Leelavathi was accompanied by former minister SR Mahesh and MLC KT Srikantegowda while she filed her papers. Chamaraja MLA L Nagendra accompanied Shobha to the MCC office to file her papers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/will-stay-neutral-during-voting-if-cong-refuses-mayors-post-says-sr-mahesh/articleshow/85570296.cms||---

According to KMC, with this stock, the drive in its 144 vaccination clinics and 50 mega centres will continue without any disruption till Thursday. The depleting stocks had prompted the state to give KMC a one-time nod to purchase these syringes from open market which the state will reimburse later. The state Bengal government has also set aside Rs 1 crore for the syringes which costs Rs 5 per piece. It has also asked the Centre to provide 20 lakh syringes. “Arrival of fresh syringe stock from the state is a huge relief. This will enable us to run our vaccination clinics and mega centres for the next three days,” said a KMC health department senior official. The officials on Sunday expressed anxiety over depleting stock of AD syringes. The matter was taken up with the state health department and following intervention by health secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam, the KMC was assured of supply of 50,000 syringes. In the market, too, there is a shortage of auto-disable syringes in the city. Distributors said that it will take nearly three days for them to cater to any bulk demand. There are two-three private companies outside Bengal that specialise in supplying these syringes that are required for Covid-19 and other vaccinations. “While they have been supplying on a regular basis, the spurt in demand is sudden,” said Sajal Ganguly, secretary of the Bengal Chemist and Druggists Association. “While there are a few local firms, most of the reputable onesare located outside Bengal,” said Subhasis Gupta, a sub-distributor of auto-disable syringes in Kolkata. Rajendra Khandelwal of pharmacy chain Dhanwantary said it would take around three days for the stock to reach after the government places an order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-rescues-vax-drive-from-syringe-crisis/articleshow/85574305.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Delhi||Delhi riots: ‘Hollow’ UAPA charge based on truncated footage, says Umar Khalid||NEW DELHI: Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid alleged before a court on Monday that the conspiracy case against him in connection with the northeast Delhi riots was “hollow”, “cooked up” and police had relied on a truncated version of his speech shown on two news channels. Khalid said before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that as per their replies to police notices seeking the original footage, the news channels had taken it from a BJP functionary’s tweet. They didn’t verify it, he claimed. The submissions were made during Khalid’s bail plea hearing in the case in which he has been booked under the anti-terror Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Senior advocate Trideep Pais, appearing for Khalid, said the government’s distrust in the judiciary was allegedly shown in enactment of various laws like UAPA, POTA, NDPS “so that your hands are tied”. UAPA “kicks in after the so-called unlawful activities happen. This is the unfairness of the Act. Why does this unfairness happen? Because it doesn’t trust the judiciary... The third and the most important part of the government has been disabled from acting by the other two — legislature and executive,” Pais claimed. On March 6, 2020, when the FIR was registered, police had nothing against any of the accused, he said, claiming that none of the accused in FIR 59 should be in custody. “This is not the chargesheet worth the paper on which it is written. It will not stand the test of any trial. Laughable statements have been made.” He continued, “What will the prosecution achieve through this? Cherry-pick people who oppose Citizenship Amendment Act, you don’t like. You keep them in custody as long as you please because of the oppressive UAPA provision... The purpose of the FIR is not to prosecute or to bring on guilt or to ensure that justice is done to everybody. That is hypocrisy. It is only to keep them in custody.” The senior counsel added that police had got the full video of Khalid’s February 17 speech given in Amravati on July 6 when 18 people were already arrested under UAPA. Pais claimed that one of the media channels had deliberately suppressed a sentence from the speech in which Khalid was talking about uniting the country. “It makes it quite clear that he has been framed by the press. Why did you leave this line unless you deliberately want to paint him as a person who is inciting people to sedition?” He further alleged that first police registered the FIR, then they started registering statements of witnesses, protected witnesses and then they cooked up this whole potboiler of a terror offence. The conspiracy FIR is so vague that anybody can be included in it as an accused, he alleged, adding that police had even allegedly fabricated statements. “The contents of the speech was not seditious and Khalid was talking about democratic law. He didn’t call for violence. He called for democratic participation in the protest. He said that when a foreign dignitary visits India, we will make it known to him that this is an unjust law,” Pais said. According to the chargesheet filed on June 2, 2020, the conspiracy for the Khajuri Khas violence was hatched on January 8, 2020, and police had got a witness to say that the plan for inciting violence during the then US president Donald Trump’s visit to India was hatched that day. But, Pais claimed, the foreign ministry itself did not know on January 8 that Trump was coming to India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hollow-uapa-charge-based-on-truncated-footage-khalid/articleshow/85574377.cms||Usha Das
---||Goa||Will contest from Mandrem on BJP ticket: Laxmikant Parsekar||PANAJI: Former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar said on Monday that he is very much a contender for the BJP ticket from Mandrem constituency for the upcoming 2022 assembly elections. Stating that he’s confident of bagging the ticket, he said he would not extend his support to any other BJP candidate contesting from his constituency. “I am a contender and the voters are eagerly waiting. Let elections be declared and I will be there,” said Parsekar. “Of course, I will be with the party,” he said. Party MLA Dayanand Sopte currently represents Mandrem. “I won’t be speaking about him (Sopte). If I speak anything about him, he gets upset,” Parsekar told reporters.  “Why should I be responsible for his irritation. If he could take it sportingly, then it was different. So I avoid commenting on him. But I have told you, I will be there (contesting the upcoming polls),” Parsekar told reporters. “Don’t be under the impression that I would be supporting anybody. I will be contesting,” Parsekar added. At the 2017 assembly elections, Sopte won the Mandrem seat on a Congress ticket, pipping Parsekar, who was the chief minister at the time. Later, Sopte quit Congress and joined BJP in October 2018. Subsequently, he contested the bypolls from Mandrem on the BJP ticket and won comfortably, by 4,125 votes. On June 22, Parsekar, one of the state's seniormost BJP politicians, had said that he had told the party's central leadership that he wishes to contest from Mandrem. "There is no question of BJP denying me the ticket to contest from Mandrem," he had said. However, a couple of days later, state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said that the party doesn't endorse the claims made by individuals. "Nobody should announce their candidature, and if someone has announced it, BJP doesn't endorse it," he said. Last year, after BJP lost two seats in the zilla panchayat polls in Mandrem, the local BJP unit accused Parsekar of working against the party, while Parsekar said Sopte should not blame him for the debacle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-contest-from-mandrem-on-bjp-ticket-parsekar/articleshow/85576645.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The spacious studio nestled amid the lush green environs of the Laxmi Vilas Palace compound where Varma used to paint has been completely refurbished by the royal Gaekwad family. And they want to turn it into a tourist spot. “It’s a piece of heritage as Varma, one of the greatest artists, used to make his paintings in this studio. Many tourists visit the Fatensingrao Museum near Motibaug Ground and this studio is located just a few hundred metres away. “We want to make it a tourist spot too,” said royal scion Samarjitsinh Gaekwad. He added that in future, they would also consider hosting art exhibitions at this studio. The studio was in a dilapidated condition for many years and its roof had almost collapsed. It was in 2014, that Gaekwad decided to take up renovation of the structure. “The work was painstaking as we wanted to retain the original design. Some material from the earlier structure was also used during the renovation and the studio has come out really well,” Gaekwad told TOI. The single-storey studio has exposed bricks and the roof is covered with earthen tiles while the beams inside holding the roof are made completely of wood. The studio’s design allows a lot of natural light and even the power switch designs are of old era. The renovation was co-funded by Indira Gandhi National Centre of Art (IGNCA) that has its office in Maharaja Fatehsinghrao Museum. “For a period of three years, the IGNCA will have its office in this studio. But we are in talks with them for our projects too,” Gaekwad added. The renovation of this studio began in February last year but the project got delayed due to Covid pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/legendary-painters-studio-to-be-a-tourist-spot/articleshow/85571946.cms||Tushar Tere

---||Amaravati||Palnadu emerges as pulse capital of Andhra Pradesh||AMARAVATI: The perennially drought-hit Palnadu region of Guntur district has emerged as capital for production of pulses in the state. The presence of over 50 dal (pulse) mills is helping a large number of local farmers to switch to pulse cultivation as it is giving them decent profits. The farmers in the region usually are dependent on cash crops such as cotton and chilli but are now slowly moving to cultivation of red gram and green gram. The cultivation of pulses is saving money for farmers. Growing cotton and chilli has become a gamble due to frequent fall in prices. The cultivation of chilli and cotton require massive investment, pushing farmers into a debt trap whenever the crop gets damaged or prices dip in the market. Chilli and cotton prices are witnessing severe fluctuation every alternate year leaving farmers in distress. Interestingly, price of dals are mostly constant and giving decent returns to farmers. The dal mill industry which initially operated only during the crop season has now evolved into a major industry after many of the traders turning as exporters of the stock. The traders are importing whole pulse (mostly red gram) and exporting broken dal after processing in local mills. The mills are located from Vinukonda to Macherla and Durgi mandals in the district and provide employment to the locals. According to sources, the dal mill industry is making a turnover of over Rs 3,000 crore every year as the millers are exporting stocks to various states and overseas. About 20 mills are in operation in Vinukonda areawhile another 30 industries have come up in Macherla constituency. “It would require Rs.5 to 8 crore to set up the dal mill which we might get back in a span of 5-6 years if everything goes well,” said D Malleswara Rao, an industrialist. The entry of young entrepreneurs into the sector has also helped industry set its focus on quality management. Unlike in the past, the industrialists were spending huge monies to procure advanced sortex machinery to segregate different forms of the output. Many mills have also installed packing units which is helping them bag government orders. Local millers are supplying huge quantities of packed red gram and Bengal gram for supply through Public Distribution System (PDS) in many southern states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/palnadu-emerges-as-pulse-capital-of-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/85574400.cms||Samdani MN
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Two unemployed electricians held for murder of Nalasopara jeweller||MUMBAI: Two electricians, jobless since lockdown, were nabbed for the murder of a Nalasopara jeweller on Saturday. As they could not open the digital locker that had Rs 2 crore worth gold, they fled with over Rs 1 lakh of silver on display in the showroom. Johnson Batiste (42) and Mohammed Afzal (33) were arrested within 48 hours of allegedly murdering Kishore Jain (45) at his Sakshi Jewellers’ showroom in Nalasopara (W), said DCP Mahesh Patil. The stolen ornaments and murder weapon have not been recovered, police said. Batiste, a Nalasopara resident, who often passed by the shop, roped in Afzal, a resident of Bhayander, and they decided to rob the shop. Police said the duo was keeping a watch on Jain for more than a month. They had studied Jain’s movements and gathered details about him. On Saturday, they arrived near the showroom around 9am. Jain arrived at 10.30am and within 15 minutes the two entered the shop. Jain had not locked the glass door. The men walked into the locker room and asked him for the keys. Jain resisted but the men snatched the keys from him. They tied his limbs and gagged him with tape. The men tried to open the locker using the keys but realised they needed the code. When Jain refused to share it the men stabbed him repeatedly in the abdomen. Police relied on showroom CCTV images to nab the killers. After committing the murder they returned to their homes. The informant network was activated and Batiste was identified. Afzal was arrested later. They have been booked under IPC sections 302 (murder), 397 (robbery with deadly weapon) and 392 (robbery). One of them has cases of theft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-unemployed-electricians-held-for-murder-of-nalasopara-jeweller/articleshow/85576703.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Delhi||Submit status of prosecution in NE riots cases, police told||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday asked Delhi Police to place before it the latest status of cases relating to northeast Delhi riots of 2020 pending before trial courts. “How many cases have been filed? How many chargesheet filed, charges framed, what is the number of witnesses examined, give us all the details,” a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said while asking the police to file these details before the next date of hearing on October 8. The high court’s direction came on a batch of petitions related to the last year’s violence and alleged hate speeches by leaders, which led to eruption of violence related to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The plea sought lodging of FIRs on the violence that has left at least 53 people dead and around 700 injured, and against political leaders for allegedly making hate speeches. One of the petitions also seeks a SIT probe by an independent agency. During Monday’s hearing, one of the petitioners cited a “fact finding” report that called for a SIT investigation. “Who appointed this committee? What is the value of the petitioner’s affidavit if they themselves set up a committee?” the bench responded. After being informed that the committee was appointed by Delhi Minority Commission, the court pointed out that in another petition that report itself is under challenge and refused to issue any order. In its response, the police said it had already created three special investigation teams under the crime branch and there was no evidence till now that its officers were involved in the violence. It had added that the families of people arrested and detained in connection with the riots had been informed. The police, in its affidavit earlier, had said that investigations into the northeast Delhi riots had not revealed any evidence till now that political leaders instigated or participated in the violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/submit-status-of-prosecution-in-ne-riots-cases-police-told/articleshow/85574420.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The accused, Sohail Pathan, pelted stones at the commuter while he was lying on the tracks. Passers-by pinned down Pathan a beggar from Latur, after the victim, Amit Purohit, raised an alarm. In the melee, Purohit accidentally left behind his luggage in the train compartment, containing his academic certificates and other important documents. Purohit, an Akola resident, had gone to Wardha for some work. He boarded the Sevagram Express to travel to Mumbai. Purohit had kept his phone for charging. As the train passed Dadar station and slowed down, a person leapt towards his phone, grabbed it and jumped off the moving train around 11.45am. “Purohit followed suit but the train had passed the platform and he landed on the tracks. While he was lying there, Pathan picked up stones and threw them at Purohit’s face, resulting in injuries to his nose,” said a police officer. Purohit raised an alarm, which alerted passers-by. They nabbed Pathan and asked Purohit if he was fine. When he narrated what happened, the passers-by handed over Pathan to the GRP. Purohit’s statement was recorded. “He has abrasions and escaped serious injury,” a police officer said. Purohit told police his backpack left behind in the train was valuable to him as it contained property papers, his school admission certificate, marksheets for classes X and XII, graduation and MSc (Information Technology), PAN and Aadhaar cards and his father’s death certificate. The backpack had his clothes and two old cellphones with no SIM cards. Police booked Pathan for robbery and assault.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-youth-hurt-as-he-falls-off-train-while-chasing-phone-thief-at-dadar-station/articleshow/85576766.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Petition in SC seeks access to virtual courts as fundamental right||Nainital: Should courts always allow virtual hearing as an option because of its easier access and the pandemic? A petition in the Supreme Court, challenging an Uttarakhand high court decision to stop all virtual hearings because physical ones have resumed, wants access to virtual hearings to be declared as a fundamental right. “Access to virtual courts and conducting cases through video conferencing by resorting to usage of information, communication and technology is a fundamental right available to every lawyer under Article 19(1)(a) and (g) of the Constitution (freedom of speech and expression, and freedom to practise any profession),” says the petition filed by a lawyers’ body, All India Jurists Association, and legal journalist Sparsh Upadhyay on Monday. “It is also a fundamental right of the litigant under Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) read with Articles 38 (state to promote welfare of people) and 39 (which lays down welfare principles).” On August 16, the Uttarakhand high court had issued an administrative order through the registrar general, Dhananjay Chaturvedi, saying that virtual hearings will stop from August 24 and everyone attending a hearing has to be present in court. “No request for virtual hearing will be entertained,” the order said. This decision, the petition said, sounds the “death knell” for the development of virtual courts in the country and goes against the core elements of the vision document of the Supreme Court e-committee, which has been working towards setting up e-courts across the country since 2005 for a “judicial system that is more accessible, efficient and equitable for every individual who seeks justice, or is part of the delivery of justice, in India”. The petition also refers to the Madhya Pradesh, Bombay and Kerala high courts, saying that while these courts are functioning virtually, “advocates are being pressured” to attend in person because they are not being given virtual hearing links. So, the petition appeals to the Supreme Court to restrain all high courts from denying access to virtual courts on the grounds that physical hearings have resumed. The Uttarakhand high court had adopted the virtual mode in April 2020 when the first wave of the pandemic swept the country. When the number of Covid cases started coming down, the court moved to a hybrid model. But the second wave struck and the court went back to virtual hearings. Finally, it was on August 2 that physical hearings resumed along with virtual ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/petition-in-sc-seeks-access-to-virtual-courts-as-fundamental-right/articleshow/85571837.cms||Prashant Jha

About 1,300 surveyors will undergo vigorous training in districts. The government has decided to depute senior moderators from the State Survey Training College at Samalkot in West Godavari district to the districts to launch the training session from August 26. Initially, the government wanted to provide training at State Survey Training College, Samalkot. However, it was deferred and decided to depute the officials from the training college to the districts as part of the Covid-19 containment measures. The training programme was designed to give both off and on field exposure to staff in reaching targets of comprehensive survey. Speaking to the media, survey and land settlement commissioner, Siddarth Jain, said that surveyors would also be given thorough training in handling the latest gadgets. “Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is of the view that surveyors should be capable of resolving all the field-level issues with the help of latest technologies and equipment. The training programme will help them switch to the new technologies and complete the survey without any delay,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/govt-to-train-1300-to-ease-land-survey/articleshow/85574477.cms||Samdani MN
---||Delhi||Delhi: Rain prompts civic bodies to step up anti-dengue drive||NEW DELHI: The recent heavy rain and reports of increase in cases of vector-borne diseases has forced the civic bodies to increase the frequency of fumigation drives in open sites, parks and public places where chances of waterlogging are high. A South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) official said that usually fumigation was repeated after seven days, but at certain sites workers had been directed to visit after 4-5 days. “At places such as open parks, gardens, tourist places and nurseries where footfall is high and where water is stagnant despite the efforts of the department concerned, our workers are making efforts to reduce the chances of mosquito breeding by intensifying fumigation drives. Besides, we are also acting on residents’ complaints and requesting other departments to coordinate with us by taking basic steps such as arranging for pumps and spraying kerosene/oil to avoid mosquitogenic conditions,” added the official. At least 14 cases of dengue have been reported in the city, taking the total number of cases to 82 compared with 51 last year, data released by SDMC on Monday showed. There has also been a rise in malaria as well as chikungunya cases. At least four cases of malaria and two of chikungunya have been reported. Till date, 36 malaria cases have been reported compared with 53 last year. Similarly, 23 chikungunya cases have been recorded compared with 28 in 2020. “The chances of vector-borne disease are high as this is the appropriate weather for mosquito breeding. But we can avoid it by taking a few steps in our houses and adjoining areas,” said the official. On Monday, North Delhi Municipal Corporation standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain held a meeting with officials of the public health department regarding prevention of vector-borne diseases. He directed them to regularly check government buildings, schools, offices, community buildings and dispensaries, etc, in addition to carrying out awareness campaigns in residential areas, so that dengue, malaria and chikungunya can be prevented. “This season is conducive to breeding of mosquitoes, so we need to be more vigilant. We will also do random checks in vulnerable areas,” said Jain. The civic bodies have also started fogging in neighbourhoods where vector-borne diseases have been reported. An East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) official said inaccessible areas, such as vehicles dumped at police stations, were being targeted through anti-larval measures, like spraying insecticides and using granules. Meanwhile, domestic breeding checkers (DBC) announced that they would hold a protest in front of the EDMC headquarters on August 25 for non-payment of two months’ salary. “After a series of correspondence, we were paid a month’s salary last week. But salary of two months is still pending. All 710 DBCs will participate in the protest for the unconcerned and irresponsible attitude of the civic body,” said Madan Pal of Anti Malaria Ekta Karamchari Union.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-prompts-3-civic-bodies-to-step-up-anti-dengue-drive/articleshow/85574625.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||12,000 have their say on more liveable Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority has received over 12,000 suggestions and objections regarding the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041, which was put in public domain 75 days ago. Monday was the last day to submit public inputs. The draft MPD41, meant as a strategic and enabling framework for a sustainable and liveable Delhi in two decades, was made open to the public on June 9, originally for 45 days but later extended to August 23. A DDA official said 12,099 suggestions or objections were received till 6pm on Monday, of which 7,337 were received by post, 362 by email and 4,400 in the form of comments on the agency’s portal. The portal saw a claimed user traffic of 63,062 and had 5,151 registered users. The official said that the suggestions and objections would now be subjected to online public hearings on different issues such as environment, transport and housing likely in October. DDA plans to notify MPD41 by the end of this year or at the most, by early next year. Among the many suggestions are those submitted by Save Our City campaign, an umbrella group of RWAs, NGOs and activists, which has held the mixed land use policy for being the cause of chaos in the city. The campaign opined that the policy has prompted rampant commercialisation, which has increased congestion and added pressure on infrastructure like water, power, roads and parking. “The draft MPD41 seems to be a document of hope rather than redemption. It fails to address the problems the city is grappling with,” maintained Rajiv Kakria, convener of the campaign. Kakria’s group said, “Commercialisation of residential colony is a security and environmental nightmare, not to mention its impact on social fabric. Delhi has become a nonstop urban jungle in seismic zone IV with intermingling habitat and livelihood and unplanned rickety structures, everything being the result of a flawed MPD21.” Among suggestions and objections DDA received was one from East Delhi RWAs Joint Front on the issue of the increasing number of vehicles in the city and the lack of adequate parking. “Surprisingly, Delhi had over 75 Lakh vehicles in 2019, but the parking space available was for less than one lakh vehicles,” the front said. “And the government hasn’t yet introduced any checks on the sale of vehicles in the city.” Arguing that existing parking norms have failed to solve the problem, B S Vohra, front president, submitted that though 20% of the land area in Delhi consisted of streets, the residents had to “face traffic jams at almost every corner, contributing towards air and environmental pollution in the city”. Manoj Misra, convener, Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said that while he welcomed the draft MPD-2041 saying upfront that its focus was on environment, it shouldn’t have been taken up as a standalone subject. “Environment is not just a chapter, but should figure in all the chapters related to transport, shelter, infrastructure, etc., because environment is overarching,” argued Misra. “Environment in Delhi is not just the Yamuna and the Ridge, it is also air and water quality and the quality of life per se.” He added that by treating environment as just one of the contentious subjects, justice couldn’t be fully done to it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/12k-have-their-say-on-more-liveable-city/articleshow/85576830.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Dehradun||Tiger breeding zones in Corbett hit by ‘illegal construction’, Delhi HC seeks NTCA report||Dehradun: Two walls on two 5-km stretches and 12 bridges are allegedly being built illegally within the Corbett Tiger Reserve. The Delhi high court on Monday asked the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to file a report in response to a petition that says this illegal construction “by forest officials” is threatening the breeding zones of tigers. A source told TOI that so far, a seven-foot wall on a 5-km stretch from Saneh to Pakhro, another on a 5-km route from Morghati to Kalagarh, and 12 bridges being built illegally on a 17-km stretch of the Corbett Tiger Reserve between Kalagarh and Pakhro have been identified. Barring cement, construction material is also being sourced from the forests, “resulting in illegal mining of natural resources,” a notice to the NTCA from the petitioner, Uttarakhand-based lawyer Gaurav Bansal, said. Corbett, home to 231 tigers, has the highest big cat density in the world, at 14 per 100 square kilometre. In 2001, while hearing a case against the construction of a road through the reserve, the Supreme Court had said that “no tree whatsoever shall be felled in the Corbett Tiger Reserve by the State or anyone else.” But now, Bansal said, thousands of trees are being cut for the construction of these illegal walls and bridges. The construction was also flagged in a letter to the Kalagarh DFO by the reserve director last month. “On July 14, on my way to the forest conservators’ meet in Dehradun, (I) inspected the area and found that a lot of new construction had come up between Kalagarh and Pakhro … which I had no knowledge of,” Corbett director Rahul, who goes by his first name, wrote in the July 19 letter. “The DFO has been questioned and we’ll take the next steps after we get his reply,” he told TOI. The DFO, Kisanchand, who also goes by his first name, said all construction had a conservation or tourism purpose. He added, “The work is being done for the Pakhro tiger safari. All clearances from the government of India have been sought. The walls have been erected to contain human-wildlife conflict and poaching.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tiger-breeding-zones-in-corbett-hit-by-illegal-construction-delhi-hc-seeks-ntca-report/articleshow/85571876.cms||Shivani Azad

The biker has been identified as Pappu Kumar Jha, a resident of Liluah in Howrah. Police said the incident happened around 2pm on Sunday while he was returning home. “The incident took place at the crossing of EM Bypass-Park Circus Connector. There are no residential colonies nearby and such an incident has never happened here, though around two dozen cases have been reported in the past three years from the Maa flyover,” said an officer at Lalbazar. A case has been initiated at Pragati Maidan police station. This is the fourth such accident in the past 10 days on Maa flyover, AJC Bose flyover and Vidyasagar Setu. Cops had earlier also proposed regular raids across Kolkata to seize alloy coated strings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/manja-injures-another-biker-on-maa-flyover/articleshow/85574604.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Chandigarh||Beggars violate Covid protocol as depts puzzle over jurisdiction||They can be seen roaming around in the markets and lightpoints of Mohali from midmorning to evening. Dressed in flared skirts and heads covered with colourful dupattas, they stop passersby, asking for “atta” or milk and other provisions. Generally, they have a baby in their arms. Often the one asking for money or provisions is a child herself. It is rare to see them wearing a mask and even rarer to see them maintaining a safe distance. A day of Dihadi When TOI asked one such child-beggar to spare five minutes to talk to her, she cut a hard bargain. “Ok but you will buy me ration,” she said. Her name was Anjali, a minor girl from Chittor. She explained her reluctance to talk saying that she was earning her “Dihadi.” On being asked if she had ever gone to school, she said she had a faint memory of school back in Chittor. “We came to sell broomsticks but we also ask for money like this,” she said. On being asked to wear a mask, she rolled her eyes and walked off. A little further off, near the chemist shops in phase 9, a young woman of around 20 went around with a six-month-old baby in her arms. Again, there was no mask. She said her name was Krishna and she too, was from Chittor. Like Anjali, she said she came here with others of her village to sell broomsticks. “Its raining and we can’t sell broomsticks these days,” she said. On being asked if anyone asked her to wear a mask, she said she faced no such “problems.” A woman sitting in front of Sohana Gurdwara lightpoint with twin babies around three months of age asked for money and food with no mask. Nearby, at the lightpoint of Sohana gurdwara, two girls aged not more than 10 sought alms, again with no mask. They had around one-year-old babies in their arms. Video triggers resentment Recently, a video allegedly showing a family of beggars drinking openly on the streets of Mohali went viral, causing considerable resentment. The family was seen having alcohol openly as their scantily clad children looked on. Showing the video, Harjeet Singh, a resident of Sohana village alleged that they were far from needy, ate heartily, indulged in drugs and did not care about Covid rules. Vikramjeet Singh, owner of a kiryana shop in Mohali said, “Whenever customers come to the shop, they hassle them. Worst part is that they don’t wear mask and have no qualms about standing close to people. Cops don’t say anything. What can they do anyway? Where do they take them?” Nitish Rohilla, a businessman and social activist from Airport Road, Mohali said he tried to help them with masks, sanitisers, money, provisions and even education for their children. “I tried and my mother tried but they are not receptive. However, now that we are apprehending a third Covid wave, I feel they should at least maintain some distance and wear masks.” Social evil, not crime As of now, there are no curbs on the activities of beggars because various departments lack clarity on whose responsibility it is. Deputy mayor, Mohali Kuljit Singh Bedi said, “We have written to the police. We will ask the administration to act. We want a place allocated for them.” SP City, Harvinder Singh Virk said, “Begging is a social evil. The SC ruling also states that there cannot be a ban on begging. They can only be rehabilitated. As for them not wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, the health department needs to launch an awareness campaign targeting them. They are mostly illiterate and not aware of Covid protocol.” Civil surgeon Adarshpal Kaur does not agree. “This is a law and order problem. Police should ensure they wear masks and follow Covid protocol.” As the question of departmental jurisdiction persists, beggars wander around with no masks and no restrictions, much to the alarm of residents fearing a third Covid wave. Legal take on beggary Responding to a petitioner who moved Supreme Court for removal of beggars from public places in the national capital, the court ruled out an “elitist view” on begging. “We will not take an elitist view and order removal of beggar from sight or ban begging. No person would like to beg unless he/she is forced to do so because of poverty. It is a socio-economic problem,” the court ruled. Advocate Hari Chand Arora a Chandigarh based banker-turned-lawyer who has filed a record number of PILs for various causes, disagrees. “If we take the SC ruling, then there is no solution to this problem. The spirit of the ruling was that poverty forces people into begging but that is not always the only factor. Begging is now a profession and those who get it done are different from the ones doing it. There is even the risk of children being kidnapped. I feel those who give alms should be punished,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/beggars-violate-covid-protocol-as-depts-puzzle-over-jurisdiction/articleshow/85574570.cms||---
---||Kochi||Onam ‘gift’ row: Left Democratic Front to launch indefinite protest from today||KOCHI: The opposition LDF has decided to start an indefinite protest from Tuesday against the Onam ‘gift’ controversy at Thrikkakara municipality. A meeting of LDF Thikkakara municipal committee on Monday has decided to put pressure on the ruling UDF for the resignation of municipal chairperson Ajitha Thankappan, who landed herself in the soup over the alleged gifting of Rs 10,000 to councillors along with ‘Onakkodi’. It has been decided to conduct protest in front of the municipal office from 10.30am to 12 noon every day, until Thankappan resigns from her post. “We will examine the progress of the protest in the first one week. The committee will review it after that and discuss on the future course of action. On Tuesday. LDF Thrikkakara municipal committee will protest in front of the municipal office on Tuesday and DYFI the next day,” said Ernakulam CPM district committee member from Thrikkakara C K Pareeth. Municipality former chairman K P Eldho will inaugurate the protest on Tuesday. Pareeth said the protesters would follow Covid protocols. “A poster campaign will also be launched and the posters will be pasted in all wards demanding the resignation of the chairperson. The protesters will also seek an apology from P T Thomas, MLA, who supported the chairperson in the matter,” Pareeth said. Labour unions affiliated to the political parties belonging to the LDF and other wings will join the protest. Meanwhile, Ernakulam district Congress committee has entrusted two leaders to probe into the controversy. “We have entrusted DCC vice-president Mohammed Shiyas and general secretary K Sreedharan to conduct an inquiry into the issue. They will submit report at the earliest,” said DCC president T J Vinod. Even though an inquiry has been ordered in the controversy, UDF is maintaining that the current issue targets the chairperson. A Congress councillor coming out against the chairperson, has put the party in a spot. “Ever since Thankappan was made the chairperson, there was opposition against her even within the party circles. As a Congress councillor himself has come forward complaining that he was gifted with Rs 10,000 along with Onakkodi by the chairperson, party will hear both sides. The probe team will hear other councillors in person on Tuesday. Hearing of Thankappan will be held in the final stage only,” said a Congress leader. LDF councillors also raised apprehension that there would be an attempt to destroy CCTV evidence against the chairperson in the ‘Onakkodi’ issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/onam-gift-row-ldf-to-launch-indefinite-protest-from-today/articleshow/85574578.cms||---

Patients, especially children, are reporting high-grade fever up to 104 and 105 degrees F, chills, extreme headache, and vomiting. As reported by TOI earlier, hospitals are experiencing a never-before surge in dengue cases this year. In the last few days, not only dengue but other mosquito-borne viral diseases also have kept doctors busy. “There are several cases in which patients test negative for dengue but the platelet count reduces drastically. We call it dengue-like fever and treat on the lines of dengue,” said senior paediatrician Dr Avinash Gawande, who is medical superintendent of Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH). According to Dr Gawande, fluid management, fever control and doctors’ supervision are the keys. Dr Gawande said that 80% of patients recover at home but remaining 20% need hospitalization. “So, you must see a doctor and let him decide on hospitalization. There is absolutely no need for hospitalization if the platelet count is around 1 lakh,” he said adding that unnecessary hospitalization should be avoided. Senior paediatrician Dr Vasant Khalatkar said that every alternate case of viral fever is dengue positive. “Cases are coming from every part of the city. The age group is right from six months to 18 years. Platelets count dips drastically, especially in patients in the 12 to 18 age group,” he said while making it clear that the dengue is not deadly this year. “Majority of cases are manageable, with observation and saline therapy. If the platelet count falls below 1 lakh, we suggest hospitalization,” he said. Doctors have observed a surge in cases of malaria, chikungunya and viral fever in adults too. As controlling mosquito breeding is difficult now, doctors suggest some common measures to stay safe from mosquito bites. “Breeding has already happened and many breeding spots are still active. So, now it’s time to save ourselves. Using mosquito repellents and wearing full-sleeve clothes are some common remedies,” said physician Dr Vikrant Kamble, who is seeing an increased number of viral fever patients at his clinic in Manewada. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said that general precautions can save people not only from dengue but also many mosquito-borne illnesses. “Using things like mosquito nets on windows can save you from dengue, chikungunya, and zika. Though conventional, this remedy is three-in-one protection,” he said. Good old remedies Use repellent | Paediatrician certified, child-friendly roll-ons, sprays, creams etc Wear long clothes | Long-sleeved shirts/long pants, especially while playing in the open Timings | Mosquitoes active during early morning and evening, so avoid these timings Lights | Mosquitoes love darkness + humidity, so keep homes well lit and ventilated Safety | Use mosquito screens on windows to ensure safety inside the home Breeding | Stop mosquito breeding by eliminating breeding grounds in water tanks, air coolers, etc||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/its-dengue-and-more-keep-kids-safe-from-mosquito-bites-docs/articleshow/85578811.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||Interest for delayed payment is waste of taxpayers’ money: HC||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Monday directed the heads of the government departments concerned to remain present in court on Wednesday, to explain why three years delay was caused in disbursing compensation to a private person, for an award granted by a lower court. The bench was angry at the government, when it sought four weeks to state the status of payment to one Gajendra Odedara, who was in 2018 awarded interest of 9% for one year and 15% till final payment and additional interest of 12% for the delay caused in payment. The court said that in today’s time, paying 15% and 12% interest would entail a huge liability on the state exchequer and it is the taxpayers’ hard earned money which is going out of the pocket of the state exchequer for the unnecessary and unjustified delay at the end of the officials. This high amount of interest is paid when even banks offer 6%-7% interest on fixed deposits. The HC asked the principal secretary or additional chief secretary of the roads and buildings department, and the heads of all other departments involved to remain present and explain why was the delay made in making payment to the party as awarded by the reference court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/interest-for-delayed-payment-is-waste-of-taxpayers-money-hc/articleshow/85576804.cms||---

Nayak said that when they visited the spot, they could see no one at the construction site but the construction material and at least three stumps of felled coconut trees were lying around. The sarpanch said that when she returned to the panchayat office, there was an application seeking permission to construct some huts and a restaurant. “That an application has been submitted doesn’t mean the permission is granted,” she said, adding that it has to be placed before a meeting of the panchayat. TOI had reported that residents of Khola village were alerted of illegal activities in violation of CRZ regulations at the picturesque location. A short video clip and several photographs of the construction activities in the eco-sensitive zone and steel rods in the vicinity had gone viral on various social media platforms since Saturday evening. Workers were seen erecting platforms, landscaping and cutting coconut trees on the edge of the cliff of the Khola beach. Locals also allege involvement of a political group whose blessings are given for such activities, which they say are rampantly taken up in the coastal areas of Khola village. They also said that the property in which the construction activities were reported belongs to a local resident. TOI spoke to a few locals who said that not just one structure but similar and larger construction activities are going on and that some are already completed. What is surprising, they add, is that in the same locality such construction activities go unnoticed. Most of such activities are damaging or destroying the eco-sensitive areas, no development zones which they say is in blatant violation of CRZ regulations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/khola-panchayat-finds-illegal-construction-site-abandoned/articleshow/85578821.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Detention shouldn’t be a pre-trial punishment: HC||Nagpur: While granting bail to an accused, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has clarified that “detention cannot be a pre-trial punishment”, particularly since the offence punishable under Section 420 of IPC entails a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment. Facing charges under the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (In Financial Establishments) (MPID) Act, 1999, apart from IPC Sections, petitioner Raj Mohammad Mumtaj Choudhary had sought bail through counsel Mir Nagman Ali for bail. After he was booked by the Desaiganj police station in Gadchiroli for allegedly duping several women of Rs 1.41 crore, he has been kept behind bars since July 1 last year. “The charge is not framed as yet, and 150 witnesses are cited. In response to the specific query, the prosecution clarified it is in no position to assure that the number of witnesses will be curtailed or the trial can be concluded within a specific period. Considering that the chargesheet is filed, the petitioner has no criminal antecedents, and it is not shown that he would be in a position to influence the witnesses, I am inclined to grant bail,” justice Rohit Deo said. Earlier, additional public prosecutor Nitin Rode informed that Choudhary allegedly lured the women under the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) scheme. Anyone depositing Rs 1,500 with him was to be given a sewing machine and other articles. His accomplices — Nisar and Shabana Choudhary, who used to run a beauty parlour and sewing classes — helped him by promising the women that she would provide a motorcycle and 10 gms of gold on payment of Rs 7,000 and a four-wheeler on depositing Rs 50,000. A person depositing Rs 60,000 was promised a house under the Gharkul Scheme. After collecting about 1.41 crore, the trio fled from Desaiganj. A complaint was lodged by Prabha Kawale on May 12, 2019, against all three. It was claimed that all of them actively participated in the crime and shared a common intention to cheat the women. While allowing the petitioner’s application for bail, Deo said perusal of the material in case diary does disclose a strong prima facie case to connect him with the crime. He was released on furnishing PR bond of 16,000 with solvent surety of like amount. He was directed to furnish his current address and phone numbers to the investigating officer within 48 hours from his release from custody. While asking him to scrupulously attend each date of hearing in the lower court, the judge told him to report to the police station on every 15th and 30th day of the month till the trial is concluded. He was warned not to tamper with evidence or make any attempt to influence the witnesses, directly or indirectly. Choudhary is also prohibited from leaving the country without the permission of the jurisdictional court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/detention-shouldnt-be-a-pre-trial-punishment-hc/articleshow/85578819.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

As per official data, there are 1.2 lakh manholes spread across the 2,300km drainage network in the civic limits. Of these, 1.05 lakh have RCC lids. Officials said the remaining iron lids are mostly placed on older drainage lines and have not been replaced as they remain in good condition. Two decades ago, following frequent complaints of stolen lids, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) started using RCC covers. More recently, PMC, in association with Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited (PSCDCL), has been using fibre lids. PMC officials said the conversion to RCC covers started with the merger of villages in 1997. As a result, these fringe villages have RCC covers while core city areas still have iron lids. The total number of manholes will increase to 2 lakh if 23 merged villages are considered, officials said. “Normally, RCC lids replace irons covers when the sewage lines are changed. The lines in the old city areas, as well as areas on Nagar Road, Solapur Road and Satara Road, have not been replaced for decades and retain iron covers,” a PMC official said. Two decades ago, PMC had few options except iron lids. These days, there are fibre and other durable material available. “Most of the work being carried under the Smart Cities Mission comprises modern equipment. While carrying out sewage line augmentation, we have used fibre manhole covers. They are easy to install and replace. These products are easy to find and less likely to be stolen due to the low scrap value,” said Arun Godbole, the chief engineer of PSCDCL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/15k-iron-lids-in-the-city-ripe-pickings/articleshow/85576843.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Monsoon session: MLAs pay tributes to 7 ex-members||Dehradun: On the first day of the Monsoon session, legislators - cutting across party lines - paid rich tributes to seven former members who were either part of the Uttarakhand or Uttar Pradesh assembly. Indira Hridayesh, Gopal Rawat, Kalyan Singh, Bacchi Singh Rawat, Shri Chand, Amrish Kumar and Narendra Bhandari had passed away since the last session in March, this year. The state government is also likely to present a Rs 5,300 crore supplementary budget at the assembly on Tuesday. Incidentally, it was the first occasion during a mid-term when the assembly got a new leader of the House Pushkar Singh Dhami, new leader of Opposition Pritam Singh and new parliamentary affairs minister Bansidhar Bhagat. Paying tributes to Indira Hridayesh, Dhami said, “ In her two-term as minister in Uttarakhand she had important responsibilities like finance ministry and parliamentary affairs. She was an inspiration not only to her own party members but others, too. She always guided me and others.” Forest minister Harak Singh Rawat, who was a minister in undivided Uttar Pradesh, recalled how BJP touched new heights under the leadership of former CM Kalyan Singh. “He won people over through his simplicity,” Rawat added. Leader of opposition Pritam Singh, who has replaced Hridayesh, said, “We all were in Uttarakhand Bhawan in Delhi and had dinner together before she left us. The next morning we all were surprised with the shocking news.” Singh added that Hridayesh was a guiding force and mentor of all the Congress MLAs. “With her demise, the party and state has suffered a huge loss."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/monsoon-session-mlas-pay-tributes-to-7-ex-members/articleshow/85571949.cms||Kautilya Singh

The land acquisition proceedings took place in 2013 and the owners of the land challenged the legality of the proceedings as well as fixation of the compensation before the high court. The high court perused the records and said that the compensation was fixed in 2013, but physical possession of the land could not be taken because of the stay order passed by the high court in 2014. Meanwhile, attempts were made by the authorities to give compensation to the petitioners, which they denied. For this, the court said that no case is made out by the petitioners even in context of the applicability of the Land Acquisition Act of 2013. The court dismissed the petitions and imposed cost on all three petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-imposes-rs-50k-fine-each-on-three-petitioners/articleshow/85576853.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune residents at risk as thieves steal manhole covers||PUNE: Thieves stole manhole covers from various lanes and bylanes of upscale Kalyaninagar on Sunday night, Two days prior to this, two iron manhole covers were reported stolen from Lane No. 10 and Central Avenue, which the civic administration immediately repaired. On Sunday, the thieves struck again — about seven manhole covers were reported missing by residents of those lanes. Police said the stolen lids were worth about Rs18,000 and they were scouring CCTV footage for clues. The local municipal ward officer said they suspect scrap dealers of stealing these covers made of iron, as they carry a high value. Police said such complaints pour in not just from Kalyaninagar, but also from Pashan, Baner, and areas coming under the Chatushrungi police station. Kalyaninagar resident Asma Sharma said the missing manhole covers could have spelt danger had they gone unnoticed. “Early in the morning, a few walkers covered the manholes with tree branches and plastic crates to warn others. It is an old tactic, but a missing cover remains dangerous,” she said. After Friday’s theft, Pune Municipal Corporation immediately covered the manholes with cement lids. Senior citizen Krishnakant Singh, who lives on Central Avenue, said, “The manhole covers should have been replaced with concrete lids long ago. PMC has directed all ward offices to change them after similar incidents took place many years ago across the city. But there are many such covers that are not replaced; these thefts could pose a danger to pedestrians.” Earlier, three drainage chamber lids were stolen from Baner Road. All these areas come under the Smart Cities project. The thefts occurred towards the end of July. “We have replaced the stolen manhole covers. The replacements were done the next day. The new covers are made of fibre and have multiple uses; they also work as stormwater drains,” said Arun Godbole, the chief engineer of the Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited (PSCDCL). These fibre covers aren’t as valuable as iron lids, but they too are not spared, civic officials said. “We have registered a theft case against unidentified persons for stealing drainage lids from different spots located in Baner-Pashan area last week,” senior police inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure of Chatushrungi police told TOI. “We suspect the thieves who stole lids from the Baner-Pashan area also stole manhole covers from Yerawada and other areas,” Waghchaure said, adding, “We have requested contractors to employ security guards where lids are being installed and to affix the lids properly to ensure they cannot be stolen. Missing manhole covers can cause serious accidents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-at-risk-as-thieves-steal-manhole-covers/articleshow/85576821.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Chandigarh||Now, watch otters and ‘dinos’ at Chhatbir Zoo||Barinderjit.Saluja Mohali: Visitors at Chhatbir Zoo are fascinated by river otters frolicking around in the water, swimming belly up with a fish in their paws. The otter house in the zoo is their new home, where every move they make elicits gleeful reactions from people watching them through the glass. The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) is a very active and playful animal. The glass enclosure of the otter house makes it easy for visitors to observe their antics in the water, said zoo field director Naresh Mahajan. He added that the otter house has been built at a cost of Rs 35 lakh for conservation and upkeep of the species. Mahajan said otters are listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List since 1996. They are threatened by habitat loss, pollution of wetlands and poaching for illegal wildlife trade. “As its name indicates, its fur is smooth and shorter than that of the other otter species. Otters are poached for their fur and we, at Chhtabir Zoo, will nurture the amazing creatures and try to breed them,” he added. The smooth-coated otter has a short and sleek fur that is dark to reddish brown along the back, but light brown to almost grey on the underside. It is distinguished from the other otter species by its more rounded head and a hairless nose in the shape of a distorted diamond. Its tail is flattened, in contrast to the more rounded tails of other otters. Its legs are short and strong, with large webbed feet bearing strong claws, Mahajan said. It is a relatively large otter, from 7 to 11 kg in weight and 59 to 64 cm in head-body length, with a tail 37 to 43 cm long. BOX: Chhatbir goes Jurassic This Dinosaur Park is one of its kind and it matches standards of international zoos to help visitors understand prehistoric dinosaurs. Chhatbir zoo, in collaboration with Altrview group on PPP mode, has developed a dinosaur park in which exhibits are life size robotic models that look alive and are interactive. Zoo field director Naresh Mahajan said, “A total of Rs 5 crore has been spent on this wonderful facility. The park will provide actual and scientific information about dinosaurs and is attracting majority of the visitors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/now-watch-otters-and-dinos-at-chhatbir-zoo/articleshow/85574643.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Patna||Nitish Kumar leads all-party team to PM to push for caste census||DELHI/PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday tossed the issue of caste-based census in the Centre’s court, saying it was for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take a call on estimating the respective strength of castes. After meeting PM with a 10-party delegation to demand caste-wise headcount which was discontinued in 1931, Nitish told reporters, “The Prime Minister listened to all members of the delegation on caste census. We urged the PM to take an appropriate decision on it. We briefed him about how resolutions have been passed in the state assembly twice on caste census.” The interaction with reporters was marked by the rare sight of the Bihar CM praising his opponent, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, for mooting the idea of taking an all-party delegation to the PM. Yadav, on his part, thanked Nitish for heeding the suggestion. Nitish said the PM gave all of them a patient hearing and “did not deny what we said (need for caste census)”. “People of Bihar and the entire country are of the same opinion on this issue. We are grateful to the PM for listening to us. Now, he has to take a decision on this,” Nitish said, his remarks implying that the political onus of satisfying the clamour among the numerically preponderant intermediate castes for officially estimating their respective numbers rested with Modi. Although BJP leaders have not been averse to caste-wise count, the party is wary of making a specific commitment to hold one because of the logistical nightmare it is set to present in view of the gigantic nature of the task and its complexities. Sources say it will certainly not be easy to club it with the forthcoming decennial census for which all the preparations have already been made. The exercise has already been delayed because of Covid restrictions. A section in the party also seems to be concerned about the possibility of such an exercise putting a spade in the project to knit a “Hindutva” constituency cutting across castes. “A message is being spread in Bihar that BJP is against caste-based census, which is wrong. We have never been against it. However, clubbing caste headcount with general census might not be possible,” a senior functionary said and added that the government may initiate the process at a later stage. Nitish said it was a central minister’s statement discounting the possibility of conducting a caste-based enumeration of population which served as the trigger for the move to organise the all-party delegation. “It made us anxious as there is unrest among the people. Following the statement, all parties including the opposition took the initiative to meet the Prime Minister,” he said. Nitish was referring to a statement of junior home minister Nityanand Rai’s written reply in the Rajya Sabha in July this year that there was no proposal for releasing caste-based population data. He said all parties from Bihar spoke in one voice on the need for a caste-based census and asserted that statistics about different castes will help in formulating development schemes effectively as many of them have not benefited so far in line with their actual population. Tejashwi said, “Our delegation called on the PM not only for a caste-based census in Bihar but in the entire country. We are awaiting a decision on this now.” BJP's Janak Ram, who was part of the delegation, said the PM heard out everyone’s view like the “guardian of a family”. “Everyone was satisfied and the Prime Minister’s decision will be acceptable to all,” he added. State’s parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary made a very strong and convincing argument explaining why caste census was necessary for the country, one of the delegation members told TOI over phone. Choudhary told the PM that the caste data was necessary also for the proposed sub-categorization of the OBCs, as recommended by the Justice Rohini Commission. “If there is no caste-wise break-up, how can the Centre categorize different castes under the OBCs,” he said, adding, “The caste-wise data will also be required for regular review of the status of different castes by the National Commission for Backward Classes.” Choudhary told TOI over phone: “We hope the unity shown by all political parties in Bihar under the leadership of Nitish Kumar on the demand of caste-wise census will motivate the political leaders of other states and they, too, will join the campaign in the country.” He said Bihar has taken a lead on the issue because of Nitish, who has consistently been championing the cause of OBCs, EBCs and other underprivileged people. Ajeet Sharma (Congress), Mehboob Alam (CPI-ML), Akhtarul Iman (AIMIM), former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM-S), Mukesh Sahani (VIP), Suryakant Paswan (CPI) and Ajay Kumar (CPM) were part of the 11-member delegation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-leads-all-party-team-to-pm-to-push-for-caste-census/articleshow/85574671.cms||---

A delegation of the Gangotri temple committee visited Raithal, Natein, Bandrani, and other villages of the Bhatwari block in Uttarkashi on Monday and asked locals to join the movement against the devasthanam board. “The state government has not only infringed upon our rights by imposing the devasthanam board but also hurt the sentiments of devotees.

Thus, we have launched a public campaign to gather public support,” said Suresh Semwal, president of the Gangotri temple committee. He added that locals have extended their support to the priest community over the issue.

The hotel bookings which were over 70-80% just a few days back have now plummeted to less than 20%. According to local hoteliers, for the last few days they have been receiving calls from tourists enquiring whether the roads to the town are blocked and if there are chances of any major landslide. As reported by TOI while a portion of the road leading to Governor’s house in Lake Town had collapsed last month, cracks appeared on Bhowali-Nainital highway soon after and several secondary roads also caved in. “The most impactful, however, were the visuals from the Bhowali road where a bus narrowly escaped a major landslide. As soon as the video was shared online and shown by national media, we started receiving frantic calls from tourists,” said Ved Sah, secretary, Nainital hotels' and restaurants' association. According to district administration officials, the Bhowali road is yet to be cleared while there are half a dozen other rural roads in the town that are still blocked. “The Independence Day weekend was lull. The past weekend barely saw any tourists either. The situation looks grim in the coming days as well. There is obviously panic among the tourists and their calls and booking cancellations prove that,” Sah said, adding that he has been trying to explain to the visitors that Nainital town has not had any major landslides. Another hotelier said that they hope the roads will be cleared soon and a message is sent to tourists so that losses can be recovered. “We can understand the panic, but after almost a year tourists had started coming back to the town. Now, experts are talking about a possible Covid third wave. So, we really hope the roads are cleared and tourists can visit the town before any fresh wave,” Vinesh Joshi, the hotelier, said. The district administration, meanwhile, said the Bhowali highway will be cleared soon and the work on other rural roads is also on. “We have been working on the highways since Friday. It will be cleared soon. Our personnel are working with equipment on other roads as well,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/recurring-landslides-around-nainital-scare-tourists-hotel-bookings-go-down/articleshow/85571975.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘No age bar for MLAs to contest polls’||GANDHINAGAR: After keeping speculation alive for a long period about adopting ‘no tickets for 60-plus age’ MLAs in the 2022 assembly elections, state BJP president C R Paatil categorically said on Monday that the policy will not be applied for those seeking tickets for the 2022 assembly elections. Paatil said this while speaking at a party event in Amreli district. Speaking at an event to felicitate Union minister Parshottam Rupala, Paatil said, “We won 205 out of 231 taluka panchayats and all other elections. The state parliamentary board had decided not to give tickets to 60-plus workers in corporations, municipalities, taluka and district panchayat local bodies. This rule is not for assembly elections, so MLAs need not worry.” Earlier, ahead of the local bodies elections, Paatil had said, “All decisions related to local bodies are with state parliamentary board, so we adopted new strict criteria. Adopting or not adopting any new criteria for assembly or Lok Sabha polls are with the national parliamentary board, so I cannot comment.” Paatil had not clearly spoken about whether 60-plus MLAs or leaders will get tickets in the 2022 elections and hence there was a lot of speculations over whether the BJP will drop a sizeable number of MLAs who have crossed the age of 60. However with Monday’s announcement, the air has been cleared over the issue. If Paatil’s new policy is adopted in the 2022 assembly elections in giving tickets and thereafter in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, almost the entire top brass of the state BJP will not be eligible to contest the polls. These include CM Vijay Rupani, deputy CM Nitin Patel, senior ministers Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, Saurabh Patel, Kuvarji Bavaliya and many other ministers. Almost 50% of the present BJP MLAs are over the age of 60.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-age-bar-for-mlas-to-contest-polls/articleshow/85576893.cms||Kapil Dave

Doctors treated her and declared her and the foetus out of danger. Her condition is stable,” senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure of the Chatushrungi police said. The woman gave a statement to the police in the hospital blaming her husband for her woes. Based on her statement, the police registered a case of domestic violence against the husband. The man went to Sassoon hospital on Sunday morning and had a heated exchange with his wife as well as her parents , the police said. He then left for home. Around 8pm on Saturday, the man’s brother, who stays in a neighbouring house, found his sibling hanging from the bedroom’s ceiling fan with a rope. Waghchaure said, “We have recovered a two-page note, purportedly written by the man himself, from the spot. We shall get it verified by the handwriting experts. It blames the parents of his wife and other in-laws for harassing him and meddling in his family matters, which drove him to commit suicide. The note states that he was reeling from debt after his in-laws had borrowed Rs1.3 lakh from him and he himself had borrowed money from many people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-found-hanging-a-day-after-wifes-suicide-bid/articleshow/85576863.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Maharaja Sayajirao III funded Varma’s Mumbai printing press||Born on April 29, 1848, Raja Ravi Varma was closely connected with the royal house of Travancore. He was already making waves with his paintings when he was just 13-year-old. T Madhav Rao, who first served as Dewan of Travancore and later as Dewan (Prime Minister) of Baroda State, invited Raja Ravi Varma to make a portrait of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III. Varma, who created colourful depictions of the Hindu gods and goddesses, first came to the erstwhile Baroda state in 1881-82 and spent four months here. Sayajirao got a studio built for him near Motibaug ground where Varma stayed and worked in the 1880s. Impressed by Varma’s work, the Maharaja in 1888 invited the legend to Ooty where he commissioned 14 paintings illustrating the mythological epics — Ramayana and Mahabharata — for the decoration of the new Durbar Hall in the new Laxmi Vilas Palace. “Sayajirao had given Rs 50,000 to Raja Ravi Varma for starting a printing press at Mumbai in 1893. The first oleograph to be printed at this press was of Varma’s famous painting ‘Birth of Shakuntala’. Also, the original painting of Menka and Vishwamitra made by Varma still adorns the walls of Fatehsinhrao Museum in the city,” said Sachin Kaluskar, art connoisseur who has a rich collection of Varma’s oleographs. Varma made several paintings at this studio near Motibaug Ground but there is no official record of which of his artworks were made during his stay in the Baroda state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/maharaja-sayajirao-iii-funded-varmas-mumbai-printing-press/articleshow/85572030.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Nagpur||Jewellers strike against HUID to track each gold ornament||NAGPUR: Jewellers in the city held a daylong token strike on Monday against hall marking unique ID (HUID), a latest norm introduced by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), an agency under the ministry of consumer affairs. The strike at Nagpur was part of a nationwide agitation against HUID, and traders here claimed to have got full response to the call. “All the shops, except one corporate chain, were closed,” said Rajesh Rokde, secretary of Nagpur Sarafa Association. Even as traders fear HUID will lead to inspector raj, BIS officials says it brings a foolproof system for consumers. It will also lead to effective end-to-end tracking of gold supplies. HUID is a system of getting a hallmark and a unique ID for every individual ornament in any outlet. Before this, hallmarking would be done for gold in bulk, in terms of weight. The hallmark applicable to all the ornaments made out of the given quantity. Under the new system, jewellers will have to apply for hallmarking for each single ornament at the BIS portal. A hallmarking centre will be allotted on the basis of a token number generated at the BIS portal. The first stage would be checking the weightage. Suppose a necklace’s weight turns out to be 28 grams instead of 30 grams as mentioned by the outlet, the piece would be returned at the first stage itself. The jeweller can accept that the weight was less and apply afresh. If the piece passes the weight test, it is put into the XRF machine. This is a preliminary test of purity. Only on passing the XRF stage the piece can be taken for the final test or else is returned. Finally, the gold is put to fire assay test, which is the final stage. During the entire process a unique ID of each and every ornament will be generated. With the ID, the movement of the particular ornament can be traced till the consumer’s end. This means the BIS portal will also have details of the buyer along with the seller. If a consumer finds a deficiency, a complaint can be lodged with BIS on the basis of the unique ID. Sources say this can be an effective means of tracking the movement of the ornament till the last end. This can also help curb unaccounted sales eventually. To this, the jewellers say they are not wary of the tracking system but are hassled with the time taken at hallmark centres. As each jewellery is hallmarked it is taking not less than 10 days to finish the job, holding up the stock in trade till then. “It is also not the job of BIS to keep track of gold movement. For that the tax enforcement agencies are there,” said Rokde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jewellers-strike-against-huid-to-track-each-gold-ornament/articleshow/85578833.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: NKDA to ready New Town vaccination database||KOLKATA: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) is preparing a Covid vaccination database of all residents, domestic workers and security guards residing within the jurisdiction of New Town who are yet to get their first or second dose of Covid vaccines. The resident welfare associations of gated communities and block committees have been asked to mail the lists of such persons to NKDA in an enclosed format as provided by the authorities. Officials said that most of the residents living in the gated communities have at least received their first dose of vaccine as several of the RWAs had earlier tied up with private hospitals to conduct vaccination within their complexes for residents, but the same is not with the individual block committees, where residents mostly are either going to the NKDA run vaccination camps or going to private hospitals for vaccination. “We would get to know the approximate figures as to who are yet to get their first dose or second dose of vaccine jab once we get the list from the RWAs. On an average around 200 persons are getting vaccinated from the two vaccination centers in every day as per availability of vaccines,” said a NKDA official. In neighbouring Salt Lake, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) ward committees are periodically organising vaccination camps in their respective wards to coverall residents, domestic helps and others with their first or second dose of Covid vaccines. “We are conducting vaccination drive in different wards periodically in phases depending on the availability of vaccines, with special attention on vaccinating domestic helps and others working in households in Salt Lake as many of them have not been vaccinated,” said a BMC official, adding that on an average around2,500 persons were getting vaccinated on a daily basis. Many of the block residents have already taken their first dose of vaccine as several block committees had earlier conducted paid vaccination camps in the block community centers, tying up with private hospitals or healthcare service providers. BMC authorities have been conducting a survey to find out how many have been left to the vaccinated as it has been found out that till date about 25% of residents in BMC area have been fully vaccinated and nearly half of the population have received their first dose of vaccine but close to 50% of residents were still yet to get the first dose of Covid vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-vaccination-database-for-new-town-23-08-21/articleshow/85574693.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The accused persons, Sreemon, Mohammad Favas and Shamna of Kozhikode, Aju alias Amal of Kasaragod and Mohammad Afsal of Ernakulam, were remanded by the court and a custody application will be filed on Tuesday. Excise sources said that the recent cases of seizing MDMA in Ernakulam is a sign of an increase in the interstate peddling of drugs. The officials believe that more details about the interstate drug peddling network can be collected by interrogating the accused persons. “We suspect that they have been part of the network for long and have smuggled in contraband earlier too. We are trying to collect the details of their associates and customers. It is essential to get them in custody,” said a senior excise official. The racket was busted during a joint raid held by the customs and excise departments on Thursday when around 90gm of synthetic drug MDMA worth Rs 1 crore was seized from the rented apartment. However, later in another raid, the excise team recovered around 1.085kg more MDMA from the same apartment on Thursday night. The seized MDMA has a market value of more than Rs 13 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/excise-to-seek-custody-of-accused/articleshow/85574685.cms||---

---||Nagpur||NBWL allows devpt inside PAs and ESZs with 2% levy||Nagpur: The standing committee of National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), the apex decision-making body for conservation of wildlife and its habitat, has decided to levy 2% of the proportionate cost of projects falling inside protected areas (PAs) and eco-sensitive zones (ESZs) on user agencies for impact mitigation measures, wherever required. The amount will be spent on mitigation measures within the same protected area, national parks, sanctuaries, ESZs, tiger reserves, and corridors. The decision was taken in NBWL’s 64th meeting held on August 7, minutes of which were released on August 19. However, the decision has not augured well with wildlife experts. “The ecosystem level consequences of habitat fragmentation are deleterious. Yet, the NBWL, whose statutory duty it is to protect habitats, is trying to justify non-forestry activities by imposing 2% levy,” said Praveen Bhargav, trustee, Wildlife First. Bhargav, a former member of NBWL, said, “Endangered wildlife now faces a double whammy of fragile habitats getting fragmented and excess money causing cascading impact in PAs due to wide-ranging construction and earthmoving activity using bulldozers, which will be passed off as mitigation and habitat improvement works.” “Already, we are witnessing such negative impacts after the release of Rs50,000 crore CAMPA fund. With states not allocating CAMPA money for habitat consolidation through voluntary resettlement and land acquisition is a huge lost opportunity,” Bhargav adds. Another former NBWL member Kishor Rithe said, “The decision is the same which we took in 2012-13. The state board for wildlife (SBWL), Maharashtra, is following it since 2014. The standing committee now needs to look beyond and increase the levy to 5-7% to discourage infra projects in PAs, reserves, ESZs, and corridors.” States/UTs impose costs at different rates for mitigation measures. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) received requests that the cost imposed should be based on the proportion of the project lying within the PAs or the ESZs rather than the total cost of the project. The ministry also received requests that instead of imposing costs on project proponents, they may be asked to implement mitigation measures. “Maharashtra’s draft wildlife action plan (WPA) for 2021-30, prescribes a levy of 3-7% conservation cost for non-linear projects proposed in sanctuaries, tiger reserves, and corridors. In case of non-linear projects, it will be 3%. The idea is not to get funds, but to discourage such projects,” said a senior wildlife officer on anonymity. R Sukumar said, “The cost, if any, imposed for mitigation measures should be 2% of the proportionate cost of projects falling within the PAs or the ESZs.” He also suggested that there should be an analysis of the cost imposed and mitigation measures taken based on the experience of the states. MoEFCC secretary RP Gupta suggested that the conditions should prescribe mitigation measures to be carried out by the project proponent instead of restricting the cost to a certain percentage of the project cost. “The cost imposed on the project proponent should be based on the proportion of the project falling inside the PAs and the ESZs. If the project proponents are allowed to carry out mitigation measures inside PAs, it will cause interference in the management of parks,” said HS Singh, member. UD Singh, member & director of GEER Foundation, called for framing guidelines for fixing impact cost of the projects. “Project proponents do not have expertise in implementing mitigation measures and hence the amount recovered from the project proponents should be deposited in state CAMPA accounts and annual plans of operations (APOs) may be prepared and sanctioned for withdrawal of funds and execution of mitigation plans,” he said. “It is a pity that NBWL, whose job is to protect wildlife habitats, is on a project-clearing spree without even studying them. The money if deposited in CAMPA will lead to misuse as it is happening now. Instead of doing afforestation works, CAMPA money is being used to procure machines and implement construction activities,” said a section of former PCCFs. R Sobha, PCCF (wildlife), Telangana, suggested that impact cost of the projects should be site-specific and based on the impact of the project on the wildlife in the PAs and ESZs. NBWL to meet every month, fast-track projects The NBWL standing committee has decided to fast-track project proposals by holding meetings every month. As per the MoEFCC notification of July 22, 2014, the committee ordinarily meets once in three months. However, now it has been proposed to conduct meetings every month to minimize the number of pending cases and avoid project delays. Though a couple of members observed that the meetings may be held once in two months, the MoEFCC secretary himself said if meetings are held once in two months, new project proposals would have to wait for a long time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nbwl-allows-devpt-inside-pas-and-eszs-with-2-levy/articleshow/85576920.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh leads in bringing hospitals under Ayushman Bharat ambit||CHANDIGARH: After Kerala and Punjab, Chandigarh is leading in private hospitals empanelled under Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana ABPMJAY for universal health scheme coverage in the country. Out of 26 empanelled hospitals under universal health coverage, 18 are private hospitals, while the remaining are public hospitals. Across the country, 41.2% are private empanelled hospitals, while 58.8% are government hospitals. In Punjab, out of 878 empanelled hospitals, 72% are private, quite like Kerala, where, out of 712 such hospitals, 73% are private. Latest figures indicate that more than 2 crore hospital admissions worth Rs 24k crore have been authorised under the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana. Also, around 23,000 hospitals have been empanelled under the scheme. Recently, the National Health Authority accepted the proposal of the Chandigarh health department to use national food security data to map beneficiaries for Ayushman Bharat universal health coverage scheme. This would increase the number of beneficiaries in the city from the present 19,000 to one lakh. Among UTs, Jammu and Kashmir have the highest number of hospitals under AB-PMJAY at 226, Delhi is placed third with 96 hospitals while Chandigarh is at the third place with 26 hospitals. Ayushman Bharat was launched in Chandigarh on September 23, 2019. Apart from the financial cover, the scheme focuses on prevention of diseases, mainly non-communicable ones like diabetes, hypertension and lifestyle-related conditions. The scheme is aimed at reducing out-of-pocket expenditure. AB-PMJAY is a flagship scheme of Government of India, which provides health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation to those below poverty line. The data was shared during a recent Rajya Sabha session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chd-leads-in-bringing-hospitals-under-ayushman-bharat-ambit/articleshow/85574686.cms||Shimona Kanwar

As per the data on the state information commission’s website, the number of pending complaints and second appeals is already over 74,240 for the eight benches till May this year. The activists have appealed to the government to implement the act in letter and spirit. According to the data, 63,045 pending appeals have been uploaded on the website, of which the Pune bench has the largest pendency of 16,961, followed by Aurangabad with 10,919. Altogether 11,195 complaints are pending, with the Mumbai bench registering a pendency of 1,768 complaints. Former CIC and RTI activist Shailesh Gandhi said that the Right to Information (RTI) seems to be just an act on paper with hardly any implementation because of such huge pendency in the state. “We expect the commission to draw up a plan showing how with th0e 11 commissioners they could meet the directives of the high court in two years’ time,” said the RTI activist. “If they are not given adequate resources, they should demand these from the government. The responsibility of meeting the directives of law is with them,” he added. The state government is yet to fill the commissioner’s posts in Pune, Nashik, and Nagpur. With the retirement of the Amravati commissioner, another post has again fallen vacant. Unlike in other states, the posts of information commissioners (IC) in Maharashtra have been created as per geographical zones. Thus, IC posts have been created for Mumbai, Brihanmumbai, Konkan, Nashik, Amaravati, Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad. State chief information commissioner Sumit Mullick told TOI that officials are trying to hear as many cases as possible online and offline. “As of now, we have only four information commissioners and if all the 11 required posts are filled, we should be able to speed up hearing of cases. More cases are being filed daily, so obviously the numbers are increasing,” he added. While the post in Nashik has been vacant since February 2019, Pune has not had one since November 2018, while the post in Nagpur has been vacant since June 2018. Another vacancy has been created with the retirement of the Amravati commissioner. Gandhi added that over 12 years, the average disposal of cases by high court judges is 2,600 cases per year per judge. “The average complexity of cases before the information commission is less than one third of that before the high court judges, so they must dispose of 7,000-8,000 cases per year, he said. “Based on this, a plan can be made as to how the HC directive can be met,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rti-commissioners-for-four-benches-yet-to-be-appointed/articleshow/85576912.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Patna||Bihar: 17-year-old boy killed for Rs 10 fare in Samastipur district||PATNA/SAMASTIPUR: It may sound bizarre but a 17-year-old boy was shot dead for charging Rs 10 as fare to ferry a muscleman’s brother on his boat from one place to another in flood-affected Samastipur district on Monday. The incident took place at Banbhaura village under Bithan police station area. The deceased, Sikil Yadav, had collected Rs10 from one Anil Yadav as fare for ferrying him on Sunday evening from one place to another at the village inundated by the floodwaters. That enraged Anil’s brother Ranbir Yadav, known for his muscle power in the region. Ranbir visited Sikil’s house at around 6am on Monday and engaged in a verbal duel over the latter’s audacity to ask for money from his brother. In the process, Ranbir whipped out a pistol and shot at Sikil. The bullet hit Sikil’s abdomen, causing grievous injuries. As he cried for help, Ranbir escaped from the spot. The injured was rushed to the local primary health centre at Bithan from where he was referred to the Sadar hospital at Samastipur. Sikil, however, succumbed to his injuries on way to the Sadar hospital. His father Om Prakash alleged that Ranbir killed his son for charging Rs10 as the boat fare. “The entire village is under thigh to waist-deep water due to floods in the area. Boat is the only means of transportation. My son was assigned to ferry the residents of the village on the country boat and charged a paltry sum as fare for that,” Om Prakash told this newspaper. Bithan police station station house officer Md Khushibuddin said the incident was a fallout of a dispute over charging fare of a country boat. “Ranbir is absconding,” he said. Om Prakash has lodged an FIR against Ranbir and Anil, both residents of Banbhaura, he said. An investigating officer said a bullet to be used in a revolver costs between Rs500 and Rs700 in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/17-year-old-boy-killed-for-rs10-fare-in-samastipur-district/articleshow/85574735.cms||S K Jain

"The upcoming festivities are very worrying. It is important to postpone celebrations and festivities for another year. It is very crucial as Delta - which caused the second wave - continues to be the dominant variant," an official said. The Centre is in discussion with state governments to revise norms to ensure restrictions on public events ahead of major festivities. As projections have pegged Covid cases to peak around October, the Centre has emphasised on the need to impose local restrictions, particularly in districts that continue to record high positivity rate. The ICMR and National Centre for Disease Control have also expressed concern regarding mass gatherings at events during festivals turning into super spreader events. The Centre has also asked states to ramp up vaccination coverage as well as health infrastructure to avoid any crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/revise-norms-ensure-no-crowding-in-festive-season-centre-to-states/articleshow/85580786.cms||Sushmi Dey

For the last 10 days, Ravinder Singh has been staging a protest demanding holding of the last phase of Senate elections. Majithia condemned the delay in holding of PU Senate elections and said students should get all required facilities on campus. He asked leaders of all political parties to rise above political considerations and come together under one banner “to save Panjab University.” Majithia said he would write a letter to Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh asking him to intervene to get Senate elections held. He urged former and present PU students to save the spirit of the university and assured all help from Shiromani Akali Dal to protect the varsity and its democracy. He also asked leaders of other parties to work for the cause. 10 days of protest Ravinder Singh alias Billa Dhaliwal, former chairman, PU Students Union (PUSU), has been staging a dharna outside the office of the vice-chancellor for the last 10 days demanding holding of Senate elections. Billa is contesting Senate elections from the Graduate Constituency this time. Students belonging to PSU Lalkar, Youth for Swaraj, Ambedkar Student Union and SOPU are also holding demonstrations demanding elections and reopening of the campus. Earlier, there was tension on campus regarding graduate constituency elections, which have been deferred again, causing resentment among students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/majithia-visits-protesting-pu-students-offers-support/articleshow/85574714.cms||---

---||Delhi||Notifying 351 roads among BJP suggestions||New Delhi: A BJP delegation submitted 52 suggestions for incorporation in the Master Plan Delhi 2041 to Delhi Development Authority on Monday, including notifying 351 roads where commercial activities take place as mixed land-use roads to avert shops there being sealed. Led at the meeting with the DDA vice-chairman by its Delhi unit chief Adesh Gupta and leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, the delegation also suggested a provision like the PM Uday scheme under which owners of houses in unauthorised colonies are permitted to file for land registration. Bidhuri stressed such a scheme would aid development of unauthorised colonies, urban villages and the city’s slums. He also demanded mixed land use and commercial use in urbanised villages, 79 of which were recently declared as such. Among other demands, Bidhuri wanted more floor-area ratio for local and convenient shopping centres in colonies. He added, “All colonies in the Yamuna khadar areas must be regularised if they are not in the river’s catchment area. And all colonies falling in the O zone, or the Yamuna floodplain, must be brought out of the zone and households given ownership rights.” Gupta said that said lakhs of shops were functioning in 20-sq metre areas in the city and suggested that DDA allow non-polluting commercial activities in such shops located in residential areas. Currently such shops can engage in only 24 stipulated commercial activities. Delhi BJP has sought speeding up of the ‘Jahan Jhuggi, Wahan Pucca Makan scheme’ under MPD41 and the provision of cheap houses on rent for people who migrate to Delhi for work for short periods of time. The party also sought permission for construction of farmhouses on one acre of land under the new master plan. Another demand was permitting group housing societies on 2,000 sq metre plots instead of the existing 3,000. “PM Narendra Modi wants to provide better living standard for Delhi’s people,” claimed Gupta. The Delhi party chief desired relaxations for industrial units too. “Many units have bene closed for violating pollution norms. Construction of multi-storeyed buildings in industrial areas must be allowed,” Gupta said. A committee led by BJP Delhi general secretary Harsh Malhotra had interacted with social, religious and industrial organisation to collate the suggested amendments to MPD41.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/notifying-351-roads-among-bjp-suggestions/articleshow/85576935.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The overall deficit touched 2% on Monday. After copious rainfall in 13 days during July triggered the worst floods in 40 years, the monsoon activity has been subdued for almost a month. While a rainfall of 702.3mm is normal during August, so far only 270mm has been recorded — only 38% of the total — with only a week for the month to end. The deficit in the third month has mounted high at 62%. On Monday, the seasonal total was poised close to the 100-inch mark, as India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji had recorded 2,504.6mm (98.6 inches). The deficit in overall total surfaced since Saturday and rose to 2%, as a total of 2,662 (104.8 inches) is normal at this stage. During the last eight days, the rainfall has been sparse and IMD, Panaji recorded hardly 50mm as state average rainfall. The rainfall in August has worried farmers since the paddy crop has reached a critical stage of growth. “There will be no significant change for about five days,” an IMD source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/weak-rain-activity-to-persist-seasons-deficit-touches-2/articleshow/85576976.cms||---

The Maharashtra Rajya Saraf Suvarnakar Federation, which has 4,000 member-jewellers, is meeting to decide the course of actions to show the government its disregard for the new regulation of registering each piece of jewellery for a six-digit alphanumeric code, known as HUID. Fatehchand Ranka, president of the federation, said, “The various penal provisions and arbitrary implementation of the hallmarking process by changing old simple system by Bureau of Indian Standards are taking away the ease of business for traders, the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises and jewellers.” He said, “The rule has been mandatory only in 256 districts and not the rest of India. This will be a blow to our business when we are looking forward to a pick-up in sales ahead of the festive season.” Ranka said issuing the six-digit alphanumeric code would put ornaments submitted for evaluation at the risk of getting damaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jewellers-keep-shutters-down-to-protest-new-hallmarking-process/articleshow/85576941.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Apart from the IITs, Central Building Research Institute of Roorkee, IP University, IMG Punjab Technical University, HNB Garhwal University, Kumaon University and LSM Government PG College Pithoragarh were also involved in the research. Titled “high resolution geological and geotechnical mapping along Rishikesh-Kedarnath national highways”, the study was conducted by 13 teams of the institutions. They divided the 223-km long stretch of the national highway into 21 zones for their field study. They found around 100 places right from Rishikesh to Kedarnath where rocks are weak and there are over 40 points out of them like Dharasu, Raithali, Vyasi, Utrasu, Kaliyasaun, Saknidhar, Baswa, Phata, Soneprayag and Rambada where chances of landslide are “high” owing to weakened rocks strength and shear strength of debris. However, some remedial suggestions to minimise landslide vulnerability at these 40 places were also given in the study. “Though remedial was not part of our study, but we have included some measures in the study report. Presence of proper drainage system along the national highway, maintaining of slop angle of the rocks, provision of benching (stair-step condition) on weak rocks are some works with that we can minimise incidents of landslides,” said Prof SP Pradhan, a faculty from earth sciences department of IIT-Roorkee who was involved in the research.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rishikesh-kedarnath-highway-has-40-spots-with-high-landslide-vulnerability-finds-study/articleshow/85572089.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||Nagpur||Refund Rs18.71L to sr citizens tricked in KYC fraud, SBI told||Nagpur: Squarely fixing responsibility on banks in case of online fraudulent transactions, the Gondia District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to refund Rs18.71 lakh to two senior citizens who had lost the amount after being tricked by a fraudster under the pretext of Know Your Customer (KYC) rules. Of the total amount to be refunded, Rs18.36 lakh is to be paid with 6% interest since November 22, 2019, when the complaint was lodged. The banking behemoth was further told to pay Rs25,000 towards mental agony and suffering caused to the aged couple and Rs10,000 towards the legal cost. While partly allowing complaint of Dr Suresh (65) and Minakshi Katre (61) filed through counsels Mahendra Limaye and Mayank Gupta, a bench comprising president Yogesh Khatri and member Sarita Raipure asked SBI to conduct internal inquiry and recover the amount from salaries of officers concerned “who committed dereliction in duty and caused losses to the public bank”. The forum said that it is important to recover such an amount from a public servant “who has performed their duty capriciously and caused harassment and mental agony to the complainants”. Pointing out that only after completing all formalities of Aadhaar verification, PAN card details, ID and valid address proof, an account is opened, the judges said the banks are having networks and can easily help the customers in cases where they lose the amount to online tricksters. “If an online fraudulent transaction took place, the amount is still in the system till working time. The banks can easily stop payments to protect customer’s interest. Whoever has withdrawn the amount fraudulently from a bank account can be identified easily,” the forum observed. Observing that the details of fraudsters can be traced, the bench said banks, however, do not help poor customers and even its employees share their details with fraudsters. “A person’s details are only with the bank, then how come anyone know that s/he has an account in a particular branch? It is a burden on the part of the bank and its employees to discharge their duties first, then only the complainant can be held responsible for any alleged negligence,” the forum said. Citing various provisions in the Consumer Protection Act, the forum said that once the complaint was made citing specific incidents of unauthorized withdrawal, it was the banks’ duty to carry out the necessary verification, rather than washing their hands off. “Looking from any angle, the SBI miserably failed to discharge its burden. Evidently, there has been a deficiency in service on its part,” the forum observed. Limaye told TOI that the judgment established that even if police have not fully investigated a cyber crime case, the victims can fight for their rights in cyberspace through consumer courts and can get the lost amount back. What forum said * SBI to recover lost amount from salaries of concerned officers/staff * It should be done after conducting internal inquiry * If fraudulent transaction took place, amount is still in system till working time * Banks can easily stop payments to protect customers’ interest better * Whoever has withdrawn amount fraudulently can be identified easily * Banks don’t help customers and its employees share their details with fraudsters||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/refund-rs18-71l-to-sr-citizens-tricked-in-kyc-fraud-sbi-told/articleshow/85578856.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Ahmedabad||Cut GST on edible oils to benefit consumers: Trade body||AHMEDABAD: To ease the burden on end-consumers, the government should reduce the goods and services tax (GST) on edible oils rather cutting import duty on them, a trade body of local oil millers has suggested. The Gujarat State Edible Oils and Oil Seeds Association (GSEOOSA) has urged the central government to bring down the GST on edible oils to 2-2.5% and raise the duty on their imports to the highest possible levels. “If the government is serious about reducing rates of edible oils and easing the burden on our consumers, they should reduce GST on edible oils and not the import duty,” said the association’s president Sameer Shah. The point was made by Shah in a letter written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Edible oils attract 5% GST. “A 15kg tin of all edible oils costs between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,600 in the market,” said Shah. “The GST on them ranges from Rs 100 to Rs 130 per tin, while edible oil vendors get a profit of Rs 20 to Rs 30 per tin or at the most Rs 50 per tin in a rare case.” Shah said that the cut in import duty on some edible oils such as crude palmolein, crude soyabean, and sunflower oil has benefitted a handful of domestic importers as well as farmers and traders of other countries. Shah added that the wholesale prices of palmolein oil went up from Rs 112 per kg to Rs 126 per kg even after the reduction of import duty on crude palm oil (CPO) a couple of months ago. “The government lost revenue and consumers did not get cheaper oils,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cut-gst-on-edible-oils-to-benefit-consumers-trade-body/articleshow/85576958.cms||---

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah granted an early hearing and listed it for Friday after advocate Anand Varma, who filed the petition on behalf of two group housing societies, alleged that full-fledged construction is going on and irreversible damage to the environment would be done if it is not stayed. The court issued notice to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) seeking its response. Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioners, said NHAI is building an already constructed small road which passes through densely populated colonies and has six schools on its periphery. He contended that NHAI did not hold any public consultation and did not get any environmental clearances and trees were being cut even after the permission granted to do so lapsed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-issues-notice-to-nhai-over-illegal-construction-of-dwarka-e-way-flyover/articleshow/85574878.cms||---

The three individuals in question had been deployed as commandoes, part of a security team at the Indian Embassy in Kabul, which was attacked after the Taliban usurped power in the Afghan capital. Dastgir Mulla from Chikkodi, Manjunath Maali from Bagalkot and Ravi Nilagar from Gadag, had been working in Kabul since 2019, and are currently quarantined in New Delhi. Maali recounted to TOI the harrowing experience they endured when the embassy came under attack. “We were attacked four times when we were en route the Kabul Airport from the embassy,” said Maali. Senior diplomatic officials and the commandoes left Afghanistan on board a special flight on August 16. Mulla’s wife Ravoof, who is in her eight month of pregnancy, had been calling him frantically since August 13, impatient to learn about his state. Mulla said that, while instances of violence were common in Afghanistan, the situation turned particularly chaotic after the Taliban seized power in the capital. “People could be seen running on the streets, and one could hear shots being fired every 30 minutes. The Taliban did not want those in the Indian Embassy to leave since they wished to negotiate with our government. When they learnt that we were evacuating the embassy, they gheraoed the office and started firing in the air. We defended the embassy, and did not allow them to enter the office,” Mulla added. His wife Ravoof was ecstatic on hearing his voice over the phone when Mulla called her from Delhi. The commandoes, who arrived in Gujarat from Kabul, travelled to New Delhi by road, where they are quarantined. They are expected to stay for a month’s time in the National Capital, where they will complete necessary formalities, before travelling to Karnataka. In Balaganur village in Gadag, Ravi Neelagar’s family was joy unbound on learning of their son’s safe return from Afghanistan. Neelagar has been working as a constable with the ITBP for the past 13 years, and was posted to Afghanistan in October 2019. It was not without palpitations that the family awaited news of Neelagar after they learnt of the Taliban’s takeover. They recalled the attack on the contingent of 200 soldiers, who were to be airlifted on August 17, by Taliban militants. It was only when they spoke to Neelagar on a video call on Saturday that they heaved a sigh of relief. He is expected to return home once the quarantine period is over. Neelagar’s mother Neelavva, wife Yellavva and son Santosh, who are in Hulkoti village, expressed their joy on hearing of his return to India. - (With inputs from Sangamesh Menasinakai)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/three-itbp-personnel-from-n-ktaka-return-home-families-relieved/articleshow/85542727.cms||---

An unhindered view of the racecourse is being peddled as one of the perks of the cycling track. BMC officials said architects from the Rachna Sansad School of Design and civic engineers are finalising the plan. “The Mahalaxmi Racecourse cycle track will have a footpath and a cycle track. We will demolish a wall and replace it with a fence to offer an open view of the racecourse. Currently, the entire stretch opposite Famous Studio is lying unused. It will be transformed into a usable space for both pedestrians and cyclists,” said Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner, G-South Ward. He said the project would be completed in around six months. “It will be cost effective. We will also illuminate the stretch and make it cleaner, safer and accessible to all. There will be equal space for pedestrians and cyclists on the 500m stretch,” Ughade said. “This is part of the pedestrianisation and beautification from Dadar station to Mahalaxmi along Senapati Bapat Marg. It will be accessible to both pedestrians and cyclists. The wall will make way for see-through grilles,” said Worli MLA Aaditya Thackeray. While the BMC is pushing for more cycle tracks, cyclists and mobility experts have pointed out that constructing cycle tracks alone will not be enough to promote cycling in the city. Mumbai’s bicycle mayor Firoza Suresh said there should be a feasibility study on how the tracks will engage cyclists throughout the day. “Else it will be like the BKC cycle track which did not attract hardcore cyclists and the project eventually fizzled out,” she said. She also underlined the need for a “continuity plan”. “A single patch can help neighbourhood cyclists, but when you take a civic ward and work on a cycling network plan with proper junction management, surveillance, and continuity from any part of the ward to another, it will encourage more cyclists to use the track,” she said. Transport expert Pranav Naik lauded the idea of cycling tracks, but rued the closure of events such as equal streets, and the weekend cycling track from NCPA to Worli. He said if cycling tracks were viewed as a “recreational activity,” rather than a mode of transport, it wouldn’t contribute to a healthier or safer city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-peddles-walkway-and-cycling-track-at-racecourse/articleshow/85576987.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Delta plus cases confirmed in 5 Vidarbha districts on Monday||NAGPUR: Amravati, Nagpur, Bhandara, Gadchiroli and Yavatmal are among the seven districts in Maharashtra where total 27 cases of Delta+ variant of Covid-19 have been confirmed, informed state health department. As the genome sequencing results were out on Monday, six Delta+ cases were confirmed in Amravati, considered as the place from where the Delta variant of Covid-19 originated. Five samples from Nagpur, six from Gadchiroli, three from Yavatmal and one from Bhandara were also confirmed as Delta+ cases. Now, Wardha, Washim and Buldhana are the three districts in Vidarbha where Delta+ cases are not yet confirmed. During last week’s results, cases were found in Gondia, Akola and Chandrapur. Eight out of the 11 districts in Vidarbha now have confirmed presence of Delta+ variant. Initially, the authorities in Bhandara and Nagpur informed that all the patients whose samples were sent for genome sequencing, including Monday’s Delta+ confirmed cases, have already recovered. However, authorities are now taking further information about these patients and their contact-tracing history. Akola, Chandrapur, and Gondia — where Delta+ cases were detected last week — confirmed that the patients have already recovered and doing well. Experts had told TOI then only that Delta+ is just another mutation of Covid-19 virus and not as dangerous as the Delta variant, which had played havoc in the state during April-May period. “Twenty-seven more Delta+ patients have been registered in the state on Monday. This brings the total number of Delta+ cases in the state to 103,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. Overall, Vidarbha reported 13 new cases and 34 recoveries on Monday.

Jamshedpur Jewellers Association president Vipin Adesra clarified that they were not against hallmarking policy but said HUID will neither benefit the customers nor the shopkeepers. He said under the present system of hallmarking, there is no provision of protecting the interests of the customers and giving them quality products. He said on the businessman’s part, those found not following the system would be liable for legal action, which in coming days if not revoked, will promote “inspector raj” of the past. So Adesra wanted the Centre to immediately amend the policy for the benefit of customers and shop owners. Notably, the token strike was called by the All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council and was supported by more than 350 associations across the country. According to jewellers, they cannot accept the new HUID as it has nothing to do with the purity of gold. The BIS feels the new HUID will improve gold purity but jewellers think it is just a tracking mechanism. The jewellers said the new system HUID is not foolproof as there have been lots of issues such as double HUID on the same piece, same HUID on multiple pieces of jewellery and so on. Gold hallmarking, a purity certification of the precious metal, was voluntary in nature so far. Jewellers selling non-certified products are to face fines from September. Mandatory gold hallmarking has come into force from June 16 in a phased manner. The government has identified 256 districts from 28 states and Union Territories for the phase-1 implementation and is applicable to jewellers with an annual turnover above Rs 40 lakh. Jamshedpur Jewellers Association secretary Kamal Singhania said the present system of hallmarking is a time-consuming process too. So, both customers and jewellers have to face problems as delivery of ornaments will take a longer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/300-jsr-jewellers-on-strike-in-protest-against-hallmark-policy/articleshow/85575713.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

GFP said that the police must take immediate action by increasing patrolling and ensuring quick investigations. “Government and police should ensure that all women across the state of Goa have dedicated and full-proof security that will impart much needed confidence and reassurance to them,” said GFP vice president Ashma Bi. GFP has threatened to agitate if the government fails to take steps to make Goa safe for women. The GFP delegation met Goa director general of police (DGP) Mukesh Kumar Meena and recommended that women should be encouraged to join the police force. “Self-defence training and awareness campaigns along with meaningful interactions regularly with girls and women across campuses and workplaces will go a long way,” said Colvale zilla panchayat member Kavita Kandolkar. “Goa is a tourist destination but our state is sending a bad message everywhere. This should not happen,” Bi said. “The manifold increase in crimes against women in Goa has put a black mark on our state which was once known to be the safest and most secure for residents and tourists alike despite the liberal way of life we proudly practice.” Former chairperson and present Margao Municipal councillor Pooja Naik questioned the BJP’s women’s wing stand on the consecutive rape cases, murders, and assaults on women in Goa. “Why are BJP women wing mum over the crime rate increased against women” Pooja Naik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/increase-patrolling-to-make-state-safe-place-for-women/articleshow/85577014.cms||---
---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand: First Sanskrit school in East Singhbhum named after Dr APJ Abdul Kalam||JAMSHEDPUR: A Muslim-owned organisation named Abdul Hanan Memorial Educational, Welfare and Charitable Society, (AHMEWCS) here will open the first Sanskrit school in the district next month on the occasion of Teachers’ Day. The Jharkhand Academic Council (JAC)-affiliated Sanskrit school, which is named after former President of India, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, will conduct primary and secondary classes. “For quite some time our organisation was planning to open a Sanskrit-medium school and earlier this year, when we learnt that some Muslim students were facing difficulty in getting admission in the Sanskrit schools of the neighbouring districts, we decided to start our own school,” AHMEWCS secretary Mohammad Tahir Hussein said, adding that the ground work for opening the school was going on for the past two years. “As soon as JAC gave its approval, we started with process of hiring teachers and so on,” Hussein said. Spread across two acres of land, the two-storeyed building at Kalikanagar in Jawaharnagar, Mango, students from all religions are welcome to enrol themselves in the school, Hussein said. In order to inaugurate the school on September 5, the management committee of the institute is working on war-footing to complete hiring and admission-related work. “The appointment of teachers and non-teaching staff will be over by the end of this month. We are also conducting the admission process of the students simultaneously,” Hussein said. “As an initial step, we have readied nine classrooms to begin the session,” he added. Presently, three JAC-affiliated Sanskrit schools are operating in Kolhan division. “Every year 2,500 students from Jamshedpur sit for the Sanskrit board exams,” he said. AHMEWCS has been running two schools -- APJ Abdul Kalam High School and APJ Abdul Kalam Inter College -- since 2008 and a total of 2,000 students are enrolled in the two schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/1st-sanskrit-school-in-e-sbhum-named-after-kalam/articleshow/85575474.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Pathalgarhi-style notice inside Jharkhand's Palamu Tiger Reserve||DALTONGANJ: In a Pathalgarhi-styled move infamous in Khunti, Chaibasa and other tribal-dominated districts of Jharkhand, villagers of Latehar have put up a signboard to declare their rights inside the Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR), citing the Forest Rights Act (FRA). The move is allegedly aimed against the development of the village, which has a hot spring, as a tourist spot. The signboard put up by the gram sabha under Morwai panchayat of Barwadih block deep inside the reserve warned the PTR officials against taking up development projects which will be harmful to the ecology. The notice in Hindi said the gram sabha is authorised to protect, conserve and manage the community forest resource guaranteed to them by the FRA 2006 and its 2008 rules which were further amended in 2012. A few meters away from the signboard, the villagers also wrote “sari jungle hamari hai (All parts of the jungle are ours)” on a rock. No member of the gram sabha agrees to come on record over the installation of the signboard fearing administrative action but said it was a declaration of the gram sabha. The declaration in the signboard said it was adopted on April 17, 2018, coinciding with the period when a series of stone tablets were erected under the Pathalgarhi movement in the Khunti district. The declaration prohibits the setting of fire in the forest, felling of trees and harming the wild animals or the biodiversity of the forest by any sort of activity without the permission of the gram sabha. The villagers have also mentioned that anyone violating the norms would be punished by the gram sabha under Section 5 of the FRA. Forester (in-charge) Akhilesh Kumar said though the signboard is signed by the gram sabha in 2018, it was erected recently. “The gram sabha notification is just a 'cover up' as some influential tribals want to enjoy control over the forests,” he said, dismissing reports that the villagers unanimously agreed to put up the signage. PTR (north division) deputy director Kumar Ashish claimed that it is the handiwork of one influential tribal identified as Ganesh Singh. Ashish also said after action by the forest department for felling trees against Singh in January this year, the signboard came into the public domain prominently. Ashish, however, admitted that it was there for long. It may be noted that a tourist spot is under construction at a hot spring in the village inside the reserve reportedly after getting the nod from the PTR officials. Talking to TOI, Barwadih block development officer Rakesh Sahay said the villagers have the right over the community forest resource as they were given the title under the FRA. “We are not aware of the signboard put up by the villagers but due to certain technical reasons, we have temporarily restricted construction in the area. The villagers had applied also for PM Awas Yojna after obtaining the land title,” he said. Asked if a gram sabha permission is necessary for the development of the village into a tourist hotspot, Sahay admitted that there is a provision to take permission from the village entity under the FRA. “The forest department can develop the area as a tourist place and if it wants, we can arrange for a meeting with the gram sabha, but no such proposal has come yet,” he said. Noted wildlife expert D S Srivastav said the hot water spring can change the look and economy of the village if the gram sabha allows the PTR officials to complete the work. The approach road to the hot water spring is in a bad shape and there is no privacy for tourists who want to have a hot water bath there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pathalgarhi-style-notice-inside-ptr/articleshow/85576061.cms||M F AHMED
---||Ranchi||Excess rainfall far worse for crops than deficit, say experts||Ranchi: Though Jharkhand has received normal rainfall during the monsoon season this year, the spatial distribution has remained highly uneven. The cumulative rainfall in the state was recorded at 735.5mm till Monday as against the seasonal normal rainfall of 754.3mm, indicating a shortfall of 2%, which is considered normal in Met parlance. However, the spatial variation in rainfall distribution has been substantial and out of 24 districts, 11 are at two extremes. While 13 districts have received near-normal rainfall, five — Lohardaga, Latehar, Koderma, Dhanbad and Jamtara — have received excess rainfall with a deviation of as high as 57%. As against 708.2mm normal, Lohardaga till date has received 1,109.5mm rainfall till Monday. In contrast, adjoining Gumla which should have received 829.7mm rainfall, has received a mere 515.6mm indicating a shortfall of 38%. Gumla is in the group of six rainfall-deficient districts which also include the majority of south-western districts — Simdega, Khunti, West Singhbhum, Seraikela, Kharsawan and Chatra. In terms of Kharif crop, though monsoon rain is absolutely essential, with near-normal rainfall recorded all over the state, experts believe that deficit rain in the six districts may not cause adverse effects. Agromet advisor and weather scientist at Birsa Agriculture University, Abdul Wadood, said excess rain can be a cause of worry for the farmers than those in rainfall-deficient districts. “Till date the coverage of paddy crops is good and if there is no prolonged dry spell, there would not be any adverse impact on the crop,” he said. The agriculture experts have noticed that crop failure is not linked to less quantum of rain but uneven seasonal distribution, marked with long dry spells. Wadood, however, expressed concern about the maize and pulse crops in the districts which have been receiving excess rainfall. “Standing water is detrimental for maize and pulses and they can suffer badly even if water stands for more than 24 hours,” he said. But farmers have been trained to follow a ridge and furrow system for maize and pulses to ensure natural drainage, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/excess-rainfall-far-worse-for-crops-than-deficit-say-experts/articleshow/85575580.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Sahibganj primary health centre officer held for issuing fake vaccination certificates||DUMKA: A community health officer working on contract at a primary health centre (PHC) in Sahibganj district was arrested on Sunday for selling fake Covid vaccination certificates, officials said on Monday. The accused is identified as Mangni Ram Landi, who was posted in a Mandai area PHC under the Rajmahal sub-division. Another community health officer named Kripan Meena, who works at a PHC in Lakhipur, is a suspect in the case and is absconding. Deputy commissioner Ramnivas Yadav said he has ordered a detailed probe into the entire vaccination drive in the district to find out further loopholes, including ascertaining if any vaccine doses were misused. The administration has initiated action against Mangni based on a video, which went viral on Sunday, in which he was seen negotiating with someone to sell fake vaccination certificates to around 65 migrant workers at Rs 500 each. Yadav said prima facie the allegations levelled against Mangni appear to be true. “We are trying to track down Kripan and I have directed the district health department to conduct a thorough probe and ascertain the number of persons who have received the fake certificates,” he added. Highlighting the modus operandi of the accused, Yadav said, “Mangni used to alter the details of the bonafide beneficiary in the certificate by editing the name and other credentials and issue the certificate to someone else. By buying such fake certificates, many misled the administration by claiming that they were vaccinated. I am unable to gauge why these people were hesitant in taking the jabs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sahibganj-phc-officer-held-for-issuing-fake-vax-certificates/articleshow/85576014.cms||---

He was 79. Ambhaikar was in the league of the legendary Purushottam Darvekar, who pioneered ‘Ranjan Kala Mandir’ in Nagpur, one of the all-time great theatre groups in Maharashtra. Ambhaikar worked as Ranjan’s trademark director in the post-Darvekar era and nurtured generations of actors, writers, and directors. He leaves behind wife, two sons, and a host of relatives to mourn the loss. Last rites were performed at Mokshadham on Monday. Ambhaikar, who retired from the Reserve Bank of India, continued his association with theatre during his job and also after retirement. He directed many award-winning Marathi as well as Hindi plays for the Maharashtra State Theatre Festival. Apart from the competitions, plays by great writers like PL Deshpande, Jaywant Dalvi, Mahesh Elkunchwar, and CT Khanolkar directed by Ambhaikar are still remembered as milestones in amateur theatre. Theatre-lovers and activists paid tributes to Ambhaikar on Monday. Nagpur branch of Natya Parishad, Maharashtra Sanskrutik Aghadi and other groups also recalled his five-decade-long association and valuable contribution in the development of Nagpur’s theatre scene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/theatre-veteran-ramesh-ambhaikar-no-more/articleshow/85577001.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Ranchi||159 language teachers’ posts created||Ranchi: The state government on Monday announced the creation of over 159 new posts for professors and assistant professors for undergraduate levels in Kolhan University, headquartered in Chaibasa (West Singhbhum), an Adivasi dominated pocket of the state. Officials said the move will strengthen the academic ecosystem and boost regional and tribal language studies. Chief minister Hemant Soren made the announcement in a tweet. The Hemant government’s move came after amending the recruitment rules for government’s grade III and IV jobs, which made the knowledge of local/indigenous languages and rituals compulsory for an applicant. The CM’s focus now is on boosting studies of local languages. The fresh posts have been created for professors/principals and assistant professors in four languages namely, Santhali, Kuduk, Kurmali and Mundari across 14 constituent colleges of the university and its associated centres of regional subjects/learning. Of the total posts, 147 are for professors, eight for assistant professors and four are for principals. Six posts each of professors have been created for Kuduk, Santhali, Kurmali and Mundari languages. Talking to TOI, the additional chief secretary of the state higher and technical education department, K K Khandelwal, said the government will up the fresh as well as existing vacancies across different universities on priority. He also said the varsities have been asked to send proposals in this regard at the earliest. “The Kolhan University had sent us the proposal for the creation of new posts for regional and tribal languages and we forwarded the file with chief minister’s consent,” Khandelwal said. Kolhan University’s vice-chancellor Gangadhar Panda welcomed the decision but maintained that they were yet to receive formal communication on the creation of new posts. He said, “At the post-graduate level, we had some academic strength for tribal and regional languages but at undergraduate and college levels, we don’t have any posts since the creation of the varsity in 2009.” He added, “Depending on the demands from the colleges and to fulfil our responsibility towards safeguarding regional languages and students’ interest, we had moved a proposal for the creation of the new posts. In some colleges in Ghatshila and Chakradharpur, we were imparting studies in regional courses, but all manpower was on ad hoc basis so far.” Meanwhile, many public representatives continue to raise their voices against the recent amendments in the recruitment policy for grade III and IV jobs conducted by the Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission (JSSC). On Monday, BJP’s MLA from Godda, Amit Mandal, dubbed the government’s decision to make passing out of matriculation and intermediate from state schools compulsory as a violation of Article 16 of the Constitution. In a letter to the chief minister, Mandal said in the Santhal Pargana division where the SPT Act is in force, there are hardly any good schools and colleges, resulting in forcing the locals to move to Bihar to pursue their studies. In such cases, the bonafide residents of the state will not get the chance to take up jobs in their state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/159-language-teachers-posts-created/articleshow/85575513.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||State leaders laud Bihar move but have no plans to meet PM||Ranchi: The ruling Mahagathbandhan parties in the state on Monday appreciated the efforts of the all-party delegation of Bihar led by its chief minister Nitish Kumar to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press for a caste-based census but remained indecisive on making a similar move with the Centre. In Jharkhand, the ruling parties comprising JMM, Congress and RJD along with NDA’s ally, Ajsu-P have demanded a caste-based census but they still could not come on one platform to take up the issue with the Union government. Reacting to the developments, JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharjee said, “It’s good that a delegation from Bihar met the PM over the caste-based census. We, too, have been asking for it and have already made our stand clear. The Centre must respect the growing sentiments now.” Asked if JMM, which is the lead partner in the alliance government, would consider making a similar move as done by the ruling JD(U) in Bihar in the coming days or bring any bill in favour of the caste-based census in the monsoon session of the assembly, Bhattacharjee did not reply in the affirmative. He, however, said, “Let’s see what churns out in the monsoon session scheduled from next month after which we will take a call on how to pursue the matter. But our government has already passed a resolution for the Sarna code in assembly last year as per our promise during the polls and sent it to the Centre for approval. The Union government must also include a separate column for the Sarna religion in the upcoming census,” Bhattacharjee said. Congress’s leader of the legislative party and state parliamentary affairs minister, Alamgir Alam, said they are yet to get any clear cut roadmap from the party’s high command on ways to pursue the demand for a caste-based census. He said, “As of now, I am not aware of any proposal to debate on the caste-based census in the assembly. It can only be done after a consultation with party leadership and the alliance partners. But my personal view is that a caste-based census, especially a headcount of OBCs, must be done as a similar exercise for SC/STs and religions are conducted. Why such discrimination?” Meanwhile, NDA ally, Ajsu-P said it has already written to the prime minister seeking a caste-based census. A party leader said, “Our party president Sudesh Mahto wrote a letter to PM in this regard a few weeks back and also welcomed Centre’s move to provide reservation for OBCs in dental and medical courses. After the passage of the OBC Bill in Parliament, which empowers states to fix reservation limit, it is even more important to have a caste-based census.” Even as the political parties could not come to a single platform on the issue, Jharkhand OBC Arakshan Manch is continuing with its outreach programme to seek a hike in the reservation for jobs and educational courses for OBCs to 27% from the existing 14% in the state. On Monday, the outfit’s president Kailash Yadav submitted a memorandum to Jharkhand Congress affairs in-charge RPN Singh in Delhi in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-leaders-laud-bihar-move-but-have-no-plans-to-meet-pm/articleshow/85575946.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Directions have been issued by the district authorities to conduct Covid-19 tests on a regular basis on people visiting schools and other educational institutions, and it has also been decided that special vaccination camps would be organised to inoculate teachers. Talking to TOI, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said: “We are monitoring the situation on a daily basis and have instructed deputy commissioners of all districts to carry out Covid-19 tests regularly. We will also organise special vaccination camps for teachers and other school and college staff who are not fully vaccinated.” Asked about maintaining Covid-19 protocols in schools, Deepa Mandal, the prinicipal of Ranchi Zila School, said: “We are ensuring that the SOP issued by the state are followed like ensuring social distancing, compulsory wearing of masks at all times and sanitizing the premises after a few days. We have also asked students to carry sanitizers and masks.” Notably, a total of 42,672 beneficiaries were vaccinated on Sunday, of which 32,067 received their first dose while 10,635 received their second jab. Cumulatively, a total of 23,16,530 beneficiaries have been completely inoculated in the state while 93,19,833 have received their first shot. The state received a fresh consignment of 22 boxes of Covishield on Sunday afternoon, taking the total stock of vaccines in the state to around six lakh. “As of Sunday evening, we have an opening stock of six lakh vaccine doses. Out of total six lakh doses, 4,32,220 are Covishield and 1,67,780 are Covaxin,” a health department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/special-vax-drives-to-be-conducted-for-teaching-non-teaching-staff-in-schools/articleshow/85575079.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Nagpur||57% increase in power demand met by green energy, but emissions still grow 5%: Study||Nagpur: While the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report sounds the death knell for coal and fossil fuels ‘before they destroy our planet’, research shows that instead of a decline, global emissions from the power sector have increased 5% due to continued reliance on fossil fuel. The latest report released by Ember, a London-based research organisation that tracks coal to clean transitions in the power sector, reveals that while the majority of the global electricity demand growth was met by renewable energy (57%), about 43% was met by coal. “For the first time, wind and solar generated over a tenth of global electricity and overtook nuclear generation,” adds the report, which analyses electricity data from 63 countries representing 87% of the electricity demand. On the brighter side, almost three-quarters (72%) of India’s increase in demand was met by growth in solar (+47%) and wind (+9%). However, on the darker front, coal generation increased by 4%, to fill the remaining gap in demand and also to fill reduced hydroelectricity generation, the report states. “Continued impact of the pandemic in first half of this year kept electricity demand in the country muted and coal rises minimal. Electricity demand in first half of this year 2021 was only 3% higher than first half of 2019 levels,” the report adds. While many countries pledged to propel their economies into a new green normal, the analysis shows that no country has yet achieved a truly ‘green recovery’ for their power sector, with structural change in both higher electricity demand and lower CO2 power sector emissions. “Countries with rising electricity demand also saw higher emissions, as coal generation increased as well as wind and solar. These ‘grey recovery’ countries are mostly in Asia, including China, Bangladesh, India, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan and Vietnam. These countries are yet to decouple emissions and electricity demand growth,” the report states. “Catapulting emissions in 2021 should send alarm bells across the world,” says Ember’s global lead Dave Jones. “We are not building back better, we are building back badly. A lightning-fast electricity transition in this decade is critical to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees. The electricity transition is happening but not with the urgency required: emissions are going in the wrong direction.” Highlighting that developing Asia can leapfrog fossils and move straight to cheap, clean renewables, Ember’s senior analyst Muyi Yang says, “Developing Asia must focus its attention on meeting all demand growth with new zero-carbon electricity as a first initial step of the region’s journey towards 100% clean electricity before mid-century. But this is contingent on whether the region can further accelerate its inexorable march of clean electricity while at the same time use electricity more efficiently.” Infographics: NOT SO GREEN RECOVERY - Global emissions from power sector increased 5% - Majority of global electricity demand growth was met by renewable energy (57%), 43% was met by coal - Almost three-quarters of India’s increase in demand met by growth in solar and wind - Coal generation in India increased by 4% - No country achieved ‘green recovery’ for power sector||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/57-increase-in-power-demand-met-by-green-energy-but-emissions-still-grow-5-study/articleshow/85620398.cms||Manka Behl
---||Nagpur||Malls in Nagpur open to shut down as 2-dose norm pricks all||NAGPUR: Soon after being allowed to remain open till 10pm, a number malls in the city have only shut down. The reason: A recent order restricts entry to only those having got both the doses of Covid vaccine, not less than 14 days ago. This is applicable to both staff and consumers. This has led to a major impact on the malls as manpower in these establishments is mainly young. “The vaccination for 18 to 44 age group only began on June 21. A person who got the first dose on June 21 can get the second one only sometime in mid-September. This means, a mall employee cannot enter the premises till then, as even the 14-day period after vaccination has to be counted,” pointed out Dipen Agrawal, president of Sarkar Jagaon, Vanijya Bachao campaign by traders demanding opening up of businesses. With a large number of staff yet to be vaccinated, majority of the malls have decided to rather shut down than face action by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The timing relaxation order came with the dictum that each one of the workers in a mall needed to be fully vaccinated. The civic body had held a meeting of the mall management representatives and they were warned of action if the rule was not followed. Major malls in the city include Eternity at Variety Square, Nagpur Central on Canal Road, Landmark in Ramdaspeth, Empress Mall near Shukrawari Lake and VR Mall near Medical Square. Sources in the management of most of the establishments said they did not have enough staff who had got both the doses. “We have nearly 500 workers in our establishment. Most of the employees are below 45 years, who have not been vaccinated as the drive itself started recently. Getting both the doses for each of them may be difficult. It’s tough to answer when our mall would start. It is hoped that some of the staff may be available by next month. Even individual shopkeepers need to get their staff vaccinated,” said an official in one of the older malls in West Nagpur, requesting not to be named. Nagpur Central, whose management claims it is not technically a mall because of single-billing system, too has shut down. A source here said there are over 280 employees in the mall, out of which only 30-odd have been fully vaccinated. Some more would be added by next month, after which the shops may open. At Empress Mall, an official said almost 30% of the shops are open and staff in the rest is yet to be vaccinated. It has been learnt that a number of shops in VR Mall were also closed. The NMC also runs a drive-in vaccination centre at these malls. There have been times when the doses were short, said sources here.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Malls open to shut down as 2-dose norm pricks all||NAGPUR: Soon after being allowed to remain open till 10pm, a number malls in the city have only shut down. The reason: A recent order restricts entry to only those having got both the doses of Covid vaccine, not less than 14 days ago. This is applicable to both staff and consumers. This has led to a major impact on the malls as manpower in these establishments is mainly young. “The vaccination for 18 to 44 age group only began on June 21. A person who got the first dose on June 21 can get the second one only sometime in mid-September. This means, a mall employee cannot enter the premises till then, as even the 14-day period after vaccination has to be counted,” pointed out Dipen Agrawal, president of Sarkar Jagaon, Vanijya Bachao campaign by traders demanding opening up of businesses. With a large number of staff yet to be vaccinated, majority of the malls have decided to rather shut down than face action by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The timing relaxation order came with the dictum that each one of the workers in a mall needed to be fully vaccinated. The civic body had held a meeting of the mall management representatives and they were warned of action if the rule was not followed. Major malls in the city include Eternity at Variety Square, Nagpur Central on Canal Road, Landmark in Ramdaspeth, Empress Mall near Shukrawari Lake and VR Mall near Medical Square. Sources in the management of most of the establishments said they did not have enough staff who had got both the doses. “We have nearly 500 workers in our establishment. Most of the employees are below 45 years, who have not been vaccinated as the drive itself started recently. Getting both the doses for each of them may be difficult. It’s tough to answer when our mall would start. It is hoped that some of the staff may be available by next month. Even individual shopkeepers need to get their staff vaccinated,” said an official in one of the older malls in West Nagpur, requesting not to be named. Nagpur Central, whose management claims it is not technically a mall because of single-billing system, too has shut down. A source here said there are over 280 employees in the mall, out of which only 30-odd have been fully vaccinated. Some more would be added by next month, after which the shops may open. At Empress Mall, an official said almost 30% of the shops are open and staff in the rest is yet to be vaccinated. It has been learnt that a number of shops in VR Mall were also closed. The NMC also runs a drive-in vaccination centre at these malls. There have been times when the doses were short, said sources here.

Additional sessions judge Gagandeep Singh said it appeared that the probe was being carried out according to the convenience of the investigating authority instead of the mandate of the law. The court had earlier asked police to file a status report on the 35 leaders named in the FIR. The court said the report filed by police was an attempt to sidetrack the issue. It added the investigating officer had tried to play a video that was stated to be the main evidence against gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana but it wasn’t up to the mark. The court was hearing Sidhana’s anticipatory bail plea. The judge said there was no audio and one could not figure out what Sidhana was saying to the other protesters. It asked for a proper video of the alleged instigating speech given by Sidhana to be submitted. It added that a detailed reply forwarded by a senior officer be also filed by August 26. Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, appearing for Sidhana, told the court that the FIR was registered 12 hours after the incident and 35 leaders had been named, apart from other instigators. However, despite eight months having lapsed, none of them has been arrested or asked to join the investigation. He claimed that the reply filed by the police was an attempt to mislead the court as well as sidetrack the main issue regarding the involvement of the real conspirators. Additional public prosecutor GS Guarya, appearing for the police, admitted that the report filed was cryptic and did not address the issues raised by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/republic-day-violence-35-farmer-leaders-named-in-fir-none-called-delhi-high-court-raps-police/articleshow/85580830.cms||Usha Das

The terrorists were hiding among boys who were playing cricket at Aloochi Bagh, IG (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said. On receiving information, 10 policemen rushed to the field and cordoned it. They asked them to surrender but the terrorists opened fire. Police retaliated and shot them down, he said. The slain terrorists included Abbas Sheikh of Kulgam and Saqib Manzoor, who hailed from Old Barazulla. The latter had killed two cops at Anantang in February this year. As per officials, Sheikh was the mastermind behind most of the killings undertaken by LeT in past one year. Manzoor, a post graduate student when he joined LeT last year, quickly rose through the ranks as he was believed to have executed some of the killings in and around Srinagar at Sheikh's behest"Top commander of proscribed terror outfit LeT/TRF Abbas Sheikh and his 2IC Saqib Manzoor killed. A big success," Kumar tweeted. Meanwhile, a CRPF personnel was injured after militants hurled a grenade on a bunker of paramilitary force in Srinagar on Monday.

---||Delhi||‘We’re not a Taliban state': Delhi court rejects Pinki Chaudhary’s plea||NEW DELHI: Dismissing the anticipatory bail application of Hindu Raksha Dal president Pinki Chaudhary in a case related to communal slogans allegedly raised at Jantar Mantar, a Delhi court has said “we are not a Taliban state” and the rule of law is the “sacrosanct governing principle in our plural and multicultural society". Additional sessions judge Anil Antil observed in an order last Saturday that while India was celebrating “Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav”, some minds were still “chained with intolerant and self-centric beliefs”. He added that such incidents have led to riots in the past. The court said history showed that such incidents have flared up communal tension, leading to riots and causing loss to life and property of the public. It said that the video clip of an interview of Chaudhary was impregnated with “high-octane communal barbs” and “laced with inflammatory, insulting and threatening gestures”. “It…(is) ex facie indicative of the calculative design on the part of the applicant to promote hatred and ill will amongst other sections of the community,” it said in its order. The judge observed that though the right to freedom of speech was a fundamental right, in the garb of the libertarian concept of free speech, the accused cannot be allowed to trample on the constitutional principles which inclusiveness and common brotherhood promote. “We are not a Taliban state. The rule of law is the sacrosanct governing principle in our plural and multicultural society. While the whole of India is celebrating ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, there are some minds still chained with intolerant and self-centric beliefs. The complicity of the applicant/accused in the alleged case crime is prima facie apparent from the material placed before the court. The accusations are serious and the offence alleged is severe in nature,” it observed. The court observed that the investigation was at nascent stage, persons acquainted with the facts of the case were yet to be identified and other persons involved in the incident were absconding. Pointing out that Chaudhary was the president of Hindu Raksha Dal, the judge said that going by the tone and tenure of the speech and the threatening words used in the interview, analyzed in the backdrop of his stature and influence exerted, there was a strong possibility that he might influence or threaten witnesses if released on bail. Chaudhary had sought anticipatory bail, saying he had apprehension of his arrest in a false and frivolous case registered against him by the police, allegedly at the behest of his opponents, who were making false allegations to harm his reputation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/were-not-a-taliban-state-delhi-high-court-rejects-pinki-chaudharys-plea/articleshow/85580875.cms||Usha Das
---||Chandigarh||Khattar to set up panel to probe deaths due O2 shortage||Chandigarh: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday told the state assembly that his government will set up a committee to probe possible negligence by hospitals in treating Covid patients. The statement was made by Khattar during zero hour of the ongoing assembly session, after main opposition party Congress tried to corner him for “misleading” the House with his statement that no death in the state was reported due to the shortage of oxygen during the second wave of Covid-19. Leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda also read out the TOI report, regarding a probe carried by Hisar district administration, confirming that five people died in a private hospital in Hisar because of shortage of oxygen. However, Khattar informed the House that he would make a formal statement on the issue on Tuesday. He also tried to avoid any discussion on the issue during zero hour by referring to some rules of legislative assembly. Even speaker Gian Chand Gupta told Hooda that the CM was not bound to respond to any question asked during zero hour. “You have misled the House, the soul of those died due to shortage of oxygen in the state would not forgive the government for such stance,” Hooda said in the House asking the CM to take his statement back. He also requested the CM to set up a high level committee to probe the incidents of deaths in the state due to shortage of oxygen. After heated arguments, the CM reiterated his previous stance, claiming no death was reported in the state due to shortage of oxygen. He said some irregularities were reported in some hospitals of Hisar, Rewari and Gurugram districts and a magisterial inquiry was conducted for all such complaints. In two reports pertaining to Rewari and Gurugram hospitals, it was stated that no death was reported due to lack of oxygen. In case of Hisar district, the matter of negligence of Soni hospital was highlighted and the said report has been sent to the SP for necessary action, Khattar said but denied shortage of oxygen in Hisar district during second wave. However, Hooda continued to target CM and referred to the concluding part of a report by the Hisar administration, confirming that apparently cause of deaths of patients at Soni Burn hospital in Hisar was shortage of oxygen. To this, Khattar read out another report that indicted the hospital owner for his failure to arrange adequate oxygen despite knowing that patients were on ventilator. As the opposition continued the demand for probe regarding deaths during Covid, CM announced that a committee will be formed to investigate complaints received against hospitals about negligence in giving required treatment during the pandemic. He also informed that around 13,000 people died due to Covid-19 in hospitals across the state. Of these, about 9,500 were residents of Haryana, while about 3,500 patients were from other states. Findings of a probe conducted on direction of Hisar administration Availability of oxygen “On April 25, around 9pm, their stock of liquid medical oxygen was completely finished after they carried the production through air compressor and other ancillary machinery. Again due to some faults their plant was completely shut down from 12am to 4am on April 26 for maintenance. The plant received medical oxygen in tanker at 4am on April 26 from Air Liquid Plant, Panipat,” Anand Gupta, CEO, Gupta Oxygen Pvt Ltd, had admitted before the probe panel. Gupta Oxygen Pvt Ltd was the main supplier of medical oxygen in Hisar About deaths “After going through all the relevant records and files of patients and their summaries, the inquiry committee is of the opinion that shortage of oxygen is the apparent cause of the mortality…,” says finding of a probe panel constituted by Hisar administration regarding death of five patients on intervening night of April 25-26 at Soni Burn hospital Hisar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khattar-to-set-up-panel-to-probe-deaths-due-o2-shortage/articleshow/85577712.cms||Ajay Sura

He was recently arrested from jail along with seven others, including a bank manager, for their alleged involvement in a Rs 200 crore extortion case. On August 10, TOI first highlighted the biggest-ever extortion bid reported in Delhi in terms of the amount of money and that ED had started a parallel probe. The seizures were made after ED officials quizzed Sukesh’s girlfriend, Leena Maria Paul, an actor in the 2013 film “Madras Cafe”. Police suspected she knew about a chunk of the extorted and laundered money. The case was lodged by the ED based on Delhi Police’s probe. The agency will take Sukesh on remand after his police custody ends. Earlier, the Economic Offences Wing had arrested Komal Poddar, manager of the CP branch of RBL Bank, and two of his aides on charges of facilitating and laundering money for Sukesh. The accused were involved in circulating funds and arranging cash for him,” EOW had said. Chandrasekhar was using number spoofing through an app, Crazy Call, to impersonate high-ranking government officials. He would call to strike a deal and the victims would see the numbers on their phone screen as desired by Chandrasekhar. In one of his last calls to a victim, he had impersonated the law secretary, a source said. Two of Chandrasekhar’s associates, Deepak and Pradeep, and two jail officials have also been arrested. In her complaint, the victim said she received a call in June last year wherein the caller introduced himself as a secretary in the Union ministry of law and proposed to help her secure bail for her husband. The caller demanded Rs 200 crore for getting the work done and conveyed the modalities regarding delivery of money. Later, the victim realised that she had been duped as her husband did not get any legal relief. When she approached the law ministry, she was informed that no such communication was made from them. She then lodged a complaint with police.

The sitting began at 2pm and speaker Gian Chand Gupta announced the adjournment of proceedings for the day at 6.18 pm. At 5.55pm, speaker asked a minister to introduce The Panchkula Metropolitan Development Authority Bill. Following this, three more bills — Haryana Goods and Services Tax (2nd Amendment), Parivar Pehchan Patra Bill and Haryana Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair practices) Bill — were introduced till 6.01pm. Then, five bills were passed within minutes. It began with Haryana Management of Civic Amenities and Infrastructure Deficient Municipal Area Bill and ended with Pandit Lakhmi Chand State University of Performing and Visual Arts, Rohtak (Amendment) Bill, which was unanimously passed at 6.17pm. A minute later, the speaker announced adjournment of house. Discussion and passage of supplementary bills of revised estimates took more time than these legislations. Congress MLAs Raghbir Kadian, Geeta Bhukkal, Jagbir Malik and B B Batra were among those who posed questions to the government. Except for Maharishi Balmiki Sanskrit University Bill, which was passed after a discussion of five minutes, all bills were passed within two minutes. Gupta said non-participation of opposition MLAs was one of the main reasons for less legislative business. Former speaker and seniormost MLA from Congress, Raghubir Singh Kadian, blamed the delay on less time given to MLAs to look at bills for discussion. “All this is a planned cosmetic affair. According to rules, MLAs are given seven days for preparation on a new bill introduced in the house and two days for discussion on amendments. But here we are given bills almost on the same day. Also, they have the numbers, so they get the bill passed. Since we are not prepared, legislations are passed without discussion,” said Kadian. Gupta said the bills passed on Monday were introduced on Friday. “They had sufficient time to read and discuss. Hence, these were passed unanimously. Legislative business time depends on participation of opposition only,” said Gupta. Balraj Kundu, an independent MLA from Meham, blamed both Congress and BJP-JJP MLAs. “They are least concerned with legislative discussion. All they do is compete with each other to appear on television,” said Kundu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rapid-fire-in-haryana-assembly-4-bills-introduced-5-passed-in-22-mins/articleshow/85577785.cms||Manvir Saini

BJP, Congress fight over Malabar rebellion of 1921||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Amid debate over whether the Malabar rebellion was a revolt against the British or a communal riot, Congress and BJP on Monday sparred on the issue with the former accusing the saffron party of "adopting a divide and rule policy of British colonialists". Days after RSS leader Ram Madhav claimed that the Malabar rebellion, which is also known as the Moplah (Muslim) riots of 1921, was one of the first manifestations of the Taliban mindset in India, BJP national vice-president AP Abdullakutty endorsed it, alleging that "the leader of the riots, Variyankunnath Kunjahammed Haji, was the first head of the Taliban in Kerala". Talking to reporters in Kozhikode, Abdullakutty also claimed that the family of EMS Namboothiripad, legendary communist leader and first Kerala chief minister, was also a "victim of that riot". While a section in Kerala hail Haji as a leader who laid down his life for the country fighting British colonialism, Hindu right-wing groups claim he was a leader of fanatics who targeted Hindus in Eranadu and Valluvanadu taluks in south Malabar in the "Malabar riot". "EMS and his family were victims of that riot. Comrade EMS's family had to flee from the Elamkulam Mana (the famous ancestral home of EMS in Perinthalmanna Taluk) to Palakkad to save themselves from the rioters," Abdullakutty alleged. Congress leader and Lok Sabha MP K Muraleedharan said that the Malabar rebellion was part of the Khilafat movement against British colonialists and accused the saffron party of portraying its leader Kunhahammad Haji as communal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/revolt-or-riot-bjp-cong-fight-over-malabar-rebellion-of-1921/articleshow/85580893.cms||---

During the week ending August 15, increase in the caseload was noted and experts had warned of situation flaring up if corrective steps were not taken. Punjab was clubbed with 10 other states of the country where the cases were expected to further increase. In Punjab, the daily caseload touched 105 on August 11 and was expected to double in 64 days. The projections had set alarm bells ringing, forcing the government to tighten containment and management measures. Chief minister Amarinder Singh issued a warning of imposing new restrictions in addition to those already in force. With focus on testing for early detection, the state’s testing scaled past national seven-day average of 1,366 tests per million population during the seven-day period. Despite maintaining substantially high testing numbers, the weekly positivity rate, which refers to percentage of people who are Covid-19 positive out of total tested, posted negative growth in 13 districts while there was no change in eight districts. Only Ferozepur posted increase in positivity rate. Unlike the week ending August 15, positivity rate jumped in nine districts while 10 noted no change and the rate dropped in three districts. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the health department was quick to respond when a slight uptick in cases was noted in the second week of the month and it helped to keep the numbers in control. “On an average, the health department is testing over 40,000 people. Besides, general population comprehensive testing is being carried out in schools,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-records-negative-growth-in-weekly-positivity-rate/articleshow/85577897.cms||Vinod Kumar

Zero fatalities were reported for the fourth day on the trot, as per the data shared by the Delhi government’s health department. Monday was the 14th time since the beginning of the second wave of the pandemic that Delhi logged zero deaths in a day. The low number of cases can also be attributed to fewer tests (46,251) conducted the previous day. With the fresh cases, the overall infection tally in Delhi has climbed to 14,37,334. Of this, over 14.1 lakh patients have recovered from the disease. The death toll, meanwhile, stands at 25,079, the health bulletin stated.

They were also carrying three saroops of Sri Guru Granth Sahib (SGGS) with them. Indian World Forum president Puneet Singh Chandhok told TOI on Monday that a group of 44 Sikhs and Hindus, who had taken shelter at Gurdwara Karte Parwan near Kabul airport, made it inside the airport and were evacuated by an Indian Air Force plane. Nearly 200 more Afghan Sikhs and Hindus are still stranded in Afghanistan, he added. Earlier, a group of around 24 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, including two MPs, Anarkali Kaur Honaryar and Narender Pal Singh, arrived in India on Sunday. Referring to those still stranded in Kabul, Chandhok said the10-kilometre long drive to the international airport from the Gurdwara Karte Parwan through various checkpoints is one of the biggest challenges in rescue efforts. In a video uploaded on social media, the new batch of people expressed gratitude towards the Indian government as well as Afghanistanis, who, they said, had helped them reach Kabul airport safely. In the photographs, three Sikh men can be seen carrying the saroop, packed in suitcases, on their heads. One of the Afghan Sikhs who didn’t wish to give his name said the current situation in Kabul was horrifying and ambiguous. “We don’t know what is going to happen next minute, a few foreign Sikh NGOs had assured us of evacuation but their representatives are now inaccessible. Only the representatives of the Indian government are in touch and are evacuating us,” he said. One or two Sikhs might even stay back in the gurdwara for daily religious services, the Afghan Sikh said. A man among those who have taken shelter in Gurdwara Karte Parwan said the representatives of the Indian government were constantly in touch with them and expressed the hope that they would also be evacuated from Afghanistan soon. However, he said they were resentful of their two Sikh MPs who chose to ‘flee’ first from Afghanistan instead of helping with their evacuation. Announcing the evacuation flight, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri took to Twitter to say, “Three Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji are being escorted to the IAF aircraft at Kabul Airport. Forty-six Afghan Hindus and Sikhs along with stranded Indian nationals are blessed to return on the same flight.” India on Monday brought back 146 citizens on four different flights from Qatar’s capital Doha, days after they were evacuated from Afghanistan by NATO and American aircraft amid the deteriorating security situation in the wartorn country. On Sunday, it had evacuated 392 individuals from Kabul on three flights. (With inputs from PTI)SGPC to give jobs, houses to Afghan Sikhs:The executive committee of SGPC have resolved to provide residence, job, and other facilities to the Afghan Sikhs who wish to come to India. While talking to mediapersons after chairing a meeting of the executive committee on Monday, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said the Sikh body had told the Central government that it was prepared to offer every possible help to the Afghan Sikhs if they decide to come to India. “We will arrange residence for them, job as per their capabilities and extend other help to them,” said Kaur. In another decision, the executive committee decided to install printing presses abroad for the printing of Sri Guru Granth Sahib (SGGS). However, in past also, the SGPC had taken similar decisions but did not act. Kaur said the printing presses would be installed in the US, Canada, New Zealand and other countries. She also informed that SGPC had fixed bheta for Akhand Path Sahib at Rs 9,500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/3-saroops-group-of-sikhs-and-hindus-evacuated-from-kabul/articleshow/85577956.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Interacting with the TOI over phone, Vij clarified that his current health issues were not due to long Covid-19 complications. He rather reasoned that travel by helicopter was a reason for the dip in his oxygen level. Vij has been unwell after his return from Rohtak, where he had gone to mourn the death of the Haryana chief minister’s younger brother Gulshan Khattar. “All this began after I accompanied chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in the helicopter on return to Chandigarh. Though I was sitting with a team of doctors, none cautioned me against air travel,” said Vij. His oxygen level was found low when he alighted from the helicopter. “Situation turned bad further after I reached home have been on oxygen support ever since,” he said. “I have fully recovered from post-Covid complications. But, now I have offered PGIs to do any kind of research on me on the issues of post-Covid complications,” said Vij.

---||Chandigarh||Ranjit Singh murder: CBI court in Panchkula to give verdict on August 26||CHANDIGARH: The special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Panchkula will pronounce its verdict in the murder case of former Dera Sacha Sauda manager Ranjit Singh on August 26. The arguments in rebuttal by CBI and defence counsels were completed on Monday. Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is a key accused in this case, one of the oldest murder cases in Haryana. CBI counsel H P S Verma said they have submitted their oral and written arguments before the special CBI judge. The dera chief, who is now lodged in Sunaria jail in Rohtak district, was convicted by the special CBI court in Panchkula on August 25, 2017, for rape of two sadhvis (female disciples) and sentenced to 20-year imprisonment. On January 17, 2019, the same court had sentenced him to life imprisonment in the 2002 murder of Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chhatarpati. The court has already directed superintendents of district jail Sunaria (Rohtak) and Central Jail (Ambala) to ensure the presence of the dera chief and Krishan Lal, also accused in the case, through video conferencing on August 26.

While Congress has a large majority in the state where it is in power, the tussle between its senior most members has surfaced in recent months. Singh Deo believes that it is his turn to be the CM as there was an informal agreement about a split term between him and Baghel when the party stormed to power in December 2018. However, Congress state incharge P L Punia as well as Baghel have repeatedly denied any such arrangement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-bid-to-broker-peace-in-chattisgarh-unit/articleshow/85580945.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Schools in Karnataka reopen, attendance low but spirits high||BENGALURU: Schools reopened for physical classes in 25 of the 30 districts in Karnataka for children of Grade 9 to 12 on Monday after over five months of closure due to Covid-19. While the attendance was not exactly overwhelming in many schools, the mood was buoyant as students and teachers who did return to the campus did so in a festive atmosphere. The schools were allowed to reopen only in districts with less than 2% test positivity rate. The official data provided with regard to state board schools painted a bleak picture but teachers of several schools TOI visited put the attendance at an encouraging 40-50%. The overall attendance for grade 10 in state board schools for offline classes was16%, while for grade 9 it was 13.8%. For I and II PU, the turnout was 36% each. The more worrisome feature of the data was that a large number of students attended neither online nor offline classes. How private schools faredMost private schools did reopen, while the few that did not resume classes are likely to do so next week. Not all reported encouraging attendance. Manila Carvalho, principal of DPS Bangalore East, said they opened physical classes for students in classes 11 and 12 to a dismal response. “Only 71 out of 1,066 students attended physical classes. From next Monday we plan to start physical classes for students in class 9 and 10,” she said. Shashi Kumar D, general secretary, Karnataka Associated Management of English Medium Schools (KAMS), told TOI that most private schools in the state have opened and had heartening attendance. “In Grade 10, the attendance was around 85-90% while grade 9 had 70-75%. A few schools chose to reopen after a few days. Some want to wait, others plan to reopen next week,” he said, adding that many private schools that reopened had great attendance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/schools-in-ktaka-reopen-attendance-low-but-spirits-high/articleshow/85579490.cms||Farheen Hussain

The judge was passing orders on a plea moved by Idol of Arulmighu Subramania Swamy Temple, Namakkal to restrain the revenue department from issuing free housing pattas of temple land without obtaining no objection certificate from trustees. As per the revenue department GO September 26, 1984, obtaining NOC from the HR and CE commissioner is a must and it is also confirmed by the subsequent GOs, the court added. “Insofar as the temple poromboke land is concerned, the revenue authorities have to verify about the encroachment and necessary entries have to be made in the relevant register during the time of 'Jamabandhi' every year. If any encroachment upon the temple poromboke land is found, it can be evicted directly, without the cooperation of the revenue department, since the department is the true owner of the land,” the judge said. Now, without the knowledge of the petitioner temple and the commissioner, the department has reclassified 26.29 acres of temple poromboke land in Vaiappamalai village and issued house site pattas to 81 persons on November 13, 2012. In spite of the objection raised by the petitioner, the department has ignored it and issued house site pattas to 81 persons in a hasty manner. As per the provisions of the HR and CE Act, it is the bounden duty of the trustee to preserve and protect the property of the temple and to utilize the same for the revenue of the temple, the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cant-issue-patta-to-temple-land-sans-hrce-nod-madras-hc/articleshow/85580996.cms||---
---||Chennai||Suspended Tamil Nadu DGP questions trial court’s jurisdiction||CHENNAI: Suspended DGP rank officer Rajesh Das, facing sexual harassment charges levelled by a woman IPS officer, has questioned the jurisdiction of the chief judicial magistrate, Villupuram in accepting the final report filed against him by CB-CID. He contended that since the alleged offence was said to have occurred between Namakkal to Ulundurpet, the Villupuram court does not have territorial jurisdiction over the case. Admitting the plea, the CJM has directed the prosecution to respond to the petition moved by the DGP. According to the petitioner, the Villupuram CJM court doesn’t have jurisdiction to proceed further in the case as the power of the court to inquire into the final report filed by the CB-CID is not within the local jurisdiction of the court as per Section 14 of CrPC. Therefore, it is just and necessary that the proceedings pending before this court be stayed and referred to the magistrate court concerned which is having territorial jurisdiction, he added. On August 18, the Supreme Court closed a suo motu proceeding initiated by Madras high court to monitor the investigation into the sexual harassment case. On August 9, the DGP appeared before the magistrate and received copies of the 400-page chargesheet filed by the CB-CID. According to the prosecution, a case was registered based on a complaint made by a woman IPS officer against the DGP. According to the complaint, the DGP, while travelling in his car to assess the chief minister’s security arrangements at Pudukottai in March this year, allegedly sexually harassed the woman officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/suspended-tamil-nadu-dgp-questions-trial-courts-jurisdiction/articleshow/85580974.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt to IT companies on ORR: Extend work from home till Dec 2022, cut traffic for Metro sake||BENGALURU: The department of electronics, IT, BT and science and technology has sent a letter advising IT companies and parks located along Outer Ring Road (ORR) to extend work from home (WFH) to most of their employees up to December 2022 so as to better manage traffic in the wake of Metro work expected to start soon. The letter has been sent to industry body Nasscom, which is expected to circulate the same to IT firms located on ORR in Bengaluru. Pointing out that the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) is starting Metro construction on ORR from Central Silk Board to KR Puram, additional chief secretary EV Ramana Reddy has said in the letter that the same could extend to 1.5 to 2 years. Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) commissioner V Manjula said: “We will revise the advisory as we understand that it may be inadvertently perceived that we are suggesting that they work from home. The idea wasn’t that. It was to suggest they encourage employees to use various transport options like buses or cycle-towork that are available.” “We wrote to Nasscom on the request of DULT and this is only an advisory. The companies are not mandated to do it and will be free to resume work from offices if that is necessary,” Reddy told TOI. Companies’ forum waiting for revised govt statementKS Viswanathan, VP of industry initiative at Nasscom, said, “It is information on impending work and the need for employees working on that stretch to use public transport as much as possible. The government is supportive of industry requirements.” Companies like SAP, Walmart, Intel and Accenture said they had no comments to offer. Cisco, which is also on Outer Ring Road, said it started a permanent workfrom-home policy and the decision would not have much of an impact on them. Less than 5% of the company’s 12,000 employees work from the office in ORR, according to people familiar with the matter. Krishna Kumar, operations manager, ORRCA (Outer Ring Road Companies Association), said: “ORRCA’s understanding is that the government is going to issue a revised statement following questions they have received on the advisory. We are waiting for the revised statement and will react to that.” The Outer Ring Road is the most prominent office cluster in the city consisting of business parks such as Manyata Embassy Tech Park, Cessna Business Park, Embassy Tech Village, RMZ Ecoworld and Prestige Tech Park, housing companies such as Flipkart, JP Morgan, ANZ, Cisco, Intel, IBM, Accenture, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Samsung, and Dell EMC. “IT companies working from home in the pandemic situation provided some relief to traffic movement. However, with the starting of Metro construction, it would be extremely difficult to manage traffic on ORR, especially if IT companies resume work from offices... It would be greatly beneficial if IT companies on ORR extend the WFH option for most of their employees till December 2022,” the government letter reads. The companies have been advised to stagger working hours for those employees working physically at the office, and encourage such staffers to use buses (BMTC or company provided) which can use the bus priority lanes on ORR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-to-it-cos-on-orr-extend-wfh-till-dec-22-cut-traffic-for-metro-sake/articleshow/85579538.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Class X, XII marks to decide tie-breaker for engineering students||CHENNAI: As Class XII scores are high this year, the state government introduced additional criteria — percentage of total marks in Class XII and X exams — to break ties in the engineering rank list. The number of students scoring more than 551 out of 600 marks in Class XII rose 16 times under the Covid induced weightage system followed by the state board. As of Monday evening, 1,69,897 students have registered for engineering counselling and 1,30,812 students have uploaded their certificates and paid the fees. The number of registrations increased by 6% compared to last year and the number of eligible candidates increased by 16% as only 1.12 lakh students paid their fees and uploaded their certificates last year. The last date to apply for engineering counselling is Tuesday. To reduce ties, the school education department awarded marks with two decimal points. And the higher education department amended the Tamil Nadu Admission in Engineering Institutions Rules, 2007, so that: "In cases where more than one student have got the same marks in the common merit list, the inter-se-merit among such candidates shall be determined in the order of priority as specified: marks in mathematics, physics, optional subject, total marks in qualifying examination, total marks in X standard examination, date of birth, random number assigned." Under the earlier system, date of birth and 10-digit random number assigned to each candidate played a major role in breaking the tie. “To decide the ranks based on the students' own merit, the two new criteria have been introduced. It would ensure that very few students' ranks will be decided by date of birth and random number this year,” officials from higher education department said. Last year, the random number was used for 791 candidates to break ties during the ranking for 1,12,406 eligible candidates. "It's going to be a very close finish as CBSE results were given without decimal points. Introduction of the two new criteria is a welcome move," said career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-class-x-xii-marks-to-decide-tie-breaker-for-engineering-students/articleshow/85580943.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||India||Bombay high court slams Centre, Maharashtra for use of ‘mental retardation’||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday frowned at the Centre and state over use of the term ‘mental retardation’ in statutes and even in official use. “Lunacy, mad man, mentally retarded are antiquated... I’m not going to, even if required, look at these statutes. In my court if these words are used, an order of cost will follow,” said Justice Gautam Patel. He heard a suit by the son of a physician (57) from Byculla to appoint him his legal guardian to manage his movable and immovable assets, bank accounts and affairs. The father has been in a vegetative state since June 28, 2018 after a massive stroke that resulted in acute brain injury due to oxygen deprivation. He was discharged on August 5, 2018. The neurologist’s January 2021 report confirmed his condition and said he is bedridden and though conscious, not oriented with time, place and person. He has severe comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension. He is hemodynamically stable, but he is not able to perform any task or take a decision. The son’s advocate Pramod Tambe said the suit is filed under Order 32 A (2) (guardian of a person under a disability) of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 as there is no other provision in law for persons in such condition. The state’s advocate Jyoti Chavan said it is an “unfortunate case,” and a panel of JJ Hospital must be directed to examine the patient and file a report. But the judge asked whether the state is disputing the report of a private hospital which is better than JJ Hospital. Centre’s advocate Yogeshwar Bhate said the petitioner must apply under the National Trust for Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities Act, 1999, and a trust (committee) will decide his application. Justice Patel questioned whether a family member of someone who suffers a stroke is expected to approach the trust to be appointed guardian and why they can’t approach court. He also said the Act will not apply to a clinical condition. “It has terms like autism, cerebral palsy, multiple disabilities. But mental retardation? Whoever has drafted this is retarded,” said Justice Patel. He said antiquated statutes with such terms must be repealed. He told the state “your JJ Hospital” also uses the term ‘mental retardation’ in certificates and asked if the government backs its use. “This is insensitivity to their condition (the mentally challenged),” he said. Taking note that the man’s two sisters have consented to his appointment as legal guardian, Patel allowed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bombay-high-court-slams-centre-maharashtra-for-use-of-mental-retardation/articleshow/85581063.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Mumbai||ED submits first chargesheet in Anil Deshmukh case||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate on Monday submitted its first prosecution complaint or chargesheet in a money laundering case related to former state home minister Anil Deshmukh before a special court, naming two of his aides, private secretary Sanjeev Palande, an additional collector rank government officer, and personal assistant Kundan Shinde, who are currently in judicial custody. The agency had arrested the two on June 25 after searches were conducted on the premises of Deshmukh and his associates. The investigating officer submitted a trunkful of chargesheet documents, including statements of witnesses. Though ED officials were mum about the contents of the chargesheet and names of the accused in it, it also contains statements of Palande and Shinde, along with those of other accused they were confronted with, such as nowdismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze. The ED has been trying to trace Deshmukh to record his statement in the case, but in vain. ED explains all transactions to fix money trailIt is alleged that on behalf of Deshmukh, Palande and Shinde were coordinating with Waze and two other police officers to collect money illegally from bar and restaurant owners every month. The ED investigating the money laundering case against Deshmukh on the basis of a CBI case where it is alleged that Deshmukh had asked Waze, then heading the crime intelligence unit branch of Mumbai police, DCP Raju Bhujbal and ACP Sanjay Patil to illegally collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners every month for him. The ED investigation found Waze collected Rs 4.7 crore from bar owners and handed over the money to Shinde. Afterwards, Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh had transferred the money to a Delhi-based hawala operator. From that money, the hawala operator diverted Rs 4.18 crore to Deshmukh’s trust in Nagpur through shell companies as donation. The hawala operator in his statement to the ED admitted that they had received cash from an aide of Hrishikesh and layered the money with the help of their shell companies before transferring it into Deshmukh’s trust as donation. In the chargesheet, the ED has explained about all the transactions to establish the money trail. The ED had also found several other suspicious transactions worth several crores which took place on the name of the trust. The ED is inquiring about these transactions. The chargesheet also includes statements of some bar owners who paid Waze for not harassing them and for smooth functioning of their businesses during the pandemic. The bar owners told ED that Waze told them he was collecting the money for No 1, the term he used for then home minister Anil Deshmukh. Last Friday, police registered an FIR against ex-CP Param Bir Singh, where the complainant in the case and businessman Bimal Agrawal stated that Waze told him Param Bir Singh was the No1 for whom he was collecting money from bar owners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-submits-first-chargesheet-in-anil-deshmukh-case/articleshow/85581069.cms||Vijay V Singh
