FCAT was one of the tribunals abolished by the government through the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021, which amended the Cinematograph Act, 1952 to say that filmmakers aggrieved by the decision of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) will now have to approach high courts instead of the FCAT for redressal of their grievances. The film fraternity had expressed disappointment over the government’s decision to disband the FCAT. Among those who expressed concern over the abolition of the FCAT were filmmakers Hansal Mehta, Vishal Bhardwaj and Anurag Kashyap, among others. According to the government’s list of business in Lok Sabha on Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is likely to seek the withdrawal of the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Bill, 2021, and introduce in its place a new bill called The Tribunals Reforms Bill, 2021, which will further amend the Cinematograph Act, 1952, the Customs Act, 1962, the Airports Authority of India Act, 1994, the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001 and certain other Acts. The abolition of FCAT, combined with an amendment to the cinematograph act that gave government the power to revisit film certifications approved by the CBFC, had created massive disgruntlement in the film fraternity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-likely-to-re-establish-film-certification-appellate-tribunal/articleshow/84956375.cms||Swati Mathur

In an order issued on Saturday, SSP-CID (Special Branch), Kashmir, directed all field units under it to ensure that a person’s involvement in law and order and stonepelting cases and other crime/s “prejudicial to the security of the state” be specifically looked into during the verification process. “The same must be corroborated from the local police station records,” the order read. The SSP also said digital evidence like CCTV footage, photographs, videos and audio clips and quadcopter images available in the records of the police, security forces and security agencies be also referred during the verification process. “Any person found involved in any such cases must be denied the security clearance,” the order reads. The J&K administration has already started the process of termination of government employees found involved in anti-national activities or found instigating or helping terrorists. In the past two months, at least 15 employees, including some gazetted officers, have already been sacked from their involvement in anti-national activities. The third such list of such government officials is also likely to issued soon, sources said. Former deputy chief minister of J&K and senior BJP leader Kavinder Gupta welcomed the move. “The step is a befitting response in the direction to teach a lesson of life to anti-social and anti-national elements, he said in Jammu on Sunday. Such an order should have been issued much earlier, he said in a press statement. Kavinder categorically pointed out that successive governments, both at the Center and in J&K, deliberately gave a long rope to the selected anti-national elements in the region only to satiate their own vested political motives without bothering about the loss which the country and its people had to incur because of such complacency. He further said that the government should plug-in all the gaps through which the earlier dispensations in the erstwhile state of J&K used to placate and appease the people having separatist mindsets.

The Taliban advances following the announcement of the withdrawal of the US and Nato troops from the war-ravaged country had prompted many students from Pakistani religious seminaries to join the ranks of militants, described by their mentors as ‘jihad’. The clerics in various parts of the country are also soliciting support for the Afghan Taliban and even calling for donations. While Islamabad has been denying that “jihadis” from Pakistan are going to Afghanistan, the country has been receiving dead bodies of its citizens from across the border on the Chaman-Spin Boldak and Torkhum border crossings. According to locals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the northwest and Balochistan in the southwest, dozens of Pakistanis have been killed in Afghanistan in the past few months while fighting alongside the Taliban against the Afghan forces. Hundreds of people, locals said, had attended the funerals of the Pakistani fighters in various parts of the two provinces. In mid-July, 22 years old Adul Rasheed was laid to rest in the suburbs of Peshawar city in the northwest. Rasheed, according to his family members, had gone to Afghanistan in May for ‘jihad’ and was recently killed in the Nangrahar province. His body was brought into the country through Torkhum border crossing. Hundreds of people had participated in his funeral and had congratulated the family for sacrificing his life in the way of God. Rasheed’s cause has been described by his uncle Maroof Khan as a source of inspiration for other young Pakistani jihadis fighting in Afghanistan. “Many of his young friends want to be martyred like him,” he said. In Balochistan, funerals and prayers are frequently held in the Pashtun-speaking areas along the border with Afghanistan upon the arrival of dead bodies of local and Afghan militants. “Funerals are held. The Taliban make speeches at funerals and congratulate families for their martyrs,” said a resident of the Panjpai town in Balochistan. “Recently, a funeral prayer was held for the son of a tribal leader who was killed while fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan,” he said, adding that his father, also a jihadi, had returned to his hometown from the “holy war” on Eid. In videos shared on social media, hundreds of people took part in the funeral where the Taliban’s white flags were displayed. Many locals and witnesses in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan claimed that there had been an increased pro-Taliban activity in their areas. Pakistan’s interior minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed had admitted that the dead bodies arriving to the country were of the Afghan Taliban as families of many of them reside in Pakistan. According to Rasheed, sometimes their dead bodies arrive, and sometimes they come here to hospitals to get medical treatments. Government officials, however, reject reports about the pro-Taliban rallies and donations as unfounded. “The allegations are baseless. No such thing is happening,” Zahid Hafeez Chuadhary, Pakistan’s foreign office spokesperson, recently told media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pak-jihadis-join-taliban-ranks-return-as-dead-bodies/articleshow/84956559.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

An attempt was made Sunday morning but reports from the area suggest that their assault was repulsed by the government forces. All domestic and international flights have been suspended after rockets were fired at the facility. Details of the damage are unavailable because of the claims and counter claims by both sides. Th airport chief Massoud Ahmad Pashtun said three rockets were fired by the Taliban with two landing on tarmac. “There are no casualties to report and the damage is being repaired,” he said. Taliban spokesman Zabihuallah Mujahid said the attack was necessitated because the airport was being used by enemy forces as a hub to conduct air strikes on them. It was necessary, Mujahid said, to either shut or take over the airport. The facility is an important asset to carry out air attacks and reconnaissance operations against the militants. A retired Pakistani air force general told TOI that the attempt to take over the facility makes perfect sense in the Taliban strategy to control all strategic infrastructure in the south of the country before their possible advance to the centre of the government. As the process of withdrawal of western forces entered its last month, the Taliban have intensified operations to take major towns. There are reports that most of the rural Afghanistan is already under their control. After taking control of Afghanistan’s border crossings with the neighbouring countries in the south, west and the north, fears are growing that three major cities of Kandahar, Lashkar Gah and Herat would be their primary preference before their march towards Kabul once the deadline for the western withdrawal ends on September 11. Report from Lashkar Gah are of particular concern as the residents are talking about street-to-street fight between the invading Taliban and the government forces. Fears of large-scale exodus are also being discussed. Communication infrastructure has been seriously impaired and fires have been reported from the city, home to nearly three million people. A resident told media that locals were trying to find hiding places and that the fighting has reached within a few hundred yards of government offices at the centre of the city. Numerically outnumbered, the Afghan forces are largely relying on air operations rather than fighting the Taliban on ground. A small trader with business at the centre of the city said: “We are facing death in the streets and death from the skies. While the Taliban may kill us for just being there, the aerial bombing by the Afghan air force would definitely not distinguish who is dying on the ground.” Report about the Laskar Gah fighting have been described by many in Herat, Kandahar and other smaller towns as “very frightening”. Most people are not sure when the war would reach them and if they would have time to run to safety. In the country’s western-most province of Herat that borders Iran, the administration has claimed killing hundreds of Taliban but there are no independent verifications of the claim. The government has not shared any evidence with the with local or international media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/taliban-rockets-target-kandahar-airport-no-casualties/articleshow/84956642.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

However, zealous officials in at least one instance ended up sealing with caution tape the front door of a flat where three infected members of a family live in an apartment complex in BTM Layout. According to BBMP officials, a team led by a doctor sealed the flat on Bannerghatta Road on Sunday morning after Covid tests were carried out on the premises following suspicion that the residents had contracted the virus. BBMP field officers said they were only implementing orders after the spot was declared a micro-containment zone. A Palike official who was part of the team said, “There was a doctor with us and we have taped the front door. Our team will ensure the residents get any help needed during their quarantine period and we will monitor the cases closely.” Asked about the sealing of the flat’s front door, Randeep Dev, special commissioner (health), BBMP, told TOI: “The protocol is to put caution tape on the entrance of the floor or the gate of a structure where positive cases are found. The health officer, south zone, has been directed to remove the tape from the flat door and place it at the gate.” “In fact, caution taping and pasting stickers in containment zones is the protocol being followed for all places housing active Covid-positive patients. We have started publicising such zone details as public health concerns during a pandemic override privacy issues,” he explained. Last year, BBMP officials had sealed the front doors of two adjacent flats with tin sheets in Domlur after their residents tested positive. However, following public outcry over what would happen to the residents in case of any emergency and the taint of being confined like that, then BBMP commissioner apologised for the act and the sheets were removed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/btm-layout-flat-sealed-after-three-turn-positive/articleshow/84956671.cms||---

Premachandran, the Revolutionary Socialist Party MP from Kollam, was objecting to PM Modi’s announcement on Twitter, even before he informed Parliament, the government’s decision to implement 27% reservation for OBCs and 10% for economically weaker sections in all-India medical seats. The PM also made an announcement that engineering colleges will teach students in five vernacular languages. “When the House is in session all matters of policy ought to be announced first to the House. That is the precedent and convention of this House adopted since long,” Premachandran said. While it has generally been held that “no privilege of the House is involved if statements on matters of public interest are not made first in the House”, it has been held that policy statements should first be made on the floor of the House when the House is in session before releasing them to the press or to the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rsp-mps-complaint-to-speaker-pm-making-policy-announcements-outside-when-parliament-in-session-against-propriety-courtesy/articleshow/84957546.cms||Swati Mathur

After months of anxiety and uncertainty, they are using this opportunity to de-stress, unwind and indulge. Parents are trying to make their children feel special by pampering them with gifts and their favourite food. And cashing in on this sentiment are malls and standalone retail establishments, which have recorded a rise in footfall since results were announced. Malls recorded a rise in footfall over the weekend, especially after the announcement of board results. “Our footfall has evidently gone up in the last week after the board results. The food courts are busier. Apart from the young crowd, we are also witnessing a lot of parents coming to the malls with their children to buy them gifts. Bookstores and stationery shops are much sought after. The end-of-season sale at various outlets is also proving to be a crowd-puller for our mall,” said a spokesperson from a south Kolkata mall. Swati Saraf, mother of Ananya who scored 97.75% in ISC, said, “I feel sad for these students as they missed the experience of going to the examination centre. The amount of stress they had to endure is unbelievable. Nobody knew how their marks would be evaluated. But now that the results are out, I am making sure that my daughter is treated like a princess. We had a small get-together at home to celebrate and I bought her a nice watch as a gift.” Parents are also gifting lightweight jewellery to their children as a token of appreciation. “Lightweight chains, rings, ear tops and pendants are selling like hot cakes after the board results. Many families prefer to gift something in gold to their children when they complete an important chapter in their lives,” said Rupak Saha from a city jewellery shop. Orders for cakes at city confectioneries have also gone up post the results. “We’ve been getting a lot more orders after the board results came out. Either parents are buying it for their children or relatives are gifting cakes to congratulate students,” said Satyendra Kumar Mishra from a city bakery. No celebration can be complete without good food and parents are leaving no stone unturned to treat their children to their favourite dishes. Koyeli Ray, who is proud of her daughter Teesta for scoring 95% in her ICSE exam, is going all out to pamper her. “This year was mentally very tough for students. So, I am trying to celebrate my daughter’s success in every possible way. Apart from cooking her favourite dishes at home, I have gifted her a few books as she is a bookworm,” said Koyeli. Not just books, other popular gifting items this result season include clothes, mobile phones, laptops and watches. “Several customers are indulging in these items to gift something special to their loved ones,” said Ipsita Ghosh from a gift shop in south Kolkata. Pinaki Shoukalin Ghosh, whose son Rik Raunaak Ghosh scored 98.6% in ICSE, took his son out for lunch after the results were declared. “We had a very good time together. Since Rik loves music, I am also planning to buy him a guitar,” said Pinaki.

---||India||After 11 weeks of decline, Covid cases see 7.5% surge||NEW DELHI: Fresh Covid-19 cases in India registered a week-on-week rise for the first time in 12 weeks since the peak of the second wave in early May, in what could be an early sign of another spike in the pandemic in the country. Currently, however, the surge is mainly restricted to Kerala and, to a much lesser degree, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. India recorded just over 2.86 lakh new cases in the current week ended Sunday (July 26-August 1), a 7.5% rise from the previous week's tally of 2.66 lakh. Weekly cases in the country have registered a rise for the first time since May 3-9, when the second wave peaked. The fall in cases had continued till last week, even though the decline had slowed to 1.4%. Kerala, the current epicentre of the pandemic in India, logged close to 1.4 lakh cases in the present week, a 26.5% increase from the previous week’s tally of 1.1 lakh. The state accounted for nearly half (49%) of all new cases in the country in the last seven days, with a daily average of 20,000 new cases. Kerala posted 20,728 cases on Sunday, the sixth straight day that the daily count had stayed over 20,000. Worryingly, there were signs that Kerala's Covid surge was spilling out to its neighbouring states. Karnataka recorded a 17.3% increase in new cases as compared to the previous week, although the rise hasn't been much in absolute numbers. Karnataka reported 12,442 cases in the current week as opposed to 10,610 in the previous seven days.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); In Tamil Nadu, the weekly case count remained the same as in the previous week -- 13,090 cases as compared with 13,095 in the previous week. This breaks the trend of declining case numbers in the state that had held for close to nine weeks. The daily case count has risen marginally in TN for four consecutive days now, going up from 1,756 on Wednesday to 1,990 on Sunday. Follow TOI's complete coverage on Covid-19On the positive side, Maharashtra's weekly numbers declined by 6.2%, following a 10% dip in the previous week. The state recorded 45,272 new cases this week as compared with 48,253 in the previous one. Numbers in the northeast, another region that has seen a spike in cases, appeared to have declined this week. In keeping with the rise in infections, active cases in the country have risen by over 14,000 in the past six days. The number of active had dipped below 4 lakh around a week ago, but had again climbed close to 4.15 lakh by Sunday. For the sixth day running, India recorded over 40,000 fresh cases on Sunday. The day's tally stood at 40,800. There were 418 deaths reported on the day. In the past week, India recorded 3,805 new deaths, a sharp drop of 44% over the previous week's toll of 6,848. However, the previous week, over 3,500 old fatalities were added to the toll by Maharashtra which had inflated the weekly number.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-11-weeks-of-decline-covid-cases-see-7-5-surge/articleshow/84958409.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

On July 5, the Supreme Court had expressed shock and dismay over police continuing to register cases under section 66A despite it being quashed six years ago. NGO ‘People's Union for Civil Liberties’ (PUCL) had pointed out that states have registered thousands of cases post-judgment and that the Centre needed to step in for immediate withdrawal of these cases. Interestingly, in such a sensitive case before a bench headed by Justice R F Nariman, the ministry of electronics and information technology chose a ‘Scientist G’ officer to file the response to the PUCL's petition seeking implementation of the SC's March 24, 2015 judgment in the Shreya Singhal case. The scientist said he was filing the affidavit with inputs from the ministries of home affairs and the information and broadcasting. The matter is scheduled for fresh hearing on Monday before the bench headed by Justice Nariman. “The Section (66A) has become null and void with effect from the date of the judgment,” the Centre said and informed the court that between February-May 2019, as many as 21 states and UTs have responded to the Centre intimating that the police have been directed not to register cases under Section 66A and that no prosecution has been undertaken by the state under this provision after it was erased from the statute book by the apex court. PUCL had told the court through senior advocate Sanjay Parikh that Maharashtra, which had registered 349 cases prior to the judgment, registered 381 more FIRs invoking Section 66A post-judgment. The Centre said the Maharashtra government on February 21, 2019 had informed the Centre that it has “complied with the Supreme Court judgment and that no prosecution has been initiated post March 24, 2015 under section 66A of the IT Act, 2000.” PUCL had also claimed that Uttar Pradesh had registered just 22 cases before 2015, but its police went on to file 245 more cases after the judgment. It had said that Jharkhand had just 43 FIRs prior to the judgments, but went on to register 291 FIRs after the SC verdict. The Centre's affidavit does not mention any response from the UP or Jharkhand governments. PUCL had accused Rajasthan of having only 75 cases, but going on to register 192 more FIRs post-judgment. The Centre said the Rajasthan government on February 22, 2019, had responded to its directive for implementation of the judgment saying it had issued appropriate directions to the police and complied with the judgment. In its rejoinder to the Centre’s affidavit, the PUCL through advocate Aparna Bhat sought a series of directions for implementation of the SC judgment in letter and spirit by the states and highlighted the proactive role the Centre should play in protecting citizens from getting booked under the defunct provision for posting messages in social media. PUCL said the state governments must be directed to collect and collate all information about cases lodged and pending under 66A and order their immediate dropping/withdrawal. This could be achieved by a direction to the DGPs to take necessary steps and to the HCs to issue suitable advisory to the district judges for closure of cases in the courts within their jurisdictions. On July 5, the SC had expressed shock and dismay over police across India invoking Section 66A to arrest persons for social media posts even six years after the SC had erased it from the statute book finding it to be in breach of right to free speech guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution. Taking up the petition, the bench led by Justice Nariman, who had authored the March 24, 2015 judgment in the Shreya Singhal case striking down Section 66A, had said, “Amazing is all that I can say. What is going on is terrible and distressing. How could the provision be invoked by police even six years after the Supreme Court had struck it down?” Parikh had said that it is shocking that more cases under Section 66A have been registered post-2015 judgment. “Shocking is the right word to use,” Justice Nariman had said and asked the Union government to file a response to the plea by PUCL, which requested the court to direct the Centre to collect data about all cases registered by police and pending trial under Section 66A and send a communication to all trial courts and DGPs to close the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-onus-on-states-to-implement-supreme-court-order-quashing-section-66a/articleshow/84958891.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||After Assam & UP, Uttarakhand mulls law to curb population||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government will set up a committee to look into the feasibility of rolling out a population control bill on the lines of other BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh and Assam. The Pushkar Singh Dhami government is also looking at introducing a land bill to restrict outsiders from buying land in the Himalayan state. Chief minister Dhami has said that the government will form committees to look into population control and land bills, a top source told TOI. Recently, the Yogi Adityanath government has come up with a draft of the Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill and the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led Assam government has also said that it will bring a population control law to stop people with more than two children from getting government benefits. The move comes after the Dhami government has been urged to look into the possibility of introducing a Population Control Act during a recent meeting in Dehradun. The meeting was attended by BJP’s national general secretary (organisation) B L Santosh and senior RSS functionaries. The government is also considering a strict land law. In 2003, an amendment was made to the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reform Act 1950 by the then ND Tiwari government to prevent outsiders from buying more than 500 square metres of agricultural land in Uttarakhand. In 2007, BJP chief minister B C Khanduri reduced the area of land that could be bought in the state by the outsiders to 250 square metres. In 2018, however, the Trivendra Singh Rawat government set aside the 2003 amendment, paving the way for outsiders to buy any amount of land in the hill state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-assam-up-uttarakhand-mulls-law-to-curb-population/articleshow/84959163.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||India||Covid-19: To meet its vaccination target, India needs to give 92 lakh shots per day||India will need to administer an average of 92 lakh doses a day if it is to meet the year-end target of fully vaccinating all those aged 18 or more. While this may seem quite doable given that this level was breached on June 21, it means maintaining a daily average that is 1.6 times as much as in the best week so far. What is more, the four states with the largest adult populations — Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and West Bengal — will all have to average more than double of what they achieved in their best week of vaccination so far. UP and Bihar will need to go at nearly two-and-a-half times their best weekly average so far. India’s adult population as of 2021 is estimated at close to 94 crore by the Census office, which means 188 crore doses to fully vaccinate them all. As of July end, 47 crore doses have been administered leaving 141 crore to be done over the remaining 153 days of the year. Hence, the average of 92 lakh per day is needed to do the job. Only a handful of states and the national capital would need to average less than their peak levels to meet the year-end target. But some of these are smaller states like Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and only Kerala and Madhya Pradesh among the larger ones can afford to maintain a pace that is below their peak. The most populous state, UP, averaged 6.7 lakh doses a day in its best week. For the rest of the year, it will need to average 16.1 lakh per day, Sundays included. Similarly, Bihar has averaged 3.3 lakh a day in its best week but will need to average 8 lakh a day over the remaining five months. So far, supply constraints have been a big factor in holding back vaccination levels. They could be less of a factor in the months ahead. However, the government has indicated that it expects supplies of 15 crore in August and 19-20 crore doses in September. Assuming this comes true and India can add 35 crore doses to what it has administered by September end, that would leave about 106 crore doses to be administered in 92 days, an average of about 115 lakh doses a day for the last three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-to-meet-its-vaccination-target-india-needs-to-give-92-lakh-shots-per-day/articleshow/84959504.cms||---

Excerpts from a conversation with Subodh Ghildiyal:Given the post-West Bengal polls push for opposition unity, concerns are that it may flounder on the question of leadership?Politics and charity are two different things. Personal ambition must be recognised. But the leadership issue necessarily has to be put into a “thanda basta” till everything else is done and the 2024 poll results are out. It is astonishing that while we celebrate India’s diversity, we tend to be intolerant of diversity in political cauldron. This is what BJP has exploited and the recalibration of opposition unity for 2024 will reset this button. The other key contradiction is that Congress and many regional parties are rivals in states. The theory that national parties and some regional parties, fighting each other in some states, can’t come together, has been debunked many times. Large part of the UPA rule had ironed out this contradiction. Like, to expect the Left and TMC to come together in Bengal would be wishful thinking but there is no reason why they can’t be participating elements in a central formation. How will competing opposition parties in a state join hands?When you unite, each sub unit gives up something. When total opposition unity for 2024 is clinched, adjustments will also necessarily be made as per local context. You believe such differences can be set aside for a larger anti-BJP coalition?Unity by definition assumes pre-existing differences and it also assumes submergence of differences. Prior to Bengal polls, the gap between TMC and Congress was wider but much ground has been covered since. With other parties, the coordination within the Parliament and outside is considerably improved. The impetus of unity is riding Bengal outcome. Will not a good showing by BJP in February-March polls deflate this momentum?I don’t agree that 2022 assembly polls will remotely be a disappointment for Congress or other opposition parties. In UP, Uttarakhand and Goa, BJP is running scared. The thrust of opposition unity will continue at full throttle till 2024. The Modi government’s excesses have become the best impetus for opposition unity. Is opposition unity just about alliances or something deeper?There has to be an organised methodology, a solid statistical base of data and electoral arrangements ranging from unstated strategic adjustments to full coalitions. The next two years must be spent on this. The BJP campaign is that opposition unity is just about power. How do you counter that?BJP’s success because of lack of opposition unity has resulted in casualties of governance like Covid mismanagement, social divisiveness, unaddressed issues of security like Pegasus and attempted control of constitutional institutions. We owe it to India to find a way out of this mess.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/opposition-leadership-issue-must-be-put-off-till-2024-says-abhishek-singhvi/articleshow/84959843.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The Centre is looking to persuade affected states, which include Kerala that has been contributing close to 50% of current Covid infections in the country and some of the northeast states, to implement advisories pertaining to micro containment to prevent a wider spread of infection in the community. The Centre has curtailed directions under the NDMA since May last year when the unlock process was largely left to the states. But while the Centre is loathe to use the NDMA, there is a view that the situation cannot be allowed to drift after the high cost of the second wave in terms of lives and resources. "We cannot allow the situation to continue, there are wider ramifications to failing to bring down infections. A new variant can impact our vaccine programme," said an official. Parts of the northeast in states like Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram have seen a rise in infections and the Centre is awaiting the latest assessment of national centre for disease control teams for an assessment of the health infrastructure and systems of detecting and reporting Covid 19. The case of Kerala has been troubling with the state seeing waxing and waning of infections since late August when restrictions were relaxed for Onam. Now with the festival again approaching, the cost of intermingling is worrying central officials who also warn against "over reliance" on the national sero survey findings that exposure to the infection is low in the state. "The survey is essentially intended to provide a national picture, it's use for state level interpretation is limited," said a source. Even as the Centre has advised Kerala to impose strict restrictions to curtail movement and intermingling of people, the state has indicated that its availability of health infrastructure and a low mortality rate so far means it can control the situation. However, the Centre is concerned this may not only risk many lives in Kerala but also result in a wider spread, spurts of which are already evident in some of the neighboring states, a senior official said. “There are concerns because the R value (how many can one person infect) is more than 1.2, indicating that infection is expanding,” he said, adding a final call on containment strategy will be taken after evaluating the assessment report of the central team visiting Kerala. “All the options including NDMA are technically open but our efforts are to have the state on board. The NDMA has provisions that if positivity is above 10%, then significant restrictions should be imposed. There are more than eight districts in Kerala with positivity rate above 10%,” the official said. Moreover, a rapid surge in cases also increases the risk of mutation. “We have advised the state to implement effective and strict containment to ensure cases are contained in localised area but on ground they feel mitigation is the best strategy as they have low mortality and feel the rise in cases is because of Delta variant,” the official said. “Such a large scale replication of infection in any state, district, is not good because then no one is safe. Kerala is not a island. They have a good health system, low mortality but if there is a transmission to other states then who will stop deaths there,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-may-use-ndma-to-issue-orders-to-states-as-kerala-northeast-states-see-covid-spike/articleshow/84960001.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Vials need ‘smart’ labels to show heat damage: Experts||MUMBAI: The Chinese Covid-19 vaccine has an unlikely USP over others: A tiny label that can monitor heat damage. The label, better known as vaccine vial monitor, has been a part of mass vaccination such as polio drives in India because it has a heat-sensitive chemical that tells health workers if a vial was stored correctly or damaged due to exposure to heat. It is the easiest way to find out if the cold chain to store certain vaccines was maintained or not. However, the vaccines available in India don’t have vaccine vial monitors, which would add around Rs 50 per vial. “As India steps up vaccination, especially in rural parts, the vaccine vial monitor would be the best tool to indicate if a vial is usable or not,” said Dr Sunil Khaparde, former central health ministry official who was associated with the Pulse Polio drive in the initial days. Vaccinators in India are trained to check the ‘bindi’ mark before giving vaccines to children. In 1998, VVMs were first used in the oral polio vaccine and Dr Khaparde believes they played a role in helping eradicate polio. “While India had 1,934 cases in 1998, the use of VVMs coincided with a drop since 1999 when 1,126 cases were reported,” said Dr Khaparde. On July 14, Temptime, the American company licenced by the World Health Organisation to manufacture VVMs, wrote to India’s health minister Mansukh Mandaviya about using VVM to Covid vaccines available in India. “The people of India have benefited from the use of VVM in the universal immunisation programme for over 20 years. VVM’s ability to indicate heat damage to vaccines, is a critical enabling tool in the immunisation programme,” said the letter. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said Covid vaccines at the moment have to be used within four hours of opening the vial. According to the Temptime letter to Mandaviya, the overall cost impact of VVM is just 0.3% of the Covid-19 vaccine vial cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vials-need-smart-labels-to-show-heat-damage-experts/articleshow/84960084.cms||---

The reason: A Covid test result takes anywhere between 12 to 24 hours. However, passengers were a relieved lot as airlines stepped in and relaxed rules till late Sunday. They allowed those with vaccination certificates to travel. Passengers who were wary of taking risks, put off their travel plans. Karnataka’s earlier policy was to allow those having taken at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to enter the state without an RT-PCR test report. However, Saturday’s announcement said irrespective of the vaccination status of passengers, they must carry an RT-PCR negative report not more than 72 hours old. The order also said airlines should not issue boarding passes to people without the test report. “My Air Asia flight to Bengaluru from Kochi was on Sunday afternoon and I learnt of the order only on Saturday evening,” said K Ajayan from Ernakulam in Kerala, who works at an IT firm in Kadubeesanahalli, Bengaluru. “Since Kerala remains under weekend lockdown, I couldn’t find a lab to take a Covid test on time and I had to postpone my trip to Tuesday.” Many people scheduled to fly to Karnataka from different parts of Kerala and Maharashtra made frantic calls to airline helplines with queries on their planned trip. Following this, most domestic airlines relaxed the RT-PCR report rule on Saturday and Sunday. “We understand it is difficult for passengers booked to fly on Saturday and Sunday to get a Covid test result in a short period. Therefore, we decided to extend the vaccination certificate rule till Sunday and passengers without tests were allowed to board. But from Monday, those flying in from Maharashtra and Kerala must have a Covid negative report,” said an IndiGo airlines staffer at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). Other airlines followed suit on Sunday, and staffers, on behalf of the state health department, inspected Covid negative certificates of passengers from the two states who landed in Bengaluru. From Monday passengers flying in from Maharashtra and Kerala will not be issued boarding passes if they don’t produce RT-PCR negative reports at their port of boarding, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-govts-ve-cert-rule-hits-students-and-travellers/articleshow/84960432.cms||---
---||India||Triple talaq cases down 80% since law passed in 2019, says government||NEW DELHI: The government on Sunday gave a higher profile to the law against triple talaq, marking the ‘Muslim Women’s Rights Day’ two years after the practice became a criminal offence, and claimed a decline of 80% in such cases. The Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that it is estimated that there has been a reduction of about 80% compared to the period prior to the law. He said that a database of cases was being compiled by the ministry to enable a detailed analysis. Naqvi along with women and child development minister Smriti Irani and environment and labour minister Bhupendra Yadav also made a strong pitch for a “convergence model” to empower women from minority communities through existing schemes linked to nutrition, education and entrepreneurship. The occasion could be seen in a political light given BJP’s long-standing demand for a uniform civil code and the Uttar Pradesh election early next year. Criminalisation of triple talaq has been seen as a polarising issue which has not found favour with large sections of Muslim opinion. Last year to mark the first anniversary of the law, the ministry had put out data based on previous estimates and information on cases gathered to highlight that there was a significant decline. Reports collected from minority commissions, Waqf Boards and local administration were shared by the ministry of minority affairs. These institutions and authorities received 1,039 talaq-i-biddat cases since August 2019. The Supreme Court had declared instant talaq as void and illegal in 2017. However, this year Naqvi said that despite attempts to collect data, state level functionaries were unable to collect it as the authorities were busy battling the Covid-19 pandemic. At a programme organised in Delhi on Sunday, in the presence of Muslim women including victims of triple talaq, Naqvi shared that there has been a significant decline in cases. Naqvi said the latest data was being collected and next year to mark three years of the law, the government will bring together women from across the country to the national capital to share and reflect on the impact of the legislation. As per data shared last year, between 1985 to August 2019 there were maximum cases of instant triple talaq in Uttar Pradesh at 63,400, followed by 38,617 from Bihar and 33,122 from Rajashtan. Over one year since August 2019, the maximum complaints and cases pertaining to instant triple talaq were from Uttar Pradesh at 281 followed by 203 from Telangana/Andhra Pradesh, 201 from West Bengal and 102 from Maharashtra. There were 83 cases from Rajasthan, 49 from Bihar, 32 from Madhya Pradesh, 26 each from Tamil Nadu and Haryana, 19 from Kerala and 17 from Assam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/triple-talaq-cases-down-80-since-law-passed-in-2019-says-government/articleshow/84960497.cms||---

The woman was raped by former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in 2017 in Unnao, UP, when she was a minor. Sengar is serving life imprisonment in the case. District and sessions judge Dharmesh Sharma directed CBI to file a report on the application, which has sought appropriate directions to be issued to the security officials to not curtail her liberties, upon telephonic verification by her counsel or any other source. The woman has alleged that her personal security officers were vindictive to her and her family members. “In the name of security, concerned police/security officials are bent upon in curtailing the movements/personal liberty of the rape survivor, to such an extent that she is not even allowed to meet her counsel and come to the court,” the application said.

---||India||To register protest, opposition plans parallel Parliament session||NEW DELHI: Opposition parties are likely to register their protest against the government’s “obduracy” on the Pegasus issue by holding a parallel session of Parliament outside Parliament House. A proposal to this effect was mooted, along with a few others, during a meeting of 14 opposition parties last week, where several MPs said opposition parties, since they are being denied the opportunity to be seen and heard on the floor of the House, should hold a parallel sitting outside to discuss the illegal surveillance mounted on the judiciary, election commission, journalists, civil society, bureaucracy, ministers and opposition leaders. “The Speaker is not allowing opposition protests and dissent inside Parliament to be shown and government stubbornly refers to Pegasus as a non-issue. There’s a view that opposition parties should jointly hold a parallel parliament session outside,” said RSP MP NK Premachandran. A Congress MP also said the proposal is on the table. With Parliament appearing gridlocked for the third week, opposition leaders TOI spoke to said there are little chances of the stalemate ending this week. Sources said leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, conveyed to parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi and leader of the House in Rajya Sabha, Piyush Goyal, that government outreach should be addressed jointly to the 14 opposition leaders who are determined that there shall be no winding down of the demand for a discussion on Pegasus. With little urgent legislative business pending, sources said the government may urge the presiding officers to wind up the monsoon session earlier than its designated date of August 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-register-protest-opposition-plans-parallel-parliament-session/articleshow/84960669.cms||Swati Mathur

Meena and his supporters posted videos and photos from the spot, standing alongside dilapidated ramparts, about 150-meters away from the main fort. Police soon arrived and took Meena to Vidhyadhar Nagar police station. He was let off at about 1.30pm. Later, he boasted about how he defied “three-tier” police security to fulfill his commitment of going to the fort. The fort had become a flashpoint between two sections of the Meena community — one led by a Congress-backed independent MLA Ramkesh Meena and another led by Kirori Lal Meena and supported by Hindu outfits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-mp-defies-3-tier-security-hoists-flag-at-raj-flashpoint-fort/articleshow/84960685.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: 5% of Covaxin royalty to ICMR raises questions||MUMBAI: Bharat Biotech will pay a royalty of 5% on net sales of its Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin to Indian Council of Medical Research, prompting concerns from public health and IP experts. They have questioned the need for the payout, to be done on a half-yearly basis and the basis for the calculation. The pay-out reflects in the cost of the vaccine, and hence impacts affordability, they told TOI. While the Centre has revised the price to Rs 225 per dose for Covaxin for the fresh order placed in July, it is the most expensive jab in the private market at Rs 1,410. Junior health minister Bharati Pravin Pawar told Parliament that the royalty “clause is governed by the MoU executed between the two parties (Bharat Biotech and ICMR) for the development of Covaxin”. As per the CoWin website, when the vaccination was launched on January 16, a little over 5 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered in the overall 45 crore immunisation so far. The government had invested in pre-clinical studies for Covaxin, and Rs 35 crore was spent on its clinical trials, according to the Centre’s affidavit filed in Supreme Court in May. “The government should also verify the investments made by Bharat Biotech. If ICMR gets a royalty of 5% on Rs 35 crore funding, can the government verify that BB invested upwards of Rs 650 crore for development of Covaxin?” Murali Neelakantan, principal lawyer at Amicus said. Amulya Nidhi of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan alleged that there appeared to be a nexus between government and company for earning profits. “Rather than giving 5% royalty to ICMR, the Centre should order technology transfer and a compulsory licence be given to not only the government-owned companies, but to all potential manufacturers.” “The royalty should have been used instead to reduce the price of the vaccine by 5% for the citizens during the pandemic, and not as a source of revenue by a government body like ICMR, entrusted for disaster management of Covid-19,” added Rohit Jain, a doctor working on patient issues. Queries mailed by TOI to ICMR went unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-5-of-covaxin-royalty-to-icmr-raises-questions/articleshow/84960688.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

They are scheduled to hold a meeting on August 4, following which they are likely to announce the final date for the 12th century shrine’s reopening. The temple has been shut to devotees since April 24 due to the pandemic. This comes a day after the state government authorised district collectors to take a call on reopening of places of worship in their jurisdictions after assessing the Covid situation. The government separately asked the district collectors of Puri and Khurda to hold discussions with the Jagannath and Lingaraj temple administrations before reopening the two shrines in Puri and Bhubaneswar, respectively. “We will take time to dismantle the three giant chariots parked in front of the Jagannath Temple. A shed will be set up outside the temple to for the devotees. We will subject the servitors to RT-PCR test before the temple reopens,” a district official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/puri-temple-may-open-for-public-in-mid-august/articleshow/84960742.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Maritime security, terrorism and peacekeeping will be the three areas of focus for India in the UNSC. India will organise a virtual high-level ‘Open Debate’ for heads of state and government titled, ‘Maintenance of international peace and security: Enhancing maritime security — A case for international cooperation’. Foreign minister S Jaishankar tweeted, “As we take over UNSC Presidency for August, look forward to working productively with other members. India will always be a voice of moderation, an advocate of dialogue and a proponent of international law.” India’s permanent representative to the UN, T S Tirumurti, said in a video message, “During our Presidency in August, India is organising three high-level signature meetings, focusing on our priority areas: maritime security, peacekeeping, and counterterrorism. India will also be organising a solemn event in the memory of peacekeepers,” he said. Two ministerial level meetings on terrorism and peacekeeping will see engagements by both foreign minister and foreign secretary. India is looking to contribute technological solutions to help peacekeepers in different parts of the world, which will be unveiled during this month. Tirumurti began by acknowledging his immediate predecessor, France, which led the UNSC in July.

Rejecting the bail application of one Javed of UP’s Etah district, Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav said that though Article 25 (1) of Indian Constitution provides right to freedom of religion and every adult citizen of the country is free to convert his/her religion and can marry any adult citizen, it does not mean that a person can be converted by greed or fear. In its decision, the court quoted the judgment of apex court in the case of Lilly Thomas, wherein the apex court said that without having faith in Islam, the conversion of a non-Muslim only for getting married is void. “Further, the Allahabad high court in the case of Noor Jahan Begum alias Anjali versus state of UP has held that conversion only for getting married is unacceptable,” the court said. The victim gave the statement in front of the magistrate that she was made to sign on a blank paper and on a paper written in Urdu and later on, she got to know that the bail applicant was already married. It was alleged by the prosecution that the girl was unlawfully converted for the sole purpose of getting her married to the bail applicant . On the other hand, the petitioner said that both the parties were adults and the girl changed her religion on her own free will and got married. The HC also observed that there was no place for religious bigotry, greed and fear in the country, but if a person belonging to the majority community converts his/her religion after getting insulted, then the country becomes weak and divisive powers benefit out of it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/conversion-after-being-insulted-weakens-country-observes-hc/articleshow/84960803.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Business||Give jobs data faster every quarter: Finance ministry to statistics ministry||NEW DELHI: The finance ministry has asked the statistics ministry to put in place a quarterly employment data mechanism, which should be released with a month’s lag to help in policymaking. The lack of timely jobs data is a stumbling block to data-driven policy formulation. “A timely employment data is a crucial missing link,” a source familiar with the deliberations told TOI. The issues have been taken up by the finance ministry’s economic division with the ministry of statistics as part of efforts to fill a major gap that currently exists. At present, the quarterly jobs data comes with a lag of around 45 days under the periodic labour force surveys (PLFS). The PLFS was started in 2017 to give a better picture of the employment scenario. But this too is now found to be inadequate as the time lag creates roadblocks. Sources pointed to the recent release of the annual PLFS for 2019-20. “How can you make policies based on data which is one-year old?” said a source. The pandemic has put the spotlight on jobs and authorities are scrambling for real-time data to assess the situation on the ground. Private surveys carried out have shown that the unemployment situation had reached record highs during the pandemic. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a private economic data provider, has said that the economic recovery from the pandemic will not be able to get the country’s GDP where it was before the shock even by the end of March 2022. “The loss from where the earlier growth trajectory could have taken India has also widened compared to earlier expectations. The labour participation rate remains 2.7 percentage points lower than its pre-Covid levels. The employment rate remains 3.3 percentage points lower than the pre-Covid levels,” CMIE MD & CEO Mahesh Vyas said in a recent note. The government is confident that growth will be robust in 2021-22, which should lead to improvement in the jobs space. A panel headed by the former NITI Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya had submitted a report, calling for arevamp of the country’s jobs data and had backed timely release of such numbers to aid policymaking. While the finance ministry is seeking that the mechanism be put in place immediately, the statistics ministry has been slow to respond to the issue, with a section raising several issues. The government also uses the payroll data of EPFO and others. But, experts have for long argued for timely and credible jobs data to get a better picture of the jobs situation in the economy and devising policies to create employment and increase women labour force participation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/give-jobs-data-faster-every-quarter-finance-ministry-to-statistics-ministry/articleshow/84960857.cms||---

In the appeal, he has claimed that Videocon’s foreign oil and gas assets held through foreign subsidiaries are an integral part of the group and the resolution professional and committee of creditors cannot sell them separately.  The Twin Star proposal, although approved by the committee of creditors and the NCLT, has been stayed on an appeal from Bank of Maharashtra. Dhoot has claimed that the liquidation value of these assets is at least Rs 15,000 crore. The former chairman and promoter of the group said that if all assets were sold together, the realisation would have been at least Rs 25,000 crore. Lenders are proceeding separately against Videocon for the recovery of consumer electronics and energy business under VOVL. Meanwhile, lenders have decided to sell their loan exposure to VOVL to the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC, the bad bank). Dhoot claimed that he had made a one-time restructuring proposal where he had offered to repay Rs 30,000 crore in return for his business. However, the lenders had pursued recovery through NCLT and a settlement was not possible.

---||Business||Need to revisit direct taxes, says N K Singh||In 1991, as joint secretary in the finance ministry, N K Singh played a key role in negotiating loans with international agencies and other lenders. In an interview, Singh, who was the chairman of the 15th Finance Commission, talks about the need to rework India’s tax strategy. Excerpts:How do you see India’s evolution from a country that was forced to borrow 30 years ago to the situation now?There has been a tectonic shift in multiple ways. In the 1980s, we decided to foster growth through higher public outlays from internal borrowings and external debt. The concessional flow of debt, which was around 89%, came down to 39%. This created strains on the balance of payments, leading to the emergence of the crisis in 1989. The challenge was picked up by the Chandrashekhar government, including the mortgage of gold. But the government changed and the reforms were announced in 1991. We needed support from the World Bank, IMF and bilateral donors, who were important members of the Aid India consortium. At that time, the ethos in the multilateral institutions was what was known as cross-conditionality. We had to implement the obligations every quarter to access resources from IMF in additional to the World Bank’s structural benchmarks. At that time, we wanted the fastest disbursing loan because of the forex reserves were at a historic low. Fast forward 30 years: The entire language has changed. Our reserves today are perhaps an embarrassment — the question is how to make use of these reserves in imaginative ways. Our dialogue today is on how to deepen economic reforms and cover areas that we had not, such as farm sector, labour and completing the elusive agenda on power sector reforms. The mantra is no more on enhanced public outlays but enhanced public outlays to be concentrated on credible infrastructure and more robust social sector spending. Should states be the primary drivers of reforms now?States need to be more proactive, energetic and imaginative stakeholders. Very few states, such Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, understood the importance and as a result not all states benefited equally from the 1991 reforms. The next headlines cannot be New Delhi but have to be Lucknow, Hyderabad and Bhubaneswar. Unless the states become active stakeholders, many important reforms will not make much impact on the ground. The third tier has to be part of it for issues such as health. Is it time to rework the direct tax mode where successive governments have failed to expand the tax base and keep raising the threshold? Is it also time to retire the 60-yearold Income Tax Act?Public outlays in India are not significantly misaligned with a low middle-income country of this kind. In fact, they need to be expanded in terms of improving the inequalities. The overall tax-GDP ratio is no more than the highest it reached —21.6% in 2007-08. An average middle-income country of this kind would have a tax-GDP ratio of 27.2%. In Asia, the average is 25%. Our tax-GDP ratio of around 20% is unsustainable to afford public outlays of the kind which are necessary, without spillover impact on fiscal deficit and unsustainable debt targets. If you go on raising the exemption limit, as a populist thing, it results in people coming into the tax net going out of it. Nearly half the population, which is engaged in agriculture, is already outside the net. If 5.5 crore returns are filed, 40.5% have no taxes, and it’s 6.3% who bear the burden of 79% of taxes. We need to revisit it in a fundamental way. What is your assessment of GST and changes that may be required?On indirect taxes, the calculations given by IMF suggest that there could be failure of compliance of nearly 4-5% of GDP, which is huge. GST has been clobbered by several issues. I don’t know if the grand bargain of assured 14% revenue growth to states was necessary because at that time the economy was very well. We have not been able to arrive at a genuine revenue-neutral rate. There are different estimates — from 14% to 16%. IMF had suggested 11.6%, but without exemptions. Our effective rate of around 11% is misaligned with any estimates. Add to it the inverted duty structure, compliance issues, broad-banding the rates and depoliticising the functioning of the GST Council. The future of GST must be addressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/need-to-revisit-direct-taxes-says-n-k-singh/articleshow/84960902.cms||---

Latest data released by the finance ministry on Sunday showed that collections rose 33% over a year ago, with revenue from domestic transactions up 32% and from imports being 36% higher. Data for July collections are based on sales in June. Due to the lockdown, collections had dropped below the psychologically important Rs 1-lakh-crore mark. “With the easing of covid restrictions, GST collection for July 2021 has again crossed Rs 1 lakh crore, which clearly indicates that the economy is recovering at a fast pace. The robust GST revenues are likely to continue in the coming months too,” the finance ministry said. Experts too seemed to agree. “The sharp increase in the collections for June 2021 indicates the resumption of economic activities in June and will raise expectations of better collections in the coming months. The improvement in GST collections — both on domestic transactions and imports, accompanied by the fact that major producing states have shown significant increases — would indicate that the economic activities have resumed across the country,” said M S Mani, senior director at consulting firm Deloitte India. There were, however, some concerns around the collections not yet reaching presecond wave levels. “In our view, this is further evidence that the graduated unlocking in June 2021 has triggered an incomplete recovery, which is expected to strengthen in July 2021, further boosting the August 2021 GST collections. The pace of growth across the states was highly uneven in July 2021, with some industrial heavyweights recording a sharp expansion,” added ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gst-kitty-up-by-rs-1-2-lakh-crore-as-economic-activity-picks-up/articleshow/84960924.cms||---

Jamui MP Chirag Paswan, who leads another faction of LJP, also supported the demand for caste-based census in the country. Addressing a meeting as part of his ‘ashirvad yatra’ in Nawada, Chirag said caste-based census was the need of the hour. Talking to mediapersons after a meeting with newly-elected district presidents and senior functionaries of the party, Prince said the census would help the government assess whether the benefits of schemes reached the poor. The Samastipur MP denied any split in the LJP founded by late Ram Vilas Paswan. “Only top leadership has changed, which happens in every political party,” he said Prince added Paras was nominated as the national president as per the constitution of the party. “We have never talked about any split in the LJP,” he said, adding statements about split came from the other side. Prince said the party leadership still believed that the LJP has its six MPs in the Lok Sabha. Referring to Chirag, he said, “We have no grudge against him. The love and affection for him is the same as it used to be.” Prince welcomed former minister Himraj Singh, who accepted the membership of the LJP on the occasion. Asked about allegations of sexual abuse against him, Prince said investigation was still in progress. “I have lodged a police complaint in this connection,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/prince-chirag-support-caste-census-in-country/articleshow/84955013.cms||Ramashankar

But there are other leaders in the country who have the potential to become the PM. Nitish is one of them,” Kushwaha, who merged his 8-year-old RLSP with JD(U) four months back, said. Asked whether Nitish will be projected as the PM face, Kushwaha said, “We are in the NDA and firmly support the alliance.” Kushwaha’s remark came at a time when opposition parties are holding parleys to form a united “third front” against the BJP. Asked about Kushwaha’s “PM material” remark, Nitish said he had no idea about any such statement (of Upendra). “Why should I be a PM material? There was no such talk at the JD(U) meeting in Delhi on Saturday,” Nitish told reporters outside Patna airport on his return from the national capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-has-all-qualities-to-become-pm-kushwaha/articleshow/84954916.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||Groundwater levels in Ahmedabad third deepest in India||AHMEDABAD: A data tabled in the Rajya Sabha recently pointed that Ahmedabad city was found to have groundwater levels at 67 metre (220 feet) in the confined aquifer. At 67 metre, Ahmedabad had the third deepest groundwater aquifer after Jaipur (84.7 metre) and Dehradun (79.2 metre), according to RS data. To put the figure in perspective, the deepest Delhi’s level was at 64 metre, 53.6 metre in Chandigarh and 45.8 metre in Lucknow. Other Gujarat cities fared better with the deepest levels at 12.3 metre in Vadodara, 5.5 metre in Rajkot and 4.6 metre in Surat. The data was collected from four wells in Ahmedabad and Vadodara each, and one well in Rajkot and Surat each. The RS data also pointed that in the phreatic aquifer (below the water table area), the minimum level where water was found in Ahmedabad was found to be 2.2 metre (7 feet) below ground level and maximum 24.7 metre (81 feet) in three wells dug by the experts from Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) in November 2020. Another question related to the groundwater quality revealed that out of 33 districts, 21 had reported salinity in some parts, 22 fluoride, 24 nitrate, 12 arsenic and 10 districts reported iron in the water samples. Talking on the groundwater scenario in urban areas, Apoorva Oza, CEO of Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (India), said that while majority of the residential societies have tap water supply, they are augmenting it with bore wells. “The water table is not recharged enough. Earlier we used to have open spaces where the soil would absorb water. But with faced paced development, open spaces have shrunk significantly,” he said. “While the monsoon is still here, we must focus on water conservation. Another way is promoting re-use of water – something which is as high as 93% in countries like Japan.” Mohan Sharma, executive director, Development Support Center (DSC) said: “The crop intensity has increased in almost every district which is leading to tremendous pressure on ground water sources. The nitrate content has also increased. Of course, various government and cooperative initiatives have resulted in improvement in water tables in several pockets particularly in Saurashtra, south and north Gujarat districts, but this positive change is limited to nearby canals only like Sujalam Sufalam.” Sharma added that salinity and nitrate is an issue in the majority of coastal districts along with metal or chemical impurities. “The soil quality is also degrading due to continuous use of deep ground water,” said Sharma, adding that in the periphery of Ahmedabad, the groundwater scenario has improved a bit with arrival of Narmada water. State-based experts said that the majority of the coastal districts have sea ingress issues, and community-level efforts are on to reduce the severity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/groundwater-levels-in-abad-3rd-deepest-in-india/articleshow/84957979.cms||Parth Shastri

The appeal comes in the wake of a spike in Covid-19 cases reported in several states across the country. The TTD observed that several devotees were moving about in groups without wearing masks or adhering to other Covid-appropriate behaviour. “We have been consistently trying to bring about an awareness among visiting devotees to stringently adhere to Covid-19 guidelines but have noticed that a few devotees have been deviating from these, posing a threat to fellow devotees and TTD staffers. As nearly 20,000 devotees from across the country are queuing up at the Tirumala temple daily, it is important for us to strictly enforce Covid-19 guidelines even more stringently.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Forensic institute with 8 departments, 14 labs will open with 150 students||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh State Institute of Forensic Science (UPSIFS) set up under the ministry of home affairs in Lucknow will have eight departments and 14 laboratories. The institute, which will begin classes with 150 students, will offer BSc, MSc, MPhil, PhD and diplomas and certificate courses. It will be governed by Gujarat-based National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU), as per an MoU signed between NFSU chancellor JN Vyas and UP additional chief secretary. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath recalled home minister Amit Shah’s suggestion in 2019 about establishing an advanced forensic institute in keeping with the changing nature of crime and its challenges during his visit to UP. “This has finally materialised under the guidance of PM Narendra Modi and home minister Shah. For improving policing and setting new benchmarks, we will establish a centre of excellence and produce forensic experts,” he said. DGP Mukul Goel said, the institute will not only train policemen and those in the prosecution department, but also educate students and propel research in forensic science. It will also enable students to explore new career avenues and the state will get its best forensic scientists, he added. A senior police official said, the institute will have departments of physics, biology, chemistry, ballistics, serology, toxicology and cyber forensics. Three other departments related to policing would be law, behavioural sciences and police administration. Separate labs will be set up for ballistics, serology and cyber forensics. The department of behavioural sciences will have separate lab facilities for brain mapping, lie-detection tests and narco-analysis. It will also have a resource centre on civil and criminal law. Of the 496 posts, 14 professors, 12 associate professors and 42 assistant professors have been shortlisted, but the final call be taken by NFSU. Hostel facilities for at least 500 students have also been planned. A home department official privy to the project said, public works department would handle the construction work, for which the tendering process will complete in next two months. The entire project is expected to be complete by March, 2023. Additional director, general, technical services, Sandeep Salunke, said the project will have three parts — DNA laboratory spread over 5acre, forensic science laboratory on 3 acres and remaining space will house the forensic science institute. Rs 15 crore allocation for setting up advanced DNA labUnion home minister Amit Shah said, Rs 15 crore will be allocated for establishing the hi-tech DNA lab along with the forensic institute. It would be the first of its kind institute in the country and prove to set a milestone in police modernization. He also said, by 2024 many states will also have advanced forensic sciences institutes affiliated to NFSU. “Overall conviction rate in India is low in comparison to Israel because we lack expertise in forensic sciences and preservation of evidence,” said Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/forensic-institute-with-8-depts-14-labs-will-open-with-150-students/articleshow/84959821.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

All burning issues, including internal security, which should have been addressed immediately after Independence, were kept alive for decades.” BJP has solved all the pending issues under the leadership of PM and home minister, said Yogi. Speaking about the scheduled interaction of PM with beneficiaries of PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana in UP on August 5, Yogi said, “August 5 is very special date as the surgical strike took place on the same date, foundation of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was laid and Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir was abolished the same day.” The home minister had ensured inclusion of many issues in BJP’s Sankalp Patra of 2017 assembly election, he said adding, the vision behind it was to ensure justice for all by ending fear, ensuring development and work to improve education, health and all other fields. The medical college being constructed in Mirzapur in the name of Maa Vindhyavasini is also a step in the same direction, he added. Work on developing religious shrines and sites for promoting tourism had been started with Prayagraj Kumbh, he said, adding, “It was decided to develop the sites of religious and tourist importance in each assembly area. The Maa Vindhyavasini Corridor is also a step in the same direction, he said mentioning nobody had imagined ropeway would start at Ashtabhuja and Kali Khoh, Yogi added. Yogi also mentioned how Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) and other development projects are transforming Varanasi without disturbing its ancient culture. He said that measures being initiated at Chitrakoot and Shringverpur will boost tourism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/yogi-lauds-pm-shah-forable-selfless-leadership/articleshow/84957038.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The proposed state-of-the-art facility is targeted to be made functional in two years. An announcement in this regard was made recently by health minister Mangal Pandey during the monsoon session of the state assembly. Department’s additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit said concept approval for the construction of a hospital exclusively for children has been done and they are now focusing on planning and execution. Amrit said the department was in touch with the best consultants and the aim is to make the best hospital for children in eastern India. “All treatment facilities for children will be there at the hospital and we want to make it functional in record time,” Amrit said. This will be the first government hospital exclusively for children in Patna and second one in Bihar after a PICU hospital in Muzaffarpur. However, Amrit said the hospital would be bigger in size than the PICU hospital in Muzaffarpur which was also constructed in a record time. Sources said the need for a superspecialty hospital was felt at a recent high-level meeting of the health department to chalk out ways to tackle the likely third wave of Covid pandemic. All the beds at the proposed hospital will have oxygen facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/superspecialty-hospital-for-children-in-patna-soon-health-department/articleshow/84954481.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Vadodara||Vishwamitri that shaped Vadodara in choppy waters||Vadodara: The winding Vishwamitri River, which decided which way Vadodara would turn, owes its name to the venerated sage Vishwamitra, the author of Gayatri Mantra.  From the time the first human settlement came up at Ankotakka (present day Akota) to the current days when the river meanders through the city, Vishwamitri is intertwined with Vadodara which itself is named after a Banyan tree.  But the city seems to have done little for the river that makes it the only one in the country to have a healthy crocodile population floating right from its heart. Origins of this 2,200-year-old city are traced to the Skandha Purana. The scripture says that a pious Brahman who used to live in Champavati (now Champaner) in the Shankar forest (now Pavagadh) resolved one day to offer his head to Lord Shiva. But Shiva did not want the Brahman’s blood to fall on him. So, he sank deep into the earth creating a huge gulf.  Brahmarshi Vishwamitra had his ashram in the Shankar forest. One day, his sacred cow Kamdhenu fell into this gulf. Lord Shiva advised the cow to let milk flow from her udders till she floated to the surface.  When Vishwamitra learnt about this, he asked Himadri (now Himalaya) mountain to fill in this gulf to avoid such mishaps. Some puranas suggest that Himadri ordered one of his sons, Pavak Chakra, to stand on the gulf.  Vishwamitra on request from its people destroyed Pavak (Pavagadh) and blessed the whole region with a river which was named after him – Vishwamitri.  The river turned out to be an inspiration for the sage to write Gayatri Mantra. It is said that chanting of this mantra removes toxins from the body. Ironically, dumping of waste, increased chloride levels in surface and groundwater, has turned several stretches of this river toxic!||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vishwamitri-that-shaped-vadodara-in-choppy-waters/articleshow/84954800.cms||Prashant Rupera

Whenever Shashi Kapoor was in Kolkata for work or leisure, room number 17 at Fairlawn Hotel was the only address where he would be found. The 238-year-old hotel, which has been restored and re-christened Elgin Fairlawn after a change of ownership, has now renamed the room as Shashi Kapoor Room as a part of a tribute to its legendary guest. The room has been decorated with rare photographs of the actor and the furniture he used, and the hotel is about to start letting guests stay there. This was the hotel where Kapoor met his British wife Jennifer Kendal in 1956. She was a guest at the hotel with her family that owned a travelling theatre company, Shakespeareana, that produced Shakespeare plays across India. Kapoor was then a part of his father’s Prithvi Theatre Company as a stage manager and was entranced by Miranda from ‘The Tempest’. Love blossomed and soon the two decided to marry, against the wish of Jennifer’s father Geoffrey Kendal. The hotel witnessed the growing romance of the two who later visited it for their honeymoon. The couple would often come back to the city to holiday with their children. “He loved to walk around the area and even ordered his kulhad-wali chai from the roadside vendors. From the durwan to the workers at the hotel, the actor chatted with everyone and touched every chord here with his smile,” said Rabindranath Pal, who has been managing the hotel for over 40 years. Kapoor was born in Kolkata and spent his young days here, so he was comfortable conversing with everyone in fluent Bengali. Even after Jennifer passed away, Kapoor would often come to the hotel to spend time in the room that he and his wife loved so much. The couple’s children, Sanjana, Kunal and Karan, who were frequent guests when their parents were here for long periods, have stayed here subsequently. “He loved the furniture in the room and we preserved them the way he liked,” Pal said. The room’s furniture has also been restored. The only change is the sign, which reads: ‘The Shashi Kapoor Room’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heritage-hotel-set-to-offer-guests-a-slice-of-shashi-kapoors-life-in-kol/articleshow/84956097.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The last time the positivity rate was 0.12% was on July 8, which was also the last time fresh cases were higher than that of Sunday — 93. For the second day in a row, Delhi recorded one fatality, taking the total toll to 25,054. Sunday was also the third consecutive day when the number of recovered patients was lower than new cases. In all, 72,447 tests, including 50,319 RT-PCR and 22,128 Rapid Antigen Tests, were conducted. With 83 patients recovering in the last 24 hours, the number of active cases stood at 582 on Sunday, the highest in more than a week. The number of patients recuperating in home isolation was 172, while the figure was 167 last Sunday.

Das was addressing state party leaders and workers at a virtual meeting organised by the party’s Bangladesh Mukti Sangram Swarn Jayanti Samaroh Samiti. He said the liberation of Bangladesh was a historic moment and everyone should remember it. “Fifty years back, Indian Army had bifurcated Pakistan into two parts under the leadership of the then PM Indira Gandhi. Every Indian should be proud of it,” Das said. State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha said the party would celebrate the event like a festival and organise several programmes. He said, “We will remember the martyrs and honour their family members.” Bangladesh Mukti Sangram Swarn Jayanti Samaroh Samiti president Jaeya Mishr said programmes would be held at three levels – district, state and national. She added the party was identifying the family of martyred soldiers at district and state levels for honouring them. State Congress research committee president Anand Madhab said the party has always created history and the present government is trying to erase them.

---||Patna||Lalan’s elevation Bihar CM’s deft move to hit many targets with one stone||PATNA: At a time when political parties have started strategizing for the assembly elections in five states due early next year and the NDA government in Bihar has a very thin majority, the nomination of Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan (Lalan) as the JD(U) national president is considered a deft move by party supremo and CM Nitish Kumar, who has tried to hit many targets with a single arrow (party poll symbol). Rajiv, better known as Lalan babu in JD(U), replaced RCP Singh as the party chief on Saturday. JD(U) is in a very uncomfortable situation, though its leader Nitish is the CM despite winning only 43 seats in the state assembly elections last year, compared to ally BJP’s 74. Lalan has his task cut out not only to expand the party, but also increase the number of its MLAs. Considered a master of political manoeuvrings with vast experience of handling organisational and legislative matters as the JD(U) state chief as well as a minister during a long career spanning since the era of socialist icon of Bihar, Jannayak Karpoori Thakur, the three-time MP indicated his preferences after his nomination as party president; that he will take everyone along and bring back the old “friends” of his Samata Party days. By nominating Lalan as the first JD(U) president from an upper caste (Bhumihar), Nitish has tried to prove his critics wrong that his party was reduced to ‘Luv-Kush' (Kurmi-Koeri) caste combine. Nitish and RCP are from Nalanda and belong to the same Kurmi caste while former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha is a Koeri. Upendra merged his RLSP with JD(U) recently and was immediately made the party’s parliamentary board chairman. Even the party’s state president Umesh Kushwaha is a Koeri. Nitish has also tried to strike another balance in social engineering to wean away the Bhumihar voters, who now feel marginalised in the scheme of things of BJP which they have supported and voted in election after election in Bihar. Given the fact that even the main opposition RJD, being virtually led by Lalu Prasad’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, is projecting itself as an A-to-Z party while trying to drop the baggage of an M-Y (Muslim-Yadav) party, Nitish is eyeing a larger vote base among the upper castes as well as Dalits and extremely backward classes besides the OBCs. The BJP and JD(U) have serious ideological differences on certain issues like conducting caste census and framing and enforcing law to control birth rate besides implementing the new National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Bihar. Though BJP has categorically said it is not going to conduct a caste census, the JD(U) passed political resolutions at its national executive committee meeting in Delhi on Saturday in its favour and against any “coercive law” on population control measures. Lalan, who is a tough bargainer and a political manipulator, reportedly had a hand in the coup staged in the LJP by Jamui MP Chirag Paswan’s uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras. The move is considered as a political revenge by the JD(U) for its defeat in over 20 assembly constituencies in the last assembly election because of Chirag’s decision to field his candidates against those of Nitish’s party. Since RJD won 75 assembly seats, it’s practically not possible to create a breakaway group. Though Congress won 19 seats and has time and again denied any chance of a split, Upendra’s recent statement that many legislators in the opposition camp were ready to switch sides set tongues wagging in the political circles again. JD(U) chief state spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said, “Lalan babu is known for administering political injections with high antibiotics to the adversaries, who can scream and cry only.” The JD(U) has a bitter experience with BJP in Arunachal Pradesh where 6 of its 7 MLAs defected to the saffron party in December just after the Bihar assembly election in which the BJP one-upped its ally by winning 74 seats compared to 43 by CM Nitish’s party. After Lalan’s nomination, JD(U) principal general secretary K C Tyagi said though they wanted to be a BJP ally in Uttar Pradesh assembly election also, if given a respectable number of seats to contest, the party is also ready to fight on its own there and in Manipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalans-elevation-nitishs-deft-move-to-hit-many-targets-with-one-stone/articleshow/84955462.cms||Jai Narain Pandey
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Lakes destroyed for ‘beautification’, say activists||HYDERABAD: Developing walking tracks to beautify lakes is a familiar story in the twin cities, but what happens to the water body after that is a completely different one. The lake beautification project, undertaken by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), has triggered controversies in several areas in the city. Locals and environmental activists allege that the water bodies and their FTL (full tank level) areas are being encroached upon under the guise of beautification. Common coots found swimming in polluted waters of Yapral lakeIn one such case, residents alleged that Nacharam lake has shrunk by several acres after GHMC laid a walking track stretching over three kilometres a few months ago. “At least 15 acres of the lake has shrunk after the walking track has been laid by the authorities. The natural rock formations inside the lake have been blasted near the weir on the eastern side of the lake. These beautification projects should be taken up, keeping in mind the natural habitat and future of these lakes,” said G Karunakar, a resident of Nacharam. Similarly, Malkam Cheruvu, which was spread over nearly 60 acres, was considered by GHMC for beautification about three years ago. Activists say that since then, the lake has shrunk by over four to five acres. In a letter to the chief justice of the Telangana high court some time ago, Lubna Sarwath, a lake protection activist, alleged that the construction work has “seriously compromised” the lake’s territory. “A private construction company went more than 10 acres into the FTL of the lake. GHMC accepted before the court that more than five acres have been affected and you can see vehicles being parked on the walking track built inside the FTL of the lake. Demand is that as per Supreme Court order, an environment court must be set up immediately in Hyderabad,” Lubna Sarwath, a lake protection activist, said. On the other hand, residents of Yapral claimed that the lake has turned into a cess pool due to lack of maintenance by GHMC authorities after laying a walking track around the water body. “The lake, which was once home to over 50 species of native and migratory birds and served as a major source of water for agriculture, has now turned into an eyesore. GHMC constructed a bund on the Prakruthik Vihar colony side of the lake after there was huge flooding in the colony three or four years ago, after which a lot of residential accommodations have been sanctioned. Now, the level of the lake is higher than the level of Prakruthik Vihar as well as other residential accommodations downstream,” said retired major general SK Mathur, a resident. Activists have listed case numbers of nearly 13 lakes where water bodies were being encroached upon and destroyed under the guise of beautification. “We cannot construct the walking tracks outside the lake boundary because those areas don’t belong to the lake or the government. But we are ensuring that the lake capacity is not being reduced. In some cases, when we are fencing these areas, people remove them at night and encroach upon the areas. In such cases, walking tracks can act as a permanent fencing to protect the lakes,” a senior GHMC official told TOI. However, when asked about the encroachment of inflow and outflow channels of these lakes, SNDP chief engineer C Vasantha said, “We have not received any such representations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lakes-destroyed-for-beautification-activists/articleshow/84960188.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Delhi||After O2 crisis, Delhi govt targets 421-tonne storage capacity||NEW DELHI: After the second wave of Covid-19 devastated the capital in April and May, Delhi government has been strengthening health infrastructure keeping in mind a likely third wave. Part of this exercise involves ramping up oxygen generation and storage facilities at city hospitals. In June, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that the buffer liquid medical oxygen (LMO) storage capacity for the city will be enhanced by 421 metric tonnes (MT). This is part of the large-scale preparations against the third wave. The aim was to increase storage capacity to an extent that at least one day buffer of the peak oxygen demand of Delhi is always available. Apart from Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants in hospital premises for oxygen generation, the government is also increasing storage capacity. Very soon, Delhi government-run Sanjay Gandhi Hospital at Mangolpuri, Satyawadi Raja Harish Chander Hospital in Narela and Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital, Pitampura will have cryogenic LMO vertical storage tanks with a net storage capacity of more than 50 MT. The vertical storage tanks will be constructed by vendors within 10 days of awarding the work by the state government, tenders for which have been floated “on an urgent basis during the Covid-19 situation,” said an official. Apart from 12 months’ warranty, the supplier would also have to provide annual maintenance for three years after the warranty expires. The storage tanks will have features like an insulated cold converter for oxygen, double walls with an inner wall of austenitic steel and outer wall of carbon steel, two gas vents or safety valves, pressure regulator, liquid oxygen level gauge, etc. The oxygen tanks will be installed following Static and Mobile Pressure Vessels (Unfired) Rules, 2016 and approval of the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO). Following the oxygen crisis in the months of April and May, the state government is also ramping up infrastructure to transport LMO from other states, which proved to be a big challenge during the second wave of Covid-19 cases. The state government is also creating its fleet of oxygen cryogenic tankers and Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has been entrusted with procuring and operating tankers. To begin with, 15 such tankers are being procured. As the national capital was gasping for breath, Delhi was allocated additional oxygen from plants located more than 1,500 km from the city in areas such as Durgapur, Rourkela and Kalinga Nagar. Transporting the oxygen from these plants to the capital proved to be a big challenge and containerised cargo movement through railways was also used for bringing LMO to the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-o2-crisis-govt-targets-421-tonne-storage-capacity/articleshow/84956283.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Visakhapatnam||Covid speeds up adoption of natural farming systems in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: An unintended fallout of Covid-19 has been the push the pandemic has given to organic farming techniques in north Andhra Pradesh. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, a section of consumers has moved towards chemical-free rice and pulses to boost immunity, raising the demand for organically grown produce. Alongside, an increasing number of farmers are opting for natural techniques of farming to fetch higher profits and for their own consumption. The area under paddy cultivation in Visakhapatnam district is around 80,000 hectares, 1.2 lakh hectares in Vizianagaram and over two lakh hectares in Srikakulam. Speaking to TOI, assistant director of agriculture and district project manager of natural farming, Vizianagaram, K Prakash said that of the total area of 1.2 lakh hectares under paddy cultivation in Vizianagaram district, more than 2,000 farmers are growing the crop by using natural methods on an extent of over 12,000 hectares. The demand for organically grown rice and pulses has been increasing after the outbreak of the virus, he added. In a similar fashion, around 10% of farmers in Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam are not using any synthetic fertilizer, crop booster, or undertaking huge investments. Instead, they have used cow urine and cow dung to promote soil health. The input cost of one acre under paddy crop is around Rs 20,000 using natural farming methods and gives a yield of around 25 bags (each bag is 75 kilos), farmers added. The agriculture department has extended 18 indigenous varieties of paddy. Most farmers are coming forward to grow Navara, Kalabatti and Ratnachodi varieties, which have high nutritional qualities, they added. The agriculture department has also promoted the concept of ‘Navdhanya’ instead of green manuring to maintain diversity above and below the soil in order to retain soil moisture, increase microbial load, increase earthworm population and organic carbon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-speeds-up-adoption-of-natural-farming-systems/articleshow/84954345.cms||Nalla.Babu

The government has harmed educational institutions and caused job losses,” he said. He was speaking at the launch of the party’s campaign in Kesariwada. The campaign titled ‘Vyartha Na Ho Balidan’ (Don’t let the sacrifice go waste) was rolled out against the backdrop of the India’s 75 independence day on August 15. Some descendants of freedom fighters were felicitated in the programme. The programme was organised to mark the death anniversary of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak. “There is Chinese incursion along the borders, but the Prime Minister and defence minister are not speaking about it. If such a situation continues, we may reel under the fear of foreign rule,” Patole added. People with no contribution to the freedom struggle are now distorting history. Hence, the contribution of the Congress party in the struggle for independence should be told to the young generation, he added. Deepak Tilak, great grandson of Lokmanya Tilak, said the federal structure of the country is being upended. Questions are being raised about the concurrent list and the responsibilities of the state government, he added. “Lokmanya Tilak had spearheaded the Swadeshi movement and boycotted the use of imported products. The time has come to restart this movement for the economy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-moves-pushing-country-towards-economic-slavery-says-state-cong-chief/articleshow/84958464.cms||---
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Discoms resist move to raise reliance on renewable energy||AMARAVATI: Power distribution companies (discoms) are against any attempt to increase power generation from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power plants. This is significant in the wake of the Centre’s efforts to add energy generation from renewable energy as it is being considered as clean energy. AP, which is considered one of the green energy resourceful states in the country, is facing a peculiar situation where energy generation from non-conventional power plants had already surpassed conventional thermal and hydel power plants. The power utilities are jittery over the targets to increase generation from renewable energy sources as they fear that it would lead to severe fluctuations in grid maintenance. The state has an installed capacity of 7,500 MW of renewable energy and the state government is planning to add about 10,000 MW solar power to completely meet agriculture sector power needs in the next three years. In a recent directive, the Centre asked the state government to ensure addition of another 9,000 MW from renewable energy plants in next four years which is likely to take the capacity of the non-conventional plants to about 25,000 MW. This level of generation from variable power generation sources, according to discoms, is likely to create severe fluctuations at grid level. “There were negligible uncertainties in the operation of grid prior to the addition of large scale of Variable Renewable Energy (VRE-wind and solar) integration. The system planning has become almost impossible and system operator is forced to handle several uncertainties from the resources including conventional generation after the large scale VRE integration. The uncertainties of VRE is affecting the reliability of the conventional generators as well,” explained the discoms in a filing before the AP Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC). Usually power planning is carried out on ‘day ahead’ basis to meet grid demand for the next day. It is observed that there were several instances of large variations in VRE generation during the course of day, in absolute terms ranging from 50 MW to 2000 MW (over injection or under injection), between forecast and actual generation. Discoms said that they could not arrange such quantum of power at short notice and are forced to either give load relief or purchase power at exorbitant prices during intra-day market operations. “No power market mechanism is also available to get power at short notices. In this scenario, State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC) purely depends upon over drawl from grid resulting in receiving violation notices from Sothern Region Load Dispatching Centre (SRLDC) to adhere to the regulations,” said the discoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/discoms-resist-move-to-raise-reliance-on-renewable-energy/articleshow/84954227.cms||Samdani MN

The e-library, first of its kind in the state, has been constructed adjacent to the PU central library on its western side and has also been furnished. Now the authorities are awaiting installation of computers with internet connectivity for declaring it open. PU chief librarian Abhay Kumar said that the decision to open a cafeteria library on the campus was taken during the centenary celebrations of the PU library in 2019 and its foundation stone was laid in February last year by the then vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh. The construction work was delayed for some time due to Covid-19 pandemic. But, now it is complete, he said. He pointed out that as many as 35 computers are to be installed in the cafeteria in the first phase and the university is striving to mobilize funds for purchasing the same. He said that VC Girish Kumar Chaudhary has assured that the funds for the installation of the desired number of computers would be made available soon. Narrating details of this library, Kumar said the library will remain open round the clock. Students will be given a chance to visit the library in shifts of one or two hours. Girls would be given to use it preferably during day hours, while boys would be welcome round the clock. “This e-library will be connected to the National Academic Depository which will allow students to access millions of books and research journals,” he said. PU students’ welfare dean Anil Kumar said, “This kind of unique library is available only in few universities like JNU and Delhi University, which would help to create a better academic environment on the campus. Students residing in different university hostels may utilize its services even at night.” PU students are quite elated over the opening of this cafeteria library. “With e-library facility on our campus, we will not face any difficulty now in getting the required study materials,” quipped physics department scholar Arvind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-all-set-to-have-cafeteria-library/articleshow/84954681.cms||B K Mishra

---||Business||RBI expected to hold interest rate this week||Mumbai: Downside risks to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) 9.5% growth projection have ebbed. However, the central bank is expected to keep rates on hold and continue with its accommodative stance in its monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting, which concludes on August 6. According to analysts, the first sign of a decision by the RBI tapering off its accommodative policy would come from tolerance to higher yield in government bond auctions. “Our reading of high-frequency activity indicators suggests no reason for the RBI to adjust its overall growth outlook, though its inflation forecasts may need to be revised modestly higher,” said Barclays Bank chief economist Rahul Bajoria. According to Bajoria, liquidity normalisation is already under way and there is a notable reduction in system liquidity during H1 of 2021. “Moreover, we think the rise in liquidity during the past month indicates that the RBI is adopting a ‘passive strategy’, which will allow organic factors like currency in circulation to slowly drain the liquidity surplus over time,” he said. After cutting the repo rate (at which it lends to banks) to a record low of 4% by May 2020 amid the lockdown, the RBI has kept rates on hold for well over a year. While India was hit hard by the Delta variant that resulted in the second wave of the pandemic, the economic impact has been shorter. Also, buoyant capital markets will support the macro numbers if the government can push through its disinvestment targets. Improved capital flows and better government collection through taxes and divestment will help narrow the twin deficits and reduce upward pressure on rates. The RBI’s move is also likely to be influenced by its peers in the global markets. Most of the monetary authorities are continuing to maintain their status quo approach as many parts of the world are dealing with a Covid resurgence due to the Delta variant. With bond markets getting edgy on yields because of an oversupply of government securities coupled with rising inflation, the RBI may have to announce fresh tranches of its Gsecs-acquisition programme. According to Sonal Varma of Nomura Research, the flare-up of CPI inflation to 6.3% in the lockdown month of May from 4.2% in April has been a game-changer in terms of the inflation trajectory. “Even though inflation was subsequently flat in June and some core sub-categories witnessed a payback from the May lockdown-triggered escalations, in aggregate, core prices remained sticky and displayed higher momentum. With continued supply-side pressures hitting the core and fuel baskets, and as demand-side pressures revive, we expect headline inflation to average 5.4% in 2021 and 5.5% in 2022 (5.8% in FY22), with core inflation likely to trend close to 6%,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-expected-to-hold-interest-rate-this-week/articleshow/84958290.cms||---

A proposal in this regard was recently sent to the prisons and correctional services inspectorate of the home department for approval. Sources said the proposal would be sent to the home department after approval from IG (prisons and correctional services) Mithilesh Mishra. “The fences will be three-foot-high above the periphery wall of the jail. It is for securing the jail premises, one of the most sensitive installations of the state. There is also a proposal to increase the wall height to 21 feet from the existing 18 feet. The fencing will be above the increased height, taking the overall effective height of the wall to 24 feet,” a senior prisons department official said preferring anonymity. The officer said there was also a proposal for construction of another outer boundary wall outside the periphery wall of the jail. “This boundary wall was never constructed since the jail started functioning in 1994. Instead, private constructions took place on jail land. The jail is spread over 50 acres of land,” he said, adding the electric fencing would foil the attempts of anti-socials to throw anything into the jail premises. Though Beur jail superintendent Jitendra Kumar said there was a proposal for installation of electrical fencing, he refused to share further details citing security reasons. On July 25, two youths were arrested while they were throwing cellphones, ganja and tobacco packets into the jail premises. Prison sources said that National Investigation Agency (NIA) authorities had recently red-flagged the poor security arrangements at the jail. The NIA officials had visited the jail last month on multiple occasions after four operatives of Lashkar-e-Taiba were arrested in Darbhanga railway station parcel blast case and lodged there. The Beur jail also houses dreaded Maoists and other terrorists. Last month, Patna Municipal Corporation had issued notices to at least 40 people who had illegally constructed houses and commercial buildings within 50-metre of the periphery jail wall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/beur-jail-may-get-electric-fences-with-sensors-soon/articleshow/84954653.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh to introduce revolutionary method in agricultural motors||VISAKHAPATNAM: The state energy department is all set to introduce agricultural motors with the globally acclaimed technology – permanent magnet brushless direct current (PMBLDC). According to the energy officials, PMBLDC is one such technology which will improve motor efficiency to 90% against the existing efficiency of 75% with induction motor technology. Even the life expectancy of the PMBLDC system is expected to improve to 15 to 20 years due to high grade materials as compared to the lifespan of conventional AC motors of around 10 years. As a part of this endeavour, a joint venture company of AP power utilities, AP State Energy Efficiency Development Corporation Limited (APSEEDCO), has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Andhra University, Visakhapatnam. Chief executive officer, State Energy Conservation Mission, A Chandrasekhar Reddy, said that the project deliverables of the MoU are preparing the design document of the proposed project, manufacturing protocol as per industry standards, complete operational manual, and soft copy of simulations and working model to demonstrate the technology. “Apart from the agricultural and domestic pumping, this technology can be utilised in air conditioning compressors, refrigerators, washing machines, electric vehicles, etc. to improve their overall efficiency,” said Reddy. The APSEEDCO technical team in coordination with Andhra University conducted a webinar and discussed in detail the technicalities of the proposed technology and did a comprehensive analysis of the concept of PMBLDC. Energy secretary, Srikant Nagulapalli, who was briefed by the APSEEDCO officials on the proposed PMBLDC project, emphasised the need to strengthen research & development activities in the energy efficiency field. “Advanced countries like the United States, Japan, Germany, France, etc. give high priority to R&D activities and each country contributed to the tune of around $100 billion towards research programmes,” said Srikant. Minister for energy, environment, forest, and science & technology Balineni Srinivasa Reddy said that the ultimate objective of the government was to provide the highest quality of power supply to the agriculture sector, which was the backbone for development of the economy in the state. He appreciated the energy department for the new R&D initiative that could help improve energy efficiency in the agriculture sector. “It may have a major impact on the quality of power supply that enables farmers for improved reliability and enhanced life period of motors. It helps reduce the maintenance cost for the farmer,” said Srinivasa Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-to-introduce-revolutionary-method-in-agricultural-motors/articleshow/84954085.cms||---

In the appeal, he has claimed that Videocon’s foreign oil and gas assets held through foreign subsidiaries are an integral part of the group and the resolution professional and committee of creditors cannot sell them separately. The Twin Star proposal, although approved by the committee of creditors and the NCLT, has been stayed on an appeal from Bank of Maharashtra. Dhoot has claimed that the liquidation value of these assets is at least Rs 15,000 crore. The former chairman and promoter of the group said that if all assets were sold together, the realisation would have been at least Rs 25,000 crore. Lenders are proceeding separately against Videocon for the recovery of consumer electronics and energy business under VOVL. Meanwhile, lenders have decided to sell their loan exposure to VOVL to the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC, the bad bank). Incidentally, in February 2020, there was a proposal to club the Videocon Group and VOVL during the resolution process. However, this was set aside by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, or NCLAT.Dhoot claimed that he had made a one-time restructuring proposal where he had offered to repay Rs 30,000 crore in return for his business. However, the lenders had pursued recovery through NCLT and a settlement was not possible. In his petition, Dhoot also alleged that the resolution professional had diminished the value of the company. According to Dhoot, lenders had done a techno-economic viability study of the Videocon Group and for their consumer electronics and home appliance business through Deloitte was appointed and Knight & Frank looked into its affordable housing investments and Petrotel looked into the oil & gas business. In the petition, Dhoot has mentioned the doubts raised by the NCLT over the approved bid being very close to the liquidation amount. The amount bid by Twin Star under the resolution plan was Rs 2,962 crore as against a liquidation value of Rs 2,568 crore and a fair value of assets of Rs 2,568 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dhoot-moves-nclat-against-vedantas-videocon-plan/articleshow/84958343.cms||---

JD(U) parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha’s name was also doing the rounds in the political circles for the party’s top post. Talking to the media, RJD principal general secretary Alok Kumar Mehta said the members of Kushwaha community were feeling deceived after Upendra was denied the JD(U) national president’s post at its executive committee meeting held in New Delhi on Saturday. “Today the Kushwaha community is directionless due to the decisions of Upendra, who frequently changed his political affiliation. Those who till recently were rallying behind Kushwaha in the hope of him being elevated to the JD(U) national president’s post are feeling cheated,” he alleged. “I appeal to the members of Kushwaha community to support the RJD, which will ensure its due political stake. The RJD led by Lalu Prasad earlier had proved it by his action in the 90s,” he pointed out. Mehta said there was a time when Kushwaha community had 17 MLAs and 11 of them were appointed as ministers in the RJD government. In addition, there were three MPs from that community alone, he asserted. “Lalu ji, a firm believer in the principles of socialist leader late Jagdeo Prasad, will give due share to the members of Kushwaha community, if they join hands with the RJD,” he said. When contacted, Upendra Kushwaha refused to comment. “I don’t react to such “baseless” things,” he told this newspaper. Kushwaha is currently on his yatra to get feedback about development and welfare schemes launched by the Nitish Kumar government and assess the relief and rehabilitation works in flood ravaged districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-offers-olive-branch-to-kushwaha-community/articleshow/84955136.cms||Ramashankar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Civil supply department issues 16 lakh ration cards last year||AMARAVATI: The state government issued nearly 16 lakh new rice cards to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families in the last year. With chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy setting a 21-day deadline to grant new ration card, the civil supplies department is processing applications from the eligible families well ahead of the deadline. Issuing new card or adding new members to the existing card or splitting the card has been made priority for village and ward secretariat staff. Village and ward secretariats are completing the verification process and sending the applications for clearance to tahsildar within a week. Subsequently, the tahsildar is granting permission for new card or changes in the existing card in another week. In majority of the cases, new cards are issued in a fortnight after getting the application. Kona Sasidhar, civil supplies commissioner, said chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy was very particular about issuing rice cards to all eligible families. “Issuing rice card (ration card) has become a continuous process. No eligible family will be denied the card,” said Sasidhar. He said that the chief minister had directed the department not to keep the financial burden on the government in mind while sanctioning new cards. The case of newly married couples, who wish to get their own rice card after moving away from the family home, is also being considered. “The verification is done at six stages and eligibility criteria is scrupulously followed through computer based data,” said the commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/civil-supply-dept-issues-16-lakh-ration-cards-last-year/articleshow/84954039.cms||Samdani MN

Terming an internal letter issued by the DGP office to police commissioners and police chiefs for maintaining peace during Muharram a “charge sheet against the Shia community”, the clerics demanded that the government should withdraw the document. Kalbe Noorie, son of senior vice-president of the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board, late Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, said: “The guidelines are unacceptable as it show the peace-loving Shias in poor light.” General secretary of Majlis-e-Ulama-e-Hind, Maulana Kalbe Jawad, said communication with the DGP would be possible when the document is withdrawn. “It’s language is condemnable. We have asked Muharram committees to boycott meetings convened by the police and administration,” he said. President of the Shia Markazi Chand Committee, Maulana Saif Abbas, said the person who had drafted the document was trying to disrupt peace. Classical singer and a Husaini Brahmin herself, Sunita Jhingran also reacted sharply to the draft circulating on social media allegedly from UP police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/muharram-order-tone-objectionable-shias/articleshow/84959880.cms||---

Choudhary met Pradhan in New Delhi and held a detailed discussion with him on various issues related to education, told this newspaper that the Union minister has assured him of sympathetic consideration of all the state demands. Choudhary drew the attention of Pradhan towards the drastic curtailment of salaries of teachers working under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and also the stoppage of salary payment to a large number of teachers under this scheme. He urged Pradhan to take necessary steps for release of a sum of Rs1,000 crore towards payment of proper salaries to all the teachers of Bihar working under SSA with effect from 2018-19. The state education minister further demanded release of the Centre’s committed share of Rs295 crore to the state for payment of arrears of difference of salaries of university teachers in the revised 7th payscale with effect from January 2016 to March 2019. He further requested the Union minister to facilitate enhancement of pay of cooks working in schools under midday meal scheme. With the provision of refreshments along with midday meal to the school students under the New Education Policy, 2020, the central government should provide for execution of both refreshments and midday meal in schools by an independent agency so that teachers are kept free from these unacademic activities. This would help create a healthy academic atmosphere in schools, he added. Pradhan assured Choudhary to do his best to remove all the discrepancies in the field of education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/union-edu-minister-to-visit-state-soon/articleshow/84954981.cms||B K Mishra

A good number of boys and girls submitted their applications on the first day of the opening of the admission portal. PU students’ welfare dean Anil Kumar told this newspaper that under the university management information system (UMIS) introduced for the first time this year, all the admission related works, right from submission of applications to the payment of admission charges, would be done online. Students applying for admission to courses in regular or self-financing mode and in different colleges of PU would have to fill up only one form, indicating their choice of institution and course. The last date for online submission of forms is August 20. As the university has decided to do away with the practice of holding entrance test for undergraduate courses this year, the admission is likely to be completed within a month, said Kumar. There are as many as 3500 seats in arts, science and commerce streams in all the PU colleges, except Patna Women’s College which admits students on its own. There are 1650 seats (600 each in Patna College and B N College and 450 in Magadh Mahila College) in arts streams, whereas there are altogether 650 seats (400 in Vanijya Mahavidyalaya and 250 in Magadh Mahila College under self-financing scheme) in commerce stream.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Medical education fraternity opposes draft PG admission regulations||AHMEDABAD: The draft of Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations 2021 has met with stiff opposition by the medical education fraternity in Gujarat. Experts cited that if the proposal sees light of the day in its current form, the power of the state would be undermined. It may also lead to reduction of PG seats for Gujarat students. A provision of the draft PG regulations aims to centralise and designate the Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India as the designated authority for counselling for state quota seats. Currently, counselling for UG and PG medical seats is done by state-appointed admission committees. “Different states have their own quota for admission of students. The new regulation aims to do away with the role of states in this regard. This could lead to a decline in the number of seats in the state,” said an expert in the medical field. In Gujarat, there are 2,287 seats for PG courses in state quota that may be impacted by the proposed regulations, said sources. “All these years the PG medical admission process has been running smoothly and there seems to be no reason for changing this. In states like Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana the quota depends on the area where the PG medical seats lie,” said an academician in the medical field. The academician said that while the move is being opposed by many non-BJP states while BJP ruled states may not oppose it openly even if its wrests their powers in the matter of PG medical admissions. There shall be a common counseling for admission in all Medical Educational Institutions to all Postgraduate Broad-Specialty courses (Diploma/ MD/ MS) on the basis of merit list of the National Exit Test and to all Postgraduate Super-Specialty courses (DM/MCh) on the basis of merit list of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test, as per the draft. “The designated authority for counselling for all the postgraduate broad specialty seats in the country for eligible institutions under the National Medical Commission (both the 50% All India Quota seats of the contributing states and the 50% State Quota seats including all applicable reservations) shall be the Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India,” as per the draft. The draft, proposed by the National Medical Council (NMC), also aims to introduce licentiate examination called the National Exit Test (NeXT) for enrolment in medical registers that could replace NEET for admission to PG courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/medical-edu-fraternity-opposes-draft-pg-medical-admission-regulations/articleshow/84957906.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Talks of political realignment as SP chief Akhilesh Yadav asks BSP & Congress to choose enemy||LUCKNOW: Weeks after Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav aggressively ruled out any tie-up with BSP or Congress for the 2022 assembly polls in UP, the former UP CM has now said it was for the two parties to decide if BJP was their bigger enemy or the SP. In the political circles, Akhilesh’s poser to the BSP and Congress has generated a lot of curiosity. Some see it as an off-the-cuff remark to put both the BSP and Congress in the dock for any attempt to hit at the SP’s electoral interests. Many others, however, look at it as a possible attempt to moot the idea of opposition unity in UP polls — if not in the form of a proper alliance, then to reach an understanding to divide opposition votes. “In partiyon (BSP–Congress) ko tay karna chahiye ki unki ladai BJP se hai ya Samajwadi Party se? (These parties should decide if they are fighting against the BJP or the SP)” he said in a recent interview to a news agency. On the issue of alliance for the 2022 polls, he said: “We are open to tie-ups with all smaller parties. Some of these smaller parties are already with us, more will join us in the days to come.” It is not only the SP which is talking about the ‘bigger enemy’ and possibly looking for opposition unity as well. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra recently called on two SP women workers in Lakhimpur, who were allegedly assaulted during the panchayat polls and described her visit as a part of her “fight for democracy”. She also went on to add that her party was “open-minded” for an alliance. Political observers feel that instead of a formal alliance, any ‘tactical understanding’ between the Congress and the SP will be more beneficial to both the parties in the assembly polls. There is a perception that Congress contesting on all seats will eat into the BJP vote bank, particularly those who are disenchanted with the saffron brigade and would not be happy to vote for the SP or BSP. With only seven MLAs in UP, Congress can enter into some kind of understanding with the SP where the latter can help to further their interests in the next Lok Sabha elections. Ruling out possibilities of any alliance with the Congress and the BSP, senior Samajwadi Party leaders said the party leadership had made up its mind on the issue about a year ago and there seemed no scope of any change in stance now. Akhilesh had forged an alliance with the Congress for the 2017 state polls and with Mayawati’s BSP in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, both had ended up in a disaster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/talks-of-political-realignment-as-akhilesh-asksbsp-cong-to-choose-their-enemy-sp-or-bjp/articleshow/84959784.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Vijayawada||Floods close off sand reaches, hit building activity||VIJAYAWADA: The construction industry is in a limbo with the sudden shortage of sand across Krishna and Guntur districts. All sand reaches in the district are closed with water levels increasing at Prakasam Barrage. Construction activity across the state had registered a boost from June after the increasing case numbers of the Covid-19 second wave came down. The housing project of the state government saw the demand for sand rise across the district. Builders purchased sand directly at the reach from the agency appointed by the government. But from July 20, sand reaches remained closed with huge inflows at Prakasam Barrage. With builders running short of sand, prices in the black market rose from Rs 350 to Rs 1,200 per tonne. “Construction activity stalled all of a sudden with the sand shortage. Flood levels are rising every day at Krishna river and it is estimated that the flood will continue till the second week of August. Many brokers are taking advantage of the situation and selling sand in the black market,” said R V Swamy, media cell convener of CREDAI, adding that AP Mineral Development Corporation should start the sale of sand stored at stock points. Labourers and mason workers, too, expressed concerns about the situation. “We lost all our savings with the Covid-19 crisis. Recovery started recently. But the sand shortage has again affected us. The government should help us,” said M Simhachalam, a mason worker from Kandrika. When TOI contacted APMDC about the sand shortage, officials said sales at stock points would start shortly after prices were fixed. This would take between three to five days, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/floods-close-off-sand-reaches-hit-bldg-activity/articleshow/84954267.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Patna||Lalan’s elevation CM’s deft move to hit many targets with one stone||PATNA: At a time when political parties have started strategizing for the assembly elections in five states due early next year and the NDA government in Bihar has a very thin majority, the nomination of Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan (Lalan) as the JD(U) national president is considered a deft move by party supremo and CM Nitish Kumar, who has tried to hit many targets with a single arrow (party poll symbol). Rajiv, better known as Lalan babu in JD(U), replaced RCP Singh as the party chief on Saturday. JD(U) is in a very uncomfortable situation, though its leader Nitish is the CM despite winning only 43 seats in the state assembly elections last year, compared to ally BJP’s 74. Lalan has his task cut out not only to expand the party, but also increase the number of its MLAs. Considered a master of political manoeuvrings with vast experience of handling organisational and legislative matters as the JD(U) state chief as well as a minister during a long career spanning since the era of socialist icon of Bihar, Jannayak Karpoori Thakur, the three-time MP indicated his preferences after his nomination as party president; that he will take everyone along and bring back the old “friends” of his Samata Party days. By nominating Lalan as the first JD(U) president from an upper caste (Bhumihar), Nitish has tried to prove his critics wrong that his party was reduced to ‘Luv-Kush' (Kurmi-Koeri) caste combine. Nitish and RCP are from Nalanda and belong to the same Kurmi caste while former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha is a Koeri. Upendra merged his RLSP with JD(U) recently and was immediately made the party’s parliamentary board chairman. Even the party’s state president Umesh Kushwaha is a Koeri. Nitish has also tried to strike another balance in social engineering to wean away the Bhumihar voters, who now feel marginalised in the scheme of things of BJP which they have supported and voted in election after election in Bihar. Given the fact that even the main opposition RJD, being virtually led by Lalu Prasad’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, is projecting itself as an A-to-Z party while trying to drop the baggage of an M-Y (Muslim-Yadav) party, Nitish is eyeing a larger vote base among the upper castes as well as Dalits and extremely backward classes besides the OBCs. The BJP and JD(U) have serious ideological differences on certain issues like conducting caste census and framing and enforcing law to control birth rate besides implementing the new National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Bihar. Though BJP has categorically said it is not going to conduct a caste census, the JD(U) passed political resolutions at its national executive committee meeting in Delhi on Saturday in its favour and against any “coercive law” on population control measures. Lalan, who is a tough bargainer and a political manipulator, reportedly had a hand in the coup staged in the LJP by Jamui MP Chirag Paswan’s uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras. The move is considered as a political revenge by the JD(U) for its defeat in over 20 assembly constituencies in the last assembly election because of Chirag’s decision to field his candidates against those of Nitish’s party. Since RJD won 75 assembly seats, it’s practically not possible to create a breakaway group. Though Congress won 19 seats and has time and again denied any chance of a split, Upendra’s recent statement that many legislators in the opposition camp were ready to switch sides set tongues wagging in the political circles again. JD(U) chief state spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said, “Lalan babu is known for administering political injections with high antibiotics to the adversaries, who can scream and cry only.” The JD(U) has a bitter experience with BJP in Arunachal Pradesh where 6 of its 7 MLAs defected to the saffron party in December just after the Bihar assembly election in which the BJP one-upped its ally by winning 74 seats compared to 43 by CM Nitish’s party. After Lalan’s nomination, JD(U) principal general secretary K C Tyagi said though they wanted to be a BJP ally in Uttar Pradesh assembly election also, if given a respectable number of seats to contest, the party is also ready to fight on its own there and in Manipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalans-elevation-cms-deft-move-to-hit-many-targets-with-one-stone/articleshow/84955065.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

---||Mumbai||Centres closed 9 days, Mumbai vaccinations dip by 15% in July||MUMBAI: Nine days of closure of public vaccination in July led to a 15% drop in immunization against Covid-19 in the city last month. Interestingly, the shortage in public centres didn’t lead to any rise in demand in the private sector, which in fact saw a 41% drop in doses administered in July. Mumbai’s trend was in co-mplete contrast with the state that administered 23% more vaccine doses in July. More than 1.2 crore doses were given in July compared to 98.6 lakh in June. The jump in vaccinat-ion corresponded with the higher quantity of doses it received from the Centre—66.2 lakh till July 24, up from 59.1 lakh in June. The total doses administered in the state was 4.5 crore as of July 31, translating into complete immunisation of over 1.1 crore people and single dose vaccination of 2.2 crore. Data shows that BMC too received 9.8 lakh doses in July compared to 7.4 lakh doses in June. Yet, they could vaccinate 18.9 lakh when compared to 22.3 lakh in June. The total includes doses given in the private sector too. The drive was cancelled in the public sector on nine days, including four Sundays when the BMC doesn’t vaccinate, and another five days, when the doses were in short supply or in transit. A civic official said a recent Bombay high court order mandating that the BMC declares vaccination timings one day prior and hold the drive on fixed hours (9am-5pm) was also an important factor. “It has led to some major logistical shifts in planning of sessions,” said an official. Previously, if doses arrived late, the centres would collect them from the central depot in Kanjurmarg by noon and run trimmed drives (2pm-5pm). In such cases, the slots would be opened a few hours prior. “However, in the light of the HC order about fixed timings for booking and vaccination, centres can no longer inoculate on the same day they have collected doses since the slots are not announced prior. So, on those days, we are not scheduling any sessions,” the official said. The second big factor, which has taken both BMC and private hospitals by surprise, is the drastic fall in demand for paid vaccination. While in June, 13.4 lakh Mumbaikars had gone for paid shots, less than eight lakh opted for it in July. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the fear of fake vaccination could be a key reason why people are preferring public centres. “Also, vaccination may not be as enticing for private hospitals anymore,” he said. Multiple changes in the rules of procurement has also left many small and mid-level private hospitals confused, he added. Private centres concur th-ey are left with hundreds of unbooked slots daily. Dr Sanjoy Kapote, director of Apollo Clinics, said his three centres coll-ectively open 500 slots on CoW-in, but barely one-third get booked. “I currently have 10,000 doses. The private sector is flooded with Covishield doses, but there are few beneficiaries,” he said. As queues for paid vaccination are getting shorter, demand for downsizing the 25% quota for the private sector is getting louder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centres-closed-9-days-mumbai-vaccinations-dip-by-15-in-july/articleshow/84958508.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Moorthy said that the district administration had set up oxygen beds and other infrastructure required at the end of the second wave itself. “We have adequate oxygen beds available in the district. Vaccination is being carried out as and when vaccines are made available by the union government,” he said. He said that the week-long awareness activity will help sensitise people in both in rural and urban areas. He urged people to follow basic Covid-19 precautionary measures such as washing hands, wearing masks and avoiding crowded places. “The pandemic can be handled better if the public render their support,” he said. “Pamphlets will be distributed in crowded places like bus terminals and railway terminals. Social media will be effectively used to reach out to the youths. Various competitions including short film contests, drawing and covid related slogans creation will be conducted,” he added. He said kabasuru kudineer will be distributed to the public to increase immunity and appropriate action will be initiated against commercial establishments which fail to follow covid-19 protocols. When asked about delay in smart city works, the minister said that the works got delayed by two to three months due to the ongoing pandemic. “The corporation commissioner and collector inspected smart city works on Saturday and insisted the contractors to wind up the construction works at the earliest,” he said. The minister and officials took an oath for Covid-19 prevention activities along with the public at the terminal.

Water board officials, however, have said that there was no case for alarm as it was due to turbidity in Godavari supply which has been rectified and the water was safe to drink. “We have been getting turbid water for the past four days. Most residents of this colony switched over to buying mineral water cans for drinking,” said C T Prameela, a resident of Uttam Nagar Colony in Malkajgiri GHMC Circle. Another resident of the same colony complained that it was not fit for drinking. “We are boiling it. But water is muddy,” he said. While confirming that they had noticed turbidity in the water for past three days, a senior official of Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) said: “We collected water samples and tested it at our quality wing and found turbidity at 140 to 150 nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs). Alum, the main ingredient to purify raw water, has been increased five times. The problem has been rectified and water is safe for drinking.” “This kind of water has been observed only in Godavari.

On June 15, the SC had brought the curtains down on a nine-year-old criminal proceedings and diplomatic wrangle over trial of two Italian marines for killings of two fishermen off Indian coast in lieu of Rs 10 crore additional compensation paid by Rome and chalked out modalities for handing over the monies to kin of victims. The SC made arrangements for proper investment of the compensation amount - Rs 4 crore each to the kin of deceased fishermen and Rs 2 crore to the owner of boat St Antony - so that the monies are not frittered away. The seven fishermen, who were aboard St Anthony on February 15, 2012 when the Italian Marines had opened fire leading to the two deaths, moved the SC saying they were also entitled to compensation from the money paid to the boat owner as they too suffered trauma even though they narrowly escaped death. They requested the SC to stop disbursement of the Rs 10 crore compensation till their share in the compensation awarded to the boat owner was determined and quantified. In its June 15 judgment, a bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and M R Shah had said as per the International Arbitral award, Italy is mandated to commence criminal trial proceedings against the two Marines — Massimilano Latorre and Salvatore Girone — without any loss of time. “... now the Republic of Italy shall resume its criminal investigation in the events of February 15, 2012 and it is further directed that the Union of India, Republic of Italy and the State of Kerala shall cooperate with each other in pursuit of that investigation,” it had said. On the compensation of Rs 10 crore paid by Italy over and above Rs 2.17 crore already paid by it to families of victims, the bench said, “We are satisfied that the amount of compensation of Rs 10 crores over and above the ex-gratia amount of compensation already paid to the heirs of the deceased fishermen offered and deposited by the Republic of Italy, ... can be said to be a reasonable amount of compensation and can be said to be in the interest of heirs of the deceased. We are of the view that this is a fit case to close all the proceedings in India including criminal proceedings in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.” The SC had quashed the FIR No.2/2012 of Coastal PS, Neendakara, Kollam, Kerala re-registered as FIR No. R.C. No. 04/2013/NIA/DLI dated 4 April 2013, under Sections 302, 307, 427 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 3 of the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Safety of Maritime Navigation and Fixed Platforms on Continental Shelf Act, 2002 registered by the National Investigation Agency, New Delhi, and all proceedings emanating there from including the proceedings pending before the Ld. Special Designated Court, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi. SC ordered transfer of the amount of Rs 10 crore, deposited in the SC registry by Union of India after receipt of it from Italy, to the Kerala high court and requested the HC chief justice “to nominate a judge to pass appropriate order of disbursement/investment of the amount to be paid to the heirs of each deceased (Rs 4 crore each) so as to protect the interest of the heirs and ensure that the compensation is duly received by the heirs and not diverted/misappropriated. The order of disbursement/investment be passed after hearing the heirs of each deceased and appropriate order be passed, protecting the best interest of the heirs of each deceased. Remaining amount of Rs 2 crore will be paid to the boat owner by an account payee cheque.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/uninjured-fishermen-seek-a-pie-from-payout/articleshow/84956350.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Hyderabad||No care: Fridges to feed poor gather rust in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Thirty-five refrigerators placed on city roads to serve the hungry poor have been left out in the cold, literally. Installed two years ago as part of ‘Feed the Need’ initiative by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and NGO Apple Homes, poor maintenance and erratic power supply has put paid to the novel plan to save food and feed the needy. While the fridges were supplied and maintained by the NGO, GHMC provided the space and was responsible for power. The 35 fridges (530lt) were set up at a cost of Rs 1.5 lakh each by the NGO. For a year the enterprise went smoothly, but then Covid hit and the NGO found it difficult to get people to maintain them. The refrigerators lost their keepers. Soon, food donated from homes, hotels and function halls began to rot in these rusting refrigerators left unattended and often without power. When TOI checked in Basheerbagh, Tolichowki, Mehdipatnam, Banjara Hills and Panjagutta, most of the refrigerators had stopped working due to lack of power supply and maintenance. “When it was first installed, our customers would ask us to place the extra food in the refrigerator to ensure it wasn’t wasted. But now as there is no one to maintain it, the fridge is in a very bad condition and does not work,” said M Nagaraju, an employee at a food court near one such refrigerator next to Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital in Mehdipatnam. At Tolichowki, even the shed for the refrigerator has been removed and the glass door is broken. “These refrigerators are rusting due to lack of maintenance. The bad smell clearly shows it has been left like this for long. There is no one to even clean or repair. People who bring food take it back after seeing the condition,” said Harish Daga, an activist. “The GHMC should immediately replace them. They should maintain it and designate staff to check the food,” Harish added. Social entrepreneur and founder of Apple Homes, Neelima Arya, said: “We took up this initiative as a joint effort. But when Covid struck last year, we had manpower problems and maintaining them became difficult. We did not get any support from GHMC either. Also, frequent power disruptions damaged the fridges. The entire process must be streamlined.” While GHMC officials did not respond to TOI queries, mayor G Vijayalakshmi in a recent review meeting had asked officials to shift these refrigerators closer to hotels so that the food kept in them would be in a better condition to eat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-care-fridges-to-feed-poor-gather-rust/articleshow/84960273.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: PG medicos to go on a 12-hour strike today||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Postgraduate medical students working as residents in government medical college hospitals will go on a 12-hour strike on Monday in protest against the workload in the hospitals due to lack of adequate manpower. “We have been tirelessly working for the past one year without any complaints, putting our studies at risk. Right now, only two batches are available for duties in medical colleges as final year students have completed their courses. The medical college hospitals in the state are facing acute manpower shortage,” said Dr Athul Ashok, state president of Kerala Medical Post Graduate Association (KMPGA). The association had taken up the issue several times with the authorities, including the health minister. The director of medical education even held a discussion on Sunday with the medical students to call off their strike since it would severely affect the functioning of the hospitals. But the talks remained inconclusive since several demands raised by them were not met. “The decentralization of Covid patient management is a must. The caseload must be shared with peripheral non-teaching institutions to bring down the rush at the medical college hospitals. Non-Covid patient care has been crippled in the MCHs now. We are destroying the largest medical training facilities of the state by overburdening it with Covid cases,” said Dr Naveen R, state secretary of the association. The association is demanding to increase recruitments to the MCHs through the national health mission. The hospitals are going to face an acute shortage of hands since the doctors are busy preparing for NEET PG examinations while those in the current non-academic batch are completing their postings. An increase in the number of non-academic senior resident posts has become inevitable. The finance department had approved 76 posts of senior residents, but the notification regarding the allotment of these posts has not yet been issued. The other demands of the association include incentives and risk allowances for the resident doctors who are working round the clock and decongestion of medical college hospitals of extra ICU beds that they cannot support due to severe shortage inhuman resources, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pg-medicos-to-go-on-a-12-hr-strike-today/articleshow/84956386.cms||---
---||Goa||Turtle-unfriendly draft coastal map paints bleak horizon for Goa’s flippered friends||PANAJI: For thousands of years, turtles lorded over Goa’s entire coastline, but the past few decades saw this change with Goa’s flippered friends being forcibly restricted to four beach stretches. Here too, now, the draft coastal management plan has thrown up more hurdles by limiting the nesting area within the beach stretches. The overlay of port limits, besides other components that are missing on the map, stand to have an impact, too. Citizens, scientists and lawyers had flagged the issues of dwindling space and increasingly hostile conditions for Olive Ridley turtles during the recent public hearing on the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP). The beaches of Mandrem and Morjim in Pernem and Agonda and Galgibaga in Canacona are designated turtle nesting sites under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 2011. However, purportedly, to strike a balance between tourism and turtle conservation, the government has earmarked, especially on the Morjim and Agonda beaches, small patches for nesting. Not understanding the government’s planning dynamics, the flippered visitors use other areas and beaches from where, even at the risk of harming them, the eggs are then relocated to hatcheries within the protected space. Port limits overlaid into Morjim and Galgibaga nesting sites is another major issue, as port activities can prove fatal and hazardous to marine species. “It will erode beaches and sand dunes will be lost. There will be a lot of noise underwater, pollution will increase manifold and that will be disastrous for marine reptiles, turtles, dolphins and other species,” said managing trustee, Morjim Turtle Trust and a marine and coastal policy scholar, Sarita Fernandes. Guidelines for the preparation of the coastal plan do not refer to the marking of port limits. “But they are specific about environmental features, local communities-related activities and infrastructure,” said Xavier Fernandes of Citizens for Coastal Communities, a voluntary organisation. The CRZ notification 2011 states that nesting mothers are very sensitive to human disturbances like vehicles, light, sound and tourist densities. “They require protection, but nesting sites may not survive if port limits are not removed,” environmental activist Abhijit Prabhudesai said. In recent years, the disturbance to their nesting grounds continues, despite rules to curb light and noise pollution. “Turtles arrive from as far as 9,000km and have to manoeuvre through fishing nets, trawlers, watersports vehicles and other hurdles,” Fernandes said. Harm lies at every step of the way for marine life, as indicated by a study carried out by Goa marine wildlife stranding and monitoring network, a collaborative initiative between Drishti Marine, state forest department, Terra Conscious and Reefwatch India. During the period from June 29, 2017, to June 29, 2021, a total of 141 strandings of cetaceans, including 141 cetaceans and 339 sea turtles (live/dead), were reported by the network. Unlike Odisha, where mass nesting in thousands takes place, Morjim is where turtle conservation was pioneered on a modest scale in the late 1990s. Galgibaga followed after a priest Fr Mariano Proenca played a key role in starting the local conservation effort. The coastal plan also misses out on marking of reserved forests, sand dunes and seagrass beds in all four nesting sites. Though the forest department’s board refers to Talpona-Galgibaga turtle nesting site, Talpona is not shown in the plan. Citizens also rejected the division of turtle nesting beaches into commercial and non-commercial zones, as per the draft turtle management plan, stating it would only help continue the conflicts between conservation and tourism interests. The key element of climate change is also missing in the plans. “Climate change issues, coastal disaster risks and proposed adaptation and mitigation measures for turtle nesting beaches need to be addressed as per several climate change conventions, of which India is a part like Paris Agreement 2030,” Fernandes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/turtle-unfriendly-draft-coastal-map-paints-bleak-horizon-for-goas-flippered-friends/articleshow/84960364.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Chennai||Little hope for revival of Tamil Nadu’s legislative council||CHENNAI: It is an irony of sorts that on the centenary of Tamil Nadu’s legislative council, August 2, it stands abolished. While the DMK government made several attempts to revive it, the AIADMK had steadfastly opposed the idea. Thirty-five years after the council was abolished, the M K Stalin government seeks to bring back the Upper House but the route is full of thorns. The Tamil Nadu unit of BJP too, in its election manifesto, promised revival of the council. But the proposal to restore the council may not find acceptance from the Union government in the near future as the latter is grappling with conflicting demands like revival in some states, as against abolition in Andhra Pradesh. In Tamil Nadu, the council that began with the Justice Party rule, had over the years recorded the evolution of the Dravidian movement. It met for the first time on January 9, 1921 at Fort St George. Under the Government of India Act, 1919, the first general election to the legislative council was held in December 1920, which was boycotted by the Congress, enabling victory of the Justice Party. And with it the ushering of the Dravidian movement. Among the significant measures of the Justice Party government were the communal government order to provide reservation to various castes and communities and abolition of the Devadasi system. C N Annadurai likened the assembly and council to a cup and saucer, saying while tea would be too hot to drink and required a saucer to cool it down, so too bills and resolutions which witnessed a heated debate in the assembly would have a calm discussion in the ‘council of elders’. No government could take the legislative Council for granted in the 1970s. Members of the assembly and council would dissect the provisions of the bills clause by clause and move amendments, some of which were accepted by the government. Some like G Vasanta Pai and A R Damodaran would point out that the Tamil version of the bill would convey one meaning, but the English version would give a different interpretation. All was well until 1986, when the M G Ramachandran’s AIADMK abolished the legislative council with the support of the Congress in the state and in the Union government. Tamil Nadu Legislative Council (Abolition) Bill, 1986, was passed and the Act came into force on November 1, 1986. It was said that MGR acted out of pique as his move to nominate actress ‘Vennira Adai’ Nirmala to the Upper House ran into problems, since it was brought to the notice of the governor that she had declared insolvency, and therefore she could be nominated to the council. MGR reportedly cleared Nirmala’s debts amounting to `4.65 lakh. However, it was too late. Matters reached the court and Nirmala withdrew her nomination. An incensed MGR reportedly told his aides that if there was no room for Nirmala, there was no need for such a House, and his government brought forward a resolution in the assembly, seeking abolition of the council. It was also said that MGR did not want DMK president M Karunanidhi, then a member of the Council, from becoming leader of the opposition, and therefore sought its abolition. Though the Congress in Tamil Nadu was against abolition, it was forced to support the resolution following a directive from PM Rajiv Gandhi, following MGR’s plea. In 1989, 1996 and 2006, when the DMK was in power, it brought forward resolutions to revive the council but subsequent AIADMK governments led by J Jayalalalithaa withdrew the resolutions. Now six states — Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka — have the Upper House. However, Andhra Pradesh is urging the Union government to abolish its council because some bills were defeated as opposition TDP has a majority. Proposals from Assam, Odisha, West Bengal and Rajasthan, seeking revival of the council, are already before the Union government. On July 6, the Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal assembly passed a resolution with more than two-thirds majority seeking restoration of the legislative council. Bengal wants to get its Upper House back 52 years after the abolition, as the Election Commission is not willing to hold early elections to the assembly, citing Covid restrictions. Mamata Banerjee, who needs to get elected within six months, suspects the BJP of blocking the byelection, and therefore hopes to get a nomination to a revived council. Over the years, the council in TN, which once had a stature with apolitical luminaries from various fields nominated to the Upper House, was reduced to the stature of a ‘duplicate assembly’. A similar council now would serve little purpose except providing consolation prizes to those defeated in the assembly or Lok Sabha polls. It is hoped that if the council does come about, chief minister M K Stalin will not provide tickets to politicians but bring in thinktanks from various fields like economics, ecology, environment, scientists, entrepreneurs for speedy and inclusive growth.

While three hospitals promptly repaid the excess amount, the civic administration has served notices to 22 hospitals, asking them to refund the “excess” to patients, or face action. The 22 hospitals overcharged excess amounts ranging between Rs 50 (the minimum) and up to Rs 29 lakh, said officials. After patients and their relatives had alleged “overcharging” by hospitals, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena had warned of a protest. The Thane civic body then set up an audit team to ascertain such “excess” bills in which hospitals allegedly deviated from treatment protocol to inflate bills. Dr V Deogekar, medical officer for health, was unavailable for comment. Officials confirmed that notices have been issued to hospitals, and they have been told to inform the civic body of refunds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-25-hospitals-made-covid-patients-pay-rs-1cr-in-excess/articleshow/84958654.cms||---

However, the central bank is expected to keep rates on hold and continue with its accommodative stance in its monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting, which concludes on August 6. According to analysts, the first sign of a decision by the RBI tapering off its accommodative policy would come from tolerance to higher yield in government bond auctions. “Our reading of high-frequency activity indicators suggests no reason for the RBI to adjust its overall growth outlook, though its inflation forecasts may need to be revised modestly higher,” said Barclays Bank chief economist Rahul Bajoria. According to Bajoria, liquidity normalisation is already under way and there is a notable reduction in system liquidity during H1 of 2021. “Moreover, we think the rise in liquidity during the past month indicates that the RBI is adopting a ‘passive strategy’, which will allow organic factors like currency in circulation to slowly drain the liquidity surplus over time,” he said. After cutting the repo rate (at which it lends to banks) to a record low of 4% by May 2020 amid the lockdown, the RBI has kept rates on hold for well over a year. While India was hit hard by the Delta variant that resulted in the second wave of the pandemic, the economic impact has been shorter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-expected-to-hold-interest-rate-this-week/articleshow/84960947.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Yogi’s 4-year work giant leap from SP-BSP’s 15 year rule: Shah||Mirzapur: Blowing the bugle for 2022 UP elections, Union home minister Amit Shah threw a challenge at Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati to furnish an account of work done during their 15-year regime for comparison with development accomplished by Yogi Adityanath government in less than four years. While addressing a public meeting at Government Inter College ground here on Sunday after laying the foundation of Rs 128crore Maa Vindhyachal corridor and inaugurating east UP’s first ropeway, Shah lauded Yogi for the mammoth work done on all fronts. “BJP will again get the people’s blessings in UP in 2022, just like in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections. We never did the politics of nepotism and worked only for the interest and welfare of 22 crore people of state,” he said. Praising Yogi for tackling both waves of Covid-19 with diligence, hard work and management of resources, the Union minister said the pandemic has almost ended in the state with over 22 crore population, which is a huge achievement. Shah then taunted SP leadership, “What will you say Akhileshji. You had left only 10 medical colleges, but Yogi ji has increased this figure to 40 and now there is one medical college on every two districts in UP.” “Today, goonda and mafia elements are not visible. Their properties worth over Rs 1,500 crores have been confiscated. Major change in law and order is evident and women feel safe,” Shah added. Mentioning achievements on infrastructure front, he said, “Yogi ji has ensured a huge network of airports, airstrips, Bundelkhand and Poorvanchal expressways and link expressways for Gorakhpur and Ballia. Land acquisition for Ganga Expressway has begun.” UP has emerged as most preferred destination for investment under the Make in India campaign, said Shah, adding Yogi government tabled a budget of Rs 5,50,270 crore this year and is aiming to make UP a trillion-dollar economy. “Yogi government has ensured cent percent implementation of party’s Sankalp Patra of 2017. The Naxal menace has ended in Mirzapur, Sonbhadra and Chandauli,” said Shah. Talking about developing shrines and pilgrimage sites in UP, Shah said, “We never do politics of vote bank. But, why Ram Mandir was not constructed? Why places like Chitrakoot, Vindhyachal were not developed? BJP ensured these developments.” Praising arrangements of Prayagraj Kumbh, Ayodhya’s Deepotsava and other initiatives, Shah said that in Kashi, people will now reach Kashi Vishwanath temple from Ganga Ghat easily. “The Maa Vindhyachal corridor will widen the circumambulation area up to 50 ft. The roads leading to temple are being widened and better facilities for pilgrims are being ensured,” he added. The ropeway will fulfil the wishes of those who wanted to take their elderly parents to Vindhyachal but avoided as climbing hills of Ashtabhuja and Kalikhoh was difficult. Now, Shrawan Kumars will not have to carry their parents on their shoulders and will be able to take their parents on holy Trikon Yatra of Vindhyachal with ropeway, he said. Shah praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing 27% quota for OBC and 10% for economically weaker section candidates in medical courses, free Covid-19 vaccination, free ration for 80 crore population and other schemes. He said, “Modiji knows what UP needd, hence he chose to go to parliament by becoming MP from this state. People of UP ensured BJP led government at centre in 2014 and again in 2019 with over 300 seats. The blessings of people inspire BJP to serve them and we are sure we will be blessed again in 2022,” said Shah||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/yogis-4-year-work-giant-leap-from-sp-bsps-15-year-rule-shah/articleshow/84957076.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

But environmentalists fear that despite the surplus supply, Hyderabad could well slip into a dry spell — post the monsoon season — if this water isn’t used judiciously. Their solution: Recharge, reuse and be responsible. “Since Hyderabad’s water table is shallow and this region is rocky, when it rains it quickly recharges the groundwater table. That’s also why in the summer, borewells in so many places dry up. So, to ensure that every drop of this water is conserved we should not allow rainwater to stagnate on the surface and instead make provision for it run off quickly,” Anant Maringanti, geographer and director of Hyderabad Urban Lab. He added: “Over 30% to 40% of water is consumed from groundwater. So, ground water is an asset for us and we need to invest in it.” As per the report of the Hyderabad Ground Water Department (GWD), July saw an incredible rise in the water table across several parts of the twin cities. “Except Bandlaguda, Ameerpet, Marredpally and Trimulgherry mandals, rest of the Hyderabad district saw between one and eight metres rise in the ground water table,” said a senior GWD official. When compared to the ground water table in July 2020, this year has seen significant improvement owing to surplus rainfall, officials said adding that it might increase further if the city receives more heavy showers in the coming weeks. And while that might be good news, “controlling the over exploitation of groundwater must be our prime duty and we should utilise it based on need,” said Srinagesh D, a senior scientist at Council of Scientific And Industrial Research–National Geophysical Research Institute (CSIR-NGRI). “The digging of borewells should not go deeper and deeper. People have to realise that every drop of rainwater has to be caught and preserved through scientific ways,” he added. He also suggested that every house build a rainwater harvesting structure. “Unless, we build the RWH structures water will not percolate and water table will not get recharged,” he stressed. Kalpana Ramesh, core member (Water Subject) of SEHA (an NGO) too put the onus on people. “They themselves have come forward to preserve rainwater, which is a natural source to recharge the groundwater. For this, every person has to feel that it is his/her responsibility,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyds-water-table-sees-up-to-8-metre-rise-experts-call-for-judicious-use/articleshow/84960284.cms||Sunil Mungara

On the issue of usage of some objectionable language in the order as claimed by some clerics, ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar told TOI that the circular only talked about anti-social elements from the society and not any community. “The same guidelines have been issued for Muharram for several years. Similar guidelines were issued for kanwar yatras as well. Whatever has been said is about the anti-social elements and not for the community. We issue similar guidelines for other festivals, too. And this is an internal order. There is nothing against any religion/community in it,” said Kumar. UP Police has given instructions to all the police commissioners and district police chiefs for not giving permission to any kind of Muharram procession and taking out of tazia in view of the corona pandemic. The police should take help from religious heads by observing meetings of peace committees, the order says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/routine-order-talks-of-anti-social-elements/articleshow/84959912.cms||---

---||Chennai||An artist’s guide to a better mind||Chennai: In 2019, Chennai artist Sruthi Mohan had started reading extensively on mental health to be able to contribute artwork for a friend’s campaign on the issue. While it opened a new world of insights for her, it wasn’t until 2020 when the pandemic struck that the media and communications student was able to draw parallels between the literature she consumed and her own day-to-day life; what anxiety could do, how it could alter one’s thinking and innocuous everyday habits that could become an antidote.Sruthi started expressing her musings in short animated films on her Instagram handle @smores_smohan; it started with a cute visual on how she finds calmness in music; followed by another on her love for a cup of tea and a story of a butterfly inspired from her favourite author’s book — things that kept her afloat in quarantine.Like Sruthi — whose discovery of mental health in art encouraged her to join the Schizophrenia Research Foundation as a communications professional — artists and influencers are using comic strips, digital artwork and even memes to get talking about the mental health challenges that have gripped many since the pandemic, and act as allies to those fighting anxiety, depression and hopelessness. What drives them is not just the comfort of self-expression, but also the resolve to let people know that they’re not alone in these everyday battles, and resonate with them with beauty, humour and popular culture.A way Hyderabad-born Sravya Attaluri does this for instance, is use her quirk and creativity in her illustrations to talk about the importance of seeking help, cutting out triggers even when it’s difficult, and the effort it can take just to be in good spirits in times like these — all in a way that’s practical, empathetic and not preachy. Delhi-based clinical psychologist Divija Bhasin began creating mental health-related content on Tik Tok and keeps her 67,000 Instagram followers informed and engaged on the subject through memes and short videos. Bengaluru-based Rahil Mohsin taps into people’s love for comics to talk about how to watch out for a panic attack; practical step by step guides to alter negative self-talk and demystifying various conditions. "But first and foremost, creating and putting out work is healing to oneself; that’s how it begins," says Vadodara-based Anjali Kamath, who found it cathartic to illustrate the moods and moments she was going through herself over the last year. "I find power in being vulnerable and talking about things, not necessarily as an advocate of mental health, but just as something I can do with honesty," she says.Anjali’s Instagram comics on @anjisdoodles use wry, straight-faced humour to talk about things many people may experience, but few will talk about; like how one may obsessively draft a message over and over before sending it to someone; what one may do be perceived as sexy; how social media can feel isolating. The power of her work lies in spelling out real experiences — something she happens organically."The past year has left many of us alone to deal with our own thoughts. To some extent, I can imagine other people going through the same things that I talk about. But my impetus was to talk about my journey. In that sense, it was a shot in the dark," she says.Noida-based counselling psychologist Srishti Asthana says such crisp, creative and relatable content is also the need of the hour. "With people becoming so vulnerable this year, it makes sense for us to get out of our comfort zone and invest in creating a social media presence to help clients and ourselves," says Asthana, whose Instagram handle @words.of.a.psychologist has 2,367 followers.Certified art therapist from Chennai Porkodi Palaniappan says this trend of expression can also create a safe space accommodating many who have found themselves in volatile mental health in over the past year. "Everyone accesses social media and discovering pages like these can let people — even those who haven’t previously dealt with mental illness — know that there are others going through similar struggles," she says."In some sense, this helps beat stigma around mental health and lets people know it’s normal to feel out of control and easier to get back on track."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/an-artists-guide-to-a-better-mind/articleshow/84956429.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Rajbhar politics hots up: Om Prakash Rajbhar Open To Alliance With SP||Lucknow: Former BJP ally turned rebel, Om Prakash Rajbhar, announced on Sunday he was keeping the option open of hammering out an electoral alliance with Samajwadi Party, marking a political deftness to toss up a fresh alignment to trouble BJP, which seeks to return to office after the assembly elections next year. Rajbhar confirmed to TOI his coalition of smaller parties — Bhagidaari Sankalp Morcha (BSM) — was open to a tie-up with any opposition party, including the SP if it agrees to fulfil its demands, including quota for various sub-castes within the OBC community. “Our party is open to alliances for defeating BJP,” he told TOI. He also affirmed that any alliance needs to be firmed up months before 2022 assembly elections. The development comes a day after BSP veteran and party MLA from Didarganj assembly seat in Azamgarh, Sukhdeo Rajbhar, announced his retirement from active politics, while endorsing his son Kamalkant Rajbhar’s decision to join the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP. Another BSP leader and Akbarpur MLA, Ram Achal Rajbhar, who was recently expelled by Mayawati, is also reported to be gravitating towards the SP leadership. Experts said, these developments may bolster Rajbhar community’s support to Akhilesh, while he widens space to other OBC sub-castes other than his core Yadav vote-bank. Left in the political wilderness after quitting the BJP-led NDA, Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suhaildev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) has been exploring options to cobble up alliances to consolidate the Rajbhar vote-bank, which account for 7% of the total OBC block and has significant political presence in most assembly seats, essentially in the socio-economically backward eastern UP region. The Bhagidaari Sankalp Morcha (BSM) formed by Rajbhar includes eight other parties, including Krishna Patel’s Apna Dal, Jan Adhikar Party and Chandrashekar Ravan’s Azad Samaj Party. The inclusion of Krishna Patel in the morcha gains political significance and is seen as an attempt to sabotage BJP’s bid to consolidate the Kurmi vote, which forms around 24% of OBCs. Krishna has been at odds with her daughter and Apna Dal (S) chief Anupriya Patel, who was recently elevated as a Union minister in the Modi cabinet. Likewise, Rajbhar’s stitching of an alliance with Chandrashekhar Ravan, who is also founder of Bhim Army — a group of Ambedkarite activists — is also viewed as a deft political strategy to dent prospects of Mayawati, especially in west UP, which has substantial Dalit population. Rajbhar’s attempt to take on board AIMIM chief Asaddudin Owaisi, however, suffered a setback when the Hyderabad MP unilaterally announced fielding 100 candidates in the upcoming UP elections. Experts said, SBSP faces a test of its political presence even as BJP escalates measures to woo the Rajbhar community by propping up leaders like cabinet minister Anil Rajbhar and Rajya Sabha MP Sakaldeep Rajbhar. BJP sources said, the party would not let Om Prakash Rajbhar become the sole torchbearer of his community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/rajbhar-politics-hots-up-om-prakash-rajbhar-open-to-alliance-with-sp/articleshow/84959932.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Allahabad||Admissions open in vedic vidyalayas, two new courses introduced||Prayagraj: After a gap of two years, admissions are now open in two vedic vidyalayas (schools imparting vedic knowledge) in Sangam city for the academic session 2021-22. The two vedic vidyalyas—Maharshi Bhardwaj Ved Vidyalaya (Kesar Bhawan) and Maharshi Bhardwaj Ved Vedang Shikshan Kendra—are currently being run by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). Acharya Pankaj Sharma, principal of Maharshi Bhardwaj Ved Vedang Shikshan Kendra, Prayagraj, told TOI, “In the academic session 2021-22, we have decided to open admissions for 20 students along with accommodation facility. The entrance test is scheduled on August 5.” He added, “Students passing out of class V who are under the age of 11 years are eligible for admission, and they will have to go through a written test and interview.” He, however, said that in this academic session, two new courses including samved (kauthum shakha) and shukla yajurved (kandav shakha) have been introduced this year. For the new courses, teachers have already been appointed. Sharma said that there had been no admissions in vedic vidyalayas for the past two years due to the Covid pandemic. “But we have opened admissions for 20 students along with accommodation facility this year,” he added. Currently, over 50 students are pursuing their studies (seven-year courses) at these two vedic schools through online mode. Maharshi Bhardwaj Ved Vidya Samiti and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) are currently running over 27 vedic vidyalayas across the country where around 1,000 children are being imparted lessons in vedas and vedang. In Prayagraj’s two vedic vidyalayas, the authorities, acknowledging their growing popularity, are focussed on imparting quality education, strengthening the schools’ infrastructure as well introducing new subjects. Acharya Sharma, meanwhile, claimed that no fees was charged from students, and on an average, Rs 4,000-5,000 is spent on a student monthly by the organisation. “At vedic vidyalayas, a seven-year course in vedas is being offered to the students. The academic session usually starts in July-end or August. The acharyas teach students with new methods of veda learning. In the past five years, the popularity of such schools has increased manifold, and many western countries are offering graduate-level courses in vedas, sanskrit, Hindu philosophy, yoga, ayurveda, jyotishi and medicine,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/admissions-open-in-vedic-vidyalayas-two-new-courses-introduced/articleshow/84957172.cms||---

Like Shardul, who had come with his mother, siblings and cousins, many others asked the same question to Kali Khoh ropeway station manager Sanjay Singh, who told them to wait for the inauguration of the first cable car service in east UP by Union home minister Amit Shah and chief minister Yogi Adityanath remotely from Government Inter College ground. Not only devotees, even priests and souvenir stall owners were ecstatic on the beginning of the service. Kali Khoh temple’s veteran priest Nanhe Tiwari said, “Devotees had to climb 127 steps and so, while the old and infirm could not come, many others too found it difficult and returned without visiting the temple. The cable car service will make it easy for the devotees. Sanjay Yadav, a souvenir shop owner said the facility will help increase footfall of devotees. UP Tourism’s joint director (Varanasi) Avinash Mishra said, “The Rs 16 crore ropeway project is in two parts. The Ashtabhuja hill has main terminal. The 199 m ropeway will ferry visitors to Ashtabhuja while 102 m second line will ferry people to Kali Khoh.” The ropeway projects at Chitrakoot and Vindhyachal were announced in 2016. Soon after coming to power, CM Yogi Adityanath cleared both proposals in July 2017. The ropeway area in Vindhaychal comes under forest department. The plan was finalised with the help of forest officials and later, the project was executed on PPP model,” said Mishra. Station manager Sanjay Singh said each cable car can carry maximum six persons at a time. Passengers will have to pay Rs 40 for travelling both sides at Kalikhoh and Rs 50 for Ashtabhuja. For thousands of pilgrims flocking to Vindhychal Dham, visting Ashtabhuja and Kali Khoh to complete the holy Trikon Yatra was must. On an average, 2,000 pilgrims visit Kali Khoh and Ashtabhuja temples per day. During Chaitra and Shardiya Navratra, the footfall goes up many times, said Mishra, adding the added feature will increase the number of visitors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/amit-shah-launches-east-ups-firstcable-car-service-at-vindhyachal/articleshow/84957057.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

For at least an hour on Saturday morning, he failed to give directions to the control room in Moradabad about the arrival of trains, said officials. The station master also did not provide a signal to trains which is meant to indicate to the loco pilot that the route is clear. “At least three trains passed the station while the station master was sleeping. A major accident could have taken place in case we had to run an emergency train or a train had changed its route,” said an officer from Railway’s Moradabad division. The railway employee had passed out in his cabin after drinking at 3am on Saturday. Later, he woke up and dialled the control room to inform that trains had passed by the station but was unable to give accurate timings of their arrival. After the control room sensed something amiss, they contacted the Government Railway Police who found him in an inebriated state. GRP cops then took him for a medical examination. He was suspended for dereliction of duty and drinking on duty, deputy railway manager (DRM) Moradabad Tarun Prakash told TOI. The official added, “When we came to know about his condition, we sent another station master to Kakather which falls close to Gajraula town in Amroha.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/drunk-station-master-at-up-railway-station-passes-out-suspended/articleshow/84954233.cms||Harveer Dabas

They were planning to sell the civet skins. The trio has been sent to the district jail in Lakhimpur. Anil Patel, deputy director, Dudhwa (buffer), told TOI, “We have intensified patrolling during monsoon as poachers intrude into the forest area for illegal activities. Our patrol team detected some suspicious activity in Mailani range and caught Laxman, Banwari and Rajaraj with the carcass of two palm civet cats. All three were booked under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act and sent to jail.” Last month, four poachers were arrested with the carcass of a cheetal. All the accused were habitual offenders and arrested in the past as well. But each time, they managed to get bail. But this time, they were slapped with the stringent Gangster Act, said Vijay Dhull, Kheri SSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/three-poachers-held-with-2-palm-civet-cat-carcasses-in-dudhwa/articleshow/84951950.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||Cargo area shift appears hazy, IAF demands Rs 1.38 crore rent||PUNE: The shifting of the existing cargo hold area of the Pune airport has run into rough weather yet again even after the same was approved by the ministry of defence. Pune MP and the chairman of the Pune airport advisory committee Girish Bapat told TOI that the Indian Air Force (IAF) had asked for a lease rent of Rs1.38crore per year for the 2.5-acre plot in which the cargo area was to be shifted, thereby raising fresh problems. “We have come to know that the IAF has asked for the amount from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the latter has not agreed to the payment. The amount is big and it has raised fresh roadblocks. I have been told by the Pune airport authorities that they are already paying the IAF a large amount of money for the civil enclave and that payment of more money for the plot is difficult. We are working towards a solution,” Bapat told TOI. In June, Bapat had said that IAF had agreed to provide the Pune airport with a plot of theirs so that the existing cargo hold area of the facility can be shifted. “An oral confirmation from the ministry of defence has come to us and we are presently now waiting for a letter from them, pertaining to the same, which should happen by the end of the month,” Bapat had told TOI. The Pune airport is primarily a defence airbase under the IAF and the AAI has been using it as a civil enclave for years now. “I have just returned from Delhi from the parliament’s Monsoon session but will follow up on the matter and talk to the ministry of defence about it. I will be meeting defence minister Rajnath Singh on the issue too and am sure that things will progress soon and the AAI will get the plot,” Bapat pointed out. October last year had seen the Pune airport authorities stating that they were loosing business worth Rs 2.5 crore each day due to limitations in the existing cargo hold area. “If we get the land in front of the IAFs barrack store office (BSO) yard the handling capacity will increase to 500 tonnes each day.A total of around 150 tonnes of cargo is handled presently from the existing cargo hold area,” Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/airport-cargo-area-shift-hazy-after-iaf-demands-rent/articleshow/84958617.cms||Joy Sengupta

Against 23 new Covid-19 positive cases in 24 hours, 21 patients were discharged, adding two to the active cases, taking them to 254.  Gujarat has constantly recorded a drop in active cases over the past two months due to more discharges than daily cases, said experts. Ahmedabad recorded eight, or 35% of the daily cases, whereas Vadodara registered a slight rise in cases at five in 24 hours. Four major cities of Gujarat accounted for 69.5% of the daily cases, recording a fall in non-urban areas.  Ahmedabad added five active cases with only three discharges.

---||Ahmedabad||‘Curbs hit treatment, cancer turned severe’||AHMEDABAD: The Covid pandemic also affected patients of other ailments – the lockdown last year and subsequent travel restrictions and curfews in the second wave prevented many patients who would come to a centre like Ahmedabad got reduced. “It’s one of the reasons that we have recorded a significant rise in cancer patients who are diagnosed with third or fourth stage of cancer right at the OPD, giving surgeons and experts less time for treatment,” said Dr Priyank Rathod, head & neck cancer surgeon at Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI). It is one of the biggest government-run cancer care centres of Gujarat. The experts said that earlier the ratio of the patients getting admitted with third or fourth stage was about 10% to 20% depending on cancers, which has increased to 40% for cancers like head & neck. The fear of approaching a medical setting was also a reason for the patients not to come to the tertiary care centre, and continuing with existing treatment. Dr Shashank Pandya, director of GCRI, said that for the past couple of months, the OPDs have got stabilized. “Compared to pre-Covid times, the OPDs and surgeries had got reduced in 2020. We urge all the cancer or potential cancer patients to get themselves screened at the earliest to increase chances of survival,” he said. GCRI officials said that against 20,220 total cases during 2019, 2020 witnessed only 12,142 cases, a drop of about 40%. Thus, only those patients with severe symptoms or in need of radio or chemotherapy approached the hospital. The statistics has improved in 2021, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/curbs-hit-treatment-cancer-turned-severe/articleshow/84956695.cms||Parth Shastri

While addressing a public meeting at Government Inter College ground here on Sunday after laying the foundation of Rs 128crore Maa Vindhyachal corridor and inaugurating east UP’s first ropeway, Shah lauded Yogi for the mammoth work done on all fronts. “BJP will again get the people’s blessings in UP in 2022, just like in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections. We never did the politics of nepotism and worked only for the interest and welfare of 22 crore people of state,” he said.

---||Chennai||For extra flavour, bite into these spoons||Chennai: The next time you’re looking to up your protein intake for the day, try a mouthful of spoon. At least that’s what edible cutlery manufacturers say. One grain-enriched edible spoon contains 10g protein. If you are wondering, a chicken drumstick contains 18g of protein, and a bowl of chickpeas 14g. A whole new spin on being spoon-fed?With Covid-19 putting the emphasis on hygiene, edible cutlery is one of the industries that seem to have taken off. Its market size, valued at $24 million in 2018, is estimated to reach $56 million by 2026.In Chennai, Dinesh Mandot, who just re-reopened (after the two lockdowns) his food outlet Jimosa Chaat Box is awaiting his order of beetroot, sweet spicy chocolate and chatpata spicy spoons. "I had begun using edible cutlery at my outlet before the pandemic, but after Covid-19 it’s more hygienic because you can eat the cutlery once you are done," he says.He gets his cutlery from Bengaluru-based startup Gajamukha Foods, launched by ex-techies Shaila Gurudutt’s and Lakshmi Bheemachar, which now has a portfolio of more than 35 products — from biriyani and sambar-flavoured cutlery to chocolate and peanut. The latest on their menu? Edible biriyani pots.The Covid-19 has also brought sustainability into the spotlight, says Gurudutt, and that has got the market on a growth spurt. "We have been getting enquiries from companies in Russia and Africa to convert local edible grains into cutlery to reduce food wastage," says Gurudutt, who explains the edible dishes and spoons can hold hot (boiling) and cold food for up to 40 minutes before getting soggy.In Kerala, Vinay Balakrishnan is set to launch Thooshan, a range of edible bran cutlery. "The pandemic has spiralled interest in this segment," says Balakrishnan. His product is a result of intensive research in collaboration with scientists at the CSIR- National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram. "For every 1kg of atta made, 20% is the wastage. Part of it is cattle feed, but most of it is dumped. We’ve made plates out of it that can be eaten after the meal," says Balakrishnan, who is working on creating edible takeaway containers. "If people don’t want to eat it, just throw it in the lake, the fish will love it. So will your plants. It’s eco-friendly. I eat it myself. It tastes just like a chapathi."Balakrishnan explains that the edible plates need to be treated like food products. They need to be consumed immediately or stored in airtight containers.In Gujarat, Trishula, a company started by 20-something mechanical engineer Patel Kruvil, turns beetroot, spinach, chocolate, masala, black pepper, mint and ajwain (carom seeds) into spoons that add flavour to the dish (the pepper corn soup spoon, for instance). The company advertises that it produces 31 million pieces a year. Online stores too have begun selling flavoured sweet and savoury spoons by the box.During the lockdown last year, Vivek Sabapathy, who heads Madurai-based RS Pathy Naturo launched a kiosk to promote his Ayurvedic beverage. Today, the kiosk is famous as the ‘first biscuit cup tea shop’ in the city so the company has decided to turn it into a franchise with the same name. "The 60ml biscuit-flavoured cups can hold hot tea for 15 minutes," says Sabapathy, who also retails the popular cup at supermarkets. "There are three reasons to drink my tea — sustainability, hygiene and well, who doesn’t like the taste of a biscuit dipped in tea?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/for-extra-flavour-bite-into-these-spoons/articleshow/84956474.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Under Yogi, UP is top inlaw and order, says Shah||Lucknow: In a strong endorsement of the Yogi Adityanath government in the run-up to the high-voltage state elections early next year, Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday lauded the chief minister for taking UP ahead of all other states in terms of law and order situation. Coming days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the UP government for his Covid management, Shah's remark is yet another affirmation of Yogi as a key leader to spearhead the BJP's bid to retain power in the state. Earlier, BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh had also hailed the party’s saffron mascot for his management in battling Corona pandemic. “Not only law and order, UP is leading other states in implementation of other 44 developmental schemes of the Centre. UP has developed in all fields…It is a matter of pride for us,” Shah said after laying the foundation stone of UP State Institute of Forensic Sciences in Lucknow. The institute, which will be affiliated to Gandhi Nagar (Gujarat) based National Forensic Science University, is proposed to come up at an estimated cost of Rs 200 crore. Shah also emphasised that the Yogi government worked exceedingly well in controlling the pandemic through sample testing and vaccination. His assertion was seen as BJP’s stern counter to opposition which seeks to corner the saffron dispensation over mismanagement of Covid during the devastating second wave. The home minister categorically tore into the opposition, accusing it of having pushed UP into a state of anarchy and instilling fear among people by fanning communal tensions until the BJP came to power in 2017 assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/under-yogi-up-is-top-inlaw-and-order-says-shah/articleshow/84959974.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Allahabad||Conversion after being insulted weakens country, observes Allahabad high court||PRAYAGRAJ: Quoting an earlier order of the high court that 'conversion only for getting married is unacceptable', a single bench of the Allahabad high court rejected the bail plea of a person accused of unlawfully converting a girl for getting married, reports Rajesh Kumar Pandey. Rejecting the bail plea of one Javed of Etah district, Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav clarified that though Article 25 (1) of Constitution provides right to freedom of religion and every adult citizen of the country is free to convert his/her religion and can marry any adult citizen, it does not mean that a person can be converted by greed or fear. The court quoted the judgment of apex court in the case of Lilly Thomas, wherein the apex court said that without having faith in Islam, the conversion of a non-Muslim only for getting married is void. “Further, the Allahabad high court in the case of Noor Jahan Begum alias Anjali versus state of UP has held that conversion only for getting married is unacceptable,” the court said. The victim gave the statement in front of the magistrate that she was made to sign on a blank paper and on a paper written in Urdu and later on, she got to know that the bail applicant was already married. It was alleged by the prosecution that the girl was unlawfully converted for the sole purpose of getting her married to the bail applicant . On the other hand, the petitioner said that both the parties were adults and the girl changed her religion on her own free will and got married. The HC also observed that there was no place for religious bigotry, greed and fear in the country, but if a person belonging to the majority community converts his/her religion after getting insulted, then the country becomes weak and divisive powers benefit out of it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/no-bail-to-man-accused-of-getting-a-girl-converted-for-marriage/articleshow/84959950.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Allahabad||‘Trains At A Glance’ booklet to be available only in digital format now||Prayagraj: Remember going through the popular booklet ‘Trains At A Glance’ to get details of trains, their stops, fares, routes and other information whenever you had to plan a train journey? It will not be printed anymore as the Railway Board has decided to go digital and offer the booklet in a digital format. It will now be called ‘Digital At A Glance’. Trains At A Glance, a handy book published annually by Indian Railways, used to offer exhaustive information about the Railways, including timings, routes, reservation procedures, rules and regulation of travelling, passenger amenities available on trains and at stations including catering, menu and rates, rail-tourism information, fare, etc. A must-have for frequent train travellers for decades, the booklet will now be available only in digital format. Although the booklet is being printed since 1927, the Indian Railways printed its first concise train timetable in the name of ‘Trains At A Glance’ only in 1977. In 2020, the booklet was not printed owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Barring last year, the timetable of trains has been printed throughout the last 92 years. Now the new online booklet, called ‘Digital At A Glance’ will be available for the users across the country. In a letter to the CMD of IRCTC, the Railway Board gave him the responsibility of preparing the digital format of the popular booklet. IRCTC has, in turn, sent a letter to all the zonal Railways of the country, including North Central Railway (NCR), informing them about the decision of the board. Trains At A Glance has been disseminating information about all the trains of the country including Shatabdi, Rajdhani, Duronto, Garib Rath and express trains. All the zonal Railways have also been issuing timetable of the trains being operated by them. The railway timetable issued at the zonal level mentions the smaller railway stations where the passenger and memo trains halt. However, it has been realised in the past few years that the utility of these booklets has reduced substantially as people have started using the national train enquiry system and the 139 dial service. Commenting on the issue, chief public relation officer, NCR, Dr Shivam Sharma, said, “The decision to do away with the printed form of ‘Trains At A Glance was that of the Railway Board. IRCTC has written to all the zonal Railways of the country informing them that now the digital format of the same booklet would be rolled out.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/trains-at-a-glance-booklet-to-be-available-only-in-digital-format-now/articleshow/84957264.cms||---

In fact, the month was marked by the maximum vaccination so far at about 75 lakh – 22% of the total vaccination so far since the drive started in January this year. Analysis of the vaccination trends also shows that now the 18-44 years age group has emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the initiative with 43% or four out of every 10 vaccinations administered in this group, surpassing 45-60 years age group. However, the senior citizens lead the tally when it comes to full vaccination. The share of youngsters is slightly higher than the national average of 41%. Likewise, out of 19.65 lakh healthcare and frontline workers, 76% or 15 lakh are fully vaccinated. The state has 2,869 vaccination centres, of which 31 are privately-run. Moreover, the COWIN dashboard revealed that vaccination in rural areas has increased in the state — against 1.27 lakh doses administered in urban areas, 1.49 lakh were recorded in rural areas. Among the cities, Ahmedabad has administered 29.27 lakh first doses, and 9.08 lakh second doses, making 31% of the vaccine takers fully vaccinated. The share is 35% in Surat and 36% in Vadodara cities, reveal the dashboard. “Rapid vaccination is a major goal for the preparations to thwart the third wave of the pandemic,” said a public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/43-of-vaccine-beneficiaries-in-state-below-44-years/articleshow/84961928.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Lean phase of monsoon sparks concern in Marathwada||AURANGABAD: The current lean phase of the monsoon being observed in Marathwada for more than a week now, which is likely to be extended by two more weeks, has become a cause of concern among farmers during the kharif season. Marathwada has registered 145% of normal rainfall during the first two months of the rainy season by the end of July. Aurangabad and many other parts of the Marathwada region — comprising eight districts — have only reported intermittent spells of drizzle amid largely overcast conditions over the past week. K K Dakhore, the agricultural meteorologist of the Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, on Sunday said no major rainfall activity is likely to take place across the region for at least the next two weeks. “While the soil under kharif season currently has sufficient moisture to nourish crops, the same is going to deplete considerably in the wake of the likely extended lean phase of monsoon till the first half of August. The farming community has been advised to undertake irrigation measures in such cases in order to avoid stress on crops. Also, the humid weather in absence of rainfall can give birth to different pests and farmers should prepare well in advance to combat such menace,” he said. As per the official data, Marathwada has received 465 mm of rainfall (145%) since June 1 as compared to 419 mm of showers (128%) reported during the corresponding period last year. While Aurangabad district has received 333 mm rainfall (120%) during the first two months of the rainy season, Jalna and Parbhani both have reported the highest rainfall (158%), followed by Beed (154%), Nanded (153%), Hingoli (139%), Latur (134%) and Osmanabad (130%), according to the official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/lean-phase-of-monsoon-sparks-concern-in-mwada/articleshow/84952025.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

If one goes by the government’s Covid bulletin for the past few days, it looks like the third wave would become inevitable, he said urging the government to take measures to prevent it. In a statement on Sunday, OPS said the new cases were increasing in places such as Chennai, Coimbatore, Erode, Trichy, Namakkal, Thanjavur and Thiruvallur because of poor enforcement of Covid rules. Welcoming the announcements extending the lockdown, enforcing stricter norms in nine places in Chennai and closure of places of worship, OPS said the steps showed that chief minister M K Stalin was also aware of the rising Covid numbers. He said the state government should mount vigil along state borders, particularly Kerala to prevent escalation of Covid cases. “Chief minister M K Stalin should pay special attention to ensure that Covid rules are enforced 100% and protect people of Tamil Nadu from third wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/enforce-covid-norms-strictly-ops-tells-govt/articleshow/84958680.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Dr Tripti Bahuguna, director-general, family welfare and the health department of Uttarakhand, told TOI 401 samples from the state were tested for the survey. Meanwhile, fresh Covid-19 cases have shot up by 94% in a week, as per the data compiled by Social Development for Community (SDF). The data reveals that Uttarakhand recorded 466 new infections between July 25 and 31, as against 240 cases between July 18 and 24. Anoop Nautiyal, founder SDF, told TOI, “In the wake of rising Covid-19 cases across 10 states of the country, it is high time that Uttarakhand gets into preventive and protective mode to safeguard its population from the virus. There is a need to intensify the vaccination drive and focus upon building micro-containment zones, wherever needed.” Meanwhile, several doctors in the state have expressed concern over the state government reopening schools for Class IX to XII from August 2 (Monday). “The decision may lead to an influx of students from other states to Uttarakhand. The opening of schools may not be the best idea, especially at a time where there are no vaccines available for people below 18 years,” said a senior doctor from the state health department. When asked to comment on the decision to reopen schools for senior classes, NS Bisht, senior physician, Coronation Hospital, said, “In a majority of the western countries, schools have reopened. Besides, surveys relating to Covid-19 on school going students have ascertained that schools are safe zones for them.” He, however, added that adults must continue to follow all Covid-19 safety guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/73-people-in-ukhand-have-covid-antibodies-sero-survey/articleshow/84954290.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Six districts report most +ve Covid cases, Mumbai under 400 for 4th day||MUMBAI: As many as 71% of the new Covid-19 cases on Sunday were reported from six districts of Ahmednagar, Pune, Solapur, Satara, Kolhapur and Sangli. Maharashtra reported 6,479 new fresh cases, of which 4,584 were from these districts. Pune reported the highest number of new infections (999), followed by Ahmednagar (888), Sangli (754), Solapur (691), Satara (642) and Kolhapur (610). These districts also continue to account for the highest number of active cases and deaths in the state at present. Pune, for instance, is the only district to have more than 15,000 active cases currently in Maharashtra. Satara and Sangli have the second and third highest active cases. All these districts are expected to see the continuation of restrictions, state officials said. Barring them, most other districts continued to register a decline in cases and deaths. One of the most populated, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, too reported less than 1,000 new cases for the second day in a row. The state’s addition of 6,479 cases and 157 deaths on Sunday took the count of overall cases to 63,10,194 and deaths to 1,32,948. Mumbai’s new cases continued to be under 400 (331) for the fourth day in a row. The city’s overall case count stood at 7,35,107 on Sunday. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the city’s growth rate is currently very low at 0.05%. “We are trying our best to continue at that rate. Testing has not dropped either. Our current positivity rate is 1% or less on most days. Hence people need to continue Covid protocols and carry on with masking and social distancing,” he said. In the heavy burden districts, it’s the rural parts, including in Pune, Sangli and Kolhapur, that are contributing to more cases. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has scheduled a visit to Kolhapur on Monday in flood-affected areas to discuss the Covid-19 issue with local authorities. The Kolhapur region as a whole, which includes Sangli, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, detected 1,665 cases and 38 deaths on Sunday.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad’s tallest residential project opposite Science City in limbo||AHMEDABAD: The city’s upcoming tallest residential building at Science City — 110 meters tall, 30 floors — the project is currently stuck in limbo. The reason being that the state government’s urban development department, after having announced the finalization of the development control regulations (DCR) in May this year, is yet to constitute a technical committee, involving engineering institutions and government experts. The committee was to review building design and run simulation studies on horizontal load — how the building would react during earthquake — and wind load.  The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is presently examining the project after having been intimated by the state government last week. If the project passes, it will be at the 92.4 metre building height of three buildings that is expected to come up on the Sabarmati riverfront. According to plans available with the AMC, the skyscraper residential project, spread over a 14,000 square yard plot just opposite Science City will consist of 348 units. There are plans for 3 and 4 BHK apartments of 3,500 sq ft, 4,500 sq ft and 5,500 sq ft carpet area. When TOI contacted the developer, Prakash Karsan Patel, he said, “The DCR was finalized two months back while I had submitted the project eight months earlier for consideration.” Under the current general DCR, the maximum limit of any building was earlier confined to maximum 45m, since the 2001 earthquake. It was then raised to 70m — which translates to 22 or 23 floors — in 2017. The new policy for tall buildings that was announced in August 2020 allowed builders to make the sky their limits, provided a road of at least 30m width adjoined the plot. The developer also has to procure an NOC from the Union civil aviation ministry or Airports Authority of India (AAI). Sources in the AMC claimed that skyscrapers can come up in zones that have a Floor Space Index (FSI) of more than 1.2. The new policy allows an FSI of 5.4 but the developer will have to pay for FSI above 1.2 at 50% of the jantri value (revenue ready reckoner rates) of the non-agricultural land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citys-tallest-residential-project-opposite-science-city-in-limbo/articleshow/84956651.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After last year’s Covid hiatus, Lalbaugcha Raja organisers to resume Ganeshotsav||MUMBAI: The Lalbaugcha Raja Ganeshotsav Mandal will resume festive celebrations this year after its 2020 Covid hiatus. Physical darshan will not be permitted. But given that the high-profile pandal inevitably draws thick crowds, the organisers have urged police and civic authorities to help prevent public entry. “We held a special general body meeting of mandal members on Saturday, and decided that we will host the idol this year. Of course, we shall dutifully observe all government guidelines and civic rules,” said mandal president Balasaheb Kamble. “The moorti will be 4 ft tall as per the state’s guidelines. Physical darshan will be banned, and no queues will be formed for either ‘mannat’ or ‘mukhdarshan’. No worshippers will be permitted to touch the feet of the moorti either. But the police and civic authorities will also have to play their part to prevent crowds. Devotees may seek darshan online on our live streaming platform,” Kamble added. Nearly all of the mandal’s office bearers and volunteers have taken the Covid vaccine. “Approximately 3,000 families live in the vicinity of the pandal, of which over 90% have been inoculated. Our 3,000-odd volunteers have been vaccinated too. Most have taken the second dose,” said the president. The previous year, in 2020, the Lalbaugcha Raja mandal had forgone the idol entirely. Instead it had organised an Aarogya Utsav or health camp, a special plasma collection drive for Covid patients, and donated over Rs 1 crore in charity to the families of Covid victims and Galwan martyrs. “We had distributed Rs 1 lakh each to families of policemen, BMC workers and government employees who lost their lives to this disease. We gave Rs 2 lakh to the families of soldiers killed in the Galwan conflict,” said Kamble. The fact that no light is yet visible at the end of the tunnel has compelled organisers to end their self-imposed moratorium on celebration. “No one knows when the Covid pandemic will end. The ICMR is unable to say, the WHO is unable to say. So we decided to resume our tradition lest it fade away,” Kamble added. Meanwhile, Naresh Dahibawkar, president of the Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti, lauded the mandal’s decision to resume festivities with proper precautions.

---||Ahmedabad||Demand revival pushes July GST collection up 36%||AHMEDABAD: Signalling an increase in economic and commercial activity and a surge in inflation, the collection of total Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Gujarat surged 36% in July 2021, states the data released by the Union finance ministry. Total GST collection stood at Rs 7,629 crore in July 2021 against Rs 5,621 crore in the same month last year. The growth in tax collection in Gujarat was higher than the India average of 32% during the same period. The growth is comparatively high on a lower base as tax collection suffered due to a slower recovery in demand after the lockdown last year. State commercial tax department officials and industry players attribute the growth to a surge in economic activity. “The commercial activity has increased significantly in July. The demand has bounced back after slowing after the second wave of Covid-19, signalling a revival in the economy. In the run up to the festive season, the demand has taken off across various industrial sectors as the cases of Covid-19 have consistently remained very low,” said J P Gupta, state commercial tax commissioner. “As compared to July last year, inflation has also increased which contributed to the surge in overall tax collection,” said a tax official on condition of anonymity. State GST (SGST) collection in Gujarat was the second highest ever in July since the new tax regime was rolled out, according to data provided by the state commercial tax department. The highest was in April 2021, at Rs 4,279 crore. The state’s revenues through GST also showed a significant 55% growth in July this year over last year. Gujarat recorded Rs 3,872 crore of SGST collection in July 2021 – up 55% against Rs 2,503 crore in the same month last year. In fact, SGST collection also surged 34% against June’s Rs 2,875 crore. “With businesses opening up after easing of Covid-19 related curbs and demand bouncing back across various sectors after the second wave, the industrial activity has picked up pace. This is witnessed across sectors; it could be a major contributor to the growth in tax collection,” said an Ahmedabad-based corporate professional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/demand-revival-pushes-july-gst-collection-up-36/articleshow/84956691.cms||Niyati Parikh

Vasant Padhiyar, who works in a fabrication shop in Shahpur, said that he had gone to an ATM to withdraw money to pay his electricity bill. He went to an ATM near Namaste circle in Shahibaugh where a man spotted him struggling to withdraw cash. The man offered him help and took his ATM card telling him that he would withdraw the money for him. Padhiyar gave his ATM card to the man who pretended to attempt to withdraw money and later returned a card saying that the ATM machine did not have money. When Padhiyar tried to withdraw the money using his ATM card, it showed that wrong pin was inserted. After a while, Padhiyar found that Rs 57, 015 had been debited from his bank account. Padhiyar approached cybercrime police and he was sent to Madhavpura police to register his complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-57k-cost-of-taking-help-at-atm/articleshow/84956599.cms||---
---||Trichy||Leopard that injured 2 returns to Kolli hills||TRICHY: After a lone leopard ventured into a hamlet in Thuraiyur injuring two people on Saturday, the camera traps fixed by the forest department captured the wild animal returning to the forest giving much relief to the locals. A leopard has been spotted in the region after nearly six years. Hiding in a small hillock near Koneripattu in Angiyam village, the wild animal had injured Hari Baskar, 20 and Duraisamy, 59, who are under treatment in Namakkal government hospital. It had attacked the duo after they tried to go near it to take a selfie. The animal attacked them in panic and went back to the caves in the hillock, according to senior staff of the forest department. Movement of people was brought down in the area by deploying staff including police personnel as the animal could enter residential areas if it panics. Street lights were put off and people asked to remain indoors during the night. While the forest department suspected it to be a leopard after examining the pug marks and statement from the locals, it was captured by one of the six camera traps set up at the location by the forest department in the night. “As we expected, the leopard came out in the darkness due to human movement and went back into the forest in Kolli hills from where it had come,” said S Ramasubramanian, chief conservator of forests, in-charge of Trichy forest circle. About 10 field-level forest department staff are camping in the village to monitor it. The leopard usually doesn’t return, especially after such incidents, he said. It was in 2015 that a leopard was spotted in the same region and was captured and sent to Anamalai Tiger Reserve. Unlike tigers which require larger prey like Indian Gaur, sambar deer or spotted deer for survival, leopards can thrive on peafowl, rabbits and small mammals, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/leopard-that-injured-2-returns-to-kolli-hills/articleshow/84956605.cms||Sampath Kumar

Malaiadipatti is a historical place with cave temples of Shiva and Vishnu, Jain stone beds and a megalithic burial site. About 25 km from Trichy city, the rock art is perhaps the first to be found on a hillock known as ‘Thiruvalathur’. Trichy based archaeo-symbolist T L Subash Chandira Bose noticed the four-square rock art drawn in white pigment on a rock surface at the back side of the hill near to the Jain stone beds. “There are lots of petro-glyph (pre-historic rock carving) symbols attributed to various periods of time on the rock surface of the hill. But this is the only rock art found in the hill, which makes the finding significant,” said Chandira Bose. He says similar symbols denoting ‘Param’ or God were observed in ancient archaeological sites such as Gangai Konda Cholapuram Shiva temple and Kongar Puliankulam caves. “Mayamata, an Indian treatise on housing architecture and iconography has the reference of this four-squared symbol as ‘Pecaka’ geometrical diagram. The geometrical diagrams as symbols were invented by ancient Indians to understand the unknown or god,” he said. He further said that a square refers to space (sky) and a plus mark or cross with a vertical line (cause) and a horizontal line (effect) refers to causation. A plus mark is the first consonant of Tamil letter ‘Ka’ and also denotes numerical number ‘one’ in Tamil language. The ‘plus’ symbols denote ‘addition’ in mathematical science. ‘Ka’ denotes the god.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/3000-year-old-rock-art-with-symbols-found-in-pudukottai/articleshow/84956650.cms||Sampath Kumar

Activists Sakshi Satkar and Tanvi Khedekar from Mumbai strove to give Boris a second chance at life. While Sakshi shared his story and pictures on her social media handles to find him a home and coordinated relentlessly on his travel, Tanvi raised funds for treatment,” said animal rescuer Dr Rubina Furtado. They were glad when Irene Van Raadshooven, an animal empath from the Netherlands, recently connected with Sakshi to adopt Boris. Irene was looking for an addition to her family of differently abled dogs at her Little Belle’s Magical Sanctuary. “Due to Covid-imposed travel restrictions, Boris had to wait for a year under the care of his foster mom Akanskha Hejmady before finally boarding the flight to his forever home in Amsterdam recently,” said Furtado. ‘Cuddles’, a local support group for animal rescuers and feeders, helped cover the initial expense for Boris when he was at a medical foster.

---||Nagpur||Taking along communities makes her ‘Bagh Rakshak’||Nagpur: Monika Chaudhary (31), a forest guard with Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), has bagged the prestigious ‘Bagh Rakshak’ award instituted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). Chaudhary is among the five foresters from the country to get the coveted prize for her outstanding work in remote Girguti under Jambhli forest range in the buffer zone of MTR. In the last two years, the woman forest guard has been taking along the communities to protect wildlife and forest in the hilly terrain. Even MTR chief conservator of forest (CCF) & field director Jayoti Banerjee acknowledges Chaudhary’s work. “It’s a big moment for us. I had proposed names of 11 forest personnel. Chaudhary has done a fantastic job. It was visible when I visited Girguti with deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Piyusha Jagtap recently,” said Banerjee. Two years ago, when Chaudhary was posted in Girguti, conflict with villagers was common. Villagers were mostly dependent on the forest for firewood and encroachment on forest land under the Forest Rights Act (FRA) was also an issue. Banerjee said that with support from seniors, she set priorities and through the village Joint Forest Management Committee (JFMC), made the village completely firewood-free by distributing 100% LPG connections. “Besides, without entering into any conflict, I pursued villagers to remove encroachments on 35 hectares forest land,” said Chaudhary. Chaudhary stressed that without the support of communities it is difficult to save tigers and forest. “Keeping this in mind, I explored livelihood options for people. A nursery was readied in which 10,000 saplings of mahua flowers were grown. These saplings were distributed to villagers for plantation in farms,” she said. She created pressure impression pads (PIPs) in her beat to get the estimate of wild animals. In 2020-21, she did foot patrolling of 2,664km of forests with the help of M-STrIPES, a software-based monitoring system. Chaudhary was instrumental in meadow development as well and created absorption pits to harvest village sewage. “This year, Girguti was awarded a prize of Rs5,000 under the ‘Angar-mukt’ (fire-free) jungle competition. There were no forest fires in my area. It was made possible due to continuous dialogue with local people telling why fires were disastrous for their survival,” she said. Last year, forest guard Akash Sarda (29) had bagged the NTCA award for cracking 16 cases through Melghat cyber cell. Another woman guard Pramila Sidam (29) had also won the same award for monitoring of tigress T1 aka Avni in Pandharkawda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/taking-along-communities-makes-her-bagh-rakshak/articleshow/84960430.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||Cong, BJP youth wing members face off over rally route||Nagpur: A tense face-off was witnessed on Sunday afternoon between members of Congress and BJP’s youth wings in the vicinity of RSS headquarters, over the bike rally route chosen by the former. Loud slogan shouting, shoving and verbal duels continued for some time between the two parties, before the police defused the situation. Congress corporator Bunty Shelke, known for his firebrand approach, had decided to take out a bike rally passing close to the RSS headquarters. Since the rally plan was announced publicly, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) members anticipated trouble near RSS headquarters and blocked Shelke’s entry. This is where the trouble started, and what happened next depends on whose version one hears. Shelke said, “I was on my way to a Ganesh temple located near that area. Since we were starting our bike rally called ‘Sangh se Sansad’, I decided to seek blessings at the temple. However, BJYM members blocked the road and refused me the right to worship my God.” He added that BJYM members hurled abuses at his team and a few also got into a scuffle. The BJP, however, dismissed the allegations, saying Shelke’s move was political in nature. MLC Pravin Datke, BJP city president, said, “Shelke is simply using the RSS name to catapult himself in the Congress heirarchy. I agree that as a politician he has a right to hold protests, but what do issues like petrol price and farmers have to do with RSS headquarters. Shelke has an old habit of criticizing RSS because he knows that doing so will increase his strature in the Congress party.” Responding to the temple worship statement by Shelke, BJP said it’s illogical. “How can you worship at a place which is closed as per the current Covid-19 guidelines. He is an active politician, whose party is in power in Maharashtra, so Shelke must be more aware of this,” said Datke. Zonal DCP Lohit Matani said Shelke had suddenly changed his route and tried to come near RSS headquarters, but cops had stopped him from doing so. The “Congress rally was forced to follow its planned route. There is no question of permission but they had intimated us about the rally,” said Matani. “There was no untoward incident. Police were alert and ensured there was no clash or violence,” he added. “We are taking legal opinion regarding the incident. A decision would be taken soon after legal opinion is available,” said the DCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cong-bjp-youth-wing-members-face-off-over-rally-route/articleshow/84960428.cms||---

While there is no formal announcement yet from the HC administration, judges were heard telling a lawyer that they will hear his case in the chamber when the in-person hearings restart from August 17. When the lawyer said he was pleased to hear about the reopening of courtrooms, one of the judges told him not to pretend he did not know anything about the schedule for the resumption of in-person hearings. On Saturday morning, members of the Gujarat High Court Advocates Association (GHAA) had staged a dharna outside the HC campus demanding the reopening of courtrooms. The lawyers said that the number of Covid-19 cases has gone down drastically and the state administration has allowed offices and markets to open. The lawyers have been pressuring the court administration to reopen courtrooms ever since the HC shut itself and switched over to the virtual mode of hearings since the lockdown last year. The subordinate judiciary has been functioning normally since June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-may-resume-in-person-hearings-from-august-17/articleshow/84956743.cms||---

Also, I believe that by becoming a doctor, my family’s standard of living will improve a lot.” Iram had scored around 97% in her class X boards in 2019 as well. She added, “I am grateful to my teachers who helped me out financially. My father doesn’t earn much and due to Covid-19 lockdown, his income got further reduced. It was difficult to study since I had to borrow a smartphone from my elder sister which I used to get only for a couple of hours since she also needed it.” Iram’s father, Irfan Ahmed, who runs an auto-rickshaw in Doon, told TOI, “I came to Dehradun to provide better education to my children. My income was not enough to support the educational expenses of all my four children at the same time. So, I asked the older ones to start working to provide some support to the family. Unfortunately during Covid, they lost their jobs. I then took loans for my children’s education. I will make sure that all of them get college degrees." Ahmed added, “I am proud of my daughter. Now, I am confident that my children won’t have to drive an auto and will have a better standard of living.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/despite-hardships-auto-drivers-daughter-scores-98-in-class-xii-ubse-exams/articleshow/84954342.cms||Mohammad Anab

On Sunday, SDM Monika, who visited the temple, said on the complaint of the management committee a case has been registered against the MP and others under various IPC sections, including 188 and 504. Locals and state politicians also registered their protest against the MP's "bad behaviour" inside the temple. Some of them sat on a dharna while Aam Aadmi Party and NSUI members burnt the lawmaker's effigy. On Saturday Bhagwan Bhatt, the manager of the temple management committee, had said, "The MP entered the temple to offer prayers. It was 6pm and the temple was about to close for 'darshan' for the day. When we made him aware of the temple rules, he started misbehaving." Govind Gopal, the committee's vice-president, also condemned the incident.

As the threat of a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic looms large, various district administrations in the central region have announced that major temples will remain closed on the festival day and bathing in the rivers was prohibited. In Trichy, the district administration has said devotees will not be allowed to enter major temples on August 2 and August 3. The HR&CE will ensure that the scheduled rituals are conducted at the temples by priests as per the traditional manual, officials said. Following the directive from district collector S Sivarasu, the major temples installed notice boards around the entrances informing the restrictions. Other districts in the region including Ariyalur and Perambalur have also made similar announcements to curtail the festival gathering. During Aadi Perukku, thousands of families and newly-wed couples will visit temples to offer prayers, and it will be difficult to follow the SOPs at the temples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/aadi-perukku-to-be-low-key-in-delta-dists/articleshow/84956687.cms||---

The stall owner was fined Rs 2,000 and officials have initiated legal action under provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act. District food safety officer Dr R Rameshbabu said that the department had recently received a complaint stating that substandard meat was being sold at the Trichy Corporation’s meat market in Gandhi market. On Sunday, a team of food safety officials inspected 22 stalls in the market, of which one stall was found to be stocking 18kg of meat in a freezer.  “The freezer in which the meat was stored was not properly working. A freezer should maintain temperatures less than 4C if it is being used to store meat,” the district food safety officer said. The spoiled meat was found to be at least three days old and was destroyed later. “We have planned to convene a sensitization meeting for meat stall owners in the market. The surprise inspection will be expanded to other hotspots in the district,” Rameshbabu told TOI.

The body of the victim, Hiraman Kotgale (68), was recovered on Saturday night. Kolgate belonged to Ballarpur village under Padmapur round of the range. He did not return home from the farm in the evening. When family members failed to trace him, they informed forest officials who recovered the body in survey no. 21. Officials confirmed that Kolgate was killed in a tiger attack. They suspect that the farmer was killed in the farm and the tiger dragged the body to the adjacent jungle. They have paid ex-gratia aid and are completing formalities to provide remaining compensation. The villages are reeling under fear following repeated predator attacks in the area. Forest department has taken up extensive awareness campaign and is guiding people about dos and don’ts in man-animal conflict situation. Also, camera trapping is being carried out in the area to keep track on the movement of predators. Chandrapur district has witnessed 29 human kills in predator attacks this year.

---||Trichy||Trichy traders apprehend curbs as in Chennai as SOP violations go on||Trichy: After Chennai and Coimbatore enforced intense lockdown restrictions in commercial streets to tackle the rise in fresh Covid-19 infection, speculation was rife whether Trichy district administration and city corporation will also clamp similar measures. Traders who are getting ready to cash in on Aadi month sales were the most apprehensive about similar restrictions being clamped. The authorities have for now indicated that it is up to the people to follow standard operating procedures (SOP) and avert tough restrictions. The district administration and corporation acknowledge that there is laxity among people in facemask adherence and social distancing. Ever since fresh infections and positivity rate in the city drastically fell compared to the scenario in May and June, officials say people have been taking the SOPs for granted. “If SOPs are violated, we will also follow similar intense restrictions in the commercial area,” district collector S Sivarasu said. From 11% in June, test positivity rate has dropped to less than 2% now. There was a mild increase in fresh infections in the city and district as a whole in the past few days, indicating the possibilities of the third wave of Covid-19 commencing. From reporting 18 fresh cases on July 28, the city saw the number increasing to 29 new infections on July 31. Similarly, fresh infections in the district surged from 55 on July 28 to 70 on July 31. As the Gandhi market in the city had remained closed for more than 10 months since the pandemic, traders apprehended prolonged closure.With every vegetable dealer investing about Rs 2 lakh anticipating a high demand for vegetables in the auspicious Aadi month, such restrictions were seen as a threat to their efforts to come out of a deep crisis. “We are following the mandatory facemask rule and ensuring social distancing. About 80% of us were vaccinated. We are confident that authorities will not enforce isolated lockdown in Trichy,” A Balasubramani, president, Gandhi market grocery traders association, said. However, while traders claimed that there is no crowding in the market localities, the entire city seems to have let its guard down since the positivity rate and mortality are down. “We will increase the RT-PCR testing to 6,000 per day for early identification of positive cases,” collector S Sivarasu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-traders-apprehend-curbs-as-in-chennai-as-sop-violations-go-on/articleshow/84956656.cms||Deepak Karthik

The policy offers all eligible employees a 26-week parental leave, comprising all benefits and bonuses, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation. This policy includes surrogacy, adoption, and biological conception. “It’s no more spouses, it’s partners who get covered. It's a significant step in articulating our thinking is more holistic, and creating inclusive policies and environments for employees to thrive and succeed at the workplace. We believe that this will pave the way to greater equality, and talent is retained and nurtured,” said Aarif Aziz, chief human resources officer at Diageo India. Effective July 30, this policy is applicable to all new parents and can be availed by new fathers anytime within 12 months of the birth/ adoption of the child, thereby allowing the mother to better manage her career as well as other priorities. “Every employee is encouraged to equally focus on the joy of raising a new family; while continuing to thrive at work, ensuring that they can spend quality time and bond with their child,” Aziz said. Diageo India is the maker of premium brands such as Johnnie Walker, Black Dog, Black & White, VAT 69, Antiquity, Signature, Royal Challenge, McDowell’s No.1, Smirnoff and Captain Morgan. The Bengaluru-based spirits maker employs 3,500 employees.

Recently, Accenture moved away from gender binaries. Policies, it said, would focus on the caregiver rather than gender or marital status. Accenture India’s life insurance benefit was previously restricted to the employee’s spouse and family members. Now, the nominee can be anybody chosen by the employee. Accenture employees who identify themselves as LGBT+ can nominate their partners too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/diageo-offers-both-genders-parental-leave-of-26-weeks/articleshow/84960988.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

---||Nagpur||Properties under tax net rises from 4.5 lakh to 6.42 lakh in revaluation project||Nagpur: The revaluation project of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), which was started in 2015, has started giving results with the addition of 1.92 lakh more properties under the ambit of tax. The number of properties under property tax net has increased from 4.5 lakh to 6.42 lakh under the project and around 50,000 open plots are yet to brought under tax ambit. These properties are likely to be auctioned on spot for lack of details. Before implementation of the revaluation project, around 4.5 lakh properties including structures and open plots were in property tax net. The civic body used to get tax of around Rs 125 crore per annum from these properties. NMC deputy commissioner Milind Meshram told TOI, “Revaluation of existing properties and assessment of new properties of structures has been completed. Now, 6.42 lakh properties are under the ambit of property tax. Demands of around 5.75 lakh properties have been issued. Process to finalize and issue demand notes of remaining 60,000 properties is going on,” he said. He furthers said, “Demand from 5.75 lakh properties is around Rs 250 crore which is expected to increase to Rs 275 crore when process of all 6.42 lakh properties will complete,” he said. The deputy commissioner said, “We are yet to do assessment of around 50,000 open plots. Majority of these plots are situated on city’s outskirts. There are no details about these plots on spot. Also, updated information related to these parcels of land is not available with the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT), city survey department and collector office. We have taken decision to do assessment of these properties by naming unidentified owners. We will attach the copy of notice and demand notes on spot for a certain time period. Then, we will attach these plots followed by auction if owners fail to turn up.” The NMC’s revenue from property tax is likely to increase to Rs 300 crore if these open plots also brought under tax’s ambit. The number of open plots has increased in revaluation project. Earlier, there were around 50,000 open plots in the ambit of tax which increased to 1.1 lakh. Another major advantage from the revaluation drive is that all properties are now online and detailed information can be obtained on one click. Due to this system, the NMC has been able to issue annual demand notes in first quarter itself. Earlier, demand notes were issued up to December end. This is helping the NMC in getting revenue in early days of the financial year. Also, the taxpayers can see details of their properties and tax online. The number of commercial properties also increased in revaluation project. Tax of commercial properties is higher compared with residential. The civic body has done revaluation of existing properties and assessment of new properties by engaging two private agencies. One agency was appointed in November 2015 with target of completing the works within five years. The deadline lapsed in November 2020. The civic body held 20% of total payment of the agency and also levying fine for the delay. ------------------------------------ IAN *NMC launched new property tax system— ready reckoner-based rateable value— from April 1, 2015 and effective date extended to April 1, 2017 *NMC started revaluation of existing properties and assessment of new properties as per new tax system from November 2015 *All changes in existing properties in last ten years like change in occupant from tenant to owner, user change from residential to commercial, increase in area of structure, revision in location factor or ready reckoner value were brought under tax’s ambit *New properties were brought under tax’s ambit *Properties under tax’s ambit increased from 4.5 lakh to 6.42 lakh *Annual demand is likely to increase from Rs 125 crore to Rs 275 crore *More 50,000 open plots are yet to be brought under tax’s net and will increase revenue further *Number of commercial properties increased *All details of properties brought online *Annual demand notes are issued in first quarter which is helping in getting revenue early in the financial year||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/properties-under-tax-net-rises-from-4-5-lakh-to-6-42-lakh-in-revaluation-project/articleshow/84960445.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

He was speaking at the bhoomipujan (foundation stone ceremony) of the BDD Chawl redevelopment project at Jamboree Maidan in Worli. Thackeray performed the bhoomipujan, the second one for the project. The previous bhoomipujan at Jamboree Maidan was performed by Devendra Fadnavis when he was chief minister in 2017. “Many martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement were residents of these chawls. We should remember them. Even if you move to the tower, do not disengage yourself from chawl culture and do not fall prey to the desire to sell your flats,” he said. He said the state had built almost five lakh houses in rural Maharashtra through the rural development department and started alloting houses to mill workers. NCP chief Sharad Pawar said residents should stay back in redeveloped houses and keep the legacy of the chawls intact. There are 195 BDD Chawl buildings, with 80 tenements each, built between 1920 and 1925. After the redevelopment, residents will get a 500sqft flat. Aaditya Thackeray, the local MLA, said the government will convert one of the chawls into a museum to showcase its legacy to the next generation. Minister for housing Jitendra Awhad clarified that the bhoomipujan was not only for the Worli chawls but was a combined one for all three BDD Chawls at Worli, Naigaon and NM Joshi Marg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-performs-bhoomipujan-at-bdd-chawl-site-in-worli/articleshow/84958818.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Nagpur||Nagpur parents write to CBSE over ‘low marks’ in Std XII||Nagpur: A group of parents from Nagpur have written to CBSE, expressing displeasure over ‘low marks’ in the Std XII results announced a few days ago. Since no pen-paper board exam was held this year, students have been allotted marks based on a special tabulation policy. Schools entered marks in a special online software prepared by CBSE and results were declared. Parents who spoke to TOI said their grievance was that deserving students did not score well. A parent said, “My son scored over 90 in Math in Std X and now in XII his marks plummetted. I don’t believe that marks can vary beyond 20% and that’s why we asked the school to show us how they calculated marks for our kids, but the principal refused.” Parents from another school too said the same thing. “We strongly believe that schools have played foul and purposely gave our kids low marks. Academically brilliant students are the ones who have suffered due to callous attitude of schools,” said a parent. These parents from Nagpur are planning to connect with parents from other parts of the country who are facing similar issues. “We will together appeal against this injustice and try to resolve the problem faced by our kids,” said the parent. However, schools said that the entire issue was about ‘not understanding’ the tabulation policy. A principal said, “CBSE’s tabulation policy has been made public after it was approved by the Supreme Court. It’s actually a very transparent policy and it takes marks from previous year’s performance as well so that it’s a fair process.” But the principal accepted that the issue is related to ‘reference year’. “Basically, CBSE looks at the past board exam performance of every school. The best performance in the last three years is chosen as the reference year. The school gets an average median marks, and we have to keep our total schools’ performance within that range. So, if we blindly start giving 99 marks to every student, though that’s not possible either, then it will breach the average median. It’s these technicalities which are causing all the problem.” Std X results will wreak more havoc, fear principals CBSE school principals are dreading Std X results, as they expect sharper response from parents, considering what happened with Std XII results. A principal said, “In Std X, the number of students enrolled is way higher, so it could get worse. The internal marks tabulation policy includes performance for Std IX, and then the marks scored in whatever exams we were able to conduct in Std X. But it will be the reference year marks range, which will limit the number of marks we can give to students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-parents-write-to-cbse-over-low-marks-in-std-xii/articleshow/84956732.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The cooperative federation has also launched its milk brand, Nandini, in the region on Sunday. KMF’s managing director B C Sateesh told TOI that the milk processed at its dairy plant in Bijapur will reach Chandrapur where it will be packed in collaboration with a local dairy brand, Swapnapurti. The milk supplies would travel 650km from Bijapur to finally reach the consumer at Nagpur. “In response to leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis’s call, the federation may also consider starting a milk collection centre in Vidarbha,” said Sateesh. The launch function was chaired by Fadnavis. Sateesh said that the federation has drawn Rs1,000 crore expansion plans by acquiring dairy processing units. “There are plans to buy two plants in Mumbai and one each in Pune and Goa. Tender have been issued for the acquisition in Mumbai and rest would follow soon,” he said. The milk procured at KMF’s centres will be further processed apart from churning out new products from the new units proposed to be acquired. On the Nagpur market, Sateesh said that the federation plans to start with 10,000 litres of milk on a daily basis and take it to 1 lakh litres in a year’s time. In Vidarbha it will cover markets in Nagpur, Wardha, Yavatmal and Chandrapur. The brand is already sold in Mumbai, Pune and Solar apart from markets in Chennai, Hyderabad and Vijaywada outside Karnataka. KMF collects 90.62 lakh litres on a daily basis from 25 lakh members attached to 14,500 cooperative societies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/karnataka-milk-major-plans-expansion-in-maharashtra/articleshow/84960527.cms||Shishir Arya

While the Madurai district collector has ordered closure of Meenakshi Sundareswarar, Alagarkoil, Palamudhir Solai and Thiruparankundram Subramaniaswamy temples from August 2 to August 8, districts like Virudhunagar said all temples would remain closed.Sources said while most of the districts had gone for a three-day closure from August 1 to August 3, including Theni and Ramanathapuram, it would be better if the closure was announced for a week. “The Sri Ramanathaswamy temple, in Rameswaram sees lakhs of devotees for ‘Aadi Amavasai’ to pay obeisance to departed souls. This temple needs to be closed till August 8, the day of Aadi amavasai,’’ said a temple source. Meanwhile, Tirunelveli district collector V Vishnu said the public will not be allowed to worship in the major temples in the district including the Nellaiappar, Sorimuthaiyanar and Pabanasam Pabanasaswamy temples from August 1 to August 9.

In a video clip, which was put on social media, the girl can be seen standing beside Salman -- the main accused in the case. She can be purportedly heard as saying that she was in a “relationship” with the youth for quite some time and also that they were married and no one had forced her to change the religion. Moradabad Police said that they have taken cognisance of the video clip and a fresh probe has been ordered. The girl’s father, a resident of Majhola, meanwhile, alleged that the video was fake and that his daughter was forced by the accused and his accomplices to record the statement. “Salman had bad intentions. He and his brothers and relatives had misbehaved with me and my family several times. They used to threaten us. The video clip is fake, and my daughter has been forced to say such things,” said the girl’s father. Superintendent of police (SP) of Moradabad, Amit Kumar Anand, said, “The case was already under investigation. Teams were deployed to search the girl, after her family alleged that she was kidnapped by their neighbors. “However, a video clip has come to the fore. In it, the girl has confirmed leaving her house willingly and getting married to Salman, who is the prime accused in the case. The girl has also denied the allegation of religious conversion leveled by her family.” The SP city added, “We have taken note of the video and a fresh probe has been ordered.” After the girl went missing, the family approached police and filed a case against Salman. After the complaint, Moradabad police had registered an FIR against six persons under various IPC sections including 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and under appropriate sections of the anti-conversion law and the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/hours-after-up-cops-book-6-under-anti-conversion-law-abducted-girl-says-charges-wrong-married-willingly/articleshow/84954429.cms||Maria Khan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray warns BJP MLC, says Sena will slap back||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray hit back at BJP MLC Prasad Lad on Sunday, saying without naming him that slapping the Shiv Sena would earn a slap in return that would be enough to make the feet give way. He said the Shiv Sena was used to receiving and answering criticism. Lad had spoken about demolishing the Shiv Sena Bhavan, symbolic of Thackeray’s party, on Saturday. He later said he was misinterpreted by the media and did not mean it. In reply, Thackeray said no one should dare to threaten the Shiv Sena. He was speaking at the bhoomipujan for the BDD Chawl redevelopment project in Worli. “You will not be able to stand on your own feet if the Sena gives you one tight slap,” he said. A Shiv Sena MP and some MLAs, too, reacted strongly to Lad’s statement. Thackeray recalled a dialogue from the Hindi film ‘Dabangg’ in which the heroine says: “Thappad se darr nahi lagta Saheb, pyar se lagta hai.” He said his party was used to paying back more than it received. “Thappad se darr nahi lagta … [W]e are used to giving and receiving ‘thappad’, but we have given more than what we have received and have the courage to give in future as well. So, do not dare to slap us,” he said. Earlier in the day, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, while interacting with the media, said the party shakha pramukh would speak on the issue. In a tweet, he said: “There is an urgent need to initiate a drug de-addiction programme in Maharashtra. Otherwise the Marathi Manoos will mercilessly thrash political ganja addicts on the footpath of the Shiv Sena Bhavan. Shiv Sena Bhavan is a symbol of Marathi pride. (The wise understand a hint.) How will those who have converted understand it?” Shiv Sena spokesperson Sachin Ahir challenged Lad to hit the streets of the Shiv Sena Bhavan. BJP distanced itself from Lad’s statement. “Todphod (destruction) is not a part of BJP culture and we do not indulge in such activities. Prasad Lad has already issued a clarification on his statement. Hence, the issue is over for us,”said leader of the opposition in the assembly Devendra Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uddhav-warns-bjp-mlc-says-sena-will-slap-back/articleshow/84958878.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Nagpur||Crime graph in Covid second wave surpasses first wave statistics||Nagpur: The Covid first wave, with strict lockdown in place, was quieter for police too in terms of law and order problems and crime graph. The second wave brought trickier challenges before the health and district administration, and was far tougher for cops too in comparison with the first wave. Till June last year, which roughly corresponds to the Covid first wave period, a total of 2,920 crimes were registered. In the corresponding period this year till June, when the society was reeling under Covid second wave, the crime figure has shot up to a total of 3,952. Prior to Covid, the crime statistics till June in 2019 were, however, even worse with 4,133 offences being registered. Intriguingly, Covid second wave period had proved detrimental to women too, as there was an increase in atrocities on them inside the four walls of the house and also on the streets. There was also a rise in cases of domestic violence in the city. Till June 2019, there were 42 cases of domestic violence by in-laws and husband registered. In 2021, there have been 64 cases filed till June by married women against their husband and in-laws. Rape cases have increased around 68% till June this year (110) as compared to last year (75) when movements were highly restricted due to Covid restrictions. The cases of molestations too have increased from 154 till June in 2020 to 168 this year in the same period. Street crimes too had a low phase last year during Covid peak with only four chain snatchings and 39 robberies reported till June 2020, when few people stepped out. The same offences witnessed a spurt till June this year with 13 chain-snatchings and 73 robberies, due to more public movement and economic activities sans total lockdown. CP Amitesh Kumar said evaluating crime scenario in comparison with statistics of 2020 would be misleading due to Covid related lockdown, which had seen a drop in normal human activities. “Hence we are taking the benchmark of 2019. In comparison to 2019, we are better placed in 2020,” he said. “Rapes have increased but most are reported after relationships turning sour leading to police complaint,” he said. Kumar added preventive actions initiated during the first six months of 2021 too have been exhaustive and elaborate with recurrent special drives on illegal activities and sudden combing operations. “The easing out effects of restrictions seem to have pushed up illegal activities and violence especially in the slum pockets,” he said. In the statistics furnished by the police department, around 5,657 different preventive actions have been initiated which included 422 arms recovery cases, 646 gambling raids, 1,801 raids on liquor, 149 cases of narcotics and others. CP said 1,499 cases under 110 Criminal procedure code (CrPC) were made on the goons with crime records and they were sent to jail too. “We have initiated preventive action on bootleggers too. Around 32 goons were slapped with MPDA and seven MCOCA,” he said. Psychologist Dr Rajesh Rathi said Covid had really rendered a blow to the mental health condition of the masses. “If there is a direct connection between Covid and mental health conditions, then there is an indirect link too of financial constraint leading to stress disorders and such complications, which may have infused a tendency to indulge in crime more now than in normal times,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/crime-graph-in-covid-second-wave-surpasses-first-wave-statistics/articleshow/84956821.cms||Soumitra Bose

On Sunday, the police arrested three accused for making Aadhaar cards with forged documents. The CIA-I of Ludhiana police commissionerate arrested the three accused, identified as Raj Kumar, 48, of New Subhash Nagar, Raj Kumar Sunny, 42, of village Bajra and Vinod Kumar Bhalla, 42, of Tilak Nagar, Rahon Road. The accused were operating from Vinod’s photography studio. The main accused, Kuldeep Singh of Mundiyan Kalan, is yet to be arrested.With a license to make Aadhaar cards in Assam, the trio was operating from a photography studio in Tilak Nagar of Tibba area, for the last three months. The initial probe suggested that the accused have made more than 450 Aadhaar cards so far. The city police have also recovered three laptops, one fingerprint scanner, one retina scanner, two printers, 16 Aadhaar cards, five voter cards, five PAN cards, 1 fake stamp with the name of Harish Pushkar MLA Ludhiana, 36 certificates for Aadhaar enrollment/update forms with the stamps of Harish Pushkar on it and nine cloned fingerprints using glue to access the system. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), investigation S P S Dhindsa said, “We received the information that the accused are making fake Aadhaar cards. We conducted a raid at the studio and arrested the accused. During questioning, the police found that accused Raj Kumar holds the license for issuing Aadhaar cards, however, in Dhubri of Assam. He was making and issuing Aadhaar cards in Ludhiana, illegally. Moreover, to get the license, a person has to get a certification for which the minimum required qualification is Class XII pass, whereas the accused is only Class X pass. Despite that he managed to get the certification for the license.” “During further probe another shocking thing came to light that the accused have made Aadhaar cards with any name and address, without getting the ID proof from the person. In fact, the accused, using forged stamps of MLA, would attest the certificate of Aadhaar enrolment. The police have recovered one forged stamp with the name of Harish Pushkar MLA Ludhiana, but there is no such MLA in Ludhiana. Another stamp they had forged with the name of Sanjeev Talwar MLA Ludhiana, and we have MLA East Sanjay Talwar in Ludhiana,” he added. “This is such a big threat to the security of Aadhaar cards. Any criminal or fraudster can easily get their Aadhaar cards made with fake documents. The whole purpose of Aadhaar cards has been challenged,” said DCP Dhindsa. Additional DCP, investigation, Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said, “The government made the process of making Aadhaar cards free of cost, excluding the rectifications. However, the accused used to charge from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 from the people. Besides those who would not submit their ID proofs, the accused used to charge them from Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500. It is identified that the accused have issued over 450 Aadhaar cards in the past three months. Absconding accused Kuldeep Singh had arranged for them the license to make Aadhaar cards. The police suspect that Kuldeep would have helped more such people to run this illegal trade. The police are trying to trace him.” No cross-checking ADCP Bhatti said the racket busted by the Ludhiana police shows that Unique Identification Authority of India (UIAI) has no system in place to cross check addresses making it possible for people with operator ID issued in Assam system to make Aadhaar cards with Ludhiana addresses. Police writes to UIAICommissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “Aadhaar card is an important document and issuing Aadhaar cards illegally without verification is dangerous. The criminals and fraudsters may easily misuse the document. Moreover, it also seems it is just the tip of the iceberg. We are writing to UIAI to look into the matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cops-bust-gang-that-makes-aadhaar-card-with-fake-documents-3-held/articleshow/84954440.cms||Payal Dhawan

At an event to mark the completion of his five years in office, Rupani said he was carrying forward the work of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make Gujarat the “best state”. To mark the completion of his five years in office, Rupani launched a nine-day celebration on Sunday, saying that as part of these events, his government will unveil development works worth Rs 15,000 crore for the comprehensive development of people. On Sunday, the state government celebrated the ‘Gyanshakti Diwas’ as part of the nine-day programme. “People in the opposition and those living in the world of advertisements only talk. But, you must listen to the reality that in the last five years, more than three lakh students have left private schools to take admission in government schools,” Rupani said at an event of an education sector organised here. “It means the quality of our schools is improving. We are not doing publicity, but solid work,” he said, in an apparent dig at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP),which had criticised the Gujarat government over the condition of government schools in the state. “There are around 16,000 smart classes where the state government has created digital classes . More than 30,500 government primary, higher and secondary schools have been connected with the internet ,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/quality-of-education-in-govt-schools-improving-rupani/articleshow/84956795.cms||---

But, it is all about the trust between patient and doctor. At times, health infrastructure takes its toll on the patience of patients in the hour of crisis. Complaints are coming from the public and so the health minister has given specific instructions to the private players, which are representing the health department before the public,” said Dr Tripti Bahuguna, director general of health department. In Uttarakhand, the top three district hospitals in Tehri, Ramnagar and Pauri are currently under the private players. While the remaining are community health centre-level facilities. Similarly, all the private players involved in the construction of hospital and medical college buildings in Haridwar, Almora, Dehradun and US Nagar have been asked to follow the deadline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-hospitals-under-ppp-mode-given-a-month-to-prove-efficacy/articleshow/84954449.cms||---

The court also directed the authorities to process the petitioner’s application and re-issue passport to his daughter. The petitioner and his wife had adopted a girl child through the child welfare committee in 2015 by following the procedures after obtaining an order from the jurisdictional court. They applied for passport for the child which was issued in June 2016. Due to some misunderstanding, the marriage between the petitioner and his wife was dissolved and the child is presently residing with him. Since the child’s passport was to expire in May, he submitted an application seeking to re-issue the passport. That was when the RPO sent a letter summoning him for inquiry and asking to surrender his daughter’s passport as he had suppressed the fact that she was adopted while making the earlier application. Challenging the letter, the petitioner filed the present petition before HC Madurai bench. Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that proper procedure was followed during the adoption. “By virtue of this birth certificate, the parents will have to be treated almost like natural parents and thereafter, it is not necessary for the parents to keep announcing to the world that they are the adoptive parents of the child,” observed the judge. The judge observed that no one has complained till now that the parents are acting against the welfare of the child. The regional passport officer need not have taken pains to inquire into the issue of welfare of the child and it was enough if he had been confined to scrutinizing the records before him. The judge observed that in the absence of a column in the application to declare whether the child is a natural or an adopted child, it cannot be said that the parents had suppressed the fact that the child was adopted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-orders-rpo-to-reissue-passport-to-adopted-child/articleshow/84956808.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Meanwhile, the body of a crew member, Baljindar Singh, was identified this week after the second round of DNA sample matching. The body will be handed over to the family that hails from Punjab within a day or two. During the cyclone on May 17, while 186 crew members were rescued, 71 died and eight are still missing. The Indian warships, INS Kolkata and INS Kochi had rescued the survivors.  The police have so far handed over 68 bodies, all crew of barge P305, to their respective families. DNA testing helped in identifying most of the bodies. While two of the unidentified bodies at the mortuary are believed to be of the barge crew, the rest had been sent to JJ Hospital from Raigad where they were found at different shores. The Yellow Gate police had registered two separate cases against Rakesh Ballav, the late captain of barge P305, the owner of Tug Varaprada and several others. The tug had also sank on May 17 with 11 crew members. The police had arrested three employees of barge P305. “Six office- bearers of barge P305 and Tug Varaprada, have applied for anticipatory bail.

The board of the AMC revealed this information in a written reply to an RTI query. Alpesh Bhavsar, an RTI activist, filed a 11-point RTI application with the municipal school board in June this year, seeking to know how many high-tech schools had been set up since the 2014-15 academic session. He was informed that no high-tech school has been made by the AMC’s school board since 2014-15. Bhavsar also sought to know what new facilities had been made available in the schools, whether these were constructed at existing facilities or at new places, and how many of these were English-medium schools. “I also asked for the details of the funds that the state government has allotted since 2014 for making these high-tech schools. I was told that the information is not available as the schools have not been made,” he said. “At a time when the government pats itself on its back for improving education, the reality is that not a single smart school has been made by the AMC school board since 2014.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-new-smart-school-since-2014-amc-school-board/articleshow/84956857.cms||---

Martin Montrique Mansoor had filed a criminal appeal before HC Madurai bench challenging the conviction and sentence awarded by the Madurai mahila court. During the pendency of the appeal, he filed a miscellaneous petition seeking suspension of sentence.The prosecution case is that Martin was pursuing his postdoctoral studies in a college at Srivilliputhur. He and his girlfriend Cecile Denise Acosta, 36, also a Mexican, had a daughter named Adele. Acosta was learning Mohiniyattom at Kerala Kalamandalam in Thrissur. Due to a dispute over the child’s custody, Martin murdered Acosta on April 9, 2012 at Srivilliputhur. He wrapped the body in a travel bag, took it in his car to Madurai and burnt it. In an attempt to cover up the murder, he had also lodged a woman missing complaint at Krishnankoil police station a few days later stating that his girlfriend Acosta was missing.Subsequently, Austinpatti police in Madurai arrested Martin in the murder case based on a vital piece of evidence — the spare part of his car found at the place where he disposed of Acosta’s body.A division bench of Justices K Kalyanasundaram and B Pugalendhi observed that though the trial court had relied on the recovery of the gearbox of the car from the place of occurrence, a prosecution witness had stated that the part would be available in all cars belonging to the brand. The judges said that the police have also found certain tyre marks from the place where the body was found. These tyre marks were taken for analysis and the expert opined that the tyre mark impressions did not tally with those of Martin’s car. This opinion also raises certain doubts in fixing Martin as accused.Since the petitioner has made certain arguable points in his favour, the judges said that the court is inclined to suspend the sentence and directed that Martin be enlarged on bail. The judges directed him to appear before the Madurai mahila court on the first working day of every month until further orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-suspends-mexicans-life-term-in-girlfriend-murder-case/articleshow/84956851.cms||---
---||Nagpur||MVA govt avoiding decision on OBC quota: Fadnavis||Nagpur: Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis has once again hit out at the MVA regime over OBC quota in local bodies, saying that the government appears to avoid a decision on the matter till next elections. This comes after state government has filed a petition in Supreme Court on Saturday seeking that it should direct the Centre on providing empirical data on OBC quota issue. Fadnavis said, “It seems that the state government is merely buying time. They have the right to go to the supreme court, but the empirical data can be collected within the state itself in the next three to four months through a survey,” he said. He was speaking to the media at the sidelines of a function by Karnataka Milk Federation which launched its production in the region on Sunday. The Centre has already intimated the state about the difficulties related to impurities in the data. Due to it the data could not be submitted to the Rohini Commission on OBCs. However, instead of gathering the data, the state has moved the Supreme Court. If the state still does not act on collecting the empirical data on the OBCs it is clear that the state is not interested in granting quota, said Fadnavis. The government only seems to be creating an impression that the ball is in the Centre’s court and the Centre is not acting. If the state government really has the will, the reservation can be granted at its level,” he said. The Centre can only furnish data on basis of census. The court needs political empirical data on the subject for which the state government will have to make efforts, he said. However, states civil supplies minister and NCP leader Chagan Bhujbal has earlier said that even Fadnavis had written to the Centre on the data but did not get a favourable response. Fadnavis also said it is time that state government should ease Covid restrictions. It should be freed at least in the districts like where cases have come down to a minimal level. Fadnavis said that even discrimination between essential and non-essential services should be done away with. The ban is already killing the businesses and government has no scheme to aid the small businesses hit due to the lockdown, said Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mva-govt-avoiding-decision-on-obc-quota-fadnavis/articleshow/84956879.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Ludhiana||MC to install UID number plates with QR code outside properties||Ludhiana: After scrapping its previous similar scheme, the civic body is now planning to install smart UID (unique identity) plates outside the city properties. The last project had proved a failure as the company could not cover all the properties. The smart UID plate will have a QR code for all information about the property. The new project is being taken up under the smart city mission and is in the tendering process. The municipal corporation officials said after scanning the QR code from plates outside the properties, employees would be able to check property tax, water and sewerage dues and get information about the unit owner(s). They claimed that the last project remained unsuccessful because people were asked to pay Rs 110 for the plate, but this time expenses will be borne by the smart city mission. The civic body has made UID numbers compulsory for all blocks of the city. Earlier when plates could not be installed outside all properties, the MC employees wrote the UID numbers manually. According to a geographic information system (GIS) survey conducted by the MC officials with the help of Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC), there are more than four lakh properties in 37 blocks. The installation of UID number plates was proposed in 2014, but could kick off from block 26 in Model Town on June 23, 2017, and remained at low pace with only 25,000 houses covered by the private firm so far. The areas like Model Town, Model Gram, Shastri Nagar, Pakhowal Road, Ghumar Mandi, Gurdev Nagar, Rishi Nagar, Kitchlu Nagar, Maya Nagar, Maharaj Nagar, Sarabha Nagar and BRS Nagar have been covered. Requesting anonymity, an official said the slow pace of the project made them end the contract with that firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-to-install-uid-number-plates-with-qr-code-outside-properties/articleshow/84954476.cms||---

The incident took place when he was trying to cross the river in the Gasku region along the Indo-Nepal border to enter India illegally. A search operation for his rescue was launched by the locals of his native Malghat village of Nepal but in vain. Following the incident, the villagers blamed the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel deployed along the border and said that the man could be saved had the SSB been more active. Thereafter, the functionaries of the Nepal Communist Party staged a protest against India in Darchula (Nepal). The district administration of Darchula even sent a letter to the Pithoragarh administration seeking a response on the death of Jai Singh Dhami. Meanwhile, Anand Swaroop, DM Pithoragarh, told TOI, "The man was using a wire to cross the river. When he saw the SSB guards, he got tangled in the wire in panic and was then swept away.

---||Bengaluru||Covid positivity rate in 10 districts more than Karnataka average||BENGALURU: Ten of the 30 districts in Karnataka have reported Covid-19 test positivity rate that is above the state average of nearly 1.4% over the past seven days (July 25 to July 31). Dakshina Kannada has topped the state with 5.6%, followed by Chikkamagaluru above 4.8% Eight of the 10 districts have reported a positivity rate of more than 2%. Experts have suggested stringent measures like weekend and night curfews in these districts to contain the spread of Covid-19. These include Kodagu (4.7%), Udupi (4.3%), Hassan (2.7%) and Shivamogga (2.3%). Fifteen districts have a reported test positivity rate of less than 1% during the seven-day period. Bengaluru Urban’s test positivity rate was 0.8%. On Saturday, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai held a video conference with deputy commissioners from the districts. Districts must ramp up Covid testing: ExpertMore cases are being seen, mainly in border districts. We must watch out. Restrictions have to be imposed. Night and weekend curfews and preventing crowding need to be done ,” said Dr V Ravi, virologist and member of Covid technical advisory committee. Experts have raised concerns over the gradual inching up of effective reproduction number (R rate) towards 1. The R rate in Karnataka was 0.88 on July 28. It may be recalled that R rate was 0.85 on February 12 and neared 2 in May when the second wave of the Covid-19 hit a peak. Effective reproductive number is the number of people who can be infected by an individual. “This is a way towards an impending outbreak. Once the effective reproduction number crosses 1, we see a spurt in cases. If we don’t curb the surge now, we will see another wave,” said Dr Giridhar R Babu, epidemiologist and member of Covid technical advisory committee. “If we continue the expanded vaccination coverage, hospitalisation requirement will be less even if there are more cases,” he said, adding the areas with low serological prevalence are better taken care of with strengthening of testing and early management of cases, along with efforts made to vaccinate all eligible persons against Covid. Dr Babu suggested that the need is to bring in restrictions and prevent more people from attending closed-door events . Districts with a test positivity rate of more than 2% should implement strict containment measures and increase testing, an expert said. Though the spike in cases is seen in coastal Karnataka, the districts bordering Maharashtra too should be on guard. “In Bidar and Belagavi, we must not wait for the test positivity rate to touch 2% and then bring in curbs,” said experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-vity-rate-in-10-dists-more-than-ktaka-average/articleshow/84961091.cms||Sunitha Rao R

AIADMK leaders Edappadi K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam said in a statement that the party would join hands with farmers to protest if the government goes ahead with the move. Later in the day, PWD minister E V Velu maintained that the claims regarding Pennycuick were baseless and the library would be established at the designated site. The AIADMK leaders said DMK has a history of functioning arbitrarily by installing statues for themselves and removing Thirukkural couplets from government buses. Col Pennycuick constructed Mullaperiyar dam which is the lifeline of five southern districts. Hence, preserving the house that he lived in is the duty of the government. They slammed district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar for his statement saying there was no evidence to say that Col Pennycuick lived in the house which houses the PWD complex. Aneesh Sekhar had on Friday said the bhoomi puja for the existing PWD building was conducted in 1912 and it was completed in 1913. However, Pennycuick was born on January 15, 1841 and died on March 9, 1911. EPS and OPS said the farmers’ claims about the coat stand used by Pennycuick and culvert saying ``Periyar House’’ written in English had made late chief minister M Karunanidhi unveil the statue of Pennycuick at the complex on June 15, 2000. PMK leader Dr S Ramadoss said the government should drop the move and instead declare the house in which Pennycuick is said to have resided as a heritage structure. There are many more suitable sites for the establishment of the library, they have said. Minisyter E V Velu said, ``EPS and OPS are trying to purposely stall the establishment of the Kalaignar memorial library through their baseless claims. They are the people who destroyed the Anna Library established by the DMK government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/aiadmk-pmk-dont-raze-pwd-bldg-for-kalaignar-library/articleshow/84956861.cms||---

Clean-up marshals also routinely visit the site and those throwing food or waste into the lake are penalised. However, a few locals rued that the fountains had gone kaput. Civic officials blamed it on anti-social elements, saying they had tampered with the wiring. “These are water aerators which maintain the oxygen levels, thus keeping the lake clean and ensuring there is no algae formation on the top. Unfortunately, the wiring had been stolen. The BMC is now planning to get it in order,” said local corporator Asif Zakaria. “We go on a weekly basis as a group to clean the area around the water body. The area is cleaner now as compared to a few weeks back when we started. We are glad the BMC has taken cognisance of the cleanliness initiative by locals and acted accordingly,” said Gauri Kulkarni, who lives near the lake and has been actively involved in the cleanliness drive. Apart from the clean-up marshals, the BMC has also deployed security guards at the site. Between 2016 and 2019, the BMC had carried out several beautification works along the lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bandra-talao-gets-revamp-thanks-to-bmc-locals/articleshow/84958949.cms||Richa Pinto

Except for Hero MotoCorp, all the other automakers reported strong numbers in July, as companies such as Maruti, Hyundai, Tata Motors and Toyota remain optimistic about demand over the coming months even as there still remains uncertainty over Covid and a possible third wave. Maruti Suzuki, the country’s biggest carmaker, reported a 37% growth in deliveries to dealerships at 1.3 lakh unitsagainst nearly 98,000 units in the same month last year. The company has a huge backlog of bookings that is understood to be at over 1.5 lakh cars. Maruti is now quickly ramping up production to meet demand. While the second wave of coronavirus — during the past few months — has had a bigger impact on life and livelihoods, auto companies are hoping for a quicker turnaround in demand as need for personal mobility goes up due to advisories on social distancing. Also, there has been pent-up demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/car-sales-remain-buoyant-in-july/articleshow/84961133.cms||---

But in all cases, the schools concerned claimed to have received no official order. Delhi government had announced that it was taking over Swami Sivanand Memorial School in Punjabi Bagh on June 26 on allegations of it arbitrarily charging extra fees. However, K Ashok Rao, general secretary, Swami Sivananda Memorial Institute, the trust that runs the school told TOI, “On June 26, there were media reports, and it is August 2 already, we have not yet received the official order. Like any other person, I have also only read the media reports, and nothing has happened. I have no clue.” Similarly, Bal Bharati, Rohini, against which the takeover order was issued on July 29, was also awaiting the official order. According to the statement issued by the government, the school did not abide by the order of the department on an arbitrary fee hike. The authorities at Bal Bharati confirmed that they had not received any order. Even the parents’ association of the school pointed out that the school management had not received any communication from the government. Apeejay School, Sheikh Sarai against whom the government has decided to issue show-cause notice for takeover, said we have received no formal notice from the government. All our actions and fees charged are as per the orders of the Hon. High Court of Delhi and we are shocked at the prejudicial and incorrect statements made by the Delhi government while the matter is sub judice and especially during Covid-19. Our parents and students will remain unaffected and we continue our excellent virtual education in partnership with them. On July 16, the department had ordered the closure of SD Public School, Kirti Nagar from August 1. The order had been issued for violation of land norms, changing the trust’s ownership without approval from the education department. It added that the school was functioning without recognition since November 29, 2017. However, the school, run by Shree Sanatan Dharam Sabha, has filed a writ, which is listed for hearing on August 4. Meanwhile, the government said, “The due step process for the same is being followed, as per the rule of law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/yet-to-receive-official-order-on-takeover-claim-schools/articleshow/85032553.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Dehradun||Hoteliers, traders demand opening of Char Dham Yatra||Mussoorie: Representatives of Uttarakhand hotel association, Mussoorie hotel association and local traders' body have demanded that the state government should immediately start the Char Dham Yatra. Addressing media persons on Sunday, the hoteliers said that dhaba owners, lodge owners, shopkeepers, pony wallahs, hoteliers and several others in the tourism business in the hills are dependent on the yatra. “Char Dham yatra is the lifeline of the hills and a majority of the population is financially dependent on the yatra. The government should take steps to start the yatra to bring the economy back on track,” said Sandeep Sahni, president of the hotel association of Uttarakhand. Sahni also mentioned that opening of yatra was also important to retain the large number of migrants who have returned to the state during the pandemic. “Tourism could be an important source of livelihood for the migrants who have come back to their roots. We should prevent them from migrating out again,” Sahni added. Similar sentiments were expressed by Rajat Aggarwal, president of traders' association of Mussoorie. Aggarwal said that the small and medium traders had been the worst sufferers. “Shopkeepers and traders did not get any relief from the government. So, considering their plight, the government should immediately restart the Char Dham Yatra,” Aggarwal added. Notably, the high court had stopped the state government from holding the yatra. To this, the tourism industry representatives said that the matter should be "aggressively taken up in the Supreme Court to seek relief".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hoteliers-traders-demand-opening-of-char-dham-yatra/articleshow/84954551.cms||Anmol Jain

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Backstage hands of theatre script second act of careers||MUMBAI: Last Sunday, Sandeep Nagarkar — a make-up pro for Gujarati and Marathi theatre productions — spent his morning putting finishing touches on the heroes of ‘Sonnets of Susegad’. Except that this title celebrating the Goan art of contentment wasn’t one for the stage. The 46-year-old had swapped his make-up brushes and palette for knives and spatulas to dress up the Goan food fare he has been rustling up every weekend in his kitchen, as a crutch to survive the Covid blackout. It’s been 16 months since the world of theatre productions and live entertainment has been on hold because of the coronavirus. While many onstage artistes reimagined their art through digital platforms, stagehands — the invisible crew of more than 700 set designers, sound operators, make-up artistes, lightmen and ushers whose livelihoods depend on per-show income — are still out of work. “I was working on five Marathi plays when the lockdown happened. I thought it was a matter of weeks, but it turned out to be never ending. Theatre has been my life since I was 13 when I lost both my parents and started assisting a neighbour who was a freelance make-up man. Who’s going to give me a new job at 46?” rues Nagarkar, worried about being too young to retire, but old enough to face challenges in finding a new job. “If theatres open up, I will return but I need to keep my home kitchen running. The future is too uncertain.” When soundstages went dark Abhilesh Sarpadwal rushed to the warehouse unplugging speakers, mixers and putting his entire sound equipment into hibernation. He, too, went into hibernation until he found refuge in his two-wheeler that he turned into a bike taxi to pick up and drop commuters when not delivering food and documents for them. “With trains shut, people who need to travel find my bike safer than a cab,” says the sound operator who was in the midst of touring with two Marathi plays Ashrunchi Zali Phule and Majhi Maay Saraswati when Covid pulled the plug. “Thirty shows got cancelled, including a US tour. It was going to be my first trip abroad,” says the 32-year-old who retreated to his hometown in Ratnagiri to farm and returned in December when theatres reopened. “But people were too scared to resume,” says Sarpadwal. Working long, odd hours closely together behind the scenes, stagehands often see their co-workers as family and have generously offered to act as conduits for each other during this time. So, Nagarkar’s Goan food rides pillion on Sarpadwal’s bike every Sunday. “I need delivery orders and he needs someone to ferry the food he’s selling. That’s how we help each other out,” explained Sarpadwal. Known to never let a crisis get them down, the larger theatre community, too, has come together to take care of their own with a response group called Theatre Dost. Made up of artistes and backstage unions like Rangmanch Kamgaar Sangh and Marathi Natya Vyavasthapak Sangh, the team has been dealing directly with appeals for help apart from verifying information, doing voice-overs for communications and maintaining accounts for the ration kits, medicines and support with hospitalisation. “Many theatrewalas have turned to other ways of making ends meet. Theatre Dost has begun making this information available on social media. We hope the list will become more comprehensive so that it can be made available on a website,” read their newsletter this month. “Collating and putting out creatives about backstage workers who have found different ways to survive is a gesture to encourage others. In the future, we may organise monthly flea bazaars for them,” said actor and director Sapan Saran of Tamaasha. Vishal Kembulkar, 36, who had graduated from being an usher to backstage technician at the Acharya Atre Rang Mandir in Kalyan West is grateful for the help as he finds himself outside the auditorium gates, selling traditional earthen pottery. Stagehands like Bapu Sawal, 49 were attracted to this work because they didn’t feel like they fit in traditional jobs. “And despite the physical labour or long cue to dress up a set or play a filler role just for a roar from the audience was a reward in itself... Theatre ke bina mar jayenge,” rues Sawal who after two decades of working in theatre has now turned entrepreneur selling kokum, coconut oil, malvani masala from his village in Sindhudurg and is skeptical if people will want to spend time in crowded theatres, even if life slowly returns to normal. No one knows for certain when the curtain will lift, but most agree their lives will look different.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-backstage-hands-of-theatre-script-second-act-of-careers/articleshow/84959103.cms||Mohua Das
---||Kolhapur||Boatman a hero after rescuing thousands during multiple floods||Kolhapur: Nitin Gurav is a celebrity to thousands of residents in the villages and towns along the 30km stretch of the Krishna river — from Nagthane to Kasbe Digraj. Videos and photographs of his heroic flood rescue efforts are now part of many social media statuses and profiles. And why not? Afterall, he has saved thousands of lives during successive floods in the Krishna river. During the 2019 floods, he had rescued over 2,500 residents along this stretch of the river all alone. This year, he had his student Gajanan and NDRF teams along with him. This time, he has already rescued more than 1,000 residents. Nitin Gurav, who is now in his 40s, operates a boat to ferry devotees seeking darshan at the famous Dutta temple at Audumbar in Palus tehsil. “Earlier, my uncle ferried the devotees to the temple using a rowboat for over 60 years. I took up the task in the early 1990s using a similar boat. But in recent years, I have started using motorboats to ferry devotees from villages along the river which have no road route to reach Audumbar. I rescued many people for the first time during the 2005 floods. In 2019, I was the only one to operate in this stretch. Then, I helped the authorities recover the bodies of people who had drowned after a boat had overturned at Bhramhnal village. This time, due to better awareness, many people had already left before the place got flooded. I also helped the authorities get the water supply to towns and villages by wading through flooded water with technicians. I got them to inaccessible places to get the pumps removed, motors repaired and electricity connections restored.”Every person in the Nagthane to Kasbe Digraj stretch has Nitin’s phone number saved. Many residents had started sharing with him the photographs and videos of the Krishna river flooding in their locality. The gram panchayat of Bhilawadi, a village near Audumbar, has offered Nitin and Gajanan jobs. Since the start of the pandemic and successive floods, Nitin and his student Gajanan’s income has dropped. The temple remains shut and the turnout of devotees, who pay them as per their will for ferrying them to the temple, has also reduced. Rest of the year, Gajanan trains at the Sangli Boat Club. Pruthviraj Patil, the deputy sarpanch of Bhilawadi, said, “We have made a proposal to them to work in the gram panchayat. We are ready to pay them Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per month. We can avail of their boat service during the monsoon. We are waiting for their response.”After the 2019 floods, Nitin was given honour of hoisting the Tricolour during the Independence Day celebrations by the Bhilawadi gram panchayat. This time too, Nitin is getting calls from several gram panchayat’s to be their special guest on August 15.Abhijeet Chaudhary, Sangli collector, said: “We were immensely benefitted by the task undertaken by Nitin Gurav. After the 2019 floods, we felicitated him and had given him the task to train youths from nearby villages to operate the boats. He has become an indispensable part of our disaster management team.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/boatman-a-hero-after-rescuing-thousands-during-multiple-floods/articleshow/84952509.cms||---

They had purchased expensive gadgets. We wrote to the company and the delivery of the products was put on hold. Following the proper process, the company returned the money and the order of the accused was cancelled.”“It is a request to the residents to never share their bank account, credit card and debit card details with any caller.

Still, existing restrictions will continue in the district from Monday for one week as the state government is yet to issue orders for relaxations. Guardian minister Nitin Raut told TOI that government is positive above allowing more relaxations and the order is likely to be issued on Monday. On July 29, health minister Rajesh Tope had announced decision of the state task force to relax restrictions in 25 of 35 districts in the state where weekly TPR was very less. All 11 districts of Vidarbha are among the 25 districts. As per Tope, timings of all commercial activities will increase from 4pm to 8pm. Timings of restaurants are likely to be extended up to 10pm. But the government did not issue any orders in the last four days. The officials from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and collector office said that existing restrictions will automatically continue from Monday. “We did not issue fresh orders as earlier order mentioned about continuation in case of no change from the government. We will come up with new order in case government makes any changes,” they said. As per data of district civil surgeon, the district’s weekly TPR was 0.13% in the fourth week (July 22-28) and 0.15% in the third week. Weekly TPR is below 5% for the last nine weeks and below 1% for last seven weeks. Still, shops are allowed to remain open only till 4pm. Restaurants and non-essential shops are not permissible on weekends. Many activities are yet to resume.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/weekly-tpr-further-drops-in-july-last-week-still-curbs-stay/articleshow/84957001.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Ludhiana||Pro-Khalistan slogans painted on Ludhiana-Chandigarh NH||Ludhiana: Some unidentified miscreants allegedly wrote pro-Khalistan slogans at many spots on the Ludhiana-Chandigarh National Highway near Samrala. The messages, apparently written recently, drew the attention of people on Sunday, while the police are probing the matter.Sources said miscreants have painted slogans like ‘Kisan Hal Khalistan (solution to farmers’ problems is creation of Khalistan) and ‘Referendum 2020 Khalistan’ at three places—near Neelon, Samrala Bypass and Chehlan on the Ludhiana-Chandigarh Road. They said slogans have been written with red ink to incite the farmers protesting against the farm laws.Jagdev Singh, a resident of Neelon Colony, said such slogans were painted in the area earlier as well and then erased by the police. He said these ones have probably been painted about four days ago and they don’t know who wrote them.Meanwhile, a leader of the Shiva Sena condemned the incident and sought action. Punjab Youth Shiv Sena president Raman Kumar Badera said he was on his way to Ludhiana when he saw the slogans and it seemed to be the handiwork of those who want to create a wedge between Hindus and Sikhs. He requested the Khanna SSP to take action against the accused. Farmers don’t demand Khalistan, and such elements shouldn’t create hurdles in their agitation, he added.Samrala DSP Harwinder Singh said they were probing the matter, would book unidentified persons, and also get the slogans erased. Police officials said that it appeared to be the work of those who want to disturb peace in Punjab.By evening, the slogans were blackened at Neelon bridge.Farmers organizations said such issues were not on their agenda.A farmer leader said, “We have been tagged as Khalistanis and Maoists, but our agenda is to fight against the farm laws. Those who don’t want our agitation to succeed are using such tactics to defeat our struggle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/pro-khalistan-slogans-painted-on-ludhiana-chandigarh-nh/articleshow/84954648.cms||---
---||Dehradun||U’khand mulls population control bill & land law||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand government will set up separate committees to look into the feasibility of rolling out a population control law and a land law in the Himalayan state. A top source told TOI that chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has said that the government will form committees to look into population control and a land law to restrict outsiders from buying land in the state. The move comes after the state government was urged to look into the possibility of introducing a Population Control Act during a recent coordination meeting held in Dehradun, which was attended by BJP's national general secretary (organisation) B L Santosh and senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders. BJP ruled states have witnessed a push for population control policies in the recent past. The Uttar Pradesh government has come up with a draft of the Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill. TURNS HERE The Assam government has also said that it will bring a population control law to debar people with more than two children from getting government benefits. The Uttarakhand government is also considering bringing a strict law, demand for which has been growing among residents. Earlier this month, several youngsters had taken to social media to demand land laws and protesters had also gathered outside the state assembly on July 18. In 2003, an amendment was made to the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reform Act 1950 by the ND Tiwari government to prevent outsiders from buying more than 500 square metres of agricultural land in Uttarakhand. In 2007, BJP chief minister B C Khanduri reduced the area of land that could be bought in the state by the outsiders to 250 square metres. In 2018, however, the Trivendra Singh Rawat government set aside the 2003 amendment, paving the way for outsiders to buy any amount of land in the hill state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-mulls-population-control-bill-land-law/articleshow/84954676.cms||Gaurav Talwar

At 14.3 of 100 persons, SAS Nagar has the highest number of fully vaccinated residents, followed by Hoshiarpur (11.5), Pathankot (10.1) and Jalandhar (9.8). In Mansa, just 2.8 per 100 persons have received both the doses.With 34.7 per 100 persons having received the first jab, Ludhiana is at fifth position in the state on the parameter. SAS Nagar has administered first dose to 64.1 out of 100 persons, Hoshiarpur 44.1 and Pathankot 36.8. Mansa has the lowest of 15.8 per 100 persons having received the first dose.In Punjab, 26.4 per 100 persons have received the first shot and 6.5 per 100 second.The health department officials said the number of persons vaccinated per 100 eligible ones would have given the real picture.District immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Puneet Juneja said they have done 15 lakh vaccinations, of which 12.25 lakh persons have got the first dose and around 2.98 lakh have received both the doses. “We have to vaccinate around 26 lakh eligible persons (above 18 years old) in the district. The number of vaccinated persons per 100 eligible ones is the proper way to calculate the data,” he added. “The number of those who have received both the doses is less in Ludhiana. The authorities should step up vaccination drive and go door-to-door. However, inadequate vaccine supply is also affecting the drive,” said former president of Ludhiana Indian Medical Association Dr Sunil Katyal.Till July 15, seven per 100 persons in the district were fully vaccinated and 32.7 of 100 persons had received the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/8-8-per-100-fully-vaccinated-34-7-got-first-dose/articleshow/84954678.cms||Shariq Majeed

The teenager was first raped at a room belonging to a railway coolie at Timki, and later inside an autorickshaw in front of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH). Four persons, all rickshaw drivers, have been arrested so far by Government Railway Police (GRP) and Sitabuldi police station. This is the second time the teenager, who is learnt to be mentally challenged and a school dropout after Standard VII, has been raped after leaving home in the last two years. Police have identified the arrested persons as Mohd Shahnawaz alias Sana (25), Mohd Touseef (26), Mohd Musheer (23) and Mohd Naushad (24). GRP, which conducted the preliminary investigation, had rounded up Sana, Touseef and Musheer before handing them over to Sitabuldi police, which registered the FIR in the case on Sunday. Naushad was nabbed by Sitabuldi police. Names of two railway coolies too have come to fore for having exploited her along with Sana and Touseef. It’s learnt the teenager had left home on July 29 following a dispute with family. She had taken a rickshaw, asking the driver to take her to Civil Lines. The driver forced her to get off after learning she did not have any cash. The teenager had then approached Sana and Touseef, who had taken her to the room of a railway coolie at Timki. Sana, Tauseef and two coolies had exploited her at the room at Timki. They left after handing her over to Mushir and another man near IGGMCH. Mushir and the other man raped the girl in turns inside an autorickshaw before fleeing from the spot. The teenager was spotted by two other autorickshaw drivers, who offered to help on seeing her loitering alone in dishevelled condition, and took her to Nagpur railway station. They had collected Rs1,000 and also purchased a ticket for her to reach Manmad, as she wanted to go there. The two autorickshaw drivers left the place after trying to console her. The teenager was then spotted by Railway Protection Force (RPF) staffers, who handed her over to an NGO. RPF and the NGO later handed her to over GRP, who sent the girl to a shelter home. It was at the shelter home that she revealed that she was gang-raped. Senior inspector Manisha Kashid of GRP said the girl’s statement was recorded and immediately three persons were rounded up and handed over to Sitabuldi police station. Sitabuldi police have registered a case of gang rape and also invoked Atrocity Act against the perpetrators. Four-year-old reunited with family Nagpur: Police patrolling helped a four-year-old girl, rescued by Yashodhara Nagar police station, to be reunited with her family. During a three-hour foot patrolling under Zonal DCP Lohit Matani, the girl's family at Shanti Nagar approached a patrolling cop in their locality, seeking help to locate the child who had left home and did not return. The cops were able to immediately traced the girl to Yashodhara Nagar police station.

Even after almost seven months of the launch of the vaccination drive, close to 65% of the target population is yet to receive a minimum one dose. Besides, only 1.71 lakh eligible beneficiaries from municipal limits of Aurangabad have been fully vaccinated having received both doses, which comes to be 14.5% of the total target population of 11.77 lakh. Amid speculations of the possible third wave of Covid-19 and further relaxations being mooted by the state government, stakeholders have stressed the need for giving an official boost to the ongoing immunization programme. Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel said the Centre should focus more on ensuring sufficient supply of vaccines instead of allegedly engaging in loud propaganda of vaccination drive using hoardings, banners and advertisements. “Even Maharashtra at large currently has the low vaccination coverage in general. It is a serious issue and the government should not be taking lives of people for granted,” he said. When contacted, health officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Dr Neeta Padalkar said the momentum of Covid vaccination drive depends upon the supply of doses from the government. “The vaccination plans charted out by us for city of Aurangabad are very citizen-friendly. The vaccine stock made available in batches is utilised to its fullest without keeping any balance,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/65-adults-yet-to-get-at-least-single-vaccine-dose-in-aurangabad/articleshow/84952550.cms||Prasad Joshi

Waluj police have registered maximum seven offences against hotels under its jurisdiction for operating beyond permissible 50% seating capacity on July 30. The hotels concerned were located in Jikthan T-point, Isirwadi T-point and the Kamlapur T-point area and were allegedly witnessing crowding in violation of laid down rules. Satara police have booked two hotel owners from the Kanchanwadi area for operating without carrying out mandatory Covid testing for staffers on July 31.

The fire department employees rescued over 4,000 residents, over 150 critically ill patients from the submerged hospitals and 22 Covid patients from Covid care centres. Though six NDRF teams had reached the district, most of them were stationed along the upper stretches, in flood-affected villages and in Shirol. Durig the 2019 floods, an NDRF team had led the rescue efforts. Ranjit Chile, the chief fire officer of KMC, said, “We did not let the residents feel the absence of the NDRF personnel. Our firefighters swung into action. We had some challenging moments as well. Rescuing critical patients from two multi-speciality hospitals was a tough task. Most of the patients were on oxygen support. However, there were no casualties during the rescue operations.” “The need to shift the Covid patients came as surprise to us. However, since most of our firemen were anyway involved in Covid-related works, they had a clear idea on how to save patients on oxygen support. Also, our personnel had their masks. Bt they did not have PPE kits,” he added. The firefighters deployed to evacuate were fully vaccinated, which boosted their confidence. The firemen are being trained to carry out rescue works in various types of disasters. They are mostly involved in fire disasters for the rest of the year. This year, the firefighters saved a person from drowning in the flooded Panchaganga river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-firefighters-help-rescue-over-4000-citizens/articleshow/84952558.cms||---

In 2018, Suraj Kalav was arrested in a cheating case and in jail, he met Sunil Angane, who was behind bars in an MCOCA case for allegedly extorting money from a builder on behalf of a gangster. Kalav told Angane he could help him get early bail. In April 2020, when Kalav was released on bail, Angane told his family to give him money for his early release. Between May 2020 and April 2021, Kalav took Rs 93 lakh claiming that he was in talks with police and court staff to ensure the bail. But when Kalav stopped taking their calls, th-ey lodged a complaint.

---||Dehradun||Mussoorie's 30% water supply affected, locals blame under construction Thatyur-Kempty road||Mussoorie: Since the past week landslides at under construction Thatyur-Kempty road have damaged the pipelines at Jincy Springs resulting in impairing at least 30% of the town's water supply. A few kilometres away, residents of Kolti village are complaining of their houses being threatened due to landslides caused by the constant road digging activity. "Earlier, two pipelines that carried water from the springs to the pumping station were damaged. Now, the main pipeline through which water is pumped up to the reservoir in Mussoorie is damaged owing to landslides at the site where road digging work has been carried out," said Trepan Rawat, assistant engineer of Garhwal Jal Sansthan. Jal Santhan officials claimed that 30% water supply to the town has been affected owing to the pipeline damaged by landslides resulting in water shortages in parts of the town. “Impairing the supply of essential drinking water to the town due to the construction of a road is just not acceptable. If corrective measures are not taken by the administration the Jincy Springs may come under threat,” said Hugh Gantzer, a member of the Supreme Court monitoring committee. Notably, in the past, TOI had cautioned against the possible damage to Jincy Springs owing to the construction of this motor road that is aligned to pass through the spring. Taking cognisance of the report, Garhwal commissioner Ravinath Raman had directed the district magistrate of Tehri Garhwal to consider possibilities for changing the road's alignment. Meanwhile, residents of Kolti village a few km from Jincy, claimed that at least six houses were under threat. “The rocks below our houses have been dug up for the road. And now incessant rains are triggering landslides and posing a risk to our houses. At least 60 people reside in these six houses,” said Gambir Singh, a resident of Kolti village. Sanjay Nawani, assistant engineer of the Public Works Department, told TOI, “We would look into the matter and ensure adequate protection of the houses. Also, efforts are on to clear the debris due to landslides at Jincy while changes in the road alignment are being considered."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mussoories-30-water-supply-affected-locals-blame-under-construction-thatyur-kempty-road/articleshow/84954744.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Goa||‘Mark buffer zone around heritage sites in 3 months’||Panaji: Heritage lovers have set a three-month deadline for the state government to mark protected areas and buffer zones around heritage sites on all planning maps like the regional plan. At a public meeting in St Cajetan’s church complex on Sunday, it was also demanded that an illegal construction in the heritage area next to Largo de St Cajetan at Old Goa be demolished immediately. Santosh Tari, a lawyer from Ponda said that since the ASI permission only covers repair of the existing structure, this building is completely illegal. Fr Bolmax Pereira said that there was only a 50m storage place at the site but it has turned into a 600 sq m house. Architect Poonam Varma, national coordinator for risk preparedness of heritage sites from International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), an advisory body to Unesco, said buffer zones around monuments are needed to absorb water and vibrations. New constructions add to environmental hazards and carbon footprint. She pointed out how many buildings in Panaji and it's surroundings (including Old Goa) are abandoned, which should first be renovated and reused instead of allowing new constructions, she said. Architect Lester Silveira said that monuments at Old Goa like St Cajetan were built by Goan artisans and workers and were a blend of traditional art and architecture with a western influence. Peter Viegas, coordinator of Save Old Goa committee, said that a memorandum had been given to all 40 MLAs but none had raised the issue of Old Goa heritage problems in the assembly. Two youth —Pritesh Patil and Sabira Shaikh—also spoke on the issue. Earlier, youth from various parts held a peaceful march to raise awareness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mark-buffer-zone-around-heritage-sites-in-3-months/articleshow/84959215.cms||---

Fearing the building would collapse anytime soon, they immediately gathered whatever they could and evacuated their homes. A resident of Anand Palace building, which is located in camp number 5 and has 16 flats and two shops, said around 8.30am some of them noticed the cracks in the structure and immediately alerted the rest. On learning about the incident, local NCP corporator Bharat Gangotri rushed to the spot and called the fire brigade as well as the ward officer of Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation. “The residents suspect that construction work at an adjoining plot caused the cracks to develop in their building,” he told TOI. Assistant municipal commissioner of UMC Ganesh Shimpi said they had sealed the building. “After residents vacated the building of their own accord, we sealed it, because it is unsafe for occupation now as the pillars and structure have developed cracks.” Anand Palace was not on the list of dangerous buildings. “The building was constructed in 1994-1996, which saw a spate of construction activity in the city using inferior Ulwe sand. This has led to buildings or parts of structures collapsing,” said UMC PRO, Dr Yuvraj Bhadane. “Residents were offered accommodation in community halls, but they have chosen to move in with relatives and friends,” he added. In the last three months, 12 persons have died and four injured after portions of two buildings collapsed, while three other buildings were vacated after some portions crashed. The state government recently formed a committee to resolve technical problems related to regularisation of illegal buildings in the city and the committee is expected to submit its report soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/residents-vacate-ulhasnagar-bldg-after-it-develops-cracks/articleshow/84959197.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Goa||Goa’s ecological balance needs community-based governance||Wild pigs and monkeys are the talk of the day. Goa’s CM is pondering on declaring wild pigs as vermin, while orchard owners are asserting that monkeys too are a pest. These are two of the many animals involved in the humongous human-wildlife conflict haunting the Indian countryside, a conflict in which thousands of people are killed each year and losses of property run to tens of thousands of crores. The roots of this problem go back more than a thousand years with the conquest of Britain by William the Conqueror in 1066. He parcelled England’s land among a handful of feudal Lords. These Lords enclosed the village commons, impoverishing the peasantry. All humans, barring rare exceptions, have indulged in hunting since our species originated as group hunters three lakh years ago. Nonetheless, the domineering British Lords reserved hunting for themselves branding peasants hunting to fill their bellies as poachers and summarily hanging them. The fallout of these authoritarian measures was that Britain’s forests and wildlife were wiped out by the 14th century. When the British became Lords of India they were intent on looting its resources. Their tool in this plunder was the forest department, an agency created to confiscate the tree wealth nurtured by our farmers and forest-dwellers by taking over community lands. The result mirrored what had happened in Britain and India’s forest wealth was rapidly depleted by the end of 19th century. Goa was spared this fate under the Portuguese rule. The Portuguese also tried to dismantle community control, but since this led to serious loss of agricultural production and revenue, they permitted its continuance. So, Goa retained its green mantle till the end of Portuguese rule in 1961. On being integrated into the Indian Union the new regime has consistently attempted to take power away from people and dismantle comunidades triggering an erosion of Goa’s natural heritage. The foresters with their colonial legacy stepped into Goa clear cutting natural forests to raise exotic tree plantations. With the promulgation of Wildlife Protection Act in 1972 the entire countryside came in the foresters’ grip with farmers and forest-dwellers becoming victims of conflict with wildlife. Goans too are suffering with wild pigs, monkeys and gaur the major problem species inflicting huge losses of crops and livestock. India’s Wildlife Protection Act is unique in the world; no other country bans hunting outside national parks and game reserves. Sweden abounds in wildlife, it treats it as a renewable resource utilising it through properly regulated hunting. As our bizarre law stands people are not free to defend themselves against marauding animals as even driving them out of their homes and crop fields needs official permission and if they so much as injure a wild pig while defending their crops they are liable to be prosecuted as criminals. Yet the Indian Penal Code, sections 100 and 103 sanction voluntarily causing of death or other harm to the wrong-doer if an assault by the wrong-doer may reasonably cause the apprehension that it will lead to death or grievous hurt or if the wrong-doer is committing house or property trespass or robbery. Wild pigs and gaur have on occasion killed people, wild pigs, gaur and monkeys regularly trespass on farmers’ properties and rob him of his produce. Evidently an Act rigidly protecting the wild animals is constitutionally invalid. Goans should surely raise this issue through a PIL. Foresters, intent on harassing farmers using the weapon of wildlife protection are sorely neglecting their own far more important function of safeguarding national parks. Mollem National Park is threatened by a railway line cutting a swathe through it. It is the people who are protesting and going to court to save Mollem while the foresters are standing by mutely. We must therefore hand back the charge of safeguarding nature to the people of Goa, a responsibility they had discharged so well till 1961. However while reviving community governance, we must reform the institutions to rid them of the inequities of India’s caste society. That brings to my mind memories of my good friend Fr Bismarck Dias. He was the president of his comunidade and many believe that he lost his life attempting to defend its property from encroachment by real estate sharks. He often talked to me of the need to democratise the institution and create a model for the revival of community-based governance throughout the country. I hope that Goa will lead the way with such a progressive move.

---||Nagpur||33 years of unblemished service with over 300 rewards, zero reprimands||NAGPUR: Senior inspector Vijay Akot of Beltarodi police station, who retired after 33 years of service on Saturday, bagged some 318 rewards without facing any inquiry, reprimand or disciplinary action. Among the exploits of this former Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) officer was unearthing the plans of nine ISI-trained terrorists, who were about to launch an attack in Mumbai and Aurangabad with poisonous substances and explosives. Akot, who had driven the police station’s driver home on his last working day last month, got a grand farewell from his staffers too. The staffers used official vehicles to create a ‘convoy’ for him with bike-borne commandos acting as ‘pilots’ to take him from Beltarodi police station to his residence at Subhedar Layout. This was a satisfying end to the career of the wrestler (pehelwan)-turned-cop from Akola, who had joined the department as constable in 1988 after getting inspired by stories from police magazine ‘Dakshata’. While serving as constable, he had studied hard to clear MPSC examination to become a sub-inspector and came to serve in Nagpur. “It was during my service as sub-inspector at Sakkardara between 1996-2000 that I bagged almost 100 rewards,” said Akot, who also worked as in-charge of Dhantoli and Beltarodi police stations in city and also at Shegaon. Naik police constable Prashant Sonulkar of Beltarodi police station said Akot was a senior who was ever supportive and encouraging. “Tension mat le, main hoon na!’ (Don’t take tension, am there), was what he always said to us,” said Sonulkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/33-years-of-unblemished-service-with-over-300-rewards-zero-reprimands/articleshow/84957119.cms||Soumitra Bose

This will ensure speedy repair and restoration of supply for 3crore electricity consumers in a crisis situation. The drone cameras will fly at a height of 50 metres and can fly upto 15km for an hour on a single battery charge. The drones are equipped with ultra HD cameras which can take high resolution close-up photographs and videos of the towers and their components. The constant video recording allows better assessment of faults in the existing lines, he said.  “Using drones can slash costs for maintenance and reduce losses from outages,” a senior MSETCL official said. He added that drones had potential to revolutionise the way we inspect our power lines and transmission towers. “It allows aerial surveillance which is more efficient than manual survey of power lines. It will help to detect defects at the incipient stage in transmission lines,” he stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-drones-to-keep-check-on-faults-in-power-lines-across-state/articleshow/84959230.cms||Somit Sen

During questioning, the suspected persons identified themselves as natives of Barpeta district of Assam. After procuring their basic details, police have now contacted Assam state police and are trying to verify their names, addresses, their relatives and other information related to them. To recall, with the arrest of two Al-Qaeda terrorists in the state capital (Lucknow) by the ATS, several startling revelations had come to fore during investigations and their strings were found to be connected to Kanpur. Investigators have come across suspects living in Panki and other areas of Kanpur South. Subsequently, the police launched a massive drive to zero-in on Rohingyas and Bangladeshis and their activities. Police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun had directed his subordinates to launch a verification campaign of foreign nationals living in the city in order to nail down the anti-national elements, if any. During the investigation, the police were asked to identify suspected people besides verifying their identity cards. The drive yielded results after the South City police zeroed in on 16 suspects in Machariya area of Naubasta and other nearby pockets. “During the identification drive, the suspects showed the investigators their Aadhar cards and other documents that had a mention of their addresses in Barpeta district of Assam,” said a senior police official. The police commissioner said on the basis of the documents, the Assam police was contacted to get their credentials cross-checked. “If their documents are found to be fake, action will be initiated against them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/after-zeroing-in-on-rohingyas-bangladeshis-police-find-16-suspects-living-in-various-pockets-in-south-city-areas/articleshow/84957150.cms||---

Fr Dennis Gonsalves, ABE secretary communicated to its schools via a letter dated July 19, 2021, that there will be no increment in any of the unaided schools run by the ABE. Teachers said that last year they missed out on increments due to the pandemic. This is in addition to the salary cut several schools have imposed, said a teacher. The ABE letter stated that though the fixation of the salary will be done whenever increment is given but it will not include arrears. Similarly for teachers retiring before the increment is given, his/her increment will be counted only for the gratuity purpose. “We had to buy laptops, mobiles, and internet connectivity to conduct online classes. Our travel has reduced but our workload has doubled,” said a primary school teacher.

---||Nagpur||Soyabean prices at record high, but after most farmers emptied stock||Nagpur: Soyabean prices are at an all-time high. The average rate is Rs9,500 a quintal, which is more than double the minimum support price (MSP) for the crop. The MSP is at over Rs3,900. Even as the prices have also touched Rs10,000 in some markets of the country, there is not much to gain, say farmers in Vidarbha. Soyabean is the second major crop of the region. Initially, total yield was estimated at 135 lakh quintals in 2020 Kharif season. The actual production was down by around 35 lakh quintals. This led to the increase in prices, finally touching Rs9,500 to Rs10,000 a quintal in the wholesale markets. There are questions if this has benefited the farmers too. Traders said that there has been a gradual increase in the prices. There was a major jump from May but by that time most of the farmers had cleared the stock. Traders said by the time prices reached a record high it was too late majority of the region’s farmers. However, farmers and traders also say that there is a section of growers who have held on to the produce and are now booking profits. Sudhir Kothari, a director in an agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC) in Hinganghat, said majority of the farmers in the area sold soyabean when the prices were in the range of Rs4000 to Rs5,100 a quintal. “The real profit was made by the traders,” he said. In Hinganghat, Kothari said, farmers are still bringing some stock, but that’s minimal. The AMPC yard at Hinganghat is getting around 400 sacks a day, which is not much. In Kalamna APMC yard, which is dubbed as Asia’s biggest in terms of area, the soyabean supply was reported to be much lower. Atul Senad of the Dhanya Bazar said that not more than 100 bags of soyabean have reached the market. “This means that the farmers are not left with much stock,” he said. Vallabh Deshmukh, a director in Mahabeej, a state government corporation producing seeds, said that there are farmers who are left with a small portion of the produce. It may be around 2 to 4 bags. “The forward rates of soyabean are over Rs6,400 for November 2021. This means there is a scope for getting better rates in the coming harvest too. Farmers should take utmost care of the crop so that they get better yield and can take advantage of the prices in coming season,” he said. Anup Chavan, a farmer from Bod Bodhan village in Yavatmal, said that he sold soyabean for only Rs3,000 a quintal. Another farmer said there was no stock left with him Lalit Mahalle from Akola and a member of Shetkari Sanghathana said that it’s wrong to say that only traders have benefited. “Farmers also understand market dynamics and plan accordingly. They still have soyabean left with them in our area,” he said. If individual farmers may have not benefited, there are some farmer producers organizations (FPOs) that have been able to capitalize on the boom, said a commodity market expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/soyabean-prices-at-record-high-but-after-most-farmers-emptied-stock/articleshow/84957258.cms||Shishir Arya

Both of them study in the same school, Vivekanand Vidya Mandir, which is located in the hill town of Munsiyari. Rana’s father is a truck driver while Singh’s father is a peasant. Rana told TOI that it was difficult to prepare for the exams. “There were network issues and my brother and I had to share a smartphone as he was preparing for UBSE class XII exams. He scored around 98% while I scored a perfect 100. I am fond of computer science and aim to become a software engineer,” the 16-year-old boy said. Speaking to TOI, Rana’s father Hayat Singh Rana said, “I never expected that my son would score a perfect 100. I am proud of him that despite financial hardships, especially due to Covid, he performed so well. I hardly used to be at home since I am constantly busy with my travelling schedule, yet he followed his study routine punctually.” When asked about his son's future, he replied, “I hardly know anything about the formal sector jobs since I am not that educated. He will take the best decision possible.” The other topper, Hoshiyar Singh, told TOI, “Obviously, there were financial issues. My father had to take care of my two other siblings. He always encouraged us to study, though. There were network issues, but I focused more on reading from the books instead of being completely dependent on WhatsApp notes. In future, I aim to become an IAS officer,” Hoshiyar Singh said. School principal Navin Chandra Sharma told TOI that both the students have been consistent performers. Apart from Rana and Singh, Haridwar girl Shivi Tyagi also scored 100% in the UBSE class X board exams. This year, three students scored 100% in class X while there were no students with perfect 100 in class XII boards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/children-of-truck-driver-farmer-top-ubse-class-x-exams/articleshow/84954785.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Delhi||EDMC okays 710 posts for mosquito checkers||New Delhi: East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) in its standing committee approved a proposal for creating posts for 710 domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) and decided to forward the same to Delhi government for allocating a budget and taking a final decision. The civic body said the workers could be regularised only after the approval of the lieutenant governor and Delhi government. The proposal referred to the correspondence with Union finance ministry with the former South Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor in 2019, which clearly stated that no restriction on creation of new posts in A, B and C groups had been imposed and these could be created with approval of the LG. “The final approval has to be given by the LG, but since it’s a financial matter, and the budget for paying salaries are provided by Delhi government under the plan head, its approval is necessary and only it will send the proposal to LG,” said an EDMC official The standing committee chairman, Bir Singh Panwar, said since the budget for payment of salaries for their newly created DBC posts should be sourced by Delhi government, EDMC public health department had been asked to process and take up the issue with it. “DBCs have played a prominent role for decades and we can’t ignore their contribution. They have been working on a temporary basis, conducting house to house surveys to check mosquitoes breeding, besides creating public awareness about vector-borne diseases like dengue, malaria, and chikungunya. They even played significant roles during the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. The proposal passed in the committee stated that SDMC had already sent a proposal to Delhi government for creating 1,350 posts of DBCs and allocating budget for their salaries at the minimum pay scale specified by the government. “They have been working with us since 1992 on a temporary basis. Initially, they were engaged for 4-5 months, but since 2010-11, they have been working for an entire year. It is important to regularise them,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-okays-710-posts-for-mosquito-checkers/articleshow/84957281.cms||Vibha Sharma

We have already spoken with the urban development minister on this matter and will make a fresh appeal,” said BMC board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty on Sunday. Civic officials said that a fresh proposal on allowing an additional floor in residential houses across Salt Lake will need to be drafted. As per the present floor area ratio (FAR), the plots measuring below four cottahs in the township allow only two-storey buildings to be constructed while a maximum of G+3 building can be set up on the plots measuring above four cottahs, along with the provision to have only one additional room and one extra toilet only, said a BMC building department official. Officials said that a proposal had been made earlier for allowing the construction of additional floors but it was not approved for different reasons. “It was way back in 2010 that a draft proposal had been made by the civic body and the state urban development department had even allowed an extra floor in Salt Lake houses. Later, Bidhannagar Municipality had turned down the matter, stating that it would severely put pressure on the township’s sewerage and drainage system. The drainage and sewerage network has now been upgraded to withstand the pressure of extra floors,” said a BMC official. Previously, the Bidhannagar Municipality had allowed the residents to construct an additional room and an attached bathroom. “In 2007, it was incorporated in the building rules of the civic body to allow a watchman’s room and a toilet in the houses on the parking floor and allow the same at the roof in those houses, which did not have any parking floor,” said a BMC official. Bidhannagar Municipality became a municipal corporation in 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/civic-body-to-make-extra-floor-appeal-for-salt-lake-houses/articleshow/84957302.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Mumbai||Can AI speed up disposal of cases? Verdict awaited||MUMBAI: The Supreme Court recently unveiled a tool named SUPACE (Supreme Court Portal for Assistance in Court Efficiency), an Artificial Intelligence-based portal to assist judges with research. Make no mistake, it is not designed to take a decision, only to process facts and provide inputs to enable decision-making by judges. But it has opened up a debate of sorts on how much AI can be used to dispense justice. “The core job of a judge is judging. That cannot be outsourced,’’ said former Supreme Court judge B N Srikrishna. Nuances of judging a person’s state of mind are beyond a bot, said jurists. Senior counsel Amit Desai added that AI could be used in cases of a repetitive nature that fit a strict pattern such as bouncing of cheques, civil violations or drunk driving. “Judicial work cannot be handed over to a machine, even one with AI or programmed to read and understand law,” said Justice Srikrishna. But pre-judicial work, such as case management, random allocation of matters to benches, case-law indexing and analysis, administrative work linked to a court can lean on AI to streamline and reduce pendency, he added. Other legal experts concur. “Judging involves human emotions too. No scientific tool has any moral issue attached to it,” said Justice Srikrishna who helmed the study for India’s data protection policy. “AI has not been programmed to delve into human emotions.” AI as a tool to judge matters is “debatable” agreed, senior counsel Amit Desai. But he said it could be used in “summary trials, strict liability cases and cases of a repetitive nature like negotiable instrument (cheque bouncing) prosecutions, since AI has abilities to identify fact patterns easily and compare them with precedents.” Even “traffic violations and drunken driving cases or some civic violations can be dealt with by AI.” The former Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde, in his opening remarks after becoming CJI, had spoken of bringing AI into the system. Desai adds, “However matters involving judging the state of mind ( mens rea ) and cases of complex fact patterns are matters best left to human judging since justice also includes the human element of discretion. But in such cases as a tool to collate and analysis case law it will be very useful. It will have enormous use at the administrative level and significantly reduce time lines in justice delivery." Justice Madan Lokur, former Supreme Court Judge who headed the e-committee for six years prior to his retirement in 2018, say there are several question that first need to be asked and then answered including, “the big question. what is it that is sought to be achieved via AI?’’ He says, “It cannot be to dispense with Judges and Judging. Especially not in criminal case, AI can never replace Judges.’’ Last year during the ongoing Covid pandemic, SC Justice D Y Chandrachud who heads the SC e-committee had said virtual or online hearing of matters via VC is a way Judiciary telling citizens it values their time. At the launch of e-projects of Kerala high court, Justice Chandrachud had suggested using AI and the Integrated criminal justice system to translate contents of FIRs from a local language to the court language. Hence, thought there is a new tool in town, but the buzz around AI to dispense justice is still a buzz and won’t dispense with Justices, said jurists. In the US: AI in the US Judicial system is used by some county courts for visual or facial recognition to sign into court systems. A report of March 2020 by the Joint Technology Committee in the US called, “introduction to AI for Courts’ speaks of use of ‘Natural language processing (NLP) used by various digital assistant in a “conversational interface to extract meaning from human speech.’’ The applications like chatbots may be a result then. “The New Jersey court’s chat bot leverages AI to respond to increasingly complex questions,’’ said the JTC report. It adds there could be application of ‘symbolic AI’ which “closely reflects classic legal reasoning’’ in two steps; write down all rules, then apply relevant rules to facts to find a solution. Legal navigator websites in Florida and Colorado are leaning on them for senior citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-can-ai-speed-up-disposal-of-cases-verdict-awaited/articleshow/84959302.cms||Swati Deshpande

During the day, the highest flow was 24,034 cusecs around 10am. Generally, a warning is issued when the river crosses 204.5m and preparations are made to relocate people living on the floodplain. According to officials, over 100 families living on the floodplain had been moved to higher areas over the last few days. Water levels have been known to touch 207 metres in the recent past too. The highest-ever water level recorded in the Yamuna was 207.49 metres in 1978. Just a few weeks ago, on July 12, DJB had stated that the river level had been recorded at the lowest since 1965. On Friday, the administration had sounded a flood alert and expedited efforts to evacuate people from vulnerable areas when the river breached the danger mark of 205.33 metres amid heavy rain in the upper catchment areas. On Friday, the Yamuna had breached the danger mark and had swollen to 205.59 metres by 9pm. It had receded to 204.89 metres on Saturday evening. Announcements using loudspeakers were being made to warn residents not to go near the swollen Yamuna and keep children and animals away from the river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/yamuna-stays-below-danger-mark-flow-from-hathnikund-also-down/articleshow/84957379.cms||---
---||Goa||Sandesh Jhingan likely to quit ATK Mohun Bagan to realise European dream||Panaji: Sandesh Jhingan is weighing up options in Europe and is likely to quit ATK Mohun Bagan this season. The India defender joined ATK Mohun Bagan last season and has been their pillar of strength in defence. Alongside Spanish defender Tiri, Jhingan formed a rock-solid partnership that took the club to the doorstep of the Indian Super League (ISL) title. That partnership, however, is likely to be dismantled as Jhingan seeks a new challenge in Europe. According to sources, India’s Footballer of the Year has offers from clubs in Austria, Croatia and Greece. The 28-year-old defender always wanted to test himself in Europe. Sources said his contract with ATK Mohun Bagan has a clause that allows him to make a move, if a foreign club comes calling. “Jhingan has two definite offers. He wants to give European football a try. Right now, he’s talking to ATK Mohun Bagan to see what’s best for everyone involved,” said one source who has tracked this development. Significantly, while ATK Mohun Bagan started pre-season in Kolkata last week, Jhingan has stayed away. The team is preparing for the AFC Cup later this month and the absence of their star defender could be a major blow. Jhingan has come a long way since being voted Emerging Player of the Year in 2014. He has worked his way up to become national coach Igor Stimac’s most trusted man in defence. “Sandesh is twice as better today than two years ago. He is one of the best, defensively speaking, centre-backs in Asia at the moment, but now working hard on his passing. He can become the best one in Asia,” Stimac said last month. Jhingan picked up an ACL injury while doing duty for India in a friendly against NorthEast United in 2019. He was forced to miss the entire 2019-20 season. When he was fit enough to resume duty, Covid-19 delayed his comeback. He returned to the field in November last year after being out of competitive action for 13 months and won the Footballer of the Year award.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sandesh-jhingan-likely-to-quit-atk-mohun-bagan-to-realise-european-dream/articleshow/84987493.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Radhanagari dam gate closes as level drops following scant rainfall||KOLHAPUR: As the water level in the Radhanagari dam started to drop with scanty rainfall in its catchment areas, one of the gates of the dam, which was open for more than 18 hours, was finally shut. The moderate rain in the ghat sections of Kolhapur district had led to an increase in the water level of the Radhanagari dam. One of the six gates automatically opened as the water level increased. Earlier, 1,400 cusec of water was being discharged through the powerhouse spillway of the dam, but after the gate opened, the total discharge increased to 2,800 cusec. However, as the water level of the dam started to recede due to a decline in the rain and thereby inflow into the dam, the gate was closed automatically. Samrat Kerkar, an environment activist based in Radhanagari said, “The gates will continue to open and shut as and when the water level increase or decrease respectively. The rain in the ghat sections led to a huge draining of water into the dams. However, Sunday witnessed no heavy rain. The minuscule discharge will not cause an increase in the water levels of river or flooding. The Panchaganga river may swell if all gates open as happened recently.” The dam is currently 98.68% full. All gates start opening after the dam of 8.36 TMC attains 99% capacity. Meanwhile, the Panchaganga river was flowing at 32.11 feet on Sunday evening, which is below the warning level of 39 feet at Rajaram Barrage. Six barrages — Shingnapur, Rajaram, Surve, Rui, Ichalkaranji Terwad and Shirol along Panchganga river — are still submerged and closed for traffic. The minor dams — Kadvi, Jangamhatti, Ghatprabha and Jambre from Kolhapur district — continue to be filled 100%. Due to the continuous discharge and less inflow, the water level from dams such as Koyna, Dhom, Kaner in Satara district and Chandoli in Sangli district is continuously receding. The discharge from Koyna and Chandoli dams was 46,000 cusec and 8,700 cusec, respectively. The water level of the Krishna river has been reduced to 32ft by Sunday evening. Meanwhile chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will visit the flood affected villages and towns of Sangli district on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/radhanagari-dam-gate-closes-as-level-drops-following-scant-rainfall/articleshow/84952818.cms||---
---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Motorists warned as part of bridge in Ratnagiri crumbles||NAVI MUMBAI: Motorists have been advised to drive cautiously on two conjoined British-era bridges over Vashishti river on Mumbai-Goa highway in Ratnagiri. The bridges were closed for vehicular movement for six days owing to floods, and traffic movement was allowed only from last Friday. A 15-metre long portion of the conjoined bridges on the island located over the river was washed away at Chiplun in Ratnagiri. The PWD national highway division is conducting an underwater investigation of the bridge piers through a private agency. The two bridges were built in 1943 by the British. Each bridge is about 73.20-metre long and 7-metre wide. Two new bridges are under construction as part of the Mumbai-Goa highway widening work. “For the first time, flood water level crossed the 9-metre height last week, washing away a portion of the conjoined bridges. This was restored within 48 hours by using boulders and concrete. The bridges were shut for traffic on July 21 in anticipation of heavy rain,” said R R Marathe, deputy engineer Ratnagiri section of PWD-national highway division. “An underwater investigation of piers is being conducted through an independent consultant, but technicians are facing the challenge of heavy water current and turbid water of the Vashishti,” added Marathe. “The damage was noticed on July 23 after water level receded. Light vehicle movement was restored first followed by heavy vehicles,” said Salim Shaikh, executive engineer Ratnagiri section of PWD-national highway division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-motorists-warned-as-part-of-bridge-in-ratnagiri-crumbles/articleshow/84959311.cms||Umesh K Parida

They have called for immediate stoppage of works being carried out on the road leading to the Chicalim panchayat. The villagers held a peaceful protest on Saturday evening. Members of the VDC said that they were shocked to see several trees bulldozed and buried in the earth fill and added that the illegality has been carried out in an alleged private forest area identified by the state-level expert committee (Thomas and Araujo Committee). There was no signboard providing any information of the works carried out and other details. Member of Chicalim panchayat road safety committee Edwin Mascarenhas pointed out that the present work carried out in close vicinity and adjacent to Prabhu Realtor’s project and also adjoining the upcoming Shantilal Builders project is totally beyond the scope of the PWD. Member of the Chicalim panchayat supervisory committee and chairperson of the biodiversity heritage site committee of the Chicalim biodiversity management committee, Cyril Fernandes, questioned the nature of works carried out with public funds. Fernandes said that the Mormugao Planning and Development Authority had not only failed to respond to the complaints, it did not even inquire into these illegalities. Ex-sarpanch of the Chicalim panchayat and present VDC member, Pratap Mardolkar has threatened that the villagers will take up this issue with higher authorities and the vigilance department to demand action against all PWD officials involved in misusing public money for private entities in such a manner. The local parish priest Fr Bolmax Pereira appealed to the villagers to remain united and not succumb to pressure tactics of the politicians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chicalim-locals-say-illegal-road-widening-done-for-private-parties/articleshow/84959358.cms||Ruvina Khan
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Elusive whale washed onto Bakkhali beach||KOLKATA: An elusive species of whale washed ashore onto Bakkhali beach in South 24 Parganas, taking the local fishermen and foresters by surprise early on Sunday morning. Later, the whale — 5.3-metre long — was identified as a Cuvier’s beaked whale — only the fifth record from India and probably the longest of these five records. State’s chief wildlife warden V K Yadav said that they have taken the carcass for post mortem to the local range office. “We spoke to an ecologist studying marine cetaceans in India, Dipani Sutaria, and she has identified it as a Cuvier’s beaked whale. We will be doing genetic analysis of the species through ZSI,” Yadav added. Sutaria, also a member of Marine Mammal Research and Conservation Network of India, confirmed that it’s a female Cuvier’s beaked whale. “Since they are deep-diving cetaceans, highly dependent on sonar for navigation and catching prey, they are sensitive towards sounds of seismic survey and naval exercises. They are considered elusive since they spend most time in waters deeper than 500-1,000m,” she added. Earlier records of the whale are from Maharashtra in 2019, Gujarat in 2015, Tamil Nadu in 2014 and Lakshadweep in 1982. Divisional forest officer of South 24 Parganas forest division Milan Mondal said that they spotted the carcass around 6.30 in the morning. “We initially thought it to be a Gangetic dolphin. Its length is 5.3 metres. We have initiated the post mortem to find out more details. There was no external injury marks,” he said. As per Marine Mammal Research and Conservation Network of India records, a Cuvier’s beaked whale may grow to a length of 7.5m and weigh three tons. “But, weights of 5.6 tons for males and 6.5 tons for females have been reported. They are rarely found near the coast. They feed on squid, deep-water fish, crabs and starfish. The species has stranded in Sri Lanka and Pakistan. In Sri Lanka, it has been found in fishermen’s catches also. Sightings of the species have been made off the coasts of Sri Lanka and Oman. They are widely distributed, being found in all but the highest latitudes in all oceans,” said the data. On being asked about the reason for death, an official said that it can be natural, the weather and even deep-sea fishing-related activities. “The post-mortem should also find out if there is fishing net or plastic in its stomach,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/elusive-whale-washed-onto-bakkhali-beach/articleshow/84957333.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

This was revealed in the latest statistics obtained from sources in the state transport department on Monday. “Registrations of vehicles have for the first time shown an upward trend during the pandemic and surpassed pre-Covid figures,” said a senior RTO official. Also, the registrations last month were 104% higher than those in July 2020. The statistics showed the city with four RTOs had registered a total 20,135 vehicles between July 1 and 31, 2021. By comparison, new vehicles registered in July 2019 totalled 17,608 and in July 2020, 9,860. The most registrations last month were in Borivli RTO, with 5,460 new vehicles. Own vehicles help citizens avoid crowds during CovidBorivli was followed by 5,414 new vehicles registered at Tardeo RTO in the island city in July. The statistics further showed a maximum number of electric vehicles were registered at Andheri RTO in the western suburbs, with 104 new electric cars and bikes hitting the roads last month. The maximum CNG cars and public transport vehicles were registered at Wadala RTO (524 vehicles) which covers the eastern suburbs. “This has happened in a month when the city was unlocked and there was demand for new vehicles,” said a transport official, adding the registration process was also expedited as there is a new online portal for dealers to register vehicles at their level, pay taxes and ensure speedy deliveries. Transport experts said the majority of buyers preferred personal vehicles to avoid public transport during a pandemic, and also as a “good form of social distancing”. There was availability of easy loan EMIs to purchase new vehicles. More than 60% of the vehicles sold in July were two-wheelers. A V Shenoy of Mumbai Mobility Forum said, “I agree that bikes are a convenience but many riders need to be disciplined.” Transport expert Ashok Datar said the growth of vehicles was alarming. “It is high time we promote AC buses.” The city has over 40 lakh vehicles—12 lakh cars and 24 lakh bikes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/14-more-vehicle-regns-in-july-over-same-mth-in-19/articleshow/84991308.cms||Somit Sen

Instead of removing the tram lines from Sealdah flyover, Kalighat bridge, Aurobindo Setu and RG Kar bridge as decided earlier, KMDA is now planing to keep the tram lines on the bridges by relaying the bridges surface and increasing the overall load taking capacity of the bridge super structures with retrofitting and strengthening work. Officials said a final decision will be taken once the detailed project reports on the repair and retrofitting work of the bridges are finalised. Following the Majerhat bridge collapse, the bridge expert committee constituted by the state government came up with recommendations to remove the old tram lines from bridges, including Sealdah flyover. “The earlier plan was to remove all tram lines from bridges. The authorities now want to keep the tram lines for future use by relaying the existing lines on the bridges surface during repairs. Trams could run on the bridges again if they are strengthened and their overall load taking capacity is increased. The agencies engaged by KMDA are preparing the DPR for repair work after which a final call could be taken, ” said a bridge expert. Among the bridges that have tram lines, KMDA is preparing DPRs for repair and strenghthening work of Sealdah flyover and Aurobindo Setu. KMDA is working on short term repairs of Kalighat bridge by strengthening its superstructure while the structural stability of RG Kar bridge has been found to be satisfactory so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tram-tracks-to-remain-on-kmda-bridges-flyovers/articleshow/84957369.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Meena and his supporters posted a series of videos and photos from the spot, standing alongside dilapidated ramparts, about 150 metres away from the main fort. A battery of worried cops soon arrived at the spot and took Meena to the Vidhyadhar Nagar police station. By the time Meena was brought to the police station, his supporters began gathering outside in large numbers and staged a dharna. They demanded Meena’s immediate release and refused to return. At about 1.30pm, Meena was let off by the city police. A gleeful Meena emerged from the police station, boasting about how he defied the “three-tier,” police security to fulfill his commitment of going to the hill fort. “I started my journey at around 2.30am. I travelled for 7km through rugged pathways in jungles and arrived at the area at 6.30am. I had nine supporters with me,” he said, adding that he had requested the Jaipur police not to remove the flag. Additional police commissioner, law and order, Rahul Prakash said that the crowd was “dispersed” under Section 129 (dispersal of assembly by use of civil force) of the CrPC. In a significant development in the evening, an FIR was filed against Meena at Transport Nagar police station. Prakash told TOI that the forest department had filed a complaint based on which an FIR was registered under sections 332 (whoever voluntarily causes hurt to any person being a public servant) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his or her duty) of the IPC, along with the relevant sections of prevention of damage to the public property Act. “Besides the FIR at the Transport Nagar police station, a second FIR was registered against one of the supporters for blocking the public road at JLN Marg,” Prakash said. The Jaipur police were caught off guard at the secret arrival of Meena, despite a heavy police bandobast circling the area. Officials suspect that the MP had trekked through small unguarded pathways from the Ghat ki Guni area to reach the hill fort. The police claimed that Meena had hoisted a flag on the ramparts, located in the outer area of the Amagarh fort. The fort, located on the city outskirts along the Jaipur-Agra NH, had become a flashpoint between two sections of the Meena community - one led by a Congress-backed independent MLA from Gangapur city, Ramkesh Meena, and another led by Kirori Lal and supported by Hindu outfits. The tension has been simmering over the historic fort for the past several weeks now. However, the dispute started after some boys from a different religious community allegedly vandalised idols in June and Hindu outfits later hoisted a huge saffron flag there in July. The flag was later removed in the presence of Ramkesh Meena on July 21. A video went viral on social media, invoking sharp reactions from several right-wing groups. Police had cordoned the area, claiming it to be forest property after several outfits exhorted people to assemble on Sunday. The two groups later lodged FIRs against each other at the Transport Nagar police station, albeit, against unnamed persons. Meanwhile, Narendra Purohit of Vishwa Hindu Mahasangh said that besides hoisting a flag that represented the Meena community, the MP could have also put up a saffron flag simultaneously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kirori-lal-defies-law-hoists-meena-flag-at-amagarh-fort/articleshow/84959350.cms||---

Hence, the hurry to connect Sealdah by the year-end. Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi said, “Sealdah is a suburban railway hub with eight to 10 lakh daily commuters in normal times. In post-Covid scenario, at least 40,000 people should avail East-West Metro, which can ferry them to Sector V station.” East-West Metro now runs a truncated 6.97km between Sector V and Phoolbagan. It will eventually cover 16km till Howrah Maidan. In fact, passenger dispersal is the foremost aim of Sealdah station, where the first train trial was conducted on Saturday, paving the way for the corridor’s 2.3km extension beyond Phoolbagan. GM Joshi, instrumental in ushering in this significant start, said: "The Sealdah linking is crucial, for the sake of the public and for revenue and footfall generation.” Sealdah will be the only among the seven (operational) stations to boast of a double-discharge platform. “There are two large access points, opening to different areas of the city. The passenger-dispersal system has been designed to minimize peak-hour congestion,” a senior official of Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation said. The two large access points – from Eastern Railway’s south-section where platform no. 15 ends, and another from Rajabazar side. Plus, a subway, now closed, but will open directly to the Metro station’s concourse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sealdah-stn-to-jack-up-e-w-footfall/articleshow/84957473.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The 14th century Tamil inscription speaks about the gift of land. Motupalli is an international port of the medieval period. Dr E Siva Nagi Reddy , an archaeologist, said, “It is curious to note that the Kakatiyas also issued inscriptions in Tamil along with Telugu in coastal Andhra and Telangana.” Siva Nagi Reddy and R Dasaratha Reddy, president, Motupalli Heritage Society, were documenting the dilapidated Kodandaramaswamy temple located on the outskirts of Motupalli. “The inscription is written in Tamil Grandha script, dated to 1st August, 1308 AD pertaining to reign of Kakatiya Pratapa Rudra,” they said. Pratapa Rudra had ruled between 1289 and 1323 AD. “The inscription speaks about the gift of land as Tiruvidaiyattam for providing offerings to the god Rajanarayanapperumal in Desi-uyyakondan-pattinam alias Mottuppalli for merit of the king,” said Siva Nagi Reddy. The date and content of the inscription has been confirmed by Dr K Muniratnam Reddy, director, epigraphy branch, Archaeological Survey of India, Mysuru, who deciphered 813 years old Tamil Grandha script and revealed its historical importance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tamil-inscription-from-kakatiya-era-found-in-medieval-ap-port-town/articleshow/84959219.cms||---

Cops recovered the body of the Maoist, in his twenties, along with a .303 rifle and two kit bags from encounter site. Expecting trouble during the ongoing Martyrs Week, which is observed by CPI (Maoists) every year, police have been on alert. Police said that the Maoists crossed over to state from the bordering Chhattisgarh to create trouble during the Martyr’s Week which will conclude on August 3. Police were yet to identity the deceased Maoist and have shared information with all police stations in the near by tribal areas as well as Chhattisgarh police.

---||Delhi||Before kite ritual on I-Day, whip cracked on Chinese manjha sellers in Delhi||NEW DELHI: A crackdown has been launched by police against people selling Chinese kite string (manjha) ahead of Independence Day as the tradition of flying kites is usually seen around this time. Last week, a 30-year-old man sustained grievous injuries after manjha got entangled in his neck while he was riding a two-wheeler in Shastri Park. Following the incident, raids were carried out by cops at various shops and manjha rolls seized. In the Walled City, police are carrying out regular checks and making announcements informing shopkeepers that strict action would be taken against those selling Chinese kite string. Similarly, on July 28, a 24-year-old man got wounded in his hands and throat after Chinese manjha got stuck in his neck while he was riding his motorcycle. When the man felt something on his throat, he used his hand to check. His fingers then got entangled in the string. Even this incident was reported from Shastri Park. On June 28, a 24-year-old woman was seriously injured after Chinese manjha slit her throat while she was riding a scooter in Shastri Park. DCP (Northeast) Sanjay Kumar Sain said, “We have been regularly carrying out raids, especially after the incident involving the woman was reported to us. Since then, we have registered four cases and arrested four individuals selling the banned manjha. Around 1,200 rolls of Chinese kite string have been seized. We have deployed several teams in uniform and civil clothes to keep a check on sellers.” In Central district, where the tradition of kite flying is usually practised during this period, police have been making regular announcements and warning shopkeepers of strict action. “We have been carrying out regular checks. If we receive complaints of people selling it clandestinely, we deploy teams in plainclothes to nab them,” said DCP (Central) Jasmeet Singh. The use of Chinese manjha is banned, but its illegal use kills several birds every year and injures many people. Activists have repeatedly argued that the ban is only on paper and no strict action is taken against users or dealers. Pradeep Ranjan Doley Barman, advocacy associate at PETA India, said, “Thousands of birds die every year when they’re cut or trapped by manjha, the string often made of cotton thread laced with glass, metal or sharp materials. This can get caught on trees or buildings and remain there for weeks. Many motorcyclists have lost their lives after getting their necks slashed by manjha.” “The ban permits flying kites only with cotton thread that is free of any materials designed to increase its sharpness or strength. Most people will choose cotton manjha if they know that doing so can spare fellow humans, birds and other animals from serious injury and death. We request Delhi Police to conduct frequentraids and book offenders under Environmental Protection Act, which provides punishment of up to five years of imprisonment, a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh, or both,” added Barman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/before-kite-ritual-on-i-day-whip-cracked-on-chinese-manjha-sellers/articleshow/84957444.cms||Sakshi Chand

His remarks came against the backdrop of Union minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi’s statement that cases of instant triple talaq had dropped by 80% since Muslim Women (Protection Of Rights On Marriage) Act was enacted and Centre’s plan to celebrate August 1 as “Muslim Women Rights Day” coinciding with anniversary of law’s enactment. “This law (triple talaq) is unconstitutional and has been challenged in the Supreme Court. It’s against equality and demonises Muslims. Would Modi government only celebrate Muslim Women (Rights) Day? What about the empowerment of Hindu, Dalit & OBC women?” questioned Owaisi This law would lead to more exploitation of Muslim women and add to their problems. Only cases would be registered and no justice delivered. Muslims have not accepted it on the ground, he said. The AIMIM president also hit out at the Modi-government over the Pegasus spyware issue. “Why is the BJP government which has 300 MPs of its own afraid of debating on Pegasus in Lok Sabha? What do you want to hide? The Opposition is willing to run Parliament but the BJP government does not want that. You only want to pass Bills with the brute majority you have. Is that Democracy? We are not getting a chance to put forth our views,” he said. Owaisi said the Opposition wanted a debate to seek justice for the families of people who died in the second wave of novel coronavirus in the country. “Why doesn’t the Modi government discuss this issue in Parliament and render justice to the families who lost their dear ones to Covid?” he asked||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/owaisi-slams-nda-govt-over-muslim-women-rights-day/articleshow/84959478.cms||Roushan Ali

The cabinet has recommended Kaushik’s name and sent it to governor Tamilisai Soundarajan for her approval. Kaushik quit Congress and joined the ruling TRS on July 21. He was Congress secretary and contested from the Huzurabad assembly constituency in the 2018 assembly elections against Eatala Rajender of TRS then, finishing runners up polling over 61,000 votes. Eatala has resigned from TRS and the MLA post and is seeking re-election from Huzurabad after joining BJP. With this, one of the seven vacancies of MLC seats would be filled up. The Election Commission needs to notify elections to the remaining six MLC vacancies as they have to be elected under the MLAs quota. However, the ruling TRS has more than required numbers and is likely to send its members uncontested. The opposition parties, Congress and BJP, do not have the numbers and are unlikely to contest. Kaushik is the cousin of former TPCC president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy. He had alleged that the new TPCC president, A Revanth Reddy, would end up finishing off Congress in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kaushik-reddy-to-be-appointed-mlc-under-guv-quota/articleshow/84959280.cms||---

Due to Covid-19-induced financial crisis in the last two years, the state was able to waive off loans up to only Rs 25,000 availed by farmers in the past. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said already three lakh farmers had benefited due to the waiver of crop loans up to Rs 25,000. With this decision, the number of farmers getting crop loan waiver would reach nine lakh. The crop loan waiver for farmers having loans of over Rs 50,000 and up to one lakh would also be done in a phased manner. The cabinet also reviewed the agriculture operations, including rains, crops, availability of irrigation water, fertilisers and other issues. Officials were told to motivate farmers to increase the cultivation of cotton crops. The CM said there was a good demand for Telangana cotton in international market. Farmers should be encouraged to cultivate commercial crops and an action plan would be prepared by the agriculture department for this. As much as 20% of the state’s revenues was from the agriculture sector, CM KCR said. The government has decided to take preventive steps to contain the spread of Covid-19. The cabinet directed officials to conduct field visits and conduct tests on a large scale in areas or districts where the caseload has shown an increase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-govt-to-deposit-crop-loan-waiver-amounts-from-aug-15/articleshow/84959195.cms||---

On Sunday, Rajbir Singh, a resident of Defence Colony in Ambala, lodged a complaint with the Jawaharnagar police stating that on July 31, he was informed by the staff of Army College of Dental Sciences that his daughter Sunanda Jangra, 25, a BDS IV year student at the college, committed suicide in her hostel room on the campus. Rajbir Singh, who reached the city, told police that his daughter had joined Army College of Dental Sciences in BDS course in 2016-2017. “My daughter was suffering from depression as she could not secure a seat in MBBS. She was treated by a psychiatrist and did well. Two days ago, the girl’s mother discussed with her about a marriage proposal and a day before that when she spoke over video call with us, she appeared fine,” the complainant said. On July 31, Sunanda ended her life in the hostel room by hanging herself from the fan with a sari. “The student’s father said his daughter may have committed suicide due to depression and, based on the complaint, we registered a case under CrPC Section 174 CrPC,” Jawaharnagar police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/army-dental-college-student-ends-life/articleshow/84959451.cms||---
---||Surat||Bakery owner again denied bail in hit-and-run case||Surat: Atul Vekariya, owner of the popular bakery chain Atul Bakery, was once again denied bail by a session court here. Vekariya, who is accused of running over a 29-year-old woman on Udhna Magdalla Road, has been in judicial custody since April. Vekariya filed his bail plea on June 24 on the grounds that the circumstances of the case have changed since police have filed chargesheet and allowing him bail will not affect the investigation. His plea also mentioned the technical aspects of the case and investigation.  Public prosecutor N L Sukhadwala argued that Vekariya had simply repeated the grounds and reasons which he had mentioned during his previous bail application and were rejected by the court. He also submitted before the court that Vekariya has sought bail because chargesheet was filed but whether the circumstances have changed because of that has not been proven. The court of principal district judge V K Vyas upheld Sukhadwala’s arguments and denied bail to Vekariya. The court also stated that although the Supreme Court has said that a person’s independence is important, society expects that a person uses their independence responsibly. “In this case, the accused, an affluent businessman, could not control himself nor his car as he was under the influence of alcohol and leaving a 35-foot road, he rammed his car into a food cart on the footpath, the woman and two vehicles and dragged her for 15 feet,” the court said. The court also noted that there is a strong prima facie case against Vekariya and he is an affluent person aligned with a political party while the victim’s brother who is a complainant and all other witnesses on whom the case relies on are all persons belonging to the middle class. “There is a strong possibility that if the accused is released on bail, he may contact the witnesses and try to weaken the prosecution’s case,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bakery-owner-again-denied-bail-in-hit-and-run-case/articleshow/84955092.cms||---

Visitors are already thronging to Ramappa following its designation as a world heritage site. This, even as officials are trying to rebuild ten sub-shrines within the temple complex. However, the temple dedicated to Shiva has almost become invisible to visitors as toddy trees have grown over the temple’s foundation, nearly covering it. The entrance of the sanctum sanctorum is also covered with snake mounds with many visitors staying away from the temple out of fear. The Kakatiyas had built ten temples around the main Ramappa Temple and all the ancient rock temples are built within a kilometre of the main temple. TOI, during its visit on Sunday, also observed that other areas around the temple are also being renovated. Among them is are around Bolla Gudi — a rock structure — which has been protected iron pipe fencing in 2019 during a previous visit by the ICOMOS to Ramappa Temple. However, the attention brought to the temple following the Unesco’s world heritage tag has also resulted in crowds at the site. It has been observed that Covid-19 norms such as social distancing are not being followed withing the temple premises while there was also no provisions for sanitizers. Endowment authorities said that tourists have been flowing in since the Unesco recognition last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sub-shrine-with-snake-infested-entrance-in-ramappa-complex-slated-for-rebuild/articleshow/84959353.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

Many of them admitted that they didn’t know how to take swabs, investigation officer Rajesh Sah told TOI, adding that the number of tests shown against each student was “highly exaggerated”. This comes just weeks after the director of Delphia labs — which had a tie-up with another lab allegedly involved in the forged Covid-19 tests — was held and sent to police custody. SIT had found that Delphia labs had provided staff to conduct tests and upload forged test reports on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal. While recording statements of the staff, SIT found that 34 of them were students of PM Skill Development Centre — who were hired on contract for a month. Trainer of the centre, Vandana Kumari, told TOI that the students had not received any training related to Covid testing. According to Sah, apart from these students, Delphia labs had hired 34 workers from Haryana. Nearly a lakh fake tests were conducted in Kumbh in April. In one instance, a single phone number was used to register over 50 people while one antigen test kit (which has an exclusive number and is meant for single use) was shown to have tested 700 samples. The SIT had found that Max Corporate Services, which was not ICMR approved, had signed an MoU with Nalwa labs and Dr Lalchandani labs to become eligible as one of the agencies tasked with conducting the tests in Kumbh by the state government. But when it came down to on-ground testing, Nalwa labs said it did not have sufficient manpower and signed another agreement with Delphia lab to provide staff to conduct the actual testing and uploading of reports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/conducted-few-covid-tests-didnt-know-how-to-take-swabs-workers-of-accused-lab-to-sit/articleshow/84954987.cms||MS Nawaz

Having transferred out of Gadchiroli in November last year, Ghodke may have joined the current posting at Jath police station in Sangli district, but his heart is still stuck in the last place of work at Zinganoor in Sironcha taluka where he had managed to forge a special rapport with the locals. Even while working in Sangli district, Ghodke had been meeting ministers and approaching his contacts in the bureaucracy pushing for the dam in south Gadchiroli. Being instrumental in repairing a bridge on nullah and erecting a makeshift public health centre clinic, Ghodke had won hearts in the tribal district through his philanthropic approach. The locals had not only showered their affection on him, but also become his shield too in the highly sensitive stretch with strong Maoist presence. In the area, considered highly dangerous for cops, Ghodke roams around in the forest and hamlets with the villagers, who had been his biggest support. Ghodke, who had even walked up to Maoist stronghold of Abhujmad on Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border along with villagers out of curiosity, said he is hopeful to see the dam coming up on the natural lake between two hills at Zinganoor and Wardeli. “There are natural barriers on three sides, but the lake has an outlet which joins it with Kalled nullah. Substantial quantity of water is wasted. If a weir is built and the flow is curtailed and re-directed, then it would have enough water to support agriculture in five villages (Zinganoor, Wardeli, Mangigudam, Loha and Yedselli),” said Ghodke. “The dam will have enough water to support two crops in a year,” he adds. Ghodke claimed to have also met tehsildar to discuss the project. “There had been a government survey for the dam in the past, but the proposal was put in cold storage. I have already met water resources minister Jayant Patil in Sangli requesting him on behalf of Zinganoor villagers to look into the matter,” said Ghodke, who is eager to return to Gadchiroli despite his family’s reluctance. “I will convince family members and wife to let me to go back to Gadchiroli to build this dam. It’s risky to work as a cop in Gadchiroli, but I have faith in the villagers and they too have deep feeling for me,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cop-wants-to-return-to-red-zone-to-build-weir/articleshow/84960546.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Jt charity commr superior to all trustees in charitable trust: HC||NAGPUR: Flaying the joint charity commissioner here for “non-application of mind” in disputes related to Sai Mandir Trust, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court clarified that he’s superior to all trustees in a charitable trust and must exercise all his powers. “The commissioner could be considered to be a pater de trust, some sort of ‘super trustee’ having extraordinary prescience and superlative powers regarding trust affairs in general. His duty is to see that the purpose for which trust’s obligation is to be discharged isn’t defeated and confidence reposed in trustees isn’t betrayed,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said. Quoting objectives of the Maharashtra Public Trusts Act, 1950, to regulate and make better provisions of administration of public religious and charitable trusts, the bench said if trustees have to hold office on beneficiary’s behalf and required to discharge their functions and duties, the commissioner’s position is superior in all aspects. Petitioner Avinash Shegaonkar, through senior counsel Anand Jaiswal and Shreeganesh Abhyankar, had questioned the legality and correctness of commissioner’s three orders passed on November 23, 2015. In his first application before the commissioner, the petitioner pointed out towards the difference in number of applications actually made for becoming Shri Sai Baba Seva Mandal Trust members and those mentioned in October 29, 2015, public notice for which objections were invited. The second was in respect of objections taken by petitioner regarding acceptance of applications made by different persons, including trust employees for membership. The third was for granting further time for raising an objection regarding the public notice. All three were rejected on the ground that the objector hadn’t raised any objection to any of membership applications. While remanding back all disputes raised in petitioner’s applications, the judges told the commissioner to apply his mind before deciding them during fresh hearing which should be completed within three months. “We find that these orders are result of the commissioner’s non-application of mind to various provisions made in the scheme framed for the trust’s better and efficient management. If objections were raised that the trust employees couldn’t become members and a single person shouldn’t be made patron, life or ordinary member, still some of them were granted membership, then the commissioner was required to consider consequences before allowing such things.” Partly allowing the petition, the judges said such decisions (rejecting petitioner’s applications) had potential of adversely affecting discharge of confidence reposed in trustees that they would administer in trust for achieving purposes for which it is created. “It included facilitation of offering obeisance and worship by devotees to presiding deity and transparent management of financial, administrative and religious affairs of the trust, all done with a view to be in communion with reverent Shri Sai Baba.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jt-charity-commr-superior-to-all-trustees-in-charitable-trust-hc/articleshow/84960548.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Rajeev Gupta, the chairperson of admissions, said, “Like last year, the admission process will be online. No student will be required to visit colleges or the university office. All trial-based admissions will be conducted based on certificates. The only change is that students will have to apply based on four years of performance, but they are free to use the best of three years’ certificates. We are aware that many would have participated in online events this year, that’s why we are giving this option.” The admissions branch is working with the principals of colleges on the modalities for deciding the cutoffs to avoid over or under-admissions. “Ideally, we would want the admission to be completed within five cutoff lists. We will see once the process starts. A special admission drive for the reserved category would be conducted as we cannot leave those seats vacant,” said Gupta. The university has started a new portal this year to ease the admission process. It has been developed in such a manner that it will easily open on a mobile phone. Sanjeev Singh, joint director, DU computer centre, said, “This year, the portal will have all information, starting from fees of each college to seat distribution and categories. Students will be communicated through all possible channels and their issues will be resolved in real-time.” To resolve the queries of students, the university would also be conducting webinars and Open Days, the dates for which would be notified soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/70k-seats-up-for-grabs-as-du-begins-registrations-today/articleshow/84963627.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Youth flaunts weapons on social media to impress peers, arrested||KOLKATA: Cops arrested an arms dealer near Aurobindo Setu in Maniktala after he posted the photographs of two weapons — an automatic pistol and a one-shotter — on social media. Police said the automatic pistol that was found in the possession of the accused, Kishan Jaiswal (24), was used to commit a murder at Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas. Jaiswal’s aide, Sumit Yadav, a Bhatpara resident, managed to flee during a raid. The accused had posted the photographs around eight or 10 days ago and came under the scanner of the police. “Using human intelligence and the technical evidence, we detained him on Saturday close to his residence,” said an officer. Initially, the accused denied his involvement in the matter. “We showed him that the watch, which he was wearing, was the same in the photo. Then, he changed his statement. Later, he broke down and confessed to the crime, saying that he had posted the photographs to become popular among his peers,” said the officer. “We searched his house and recovered the single shotter. That was when he said that Yadav had borrowed the automatic pistol for some personal use. That was when we informed the Barrackpore city police about the matter and decided to raid Yadav’s house at Bhatpara,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/youth-flaunts-weapons-on-social-media-to-impress-peers-arrested/articleshow/84957595.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||Frenzy for engg courses wanes as job market opens to science grads||Pune: Engineering courses, that have in recent years seen a decline in the number of students, may not find takers this year too going by the number of applications for engineering CET which dropped by about one lakh, this year. The lack of employment even after studying for four years, poor returns on investment compared to other UG courses where input cost is less, not enough jobs in core branches forcing almost all engineers to study computer languages and other software just to be employable, a wide variety of courses that require less money yet assure jobs, and more acceptance of non-professional courses as a suitable UG option by parents have led to the big change over time. Many education and industry experts said most seats that are being reduced in engineering colleges are in the core branches such as mechanical and civil as against the number of seats in computer science/IT branches where they have remained the same or have increased. Manohar Chaskar, dean, faculty of engineering, Savitribai Phule Pune University, said the pandemic and the slowdown in the manufacturing and other sectors have resulted in very poor job conditions for mechanical, civil and instrumentation degree holders.“Students from IT/computer branches are thriving, but there is a bifurcation. Those from renowned colleges get placements, but rural colleges struggle. Poor faculty appointment in most unaided colleges is another problem. Most such colleges pay less and compromise on the quality of teachers. If the teaching-learning process, is not strong, then the quality of graduates is also affected, leading to unemployment,” he added.Problem Of PlentyPavanjit Mane, president of the Forum for IT employees, Pune chapter, said when he was completing his engineering degree from Satara, there was only one college in his area. “Now, there are at least 10 which means for lesser demand, there is a huge supply which will result in vacant seats. Secondly, at that point in time, IT companies were only hiring engineering graduates. Now, they are also employing BSc, BCA graduates. Students are completing these courses, which need less fees, and then joining IT companies and getting paid as much as engineering graduates. Lastly, I am a mechanical engineer and yet joined an IT company where I underwent six months of intensive training. But there are fewer jobs in the mechanical or civil sector and many are learning courses in computer languages or software and taking up IT jobs.”Skilling Matters BB Ahuja, director of College of Engineering Pune said skills and language proficiency are a big problem many engineering graduates face.“The engineering sector has changed and to survive, teachers need to change their approach and teach the right skills. They have to be entrepreneurs at heart and only then will we see fresh graduates who have the ability to come up with a viable startup. Secondly, if the graduates passing out are not employable, then the educators are at fault. We need to start courses which make these students relevant in the market. At one point, we divided the engineering field into various branches, but today the industry demands the convergence of all branches and a jack of all trades. We need to adapt to this shift in demand,” he said.Basic Science Scores Hrishikesh Soman, principal of Symbiosis College of Arts and Commerce, said many students take science after Std X due to parental pressure but soon realise it is not their cup of tea. Parents are now accepting that students need not do engineering to get a job. “The BCom degree is evergreen. From working at a shop to working as a CA, there are many opportunities for a Commerce graduate. Many study engineering for four years, then do an MBA and finally get into the financial sector. The same can be done by a commerce graduate with much less input cost. In humanities, there is a huge demand for psychology, economics and English. There are many job opportunities after these courses. Then it is particularly good for economics and statistics graduates as there are many industries that want a combination of these two courses or the applied side of these courses. Similarly, geography is another subject which is much in demand, but we still need to teach the right kind of geography that the industries demand,” he said.Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, said in-demand courses are BSc in computer science/ animation/ statistics/ mathematics/ physics/ chemistry/ electronics science/ microbiology/ biotechnology/ botany and zoology in the conventional courses. “The BSc( Blended) Bioscience course is a unique course that is in demand. BCA is another course that sees a lot of interest from students,” he added.Rules Keep Changing Former AICTE chairman SS Mantha said most sectors are doing poorly in providing employment. IT and applications areas are only slightly better, due to growth in RPA, AI, ML, AR, VR, hard robotics, IOT, blockchain and like technologies. “These technologies are intensive, experiential, and need investments to teach. Colleges are not willing or not in a position to make those investments. Hence, there is a serious deficit in quality,” he added. Constant fiddling with curriculum like changing entry eligibility (no maths, no physics), reduction in credits, cutting out core engineering courses in the name of flexibility, teaching in other languages, are all avoidable experiments It does make a difference to a student’s core engineering skills and hence employability, he added . “Over a period of time, such experiments tend to reduce interest levels to pursue engineering education. Good analytical, reasoning skills are any day preferable to ill-advised experiments,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/frenzy-for-engg-courses-wanes-as-job-market-opens-to-science-grads/articleshow/84957585.cms||Ardhra Nair

The accused impersonated as technical support team members of Amazon and used to send fake pop-ups of ransomware attacks to internet users in the US and Canada and then extort money from them on the pretext of resolving the issue. Among the 12 arrested was the owner of the call centre, identified as 32-year-old Nitesh Kumar, a resident of Avantika Enclave in Rohini. Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Meena said information was received that a call centre was being run in Dwarka sector-7 and fraudsters were making VOIP calls, bypassing the legal international long distance gateways. During questioning the accused said they instructed the victims to call on a number specified on the pop-up — to pay for technical support — to resolve the issue. The victims were made to pay money through gift cards, which were redeemed in US-based bank accounts of the accused’s overseas contacts, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/call-centre-busted-in-dwarka-12-held/articleshow/84957625.cms||---

The girl had gone to her native place and was admitted to a government hospital after health issues began. An officer from the Hinjewadi police said, “In October last year, the girl had left her home with an unknown person and returned back only in January this year. She did not reveal the identity of the person with whom she had left the house.” The victim’s father on Saturday approached the Sangli police and filed an FIR.  The police have invoked the charges of abduction, rape and offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, against an unknown person. The matter was transferred to the Hinjewadi police for further investigation into the case. Sub-inspector Ravindra Mudal of the Hinjewadi police told TOI that the girl’s father had not approached the police when the girl had gone missing in October last year. Mudal said that last month, the minor girl and her family had gone to their native place. On July 14, the girl complained of stomach pain and was taken to a local hospital. “Into the seventh month of pregnancy, her condition had become critical. She was later shifted to a government hospital, where she died during treatment on July 17,” Mudal added. “We are working on certain clues. Our probe is on,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-booked-in-pocso-case/articleshow/84957606.cms||---

Police had earlier lodged an FIR in connection with the case after the father of the inmate, Irshad (55), alleged he was beaten up in prison and died. District administration officials told TOI that the magisterial inquiry initiated on Saturday was separate from the investigation being conducted by police. Irshad was brought from Uttar Pradesh’s Rampur to the sub-jail on May 25. The man, accused of attempt to murder and criminal intimidation, died at Haldwani’s Sushila Tiwari Hospital on July 11. While jail authorities told his family that he passed away from tuberculosis, his father alleged that he had no such disease and approached police. Police then registered an FIR on July 24 under section 302 (murder) against unknown people and started its investigation. On Sunday, superintendent of Haldwani sub-jail, S K Sukhija, told TOI that the inmate had been suffering from TB which would be clear once the autopsy report is in. “There is no evidence of any beating in this case,” he said. In March, another inmate, Pravesh Kumar, was found dead in Haldwani sub-jail. While hearing his wife’s plea that he was allegedly thrashed by prison guards, the high court had slammed police for delay in lodging FIR. It had also asked the state to consider transfer of Nainital SSP and Haldwani circle officer and remarked whether “ties of brotherhood” had led police to find no evidence of beating by prison guards. The court had observed that the autopsy report showed as many as 10 injuries on Kumar’s body and yet the statement of the doctor who performed the procedure was not recorded by police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/days-after-fir-magisterial-inquiry-initiated-into-2nd-alleged-custodial-death-in-haldwani-jail/articleshow/84955117.cms||Prashant Jha

As his land was still under mortgage, the elderly man filed a complaint on Friday. An officer from the Pune crime branch said in 2013, the suspects had abducted the complainant at gunpoint from Vadhu Khurd. “They prepared mortgage documents of the three hectare land by threatening the complainant. They then withdew Rs 6.7 crore from a bank by mortgaging the land,” the officer said. Later, to free the land from mortgage, the suspects demanded Rs1 crore from the complainant. The case has been filed under relevant sections of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sr-citizen-files-extortion-complaint/articleshow/84957620.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Curtains on Padmasree cinema, owners decide to sell it off||KOLKATA: A prominent South Kolkata cinema that was running even three months ago will remain shut when others reopen in Bengal soon. The owners of Padmasree Cinema have decided to sell it off and started negotiations with a prospective buyer. This theatre has been one of the most popular destinations for cine-lovers from the entire Garia to the Jadavpur stretch. According to Syamal De, one of the managing partners of Padmasree Cinema, the hall was founded by producer-distributor Narayan Sadukhan and others sometime around 1958-59. “My father, Pramatha Kumar De, along with two other groups of partners, took over the 720-seater in 1960. We had opened it with Uttam Kumar-Suchitra Sen’s ‘Chaowa Pawa’. Ours was the first single screen theatre in the entire Jadavpur, Garia, Tollygunge stretch. Bunty, Mahua, Madhaban and Malancha followed after us. We are the last to shut down. Currently, the three partners of Padmasree have 14 heirs. All of us have finally agreed to sell off the property,” he said.  Director Kaushik Ganguly, whose ‘Cinemawala’ had highlighted the crisis of Bengal’s single screen theatres, describes Padmasree was his first introduction to the concept of movies. “My parents watched films there but didn’t take me along since I was too small. My uncle would take me to Padmasree’s lobby where I would watch the photo sets on display,” Ganguly said. Pt Tejendra Narayan Majumdar, whose residence is just two minutes away from the theatre, is sad that a part of his “childhood memories” will be gone if this cinema shuts down permanently. “Even my grandmother would watch films there. She must have paid 50 paisa for a ticket. During my childhood, the tickets were priced at Rs 1.40. I have watched ‘Sanyasi Raja’, ‘Jodi Jantem’, ‘Jadu Bansha’, ‘Ganadevata’, ‘Jay Jayanti’ and ‘Ami, Shey O Sakha’. Sometimes, charity shows would be hosted in the morning that would be wrapped up before regular 2-5-8pm movie screenings began. Unfortunately, the cinema didn’t upgrade itself with time,” he said. Along with others, Padmasree had closed on April 30 this year. The prospective buyer, De said, is not from the cinema trade. “For the buyer, we have not kept any clause for continuing with the cinema. If all goes well, the deal should be closed by the Pujas,” De added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/curtains-on-padmasree-cinema-owners-decide-to-sell-it-off/articleshow/84957624.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The police have not ruled out the involvement of local gangs. In the first case, the culprits broke the front left window of a car parked on Centre Street, Camp and stole a music system worth Rs15,000. A little later, music systems were stolen from two vehicles parked at Gangadham chowk near Market Yard in a similar fashion. A businessman from the locality filed an FIR with the Market Yard police stating that thieves made away with a music system worth Rs10,000. Another system worth Rs5,000 was stolen from a woman’s car. In the two remaining incidents, the suspects stole laptops and cash from vehicles parked at Wanowrie and Kunjirwadi. A businessman from Wanowrie had parked his car on the Shivarkar road when thieves broke the rear window of his vehicle with stone and stole a laptop and other valuables worth Rs65,000. Another businessman, from Kunjirwadi, filed an FIR with the Loni Kalbhor police stating that thieves made away with his bag containing Rs2.5 lakh cash from his car parked near a petrol pump on the Pune-Solapur highway. A window of his car was smashed using a cement paver block. “Local criminals, on the prowl at night, are targetting cars parked on the public roads or at isolated places. They are smashing car windows with rods or stones looking for valuables and music systems in the car. Our probe is one,”a senior crime branch officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/valuables-stolen-from-5-parked-cars/articleshow/84957630.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand government mulls population control bill & land law||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government will set up separate committees to look into the feasibility of rolling out a population control law and a land law in the Himalayan state. A top source told TOI that chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has said that the government will form committees to look into population control and a land law to restrict outsiders from buying land in the state. The move comes after the state government was urged to look into the possibility of introducing a Population Control Act during a recent coordination meeting held in Dehradun, which was attended by BJP's national general secretary (organisation) B L Santosh and senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders. BJP ruled states have witnessed a push for population control policies in the recent past. The Uttar Pradesh government has come up with a draft of the Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill while the Assam government has also said that it will bring a population control law to debar people with more than two children from getting government benefits. The Uttarakhand government is also considering bringing a strict law, demand for which has been growing among residents. Earlier this month, several youngsters had taken to social media to demand land laws and protesters had also gathered outside the state assembly on July 18. In 2003, an amendment was made to the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reform Act 1950 by the ND Tiwari government to prevent outsiders from buying more than 500 square metres of agricultural land in Uttarakhand. In 2007, BJP chief minister B C Khanduri reduced the area of land that could be bought in the state by the outsiders to 250 square metres. In 2018, however, the Trivendra Singh Rawat government set aside the 2003 amendment, paving the way for outsiders to buy any amount of land in the hill state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-mulls-population-control-bill-land-law/articleshow/84955173.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Kolkata||Bangladesh set to launch social media platforms||Kolkata: Social media users are upbeat with news of the Bangladesh government’s move to create its own social media platform, “Jogajog”, as an alternative to Facebook, and “Alapon” as an alternative to WhatsApp. Bangladesh’s state minister for information and communication technology Zunaid Ahmed Palak has announced this news on July 24. At the inaugural function of Entrepreneurship Masterclass Series 2, the minister said, “Through this (Jogajog app), the entrepreneurs of the country will be able to create their own online marketplace and group for information, data and communication.” He also explained how his ministry successfully created “Boithok” app as an alternative to Zoom online and “Surokkha App” for vaccine registration. Bangladeshi stage and film director Nasiruddin Yousuff has seen the interview of state minister and is waiting for the details of the platform. “A Bangladeshi film has gone to Cannes. And now, an app to compete with Facebook. Being a freedom fighter, I am happy with the strides the nation is taking on its 50th year of independence,” he said. Mymensingh-born sarod player Sharif Arefin Rony, who enrolled into Rabindra Bharati University in 2019, has also welcomed this initiative. “I feel so proud to hear that my country is taking such technological initiatives to compete with global leaders,” he said from Kolkata. Dhaka-based director Sazzad Khan is excited about “Jogajog” and “Alapon”. He already uses state-owned landphone operator Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Ltd’s over-the-top (OTT) calling application called Alaap. “It is a very handy app, gets updated regularly and can even be used to make calls abroad at a rate that’s cheaper than phone calls,” Khan said. According to him, it is good that the government is creating new apps. Dhaka-based businessman Mohammad Munna is also another “Alaap” user, who is happy with the high video and audio quality of calls made by this app. “It is completely secure. One can use this to make any international calls for work and business purposes. Now, I am looking forward to Jogajog,” Munna said. Rony also pointed out that the youth of Bangladesh is now attempting a lot of new things, especially in the IT sector. “I hear of so many apps being created from Bangladesh. Finally, the population of Bangladesh is turning into an asset for the nation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bangladesh-set-to-launch-social-media-platforms/articleshow/84957671.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The Surendranagar cops, led by superintendent of police Mahendra Bagda, held the Lok Darbar to chiefly address the grievances related to moneylending and land grabbing. The cops also took note of complaints related to other issues.“Large number of people from across the district attended the public hearing headed by SP Mahendra Bagda at the Police Training Centre at Police headquarters in Surendranagar,” H P Doshi, deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Surendranagar, told TOI. Among the many who attended the Lok Darbar was 42-year-old Sajid Chauhan, a deliveryman at a LPG agency in Surendranagar. Chauhan complained about the exorbitant interest charged by four moneylenders — Virendrasinh Dodia, Pruthvirajsinh Parmar, Mahadev Rajput, Kiritsinh.“In 2019, I borrowed Rs 30,000 from Dodia who deducted Rs 6,000 as interest before giving me the money and since then he has been charging 18% interest. I have already paid back Rs 1 lakh but he is still demanding Rs 3 lakh,” Chauhan said in his complaint.Two complaints were lodged with B division police station in Surendranagar town and one complaint was lodged in Muli police station against moneylenders.Deputy SP Doshi informed that around 46 people filed applications during the Lok Darbar. “Out of the six cases related to moneylending we have lodged FIRs in three while a probe has been launched in other cases,” Doshi added.“We have been holding Lok Darbars every six months for the last two years. But due to the Covid-19 restriction we couldn’t organize one in last year,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-firs-lodged-against-loan-sharks-after-police-lok-darbar/articleshow/84955210.cms||---
---||Goa||13-year-old Goa boy is manager of millions of dollars cryptocurrency||PANAJI: Last year, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic’s first wave, Bambolim-based school student Gajesh Naik began creating online educational content. The content was meant to help primary school students from vernacular schools to cope with the lack of physical classes. This year, 13-year-old Gajesh has outdone himself. The Class VIII student of People’s High School, Panaji, is now the creator of PolyGaj, a cryptocurrency money managing ecosystem. Gajesh has developed two dapps or decentralised applications on the Polygon network, which provide access to crypto-investing. PolyGaj is a one-stop DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFT platform, while StableGaj is a decentralized stablecoin swap providing stablecoin exchange on the Polygon network. While children his age were busy coming to terms with online learning during the pandemic, Gajesh used the time to upskill himself mastering chatbot development to blockchain technology applications. PolyGaj is a DeFi protocol built on the Polygon blockchain, which has now managed $7 million in cryptocurrency, including a recent investment in Polygon blockchain by the US billionaire Mark Cuban. DeFi is an umbrella term for non-custodial software programs that handle one’s cryptocurrency for them, without intermediaries like banking systems or investment managers. “Since the last one year, when physical classes were discontinued due to the pandemic, I decided to take and completed some online certificate courses, including from University at Buffalo, State University of New York,” said Gajesh, the son of Goa civil service officer Siddhivinayak and PWD official Pranita. Gajesh began learning coding at the age of eight at a bootcamp, and today knows C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Solidity. He said his interest in blockchain technology was kindled when he attended convincing lectures at the international blockchain congress held at Goa in 2018, organized in collaboration with the Goa government. “Since then he equipped himself with requisite blockchain programming skills and blockchain programming languages. Being a relatively newer topic with less knowledge availability in the public domain, Gajesh takes direct tutelage from professors of MIT and Stanford,” said his father Siddhivinayak. Today, he actively participates on social media platforms in discussions on cryptocurrency and has gained 22,100 followers on Twitter, among them Dimitry Beterin (father of Vitalik Buterin, founder of ethereum), Sandeep Nailwal (co-Founder of Polygon), Jaynti Kanani (CEO of Polygon), and Vijay Shekhar Sharma (Founder of Paytm), among others. He has also recorded explanatory videos about crypto for his YouTube channel, which now has over 12,000 subscribers from across the globe. Gajesh is the youngest known person to have completed all five levels of the gruelling Google Foobar challenge. As online classes have resumed, the teenager plans to dedicate up to five hours to school work, utilising the other free time during his day working on PolyGaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/13-year-old-goa-boy-is-manager-of-millions-of-dollars-cryptocurrency/articleshow/84959596.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Delhi||Licences for several businesses can now be renewed for up to three yrs||New Delhi: With apprehensions about a disruption in business due to another wave of Covid-19 cases, the annual health trade licence renewals have been very low. Municipal corporations in the city will now be offering renewal options for 3 years and 2 years along with the existing annual option. This is expected to provide relief to owners of restaurants, eateries, hotels, spas, salons, guest houses, barber shops and several other establishments. A senior official from South Delhi Municipal Corporation said, “The licences could now be renewed for 1 year, 2 years and 3 years. SDMC has decided to provide major relief to traders and businessmen by easing the norms for renewal of various licences pertaining to health, veterinary, trade and storage sections. The move will decrease compliance burden and help businessmen who have suffered badly due to the pandemic and lockdown.” An order issued by the south corporation’s factory licensing department states that the new compliance regime with 1-3 year validity will be available for four categories of licences. The first category includes health trade licences for restaurants, eating houses, hotels of all categories, bars, spa, grooming salons and barber shops. The second category will include veterinary licences such as licences for domestic animals, chicken and mutton shops and dairies. “New general trade and storage licence as well as traders seeking new factory licence or renewal will also get the extended validity option,” the official added. Earlier, the facility for renewal of licence was for one year only and traders had been complaining that the frequent renewal process causes unnecessary hassle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/licences-for-several-businesses-can-now-be-renewed-for-up-to-three-yrs/articleshow/84957745.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They also stressed the need to avoid delaying screening and treatment of lung cancer due to Covid-19 fear. “Cough, reduced oxygen levels are symptoms that easily overlap with other lung disorders . Doctors hence have to be careful to differentiate,” said Dr BKC Mohan Prasad, chairman, Mohan’s Medicity Hospital and former president, Indian Association of Surgical Oncology (IASO). “Covid-19 does not have a direct relation to lung cancer. Often lung cancers are detected only late,” said Dr Krishnakumar Rathnam, senior consultant and head, medical oncology, Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC). “In early stages of lung cancer, the tumour can be removed through surgery. But, even in later stages, now more drugs are available for targeted treatment,” said Dr Mohan Prasad.

They detained him for questioning and the accused Arvindnath Parmar confessed to have committed four offences in the last two years.However, no complaints were lodged by the victims and police are trying to identify them. “Parmar is a native of Targhadi village near Rajkot city. We took him to one of the houses where he had cheated a woman of Rs 1.20 lakh. But he doesn’t remember addresses of three other houses where he had cheated the owners,” police said. Devi Solanki (34), a resident of Krishna Park on Sadhu Vasvani Road, came forward to lodge a complaint of cheating of Rs 1.20 lakh jewellery against Parmar who had duped her in January 2018 by scaring her black magic spell.“I had offered him water and lunch when he came begging at my house. While having food, he told me that we had been victims of some unknown elements for which some rituals were to be performed. He demanded gold jewellery. We had handed over the gold and he never returned,” she said in his complaint. Police have recovered the jewellery from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-dressed-up-as-eunuch-caught-cheating-people-in-rajkot/articleshow/84955262.cms||---

While former advocate general Carlos Alvares Ferreira said that the bill “defeats the very essence of the rule of law”, former election commissioner Prabhakar Timble termed it as a case of “smart politics manufacturing bad laws”. Former MLA and veteran legal practitioner Uday Bhembre said that as the bill was among the “pathbreaking” legislations pertaining to some fundamental legal matters and not mere amendments to Acts, (and thus) proper scrutiny of the bill was essential. He strongly advocated referring it to the select committee. “The act of legalising patently-illegal houses will set a bad precedent,” Bhembre explained. “The tendency of breaking the law today assuming that it will be regularised someday will get strengthened. This is harmful for the state’s interests. The government should have considered adopting other measures instead of making illegal houses legal, without throwing the occupants out on the streets.” Stating that the legislation will not stand scrutiny in the eyes of law, Ferreira slammed the government for introducing the legislation, which he said effectively legalises landgrabbing manoeuvres. Terming the bill as “a total mockery of law,” Ferreira said that it was “a very dishonest attempt on the part of the government to mislead and fool the innocent citizens who will remain in false hopes, losing money in the process with no relief at the end”. Stating that the bill defeats the very essence of ‘bhumiputra’ as the term is defined in the legislation, Ferreira termed it as an “assault on every honest citizen living in Goa and Goans at large”. “As per this definition , this bhumiputra needs to reside anywhere in Goa for the last 30 years, but should have constructed the illegal house by encroachment before April 1, 2019, which means even an encroacher who is not on the land for 30 years or more will qualify. This legislation gives license to grab properties — unheard of anywhere in the world — which means that dishonest citizens are rewarded whilst honest citizens will be punished,” Ferreira explained. As Timble preferred to put it, “reckless overspeeding by the government violating all signals of legislative traffic results in accidents causing permanent disabilities to the state”. However, on the positive side, Timble said that as the bill envisages providing a secure roof over the head to longtime squatters, notwithstanding the electoral benefits the move may accrue to the BJP, “it will free the families from politicians who keep such families under constant fear and threat of evictions or demolitions”. Timble put into perspective the social measure associated with the bill which the legislation hopes to achieve. “The houses may have been built illegally, but with rising population and increasing pressure on land resources, it is imperative that we come out with some social measures. Otherwise, the only option we will then be left with is to sell this illegally-occupied land to real estate developers at throwaway prices,” he said. Former chairperson of the state law commission and former BJP MP Narendra Sawaikar hailed the bill as a “significant land reform” that will provide ownership rights of their dwellings to a number of Goans. “In the absence of ownership records, they could neither repair their homes nor avail of any of the welfare schemes of the government. Amendments may be brought to the legislation as needed in the course of time, but the very fact that the bill has come into existence on the 60th year of Goa’s Liberation underscores its significance,” he said. Significantly, retired bureaucrat and legal commentator N D Agrawal pointed out that as the bill pertains to land-related matters, the legislation will be thoroughly scrutinised by various ministries as such bills need the assent of the President of India to become an Act. He gave the instance of the Goa Requisition And Acquisition Of Property Bill, passed by the Goa Assembly in 2017 — which provided for the requisition and speedy acquisition of property for certain purposes — which is still awaiting the President’s assent. Nonetheless, Bhembre sounded a note of caution. “Making laws without an elaborate discussion in the House is very dangerous,” he said. “If we enact such laws (that are potentially harmful to the state’s interests), Goa will turn into a lawless state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bhumiputra-bill-an-assault-on-every-honest-citizen-in-goa/articleshow/84959627.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

The alleged lackadaisical attitude of the ZP administration, which teachers said is not new to them, has generated angry reactions from the affected workforce who have termed the delay in salary payment demoralizing. Rajesh Hiwale, the spokesperson of the Association of Aurangabad ZP Teachers, said monthly salaries often get credited after the second half of every month despite the state government mandating the release of dues on the first day of the month. “The delay has crossed all limits this time with teachers still awaiting the salaries for the month of June. Teachers too have different financial liabilities, including EMIs towards loans and fees of their wards. We feel helpless due to such delays in getting our monthly salaries,” he said. Stating that adequate funds were available with the government, the affected ZP teachers accused both the education department and accounts section of not completing the formalities on time to submit the pay-bills for June to the treasury department. “In the past, disciplinary action was ordered against authorities responsible for causing delays in the release of monthly salaries of teachers. Such instructions, however, remained only on paper and no action has been taken despite repeated delays in crediting of salaries,” Hiwale said. When contacted, chief accounts and finance officer of Aurangabad ZP Appasaheb Chate said the education department was responsible for the issue. “The education department submits pay-bills to us and we send it to the treasury section of the government on the same day,” he said. Education officer B B Chavan said certain technical issues caused the delay in completing the necessary formalities. “The issue has been resolved and teachers are expected to get salaries soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-zp-teachers-still-waiting-for-june-salary/articleshow/84950654.cms||---

The cops said that the woman had earlier filed a complaint against her husband and he was arrested too. However, he got parole and came out of jail sometime ago. An argument broke out between the couple again when they met on Sunday. The accused, Nandu, allegedly insisted that the case should be withdrawn. His wife had instead filed for cancellation of his parole. This had outraged him and he planned the murder. After coming out on bail, the accused started living in Gurgaon. On Sunday, he met his wife and strangled her. Earlier in 2017 also, Nandu had been jailed for attacking his brother and brother-in-law with a knife. He was later arrested and released on interim bail in June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-on-interim-bail-arrested-for-killing-wife/articleshow/84957784.cms||---
---||Goa||GSIDC starts excavation work on Orlim bundh||Colva: The contractor engaged by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) has started excavating the mud-filling of the Orlim bundh. More than 50m of the 780m retaining wall along with the footpath had given way on June 16. GSIDC had said the retaining wall had tilted due to hydrostatic pressure on the under-construction retaining wall due to incessant rain. GSIDC has told us to excavate only the mud between the retaining walls, under the supervision of the consultants Construmer, contractor Tolentino D’Souza told TOI. “They may be thinking of re-designing the walls and may want to know the faults in the current design,” he said. Restoration and beautification of this bundh was part of the developmental works in the Benaulim constituency in December 2018 at a cost of Rs 25 crore. GSIDC general manager Jude Carvalho said that they will initially inspect and find the cause of the wall tilting and then take corrective steps. Locals had said that the government should restore the traditional footpath ‘vaat mear’. Its total length is 780 m with water catchment areas on either side providing it a scenic view. Even before the Portuguese era, this was manually reinforced every year through local labour force. However with increase in vehicular villagers stopped using it leading to its erosion. Carvalho said that while excavating, the original bundh will not be removed. He added that both the retaining walls are connected with a ‘raft’ over the original bundh and what is being excavated is only the mud-filled above the ‘raft’. D’souza when questioned about the time frame for its completion stated that once GSIDC finds solution, rectifies it or gives a new design he will immediately get on job.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gsidc-starts-excavation-work-on-orlim-bundh/articleshow/84959765.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Corals under stress due to variations in oceanic acidity||PANAJI: Coral reefs in the Indian Ocean along with the marine life that thrives in the coral ecosystem are expected to come under relentless stress due to an increase in ocean acidification and global warming,” say scientists. Climate scientists say that because of the extreme variation in acidity of the oceans and a rise in frequency of such fluctuations, the health of the Indian Ocean flora and fauna is “precariously poised.” Scientists from the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) - Goa, Anna University - Chennai and the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru used the Boron isotopes at NCPOR-Goa, a first for India. This is the first first time Indian researchers used coral records from the Lakshadweep coral reefs to reconstruct past ocean acidification trends in the Indian Ocean. The unprecedented rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere is causing rapid acidification of the ocean as surface seawater absorbs the CO2. This, say scientists, poses a direct threat to marine flora and fauna such as coral reefs. Coral reefs provide an important ecosystem for underwater life while also protecting coastal areas from ocean currents and storms. Corals are actually clusters of thousands of marine animals called polyps, which provide a habitat for fish species. “The first long-term pH record from the Indian Ocean enables us to determine the recent ocean acidification trend forced by anthropogenic CO2 rise as well as certain key physical oceanographic factors. Once we know this ocean acidification trend and variability with the atmospheric CO2 rise, impact assessment of ocean acidification for future CO2 scenarios can be done with better accuracy,” said principal investigator Dr Waliur Rahaman. The Lakshadweep archipelago, India’s only coral island chain, is 200-440 km off the west coast of the mainland in the Arabian Sea. While historic data for ocean acidification are available for the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, no such records existed for the Indian Ocean till this study. This study has been published in one of the reputed journals of American Geophysical Union – Journal of Geophysical Research Biogeosciences. Indian climate scientists and oceanographers are racing to understand the present and future impacts of ocean acidification in Indian Ocean region for which high resolution records of long-term pH trends of seawater are vital. Utilisation of boron isotope ratio to reconstruct past seawater pH is an area of research with immense significance for past ocean and climate studies. The study led by the Indian researchers is the first successful demonstration of boron isotope measurements in marine carbonates and reconstruction of past ocean pH in any Indian laboratory. In this study, scientists discovered that physical oceanographic processes controlled by El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) control surface pH variability. “As climate scientists predict an increase in ENSO events following future global warming scenarios, the short-term and rapid pH variability also called “pH extremes” are likely to increase hereafter,” said Rahaman. He said that extreme variation in the pH levels will “relentlessly test the resilience and adaptability” of corals and other calcifiers in Arabian Sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/corals-under-stress-due-to-variations-in-oceanic-acidity/articleshow/84959672.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra: 3 die in clash over Annabhau Sathe’s anniversary celebrations in Sangli||KOLHAPUR: Three men were killed and another three were injured on Sunday after violence broke out between two groups at Dudhondi village in Sangli district following discussions on the celebration of legendary literary stalwart Annabhau Sathe’s birth anniversary. Incidentally, Dudhondi is just 25-30 km away from Wategaon, where Sathe was born on August 1, 1920. Assistant inspector Sangeeta Mane of the Kundal police station said six people have been detained and the process of filing an FIR was in progress till late on Sunday night. Mane said the two groups had differences earlier as well. “On Saturday night, the leaders of the two groups got into a minor scuffle over the mode of celebrating the anniversary. While one group was in favour of loud celebrations, the other wanted to keep the affair simple,” she said. On Sunday, the members of one group were on their way to the police station to lodge a complaint over the previous night’s scuffle when they were attacked by the other group, Mane said. “The ensuing clash was violent. Six men were badly injured and three of them — Arvind Sathe (52), Sunny Mohite (28) and Vikas Mohite (32) — bled profusely and died on the way to hospital,” she added. Ashwini Shendge, deputy superintendent of police of Palus tehsil, said, “The violence took place between two groups belonging to the same community over Annabhau Sathe’s anniversary celebrations. The injured have been admitted to the Sangli civil hospital. We are carrying out the procedure to file charges against those involved in the violence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/3-die-in-clash-over-sathes-anniversary-celebrations/articleshow/84953578.cms||---
---||Agra||Now, proposal to change name of UP’s Firozabad district to Chandra Nagar||AGRA: Ahead of next year’s assembly elections, the Firozabad district council has passed a proposal to change the name of Firozabad district to Chandra Nagar. Ahead of next year’s assembly elections, the Firozabad district council has passed a proposal to change the name of Firozabad district to Chandra Nagar.  Sadar block pramukh Laxmi Narayan Yadav, who drafted the proposal, claimed that the ancient name of Firozabad was ‘Chandwar Nagar’. “Akbar had changed it to Firozabad in the 15th century,” he claimed. Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party members said that none of its ward members were present at the district council meeting. The SP, BSP and Congress district presidents have raised strong objections over the proposal. Congress district president Sandeep Tiwari said, “It is unfortunate that the ruling party members are not concerned about massive waterlogging, pothole riddled roads, inadequate water and power supply in the district.” When contacted, noted historian and AMU professor emeritus Irfan Habib told TOI, “There is no historical evidence that Firozabad was known as Chandwar Nagar. The name Firozabad came into being during the tenure of Firoz Shah Tughlaq. The point that Akbar changed the so-called ancient name of Firozabad is incorrect.” Firozabad district council president Harshita Singh said, “During the first district council board meeting on Saturday, a proposal to change the name of Firozabad to Chandra Nagar was unanimously approved. We will be sending a detailed recommendation to the state government in this regard. We will also pursue the matter with the state authorities to restore the original name of the district.” The official website of the Firozabad district administration mentions, “The ancient name of this town was Chandwar Nagar. The name of Firozabad was given during the reign of Akbar by Firoz Shah, a mansabdar of the Mughal emperor, in 1566. It is said that Raja Todarmal was passing through this town during a pilgrimage to Gaya. He was looted by robbers. At his request, Akbar the Great sent his Firoz Shah here. The tomb of Firoz Shah and ruins of Katra Pathanan are the evidence of this fact.” A local historian, however, expressed his reservation. “There was a Chandawar town on the banks of Yamuna in ancient times. In 1193-94, the battle of Chandawar was fought between Mohammad Ghori and Jaichand of Kannauj, giving Ghori control of much of northern India. However, going by the historical evidence and geographical parameters, it is incorrect to name the present Firozabad district as Chandra Nagar,” he said. Proposals to rename several UP cities, such as Agra, Ghaziabad, Muzaffarnagar and Sultanpur have come up from time to time ever since the Yogi government was formed in 2017. Earlier, the state government renamed Allahabad as Prayagraj and the Mughalsarai railway station, one of India’s oldest, to Deen Dayal Upadhyay junction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/now-proposal-to-change-name-of-ups-firozabad-district-to-chandra-nagar/articleshow/84953453.cms||Deepak Lavania

The summons were issued during a virtual hearing by HERC quorum headed by chairperson R K Panchnanda and member Naresh Sardana on Friday afternoon. With a target to install 10 lakh smart meters, the project was launched by UHBVN and DHBVN. UHBVN had picked up Panchkula, Karnal and Panipat, while DHNVN had picked up Gurgaon district. So far, only 2.5 lakh such meters have been installed, against the 10-lakh target fixed in 2018. The project is supposed to be completed by the end of this year. According to reports submitted before commission for June and July, only 7,137 smart meters were installed in June, against the target of 45,500, and 7,531 were installed in May, against the target of 24,000. “At such a snail’s pace, it would take years to complete the projects. As per initial timelines, projects were to be completed in 2021,” the commssion observed in an interim order. According to order, consultant EESL’s officials have assured the pace of installation will pick up and the company will be able commission the target number latest by December 2023. For this, EESL’s officials have also submitted a plan to the HERC bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/smart-meter-project-slow-haryana-power-regulator-summons-officials-of-consultant-discoms/articleshow/84957842.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Hyderabad||I told her to think it was a gift for me: PV Sindhu’s dad||HYDERABAD: A father’s fervent plea for a gift on the eve of her bronze medal playoff against China’s He Bing Jiao seemed to have worked wonders on PV Sindhu. The silver medallist at the Rio Games won an Olympic medal for the second time running and her bronze in Tokyo on Sunday made her the only Indian woman with two Olympic medals. PV RamanaThe semifinal defeat to Tai Tzu-Ying on Saturday weighed her down but PV Ramana said he convinced Sindhu to give it her best. “I told her not to ponder over the semis loss. It was painful but she came back strongly. I told her to think it was a gift for me and play her best game,” said the former volleyball international and Arjuna awardee. Ramana has been a huge influence on her daughter’s career and it was no different in Tokyo. “I had told her to focus on the game and show the right body language. Yesterday, I told her that Bing Jiao had played three-setters in her earlier games and it is not easy for her to continue with the same rhythm. I also sent her a video of Bing Jiao’s match in Delhi. Her coach and Sindhu analysed it and came up with a good strategy,” he said. The colour of the medal doesn’t matter, Ramana said. “We had expected a gold but it’s not so easy to achieve it,” he said. He expressed confidence that Sindhu will play the next Olympics. “It is significant that she has won a medal and the colour doesn’t really matter. I am positive that she will also play the next Olympics. We have to plan and win as many medals as we can win for the country at the next Olympics. I am confident about her as she has the hunger to play and she enjoys the game,” Ramana added. While thanking coach Park Tae-Sang, the government, BAI and Suchitra Academy, Ramana also used the opportunity to drive home a point. “Girls are winning medals for the country. I am not criticising the male child, but only want to stress that girls should be given equal opportunities to realise their dreams,” he said. Sindhu’s mother Vijaya, also a volleyball player, was delighted too. “I am very happy. We are very proud of her. I was a bit tense in the last match but my husband spoke to her before this match and she played very well,” she said and added “I’ll make her whatever she wants to eat after she comes back home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/i-told-her-to-think-it-was-a-gift-for-me-sindhus-dad/articleshow/84959751.cms||Solomon S Kumar

The state government has now decided to come out with an action plan to support all such children who lost their parents to the novel coronavirus. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao-led state cabinet meeting on Sunday constituted a cabinet sub-committee to collect details and assess problems being faced by such orphans as well as orphanages in Telangana. Women and child welfare minister Satyavathi Rathod will head the cabinet sub-committee comprising 10 other ministers including T Harish Rao, KT Rama Rao, Sabitha Indra Reddy, V Srinivas Goud, Talasani Srinivas Yadav, Koppula Eshwar, Gangula Kamalakar, Indrakaran Reddy, G Jagadish Reddy and Errabelli Dayakar Rao. The cabinet directed the medical and health secretary to get comprehensive information on affected children. All collectors have been told to submit details of orphans and orphanages from their respective districts to the medical and health secretary. The cabinet, which also discussed the Covid situation in Telangana and other states, decided to focus on districts with higher cases. The cabinet directed officials to increase the number of tests to identify coronavirus patients, intensify vaccination drive, improve medical infrastructure, medicine supplies and ensure there was no shortage of oxygen facilities in hospitals in all the districts. It was also decided to ensure that the seven new medical colleges sanctioned would start functioning from the ensuing academic year. Officials were told to take up steps for construction of hospital, hostel and college buildings, labs, beds and other essential facilities to be put in place. Also, officials were told to identify land for new medical colleges that are expected to be sanctioned in future. The medical and health department officials have been told to prepare an action plan and submit it to the chief minister at the earliest. The chief minister said there is a possibility of orphaned children being deserted and subjected to social discrimination resulting in psychological problems. “Until they grow up and are able to financially sustain themselves, the government will support them,” KCR said. In the past, the orphans were given BC status and steps were taken for their safety. The government offices which are lying empty and are suitable, would be transformed into rehabilitation homes for the orphans. The committee will make field visits as part of its state-wide tour and prepare comprehensive guidelines for the development of orphans. State planning board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar would be special invitee to the committee meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-to-aid-kids-orphaned-in-pandemic/articleshow/84957878.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Ludhiana||To control discontentment, BSP removes all its office-bearers from Phillaur||Jalandhar: After prominent members of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Punjab’s Phillaur assembly constituency convened a ‘workers’ sammelan’ on August 7 to demand that the seat be given to the party instead of alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), its state leadership has ‘relieved’ all party office-bearers of the area. According to party insiders, the party directive meant that all office-bearers from the constituency, from state to local level, most of whom have been pressing the demand, have been removed. It is the first such en masse removal of office-bearers in a constituency after discontentment started brewing in the BSP ranks over seat-sharing with SAD. Also, the state BSP leadership has been sacking leaders for ‘indiscipline’ and even former state president Rashpal Raju was expelled without any notice. In this case, as a large number of BSP workers were involved, the party has confined itself to relieving only the office-bearers. Speaking to TOI on Sunday, Punjab BSP president Jasbir Singh Garhi said they were in the process of making fresh appointments and, barring a few, the rest would be re-appointed. A common refrain among the party workers has been that they are happy with the alliance, but BSP has not got its best seats in the seat-sharing decision. In terms of vote share for BSP, Phillaur has been at the top. “Every office-bearer from Phillaur assembly constituency is relieved from his/her office and from now on no leader from Phillaur can use party designation with his/her name. Till the next orders, the entire party structure in Phillaur and office is being disbanded,” said the Punjab BSP office in a statement issued on Saturday. Stating that some Punjab BSP office-bearers were violating directives of party supremo Mayawati and also challenging the decision on social media, the BSP state office said that state president Jasbir Singh Garhi and general secretary Nachhatar Pal had tried to take them on board, but they did not relent. However, inquiries at the ground have revealed that local leaders and workers involved in organising the ‘workers’ sammelan’ are still reaching out to party workers and supporters to ensure a good turnout and to make it a success. BSP sources said that though the party’s statement did not mention any names, those relieved included local office-bearers and those (office-bearers) who had state or district level positions but come from the Phillaur constituency. Sources said they have also been part of the discontented camp. Prominent BSP workers from Phillaur have convened the ‘workers’ sammelan’ at Goraya to build pressure for getting the Phillaur seat for the party. The brewing discontentment within BSP increased after the party inducted SAD working committee member Lakhwinder Singh Lakhi and announced that he was the constituency in-charge of the Urmur seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/to-control-discontentment-bsp-removes-all-its-office-bearers-from-phillaur/articleshow/84957895.cms||IP Singh

Jogendra alleged that the action is "entirely politically motivated", while the local authorities claimed that it is based on a police report. Licences of Jogendra’s elder brother Rameshwar Singh Yadav, his wife and son have also been suspended. Jogendra is a former district council chief and Rameshwar, a former MLA. Additional district magistrate Vivek Mishra said, “The arms licences of the district council president and her family have been suspended on the basis of a police report. The family members have criminal cases registered against them. They are also accused of doing illegal construction work by grabbing government land. Police are investigating these cases.” Notably, after Rekha Yadav was declared the SP-backed candidate for the post of district council president in June, police in Etah had registered FIRs in four different cases of alleged land grabs and illegal construction against her husband and his elder brother. Later, they were even declared "land mafia" and their properties, including a market complex and farmhouse, were demolished. When contacted, Jogendra Yadav said, “We are being targeted by the local authorities on instructions of the state government. Earlier, we were asked to surrender our arms licence. We got a stay from the high court on the orders issued by the district administration. But, it has cancelled the arms licence of my entire family now. It includes my wife who is an elected public representative." Jogendra added, "We are a political family. The unlawful action by the district administration will compromise our security. Several BJP members have cases pending against them, but the district administration doesn't take any action. We will pursue the entire matter in court."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/arms-licences-of-sp-backed-district-council-chief-in-agra-region-her-family-suspended/articleshow/84953493.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: ‘Missing vials’ weren’t stolen, staff gave vax illegally||HYDERABAD: The Cyberabad police on Sunday wrote to the medical and health department authorities stating that the 50 vials of Covishield reported missing from the Kondapur area hospital were not stolen. Police mentioned that the missing vaccine was administered to people in violation of guidelines at the hospital. In May, the then Rangareddy district hospital superintendent, Dr M Dasarath, had informed Gachibowli police that some unidentified persons had stolen 50 vials of Covishield vaccine from the hospital premises. Police were told that the vials of Covishield were stored in the Ice Lined Refrigerator (ILR) vaccine room at the hospital and when Dr Mahesh, a pediatric counsellor, checked the stock while also checking the vaccines for children, he realised that 50 Covishield vials out of about 130 vials were missing. Based on the complaint, police registered a theft case under Section 380 of the IPC. As the ILR room’s lock was not broken, police verified the CCTV footage and questioned a ward boy who was moving suspiciously near the ILR room. As some staff who were involved in maintaining the stock and administering the vaccines were on medical leave due to contracting Covid-19, the investigation took a longer time. Recently, police recorded the statement of the staff and found out that the vaccine vials were not stolen. “From the evidence gathered, we found out that the vaccines were given to people without following the guidelines. There was no theft. We have written to the medical and health department officials informing them that there was no theft. They may conduct an internal inquiry and take appropriate departmental action. Based on their response we will proceed further with the case,” said a Gachibowli police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/missing-vials-werent-stolen-staff-gave-vax-illegally/articleshow/84957903.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: BTech dropout who seduced 300 women for extortion held||TIRUPATI: Andhra Pradesh police on Sunday arrested a B.Tech dropout, who allegedly lured and trapped nearly 300 women from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana into virtual or physical relationships, and later extorted money from them. C Prasanna Kumar, 23, a resident of Proddatur town, had discontinued his bachelor’s degree in engineering and taken to crime in 2017 to support his extravagant lifestyle. He befriended unsuspecting women through social media sites and allegedly entered into sexual relationships with dozens of them. “Prasanna Kumar was first booked by Proddatur Two Town and Three Town police in a chain-snatching case and a case of house break-in in 2017. After being released on bail, he began luring unsuspecting women, whom he met on various social media platforms, into a sexual relationship. He would then blackmail them by threatening to circulate their intimate images and videos and extort large sums of money,” Kadapa deputy superintendent of police B Sunil Kumar said. Initially, Kadapa police had arrested Prasanna Kumar about an alleged job fraud case and a house break-in case registered against him in June and July this year. It was during interrogation that police came to know about his blackmailing of women after sexually exploiting them. Sunil Kumar said Prasanna had confessed to having trapped young girls and middle-aged women in sexual relationships and had extorted lakhs from them. Kumar would trap his victims in social media platforms, lure them into a physical relationship with him and later blackmail them using images and videos of their intimate acts, the DSP said. He allegedly forced the victims to pay him hefty sums and at times and jewellery. Around 200 young girls and 100 middle-aged women from Hyderabad, Vijayawada and Kadapa fell prey to Prasanna Kumar since 2017 but not a single victim came forward to lodge a police complaint due to the fear of being exposed. Kadapa police recovered Rs 1.26 lakh cash and 30 grams of gold jewellery from the possession of the accused, and appealed to the victims to approach the police with their complaints. "He entered into a virtual relationship with nearly 300 women and had a physical relationship with several of them," said Sunil Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/btech-dropout-who-seduced-300-women-for-extortion-held/articleshow/84959796.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

---||Kochi||Probe likely to be delayed as CBI seeks infra extension||Thiruvananthapuram: The investigation into the sensational Periya double murder case is likely to get extended as the CBI probing the case has sought the extension of the infrastructural facilities provided by the state government in Kasaragod for six more months. The government had in December last year allotted two rooms at the PWD rest house in Kasaragod to the CBI investigating team to set up its camp office. On July 9 this year, the head of the special crime branch unit of the agency in the capital which is probing the case, had written to the government seeking an extension of its camp office and accommodation facilities for six more months, or till the completion of the investigation, whichever is earlier. Ever since the agency received a favourable verdict from the Supreme Court to go ahead with the investigation into the case on December 1 last year, it has been in full swing into the investigation of the case. The agency sleuths had interrogated many, including the 11 accused in the case who are housed in central prison, Kannur, who are CPM activists and sympathisers. The agency, after launching the investigation into the murder of Youth Congress activists Sarathlal and Kripesh, had expanded the scope of investigation to several local leaders of the CPM, including Kanhangad block panchayat president K Manikandan. The agency had conducted raids in the area committee office of the party in Uduma and the branch committee office in Kalliyot, and had seized several documents and also had recreated the murder of the two Youth Congress men at the incident site, as part of its investigation. The state crime branch had filed the chargesheet in the case on May 20, 2019, against 14 accused persons under sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 326, 201, 212, 120B, 118 and 302 read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code. However, the high court had pointed out several lapses on the part of the crime branch while handing over the case to the CBI. As per a circular issued by the state home department in August 2014, the CBI will be provided rooms either at the PWD rest house or any other premises for operating its camp office as identified by the agency on a rent-free basis. This facility will be allowed for a maximum of six months at a stretch, which is extended further in case the agency demands. The agency will be offered other logistical support, including vehicles, for smooth probe of the case. The agency seeks such facilities on a case-to-case basis, in the geographical area where its probe is concentrated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/probe-likely-to-be-delayed-as-cbi-seeks-infra-extension/articleshow/84955510.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Piles of garbage, sewage overflow raise risk of seasonal ailments||HYDERABAD: Amid the looming threat of a third wave of Covid-19, heaps of garbage along the roads and overflowing drains in parts of Old City pose risk to the health of residents. Residents allege that despite several complaints to the civic officials concerned, nothing has been done to maintain sanitation in their area. “The ongoing monsoon season is posing a huge risk of seasonal ailments as the garbage is not lifted regularly from the dumping sites, but no one appears to be concerned about public health,” said Jahanuma Miraj, a resident. Mohammed Ahmed, TDP, GHMC minority cell vice-president, told TOI that the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) authorities have turned a blind eye to the civic issues in the Old City, thus forcing residents to live in unhygienic surroundings. “Piles of garbage lying right in front of places of worship are causing inconvenience to the people and devotees. Garbage can be seen strewn across the road at Khilwat, Shahalibanda, Jahanuma, Hari Bowli Chaurasta, Punch Mohalla, Moosa Bowli Road, Ghansi Bazaar,” he said. At Eidi Bazaar, sewage has been overflowing for the last three months in front of a shrine. “Sewage has entered into a graveyard and this has triggered angry reactions from several people, and still no action has been taken by the civic officials to resolve the issues,” said Ahmed. Mohammed Ghouse, MIM co-corporator, Ghansi Bazaar division, told TOI that waste, debris and other civic issues need to be addressed as soon as possible. He added that every now and then authorities are urged to resolve the issues but no steps are taken to resolve them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/piles-of-garbage-sewage-overflow-raise-risk-of-seasonal-ailments/articleshow/84957942.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Youngsters carry ‘daak kanwar’ to honour farmers who died during protest||Chandigarh: At a time when the government has banned the ‘kanwar yatra’ from Haridwar and other places, young farmers from Haryana have started the ‘dak kanwar yatra’ to Tikri, the Haryana-New Delhi border where farmers are camping for the past over eight months. Kanwar is associated with the devotees of Lord Shiva. They walk from Haridwar to their village temples. The ‘dak kanwar’ is like a relay race wherein one runner will cover a particular distance and would handover the water pitcher to other participant after doing his part. Unlike previous years, these youngsters are bringing soil of their field and water of their village to offer at a statue at Tikri border. The soil is offered to a statue set up near the stage and the water is offered on the barricades of Delhi police. Notably, kanwar is the most popular event among people of Haryana, who celebrate this like a festival. According to farmers behind this event, this ‘dak kanwar’ by young farmers is a tribute to 547-odd farmers who have laid down their lives during the agitation at Singhu and Tikri borders. And the young farmers participating in the yatra are the one who used bring holy water of Ganga from Haridwar or other places during the month of ‘Shravan’ and perform prayers on ‘Shravan Shivaratri’. Jimidara Students Organisation (JSO), a team of young farmers at Tikri, had been working hard for this event for the past couple of months. Starting last Sunday when the ‘Shravan’ month began, groups of youngsters from various villages have been arriving at pillar No. 751 near main stage of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) everyday. “Besides soil and water, these boys carry the Tricolour to show solidarity with the country and here all efforts are made by JSO members, who had been visiting villages and coordinating with youngsters. All this is being done to increase participation of young. Our first group has come from Dhamtan Sahib in Jind,”said Meet Singh Maan, JSO coordinator. Dhamtan Sahib is historical village on the Punjab-Haryana border and Makrauli Kalan in Rohtak. Both these kanwars reached here first and then started our schedule, added Meet Singh Maan. Sumer Singh Nain, the young farmer who led the group from Dhamtan Sahib village, said, “We don’t see anything beyond this agitation now. And this kanwar is our contribution towards farmers agitation.” Pardeep Dhankar an SKM member camping at Tikri is among those who welcome and greet the youngsters at Tikri. “Their activities have really infused freshness into the agitation. Now these young farmers have also realized that they need to worship the soil and the ancestors who brought us into the farming and we have fight out the three laws,’’ said Dhankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/youngsters-carry-daak-kanwar-to-honour-farmers-who-died-during-protest/articleshow/84957940.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Kochi||Kerala: 28-year-old Navy officer Lt Abhishek Kumar drowns in waterfall||KOTTAYAM: A Navy officer drowned while swimming in a stream in the district. Lt Abhishek Kumar, 28, from Southern Naval Command, went missing while taking a dip in the stream near Marmala waterfalls, said his friends who were with him. They said Kumar, a native of Lucknow, was swept away in a sudden surge of water from the falls around Sunday noon. The body was fished out around 4pm by the fire and rescue unit from Erattupetta and ‘Team Nanmakoottam’, a group of rescuers based in Erattupetta. The officer, based at INS Shardul, was on holiday with seven-member team of Navy officers. Kumar had gone for swimming with four others. The strong currents built by the waterfalls, and the cold weather hampered the search operation. Erattupetta SHO said that the four were taking bath in the stream and that Kumar swam towards the waterfalls, where there were strong undercurrents and that he might have got stuck in a whirlpool. Though the others swam back to shore, Kumar went missing, said the officer. An inquest will be held on Monday morning after conducting a Covid test and the body will be released after an autopsy at Kottayam Medical College Hospital, said the officer. The deceased officer leaves behind his old parents. He had recently reported to INS Shardul for his first staff appointment. The Navy is going to order a board of inquiry into the officer’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/28-yr-old-navy-officer-drowns-in-waterfall/articleshow/84955577.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Third wave to be low in intensity, says PGI director||CHANDIGARH: A third wave of Covid-19 will be of lower magnitude than any of the previous waves, according to PGI director Prof Jagat Ram. “Serosurveys done both here and nationally indicate that antibodies are generated in almost 80% adult population in the city. Also, in PGI we have achieved more than 95% vaccination,” said Prof Jagat. He said, “If however, there is no adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour, things might turn bad.” Presently, PGI has 16 Covid patients and by coming week the OPDs are also being enhanced through telemedicine. However, there have been two cases recently of Covid deaths, though there is no increase in the count. “These cases are the ones who were admitted sometime back. But we have increased vaccination coverage for 18 years and above and this will certainly help the city in its fight against the pandemic,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US has recently compared the transmission of the delta variant with chicken pox. “So, the unprotected section of the society, including the non-vaccinated and those who were never infected are vulnerable. This implies that around 3 lakh residents in the city are at risk of being infected,” said a public health worker. In July, there have been 226 cases of Covid, which was around 1,500 in June. Three deaths were reported last month, while there were 50 deaths in June. “Till this time, more cases could have come, but due to the good vaccination coverage, the numbers have been regulated,” said Dr Kang. Compared with the second wave, the first wave progressed slowly and it took almost six months to reach the peak. “There was no vaccine available during the first wave. But with the vaccination started in the past seven months, most have been induced antibodies against the virus,” said the public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/3rd-wave-to-be-low-in-intensity-pgi-director/articleshow/84955515.cms||Shimona Kanwar

KCR also announced the implementation of the flagship Dalit Bandhu scheme as a pilot project in the poll-bound constituency from August 16. “Though the dalit population in Telangana is 20%, they hold only 13 lakh agricultural land. Their situation is worse than the tribals in this aspect. The Dalit Bandhu scheme will become a role model for the country. A new act will be passed giving it legislative powers,” said KCR. The farm loan waiver will be done from August 15 to August 31. The state cabinet also gave approvals on supporting children orphaned by Covid-19, extending the Centre’s 10% EWS quota to candidates with less than Rs 8 lakh annual income with five-year relaxation. During the meeting, the cabinet also approved to waive off tax arrears to be paid by toddy tappers and do away with taxation of toddy trees. Other important decisions of the cabinet were to bring in an act to give legality to Dalit Bandhu scheme, implement at the earliest insurance scheme for weavers and toddy tappers. The cabinet also directed officials to start disbursing Aasara pensions to the people aged between 57 and 65 years. This will benefit another 6.62 lakh new beneficiaries, taking the total number of various categories of beneficiaries availing social security pensions (Aasara pensions) to 58 lakh. The pensions would be given to only one person per family. The cabinet directed officials to implement the government’s decision to extend free power up to 250 units for saloons in the state. Training will be given by the government in the sectors they want and committees will be formed for this right from the village level. Centre for Dalit Enterprise would be set up in every district to guide and encourage dalit entrepreneurs. The cabinet directed finance secretary Ramakrishna Rao to submit details of vacancies in every department as Dalit Bandhu needs full-fledged official support. “The district minister and district collector will have to play an important role to ensure the success of the scheme. As the role of officials would be important, all the vacancies in various departments will be filled up," KCR added. A new card to be given to Dalitha Bandhu beneficiaries was examined by the cabinet which would be connected online later. They would be extended civic and other infrastructural facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-cabinet-clears-crop-loan-waiver-dalit-bandhu-scheme/articleshow/84959835.cms||Roushan Ali

Spread over 264 sqkm in Aurangabad and Jalgaon districts, the biodiversity hotspot has been witnessing rampant menace of sandalwood theft and smuggling of precious stones among other ecological issues. A team of forest department officials clashed with a group of armed sandalwood thieves in the dense Patnadevi area of the sanctuary at midnight on July 31. Taking advantage of their numbers, the thieves managed to overpower the forest department team and fled the scene, leaving behind 11kg of chopped sandalwood. Prior to this, 479 sandalwood trees were found axed and another 593 damaged in the sanctuary in the past two years. Divisional forest officer (wildlife) Vijay Satpute on Sunday said that due to manpower crunch, the forest department was struggling to ensure effective vigil in the Gautala-Autramghat wildlife sanctuary. “The Chalisgaon (wildlife) range is a sensitive area considering the widespread presence of sandalwood trees, precious stones and now the presence of tiger T3C1. The vacant posts need to be filled up at the earliest in order to put a check on smuggling incidents,” he said. When contacted, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Sunil Limaye said the vacant posts in question were likely to get filled in about a month. “The necessary follow-ups to fill the vacant posts in the forest department are on. Besides, we are planning to reorganise the manpower arrangement involving Aurangabad, Jalgaon and Dhule districts in order to ensure tight vigil across the Gautala -Autramghat wildlife sanctuary,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/forest-dept-struggles-to-keep-an-eye-on-gautala-sanctuary/articleshow/84951008.cms||Prasad Joshi

The calls made through these exchanges were never captured in the official surveillance radar of the country, she said. Apart from the local police, members of the terror squad were also involved in the exchange, which was functioning at an electric shop named ‘Phoenix Trading’. Poonguzhali said that during interrogation, the accused had disclosed that Salim, who was the key accused in similar parallel telephone exchange case detected earlier in Ernakulam and Kozhikode, was the owner of the exchange at Koratty. Salim is absconding. As per the information received by the police, the accused were converting calls by installing instruments like router CBOX voice encryptors at different locations, the DPC said. They had started this operation in March this year. Police have recovered the routers, CBOX and other connected instruments from the house of the accused.

Hina Khan (name changed), a resident of Kakrauli area in Morna block, called 112 to complain about some unsocial elements standing in the street and harassing women. But her call was picked up in the police control room in Dehradun and she was told that she should have called UP police. “It was then that I called the police station of the area. But it is a serious issue that needs to be addressed,” she said.Another villager in the area, Amit Kumar, wanted to report an accident in which the victim needed immediate medical help a few days ago.“I made several calls on dial 112. But, every time, the call reached Uttarakhand. No help reached the man till I was present at the spot. Then I left. Don’t know if he got any help or not at all,” Kumar said.Uday Veer Singh, a farmer union leader, wanted to report about a cow carcass lying near his house in Bhokarehdi village this week.“My call was received in Uttarakhand. When I told them my concern, someone over the phone told me that I should dial 0522 before 112 (0522 is Lucknow's STD code). I tried, but to no avail. Later I called the nagar panchayat office and filed a complaint.” Another resident, a local journalist, Qazi Amjad, said, “Over 12 villages in the region are facing this problem for quite some time. People don’t know where and whom to make a complaint because it is a technical fault.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/technical-glitch-keeping-residents-of-muzaffarnagar-block-out-of-emergency-response-grid/articleshow/84953603.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The traffic signal at the Club junction also has regulars on this road see red. The wall demolished, road widened and a green light to drop the traffic signal is the demand now. This narrow stretch on the Rajiv Rahadari along one of the oldest and prestigious club in the country sees heavy traffic, often moving at a snail’s pace. While the club itself was established in 1878, the Club authorities have no record of how old the 10-feet wall is. It has got a new coat of paint recently, but it hasn’t erased commuters’ fear of the wall coming crashing down during heavy rain. “The mud wall is weak and soaked wet during incessant rains. It may collapse anytime. The stability of the wall has also been affected due to heavy volume of vehicles such as trucks and buses,” Ranganath, a resident of Yapral who has been taking this road for over three decades, claimed. “Unless this 30-ft stretch is widened in the next few years we would continue to face frequent traffic jams,” T S Kulkarni, an IT professional commuting daily to Cyberabad, told TOI. Recently, a few residents of Green Sainikpuri (North East Colonies of Secunderabad) raised this issue and also tweeted to MA&UD minister K T Rama Rao and ministry of defence (MoD). “The traffic signal for the Secunderabad Club is consuming time unnecessarily. Hardly three to five vehicles come out from Club’s Gate-1 entry. The Club management can close Gate-1 and use another from the rear for the convenience of lakhs of commuters,” a resident said. Traffic police head constable M Ganeshan, deputed at Secunderabad Club junction and regulating traffic for the past five years, said, “We have allotted only 17 seconds for traffic signal for vehicles coming from Secunderabad Club. High volume of traffic passes through this stretch during peak hours between 8am and noon. As a result, we are operating signals manually at this junction. A few months ago, a small portion of the mud wall collapsed after an unidentified vehicle hit it. It was rebuilt again.” The club authorities refused to comment on the wall. Repeated attempts to reach them physically at the premises and over telephone for a version failed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/commuters-want-secbad-club-wall-razed-to-end-traffic-bottleneck/articleshow/84958000.cms||Sunil Mungara

They allege that despite proposing this project under the Strategic Road Development Project (SRDP), nothing substantial has been done as the government failed to procure land from the Secunderabad Club and other private owners. “Demarcation to acquire the land of Secunderabad Club’s compound wall was also completed. Later, it was put on hold due to the financial crisis. “Now, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) has taken it up and prepared a ‘detailed project report’ (DPR),” a senior official of the GHMC Secunderabad Zone told TOI. According to HMDA sources the DPR will be completed in another five months and will be forwarded to Telangana finance department. After this process tenders will be floated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/plea-to-widen-road-from-jbs-to-orr/articleshow/84957989.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||FIITJEE told to refund Rs 4.3L fee, pay compensation||Hyderabad: A district consumer forum here has directed FIITJEE to refund Rs 4.35 lakh and pay Rs 50,000 compensation to a complainant, whose son discontinued the course a week after joining it. The forum said that FIITJEE is running a coaching centre under the name and style of an educational institution and escape from the liability of refunding the fee collected while trying to enrich itself. S Srinivas, the complainant, submitted that after seeing advertisements of FIITJEE on various platforms and talking to the staff of the college, he joined his son in FIITJEE, Saifabad on January 10, 2019, in the ‘Pinnacle Two Year Integrated Class Room Coaching Program’ by paying entire two years fee—Rs 4,37,460, in advance in four instalments. On June 6, 2019, classes commenced and about two weeks after attending classes, Srinivas said his son expressed dissatisfaction with the teaching techniques and lack of support from the faculty. On June 22, he sought for withdrawal of his son’s admission and requested for refund of fees after withholding the nominal administration charges, which was denied by the college citing rules and regulations on the declaration form. Claiming that he had to face severe hardships as the college refused to refund the fee and had to borrow money to join his son in class 11, he filed this complaint seeking compensation. The opposite parties, in their written version, pleaded that the complaint is not maintainable because as an educational institution it does not come under the purview of the Consumer Protection Act. They further said that the complainant and his son signed the declarations, which mentioned that no refund would be made if a student leaves college, for any reason, before completion of the course. During the trial, the bench noticed that while educational institutions are exempted from paying any GST, the college in question collected Rs 55,534 as GST on the course fee. “This implies that the opposite party is not exempt from payment of service tax. Accordingly, the opposite party does not fit into the definition of the educational institution as per the finance act,” the bench said. The forum said that the opposite party had failed to put forth any evidence that the seat offered to the complainant’s son is still lying vacant, and failed to provide any regulations or guidelines under which it is entitled to collect the full course fee. “This act of collecting full course fee in advance certainly amounts to unfair trade practice which has to be curtailed,” the bench added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fiitjee-told-to-refund-rs-4-3l-fee-pay-compensation/articleshow/84957976.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Chandigarh||Farm activists spare BJP’s Tiranga Yatra after SKM appeal||Chandigarh/Bathinda: The Haryana unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched its Tiranga Yatra on Sunday, even as Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is spearheading the ongoing agitation against he three farm laws, urged farmers from Haryana not to oppose the saffron party’s campaign. SKM said the BJP was using the national flag for political interests and as part of its “devious plans”, and the yatra was a conspiracy by the party to provoke farmers. The BJP’s yatra started from Bahal in Bhiwani and went to Loharu on the first day. State agriculture minister J P Dalal, who represents Loharu seat, had organised the rally, while Haryana BJP president Om Parkash Dhankar flagged it off. He even rode a tractor with the BJP workers on way from Behal to Loharu. This was the BJP’s first major political event in eight months of farmers’ agitation. The farmers had announced to obstruct the rally, but spared the event on instructions from SKM. Dhankar said: “This turnout is a mirror to our political detractors who misleaded the farmers. This Tiranga Yatra is a tribute to the martyrs of Kargil and other wars. We started this yatra with paying floral tributes to Shaheed Bhagat Singh. I dare the opposition parties who have ruled in the past to provide details of an agriculture produce other than wheat, paddy, and mustard oil. It is due to the present government’s efforts that farmers are getting MSP, even after the implementation of the three laws.” The SKM, while urging farmers to stay away from rally, said it wanted to ensure the dignity of the national flag, but added that all other programmes of BJP and JJP would continue to face opposition. Tiranga Yatra will continue till August 14. SKM functioanries Yogendra Yadav, Abhimanyu Kohad and Ravi Azad took to social media on Sunday to ask farmers not to oppose the yatra. Meanwhile, at the BJP event, Dhankar said the Tiranga Yatra will cover all 90 assembly constituencies of Haryana. Addressing the marchers assembled in a green belt, Dalal said Dhanakar had worked a lot for farmers’ welfare during his term as agriculture minister. Recounting the contribution of the BJP-JJP government, he mentioned the MSP on maize and other crops, “representation to all communities, and fairness in jobs”. Dhankar and Dalal praised the turnout but the single-colour tractors raised many eyebrows and created a doubt that these were sourced for the event especially. A few BJP workers drove their own tractors as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-activists-spare-bjps-tiranga-yatra-after-skm-appeal/articleshow/84957973.cms||---

The move is following the suspicion that a conspiracy among some of the teaching and non-teaching faulty in the varsity has led to the missing of the answer scripts and its mysterious reappearance after two weeks. According to sources, a group of faculties in the Sanskrit department conspired to hide the answer sheets to trap another official in the department so that the varsity would hold the latter responsible for the disappearance of the answer scripts and initiate action. Police are taking statements from many officials, including teachers, and are likely to seek permission to do the polygraph tests on five faculty members . However, police are yet to officially confirm this. “Police have been probing all angles and have collected fingerprints from the cabin in which the missing answer sheets were found. CCTV visuals were also collected and statements of several faculties were taken. We are yet to confirm how the answer sheets that went missing reappeared in the cabin in the varsity,” said police sources. If the polygraph tests have to be administered, police will have to get the consent from those who have to undergo it. Sources said that police are likely to take actions with regard to this. Meanwhile, the answer sheets were returned to the varsity so that they could complete the final tabulation of marks and release the results of the students. Around 276 answer sheets of the third-semester examination of Sanskrit literature PG students that was held in January were found missing in July second week when the varsity authorities asked the Sanskrit department to submit the grade sheets for the purpose of tabulating the final results. However, a few days after a police case was registered, the missing sheets was reported to have found in the varsity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cops-may-do-polygraph-test-on-staff/articleshow/84955642.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The administration on Sunday issued a statement said that the three premium water villa projects were identified in Minicoy (150 keys, project cost of Rs 319 cr), Suheli (110 keys, Rs 247 cr) and Kadmat (110 keys, Rs 240 cr) islands, based on comprehensive location suitability analysis, technical & financial feasibility and project structuring. Earlier, concerns were raised from various corners about the viability of constructing water villas in the ecologically-fragile region. “Scientific approach adopted in each stage of the projects’ finalisation ensures that it strikes a balance between protection of the fragile ecosystem of corals and the need to improve livelihood opportunities of the islanders,” said the statement issued from the office of the collector and secretary (Tourism), UT of Lakshadweep. It further added that a joint survey was done by representatives from National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), MoEFCC and NITI Aayog, who visited Lakshadweep during Nov 2018 for site assessment and confirmation. The total number of keys for water villas matched the capacity numbers assessed by NCSCM, which was further strengthened by the holistic development master plan, the statement said. It added that all applicable clearances required for the projects prior to the construction are given upfront, including CRZ clearances. “National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) was engaged to prepare environment impact assessment Report (EIA) required for CRZ clearance. In February, 2020, LCZMA gave its recommendations for the 3 projects, based on which the MoEFCC appraised & granted CRZ clearance for the ambitious water villas projects in its 274th EAC (CRZ) meeting held on Sept 30, 2020,” it said. It added that the administration conducted consultations with all stakeholders. “In Sept 2019, the local panchayats issued NOC for the proposed ecotourism projects at Kadmat, Minicoy & Suheli islands in totality, even for the bar licence,” the statement said. Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faisal said that people were not against the Niti Aayog project as long as it was executed with proper environmental clearances and assurance of employment opportunity for islanders. “We are not against development. We are yet to get a clarity on the level of assessment of environmental impact conducted by the administration. Administration should conduct proper studies before implementing such projects and they should ensure that the islanders receive employment opportunities,” he said. The administration said that the global tender for these 3 projects can be downloaded from August 1 from lakshadweeptourism.com & lakshadweep.gov.in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lakshadweep-admin-floats-global-tenders-for-ecotourism-projects/articleshow/84955685.cms||---

The 22-year-old victim from Andheri lost the money that she had saved to pay her hostel and college fees in the Netherlands. The police registered an FIR against an unknown person on July 28. The student had resorted to the internet search to gain information on how her fund transfer limit could be increased. The scammer made the woman download the ‘AnyDesk’ app, a remote desktop application that provides access to personal computers and other devices running the host application. “We have sought the fraudulent transaction details from the nationalised bank to track the money trail to nab the accused. Also, the cyber team is tracking the call details to locate the scammer,” said a police officer from the Andheri police station. The money was fraudulently transferred between July 27 and 28 in three transactions. The first two transactions were done on July 27 for Rs 99,999 and Rs 3,11,800. The third was completed the next day and Rs 25,000 was moved out before the victim called the bank and blocked her account. In the complaint, the victim said: “I lost the money after the scammer claimed to be a bank tele-caller and made me download the app to increase my banking transaction limit for Rs1 lakh and above. I came across the number through a Google search and I found it under the name of the nationalised bank. I disconnected the call and uninstalled the app on when I started receiving transactions alerts after money got debited from my account.” A police officer said the transactions were fraudulently credited to a bank account in the name of Lokesh Kumar Shah and to e-wallets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-student-finds-out-online-fraud-is-just-a-call-away-loses-rs-4-7l/articleshow/84958095.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

Accordingly, NMPML started operating a fewer number of buses from Sunday. NMPML officials said they have rolled out a total of 52 buses in two phases on city roads during the last three weeks. As the weekend restrictions are in place due to Covid, the footfall of passengers is low on these days, especially on Sundays. “Considering this, we have decided to operate fewer buses on Sundays. We operated only 40 buses instead of 52 buses,” said NMPML officials. “By noon, our daily revenue collection through the sale of tickets on weekdays is over Rs 1 lakh, but it is only around Rs 7,000 by noon on Sunday. This is leading us to incur heavy losses on these days,” said officials. “The situation is similar on the government holidays. The footfall of passengers is also low on government holidays. Hence, apart from Sundays, we have decided to operate fewer buses on government holidays too,” said the officials. Currently, NMPML operates 52 buses on 12 routes from two bus depots, Tapovan and Nashik Road bus depots. These 12 routes have over 150 bus stops. NMPML has plans to increase the number of buses on various routes there is no third wave of Covid. The call on increasing the buses will be taken after a fortnight.

A residential site measuring 500 square yards in Aerocity fetched Rs 1.93 crore while a booth in Sector 61 went for Rs 1.15 crore as Gmada fetched Rs 417 crore by selling 57 sites in the e-auction concluded late on Monday night. Gmada had offered 113 commercial and residential sites worth Rs 800 crore, out of which only 57 sites worth Rs 417 crore were auctioned. The residential plot of 500 square yards, which fetched Rs 1.93 crore had a reserve price of Rs 1.40 crore and was auctioned for just Rs 53 lakh and a booth fetched Rs 38 lakh more than the reserve price of Rs 77 lakh to be sold at Rs 1.15 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gmada-to-hold-draw-of-lots-for-showrooms-in-it-city-on-aug-17/articleshow/84955739.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Centre accepts PGI inputs on ways to counter illnesses caused by air pollution||Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: The ministry of health and family welfare has accepted the “National health adaptation plan on air pollution,” prepared for states/UTs by PGI, which was recently recognised as the centre of excellence on air pollution related illnesses. The plan envisages identification of vulnerable areas (using AQI) and vulnerable population, besides preparing a disease calendar. Union minister of health and family welfare, Mansukh Mandaviya and Dr Bharati Pawar, minister of state, unveiled the ‘National health adaptation plans on air pollution” along with infographics on air pollution and health during the 112thannual day celebrations of the National Centre for Disease Control. The Health Adaptation Plan on Air Pollution and infographics were developed under the “National programme on climate change and human health.” Institutions which played a key role in development of the plan and infographics include the department of community medicine and school of public Health, PGIMER; department of environment studies, Panjab University, Chandigarh; AIIMS, New Delhi and V P Patel Chest, New Delhi along with the Centre of environmental and occupational health, climate change and health at NCDC, New Delhi. Through graphic visual representation, the plan has been prepared as a handbook that outlines the role of health professionals in tackling air pollution related health problems. “We have been able to convey through visuals the impact of air pollution on health and how the health sector should be prepared for it,” said Dr Ravindra Khaiwa from PGI. He prepared the handbook along with Dr Suman Mor from Panjab University. Expressing his appreciation, Mandaviya said in his message, that the documents focus on addressing health issues due to air pollution-related illnesses, including cardiopulmonary and allergic health problems. He mentioned that these documents would help and guide states/UTs on how the health sector could coordinate with non-health sectors while addressing challenging health problems arising due to exposure to air pollution and at different levels of air quality index (AQI). The plan suggests setting up of a committee on air pollution and health in the hospital, to preferably involve health officials from the departments of medicine, respiratory, medicine, paediatrics, cardiology, neurology, endocrinology etc, including emergency and nursing department. It also highlights the need for preparations for logistics, drugs and equipment that may be required to address such health problems, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular emergencies. The plan highlights the need for identification of vulnerable areas, selection of air pollution hotspots as per AQI levels, vulnerable population less covering peoople less than five years of age, adolescents, pregnant women and the elderly. It also recommends surveillance on illness to help understand health problems in the area, conduct vulnerability mapping and prepare a disease calendar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-accepts-pgi-inputs-on-ways-to-counter-illnesses-caused-by-air-pollution/articleshow/84955821.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Justice Bharati Dangre passed the direction while hearing the plea of Ajit Dewale for anticipatory bail. The complaint by the Bank of India’s Mahud branch officer lodged at Sangola police station stated that on April 16, the bank was to close at 4pm due to the prevailing SOP, hence the main shutter was lowered and customers inside permitted to complete their transactions. The complaint said around 4.10pm, Dewale gained entry from the main shutter and started banging on the glass door. When a peon told him the banking hours were over and he cannot get entry, he hurled abuses. The branch officer also attempted to pacify Dewale and told him to return the next day. But Dewale did not desist and continued banging and broke the glass door worth Rs 25,000. Dewale was booked for assault or criminal force to a public servant, criminal intimidation and damage to public property. Before the HC on June 27, Dewale’s advocate Rahul Kadam conceded that the act committed by him is unpardonable and that he is sorry for his outrageous behaviour. Kadam said his client wanted to send money to his aunt who was suffering from Covid-19 in Nashik and therefore had rushed to the bank unaware that the timings were till 4pm. He said Dewale had no intention to commit any offence or deter the branch officer from discharging his duty. After consulting with Dewale, Kadam said he is ready to contribute Rs 10,000 to the CM’s relief fund “for dealing with the pandemic and this is a small token for expressing his regret”. Accepting the statement as an undertaking to the court, Justice Dangre granted him two weeks to deposit the amou-nt and submit the receipt to the investigating officer. “In the wake of the allegations levelled, custodial interrogation of the applicant is unwarranted,” she added, directing that in the ev-ent of arrest, Dewale be releas-ed on “furnishing personal bo-nd of Rs 20,000 with one or two sureties of the like amount”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-tells-man-who-broke-bank-door-to-pay-rs-10k-to-cm-fund/articleshow/84958180.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The court also directed the joint commissioner of transport to monitor the action taken by RTOs in this regard with periodical reports. The court also directed the RTOs not to issue fitness certificates without verifying fare meters installed in autos and taxis in Madurai and directed the authorities to ensure that the autos are collecting fares by operating fare meters and not demanding more money. A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed, “Though the petitioner may have a personal interest in the petition, we consider him as a responsible person who has brought to the notice of this court an information and nothing more. It is not clear as to why RTOs have not taken any action on the representation of the petitioner and not even cared to respond to the request made by the joint commissioner who is a superior officer.” The court passed the order while disposing a public interest litigation filed by A Jahir Hussain who sought RTOs not to issue fitness certificates to autos without fare meter calibration certificate in the district.  The petitioner stated that as per Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, fare meters are fixed in rental autos and taxis. As per Rule 177(5), any repair or adjustment of meters can only be done by a government approved licensed technician. The petitioner stated that he is an authorized person who has been certifying calibration meters. He stated that the auto owners are not approaching him for calibration certificate and it was found that the three RTOs in the district were issuing fitness certificates without insisting on calibration certificates. He stated that after he submitted a representation, the Madurai region joint commissioner for transport directed RTOs to enquire into the same and do the needful in the matter. However, no action was taken till now. “It goes without saying that calibration of fare meter in auto or taxi is very important to be taken note of by the authorities because travelling public who are availing the services are likely to be cheated and have to pay more money,” observed the judges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-orders-crackdown-on-overloaded-autos/articleshow/84955819.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The offer was advertised by PSA fish stall, which has a chain of shops throughout the city, at its Bibikulam branch, on social media. “I bought my fish from Anna Nagar, but could not resist the offer. So I came all the way to buy some crabs,’’ said K John Philip, who was one of the first customers. Jaffer, owner of the shop, said they did not witness any surge in customers but raked in better sales as most of their regular customers, who usually bought fish for less than Rs 500, bought fish for Rs 500 or more to avail the offer. “People who usually purchase for less than Rs 500 purchased more this Sunday, so the fish also sold faster,” he said. The customers who availed themselves of the offer were given tokens to fuel up from a local l bunk. “It was a very good move as distributing fuel in cans or bottles could have led to problems of safety,” said K Chandran who purchased fish for Rs 600.“Fuel has become as expensive, so this was an offer which was irresistible,” said Sivaranjani who came to the shop early on Sunday. Meanwhile, in Dindigul, a meat stall gave away silverware to customers on Sunday as Aadi offer. Ananth mutton stall in Chinnalapatti gave away a vessel worth Rs 100 for a kilogram of mutton which was given at a discounted rate of Rs 690 and a smaller one for halfa-kg. Boneless mutton was sold at Rs 800 per kg. Virumaraj, owner of Anand Mutton stall, said that the offers brought good revenue, as more people came forward to buy meat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/fish-buyers-for-rs-500-get-a-litre-of-petrol-free/articleshow/84955857.cms||Padmini Sivarajah

The incident happened when the complainant was heading towards Chhatrapati Chowk from Kalewadi Phata. “The woman was approached by the suspect, accompanied by the minor. The suspect told the woman that the minor had stolen Rs2 lakh from his house, wishing to go to Mumbai,” inspector Abhijit Jadhav of the Wakad police told TOI. “The suspect showed the woman currency notes of Rs500 and agreed to give a share of it to her if they take it off the boy. The woman fell for the bait,” Jadhav said. Jadhav added, “During the conversation, the man told her that wearing gold ornaments is risky and she should not do so. He told her to remove the ornaments and keep them in her purse. Believing the suspect, the woman removed her gold ornaments. The man pretended to wrap up the ornaments in a handkerchief and gave it back to the woman.” The woman in her FIR stated that the suspect gave her a bundle of currency notes with a note of Rs500 and hurriedly left. When the woman checked the bundle, she found few blank papers under it before realizing that her ornaments were missing as well. The police have filed a case under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. Assistant inspector Avinash Pawar is investigating the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/conman-minor-divert-womans-attention-steal-ornaments-worth-rs60k/articleshow/84958181.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The app was necessary as the sheer number of the rowdy elements in the city made it difficult for higher officials to monitor their movement.City police commissioner Prem Anand Sinha said that the same application is being extended to monitor the habitual offenders involved in crime activities such as house break-in, thefts, robberies and chain snatching to bring down the number of crime incidents.“The application is very useful in monitoring the status of rowdy elements. All the police officers are religiously updating every status without any delay. We are extending to monitor habitual offenders. We have already started updating their details. We are hopeful that it would help us curb crimes,” he said.He said that crime incidents came down during the Covid-19 lockdown period. However, there was a spurt in the number of house burglary incidents recently. But it has been brought under control with the arrest of a couple of thieves. A key offender was arrested based on matching his fingerprint details with the police records. It led to cracking of more than a dozen cases.Every detail of habitual offenders including their modus operandi, case details and their present status will be updated in the application, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/police-mobile-app-to-also-monitor-habitual-offenders/articleshow/84955868.cms||V Devanathan

On Sunday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray inaugurated a 2.9km flyover connecting Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Marg and Sion-Panvel highway. Work on the six-lane bridge was initially expected to be completed by January 2019, but got delayed due to a change in design so that a connector till the Deonar dumping ground could be added. All vehicles coming from Eastern Express Highway and Santacruz-Chembur Link Road can use the flyover, which is also expected to ease heavy vehicle traffic since the bridge is a crucial connector to highways leading towards the Konkan and Bengaluru. In his speech after the inauguration, the CM said, “Earlier, even I did not feel like passing through this stretch looking at the ongoing work, but now with the construction of this flyover, motorists can bypass the traffic below. I just have a small request to the BMC: the surface of the flyover should be made smoother.” Locals have heartily welcomed the flyover. Rajkumar Sharma, chairman of the Chembur-based Advanced Locality Management and Networking Action Committee (ALMANAC), said traffic along the stretch had become too heavy and so the flyover will be a huge relief for motorists. “During our ALM meetings, we had discussed a safe pedestrian crossing along the route as vehicles moved very fast. The area leading to the Deonar abattoir and also Shivaji Nagar had become extremely congested. We are happy that this flyover is finally ready.” Earlier, controversy had flared over the naming of the flyover. Ultimately, on July 29, a proposal was cleared at a civic works committee meeting to name it after Shivaji Maharaj. But the name is yet to be approved by the BMC's general body, which is expected to meet in the coming days. The construction cost of the flyover was Rs 580 crore. The flyover is expected to bring relief to traffic on Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road, which is used by motorists heading towards Navi Mumbai, Lonavala and further to Pune. Following the inauguration, Congress corporator Ravi Raja, who is leader of opposition in the BMC, alleged that he was not invited despite protocol. “Group leaders were expected to be given invitations to such events, which happen every time. The leader of opposition post has an important place in a democracy. Also, the government has given statutory status to the leader of opposition in corporations by law.” Watch Ghatkopar- Mankhurd Flyover: How this flyover in Mumbai will reduce travel time by over 30 min||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ghatkopar-to-mankhurd-bridge-cuts-half-hour-ride-to-3-minutes/articleshow/84958240.cms||Richa Pinto

The baby went missing while she was sleeping with her mother in the courtyard of the house. The autopsy report says that the infant was killed by an animal. It is suspected that some wild animal picked up the child and slipped away. This is the second wild animal attack on a child in the district. On July 29, a three-year-old girl was killed in a similar manner in Maigalganj area of the district. Both areas fall under the social forestry zone but are over 50 km apart. After the baby Shivani’s parents had lodged a missing complaint at Phoolbehad police station, Kheri SSP Vijay Dhull had deployed two teams to comb the area. A team led by Inspector Shyam Narayan Singh found the body. Narayan Singh told TOI, “Shivani’s house is on the fringe of the village and is surrounded by agricultural fields. A number of carnivores like jackals, wolves and leopards lurk amid the cane crops which are ready for harvest. Recently, a pack of wolves killed two goats at the village.” Police have asked the forest department to run awareness drives in the villages and urge them not to let children sleep in the open as a wild animal may attack them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/partially-eaten-body-of-9-month-old-girl-found-2nd-wild-animal-attack-in-3-days/articleshow/84951636.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||Spread easy to stop; mosquito control and awareness critical||Pune: Compared to the now pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the Zika virus is not a widespread threat to public health, and can easily be controlled through vector-control programmes and public participation. Clean surroundings, for a start, can greatly help curb spread, experts have said. Zika spreads mainly through mosquitoes, but it can also be transmitted via sexual contact. Its fatality rate is very low and only one in four people develops symptoms. Zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito that also transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever.“Compared to SARS-CoV-2, Zika virus infection is not a major public health challenge. It’s a manifestation of an increase in human-animal interface, due to reduced forest cover and disruption of ecological balance,” said clinical epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee. Both dengue and chikungunya are endemic to Pune and many other cities in Maharashtra; they flare up after the rains. Banerjee said, “Mosquitoes have been a perennial problem for cities like Pune that have water bodies with massive hyacinth growth. Trash piles also aid in growth.”Quick diagnostics to pick up Zika virus infection is the need of the hour, experts said. Its symptoms are difficult to distinguish from signs of dengue, such as fever, rash and muscle pain. “Most cases are asymptomatic and all symptomatic cases are self-limiting with almost no mortality,” Banerjee said.A key concern is the link between Zika virus infection in pregnant women and brain defects in newborns. “Pregnant women, particularly during the first three months of pregnancy, should be protected from mosquito bites,” Banerjee said. Infection in pregnant women in the first trimester has been associated with microcephaly in the newborn. The virus can also be transmitted via blood transfusions and mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy and delivery (perinatal transmission).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/spread-easy-to-stop-mosquito-control-and-awareness-critical/articleshow/84958215.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Estimated earnings off mark from Kerala’s actual revenue||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Exposing the inaccuracies in anticipating and collecting revenue of the state, the figures in the last five years from 2016 to 2021 show that the difference between estimated earnings and actual earnings is a whopping Rs 72,608.54 crore. The government has been citing multiple reasons for not being able to meet the estimated figures, but the widest gap between the estimated and actual revenue was as high as Rs 25,130.04 crore in the financial year 2019-20. The estimated earnings for 2019-20 was Rs 1,15,354.71 crore, and the actual earnings were only Rs 90,224.67 crore that year. This huge gap in 2019-20 was despite former finance minister T M Thomas Isaac, in his budget speech, predicting an increase of 30% in the revenue earnings for 2019-20. Finance minister K N Balagopal said in the assembly last week that the crisis that emanated from the unexpected demonitization and the technical issues that surfaced when the goods and services tax was implemented had adversely affected the revenue earnings of the state. In addition, the finance minister also cited the floods of 2018 and 2019 and the Covid-19 pandemic as crucial factors in revenue earnings reduction. Interestingly, when the LDF government came to power in 2016, Isaac in his white paper had cited lapses of the UDF government in collecting revenue as the reason for shortcomings in earnings to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. However, regarding the huge gap in the last five years, sources cite insufficient preparations by the state government while switching over to the GST system and lapses in collecting the tax dues, including VAT dues, as reasons for this difference in revenue earnings. Amidst the shortage in revenue earnings, the net public debt of the state had increased in the last one year by 9.6% than the projected figures in the revised budget estimates for 2020-21. The net public debt had increased from Rs 30,499.97 crore as anticipated in the revised budget estimates to Rs 33,429.88 crore, showing an increase of Rs 2,929.91 crore. Though the expenditure of the state was projected as Rs 1,28,382.63 crore in the budget estimates, the actual expenditure for 2020-21 had closed at Rs 1,41,946.24 crore, a difference of Rs 13,563.61 crore. Excluding state GST, sales tax and VAT, the state had earned Rs 3,375.50 crore from stamps and registration in the Covid-19 year, more than the anticipated Rs 3,061.98 crore in the budget estimates. The state also earned Rs 3,272.91 crore, only marginally less than the estimated Rs 3,367.11 crore, from motor vehicle tax in the last financial year. As the expenditure remains as expected but the revenue receipts not meeting expectations, the state will face a grim financial situation unless there is more financial discipline, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/estimated-earnings-off-mark-from-states-actual-revenue/articleshow/84955984.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Dehradun||Haridwar: Didn’t know how to take swabs, lab staff tell SIT||HARIDWAR: At least 34 students from a PM Skill Development Centre in Haridwar who were “placed” in Haryana-based Delphia labs to conduct Covid tests during Kumbh have told the Special Investigation Team (SIT) that they had performed “only a handful of tests” and received no medical training. Many of them admitted that they didn’t know how to take swabs, investigation officer Rajesh Sah told TOI, adding that the number of tests shown against each student was “highly exaggerated”. This comes just weeks after the director of Delphia labs — which had a tie-up with another lab allegedly involved in the forged Covid tests — was sent to police custody. SIT had found that Delphia labs had provided staff to conduct tests and upload forged test reports on the ICMR portal. While recording statements of the staff, SIT found that 34 of them were students of PM Skill Development Centre — who were hired on contract for a month. Trainer of the centre Vandana Kumari told TOI that the students had not received any training. According to Sah, apart from these students, Delphia labs had hired 34 workers from Haryana. Nearly a lakh fake tests were conducted in Kumbh in April. In one instance, a single phone number was used to register over 50 people while one antigen test kit was shown to have tested 700 samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/didnt-know-how-to-take-swabs-lab-staff-tell-sit/articleshow/84961584.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Got no leaving certificate? Private school pupils can still get admission||MUMBAI: The BMC’s education department has directed civic and aided schools in the city to admit students from class 1 to 10, moving from private schools, even if they do not have the mandatory school leaving certificates. Due to pandemic-induced financial constraints, parents are shifting their children from private to public schools this academic year. Schools are denying school leaving certificates to students whose fees have not been cleared. Aided schools were not admitting such students for lack of school leaving certificates. BMC education officer Raju Tadvi directed aided and civic schools to admit students based on birth certificates. In June, the state had issued a circular directing aided schools not to deny admissions to class 9 and 10 students.

He is also a twice Covid survivor. Due to his immobile condition we could not take him anywhere for the jab. He will benefit if doorstep vaccination could be conducted,” said Shankha Subhra Chaudhury, a resident of Salt Lake IA block. “My mother is 87-years-old and a cancer survivor. She is not in a position to go outside. She took the first dose sitting inside the car but has not been given the second yet. It would be very helpful if doorstep vaccination is introduced here,” said Baisakhi Chattoraj, a resident of New Town. The story is similar for many others. “I had suffered a fractured shoulder and was also ill. I managed to get the first dose only a few months back when a camp was organised in our locality. It would be of much help for me and many others if doorstep vaccination facility is introduced,” said septuagenarian Krishna Chakraborty, another Salt Lake resident.  “We had earlier sought permission from health department authorities on this issue and will do so again,” said an NKDA official. Meanwhile, Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials said they were lacking required manpower to conduct such door drives. “In some selective cases we were bringing in persons in ambulances to the civic body run hospitals for the jab,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/home-jab-demand-in-bidhannagar-too/articleshow/84956043.cms||Suman Chakraborti

They said that there is no proper drainage system on the bridge for the rainwater to reach the river. The rainwater has logged into the fields and due to this, they are left fallow thereby depriving livelihood to some farmers. The stagnant water in the fields have become a possible ground for mosquito breeding and locals fear contracting vector borne diseases like malaria and dengue. “Moreover, the interior road is halfway done and there is no proper access to the road. Adding to the misery, there are no street lights operational in the fixtures here,” said a local. The locals had requested local MLA Isidore Fernandes sometime back to resolve the issue but nothing has been done, said Luiza Pereira, a local. She added that they have been suffering due to this problem for almost two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/faulty-bridge-work-damaged-fields-in-galgibaga-locals/articleshow/84960105.cms||---

Chennithala, who was one of the petitioners against the government decision to withdraw the case, wrote to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan that the government should appoint a special public prosecutor to ensure independent and judicious trial in the wake of the government itself attempting to withdraw the case. He suggested that the government should appoint Suresan, who had appeared as special public prosecutor in the Soumya murder case and actor rape case as the special public prosecutor in this case too. He said that appointing any other counsel from the government’s panel who had tried to side with the government move to withdraw the case instead of discharging their duties would turn the whole trial into a sham and would sabotage the public interest in the case. Chennithala reminded that the Supreme Court had made scathing remarks against the government when it had tried to withdraw the case. Chennithala has joined the legal battle from the lower court till the apex court against the government’s decision to withdraw the case. The opposition has been demanding that general education minister V Sivankutty should resign in the wake of the court asking all the six including him to face trial in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/appoint-special-public-prosecutor-ramesh-to-cm/articleshow/84956090.cms||---

Officials from the PMC said besides their 200 sites, private hospitals too helped increase pace of coverage. Data from the district health office showed that around 6.52 lakh beneficiaries in PMC limits have been given the second dose. In Pune rural, around 16.58 lakh beneficiaries have received their first jab and 6.72 lakh have been given their second. In Pimpri Chinchwad, 8.4 lakh people have received the first shot and 2.76 lakh have received their second shot. Suryakant Devkar, PMC’s immunisation officer, said an increase in sites helped take the jabs to all wards. “Private hospitals also helped reduce our burden. Around six to seven lakh beneficiaries have been vaccinated at private sites,” he said. Devkar said the civic body is now focused on completing second-dose coverage. “We have already diverted 60% of doses to cover second-dose beneficiaries,” he said. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “Out of the total number of private hospitals, over 85% in PMC limits lead in coverage, which has helped push momentum.” On August 1 (Sunday being a vaccination holiday for many sites) and due to Covishield shortages, only 7,706 people got their jabs in the district — one of the lowest daily totals ever. PMC officials said they will be holding only Covaxin drives on Monday from six centres. The PCMC said it will hold Covishield drives across 59 sites, with focus on second-dose coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/71-of-target-population-in-pmc-areas-given-first-shot/articleshow/84958254.cms||Piyush Bhusari

PCMC additional commissioner Vikas Dhakane said the KIOSK token system has played a vital role in their earlier experiments across few sites to boost vaccination among PCMC limits’ residents and to implement a transparent way of token distribution. “Owing to the success of the earlier experimental token system that we implemented in July, we have decided to implement it for all the 64 civic-run vaccination sites. Now, beneficiaries can book their slot via kiosk-based registration across the civic body’s eight zonal offices and few major vaccination sites,” he said. —Piyush Bhusari||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-to-opt-for-100-token-system-for-vaccination/articleshow/84958279.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Delhi||Delhi: Dispose of e-waste properly, departments told||NEW DELHI: Most of the state government departments, which are bulk consumers of electronics and electrical equipment, don’t have any specific management plan and records for e-waste. These usually end up in the informal sector. Delhi government’s environment department has now directed all the government departments, including autonomous bodies and PSUs, to auction the e-waste generated by them through authorised collection centres or dismantlers for proper disposal. Meanwhile, a committee has also been constituted to inventorise e-waste generation in the national capital. A recent order issued by the environment department stated that all government departments, autonomous bodies, institutions and healthcare facilities of the government, that are bulk consumers of e-waste, are required to auction or channelise the e-waste generated by them through authorised collection centre or dismantlers or refurbishers and comply with the provisions of the said rules for sound management and disposal as per the E-waste Management Rules, 2016. The latest order has been passed after the approval of the environment minister of Delhi, Imran Hussain. A senior official of the department said”: “Majority of the e-waste in Delhi is generated through government departments as they use significant quantum of electrical or electronic equipment. However, as most of the departments do not have specific management plans, the e-waste goes to the informal sector. The latest order could be a game changer as bulk consumers will have to dispose the waste in a proper manner.” The government official added that there is presently no government data on e-waste generation in the national capital. As E-waste Management Rules, 2016, stipulates that inventorisation of e-waste generation is to be done by the concerned state pollution control committee, a panel comprising officials from the Union ministries of electronics, environment and forest and climate change, Central Pollution Control Board and Delhi Pollution Control Committee has been constituted to finalise methodology to inventorise e-waste generation. Considering the growing e-waste in Delhi, three eco parks for e-waste management are being planned in each of the municipal corporation areas of Delhi. A proposal has been sent to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal for approval. “A report by ASSOCHAM in 2018 stated that the e-waste generation in the city was around 2 lakh tonne per annum. Considering the growth rate, the present e-waste generated in Delhi would be approximately 2-3 lakh tonne in a year. While another estimate from experts claim that around 95% of the total e-waste generated in the country goes to the informal sector. By developing these parks, we want to provide infrastructure, training and tools to operators in the informal sector for grooming them to become formal recyclers. It will also help in reducing the adverse impact on environment and health due to the polluting technologies used in the unorganised sector for recycling e-waste,” said a government official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dispose-of-e-waste-properly-depts-told/articleshow/84956085.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

There was a marginal increase in the active Covid-19 cases to 1,961 from 1,940 on Saturday. This was mainly because, at 208, the number of patients discharged on the day was fewer than the fresh cases. In another positive development, the district didn’t report any Covid-19 death on the day.The virus spread and spike appeared to be more or less uniform in rural and urban areas, with the city corporation limits reporting 51% of the cases and rural pockets logging the remaining 49% of the cases. In rural areas, Sulur, Karamadai, Thudiyalur and Madukkarai continued to record an increase in fresh cases.Neighbouring Tirupur, meanwhile, witnessed a spike on Sunday when 95 new cases were reported against 78 on Saturday.Health officials said the surge could be arrested only if people cooperated. “Fresh restrictions are being enforced from Monday. If people follow Covid-19 norms, maintain social distancing, wear face masks properly and stop crowding, the surge could be arrested,” said a health official, who didn’t want to be named.The government, on its part, has ensured that adequate beds, oxygen and other health infrastructure are in place.Coimbatore collector G S Sameeran visited Gandhipuram bus stand on Sunday to create awareness among the public on the need to take additional precautions. He said the district administration had planned several activities through the week, as part of the government’s efforts to control the pandemic.

More than 120 scheduled caste families staying at Kondasamy Nagar were forced to take a circuitous route to reach their homes after the developer, who launched a gated community project on adjacent Kannabiran Nagar, built the wall seven months ago. “The developer told us that the wall was constructed to block view of the dalit colony, the presence of which, they said, made the site less appealing to buyers,” Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhgam (TPDK) member C Santhosh Kumar said. TPDK on Saturday petitioned district revenue officer P S Leela Alex demanding action against the developer. On Sunday, an earthmover was used to tear down the wall at four places in the presence of Pannimadai village panchayat president Rathinam Marudhachalam and revenue department officials. “Kondasamy Nagar residents thanked the village panchayat and revenue department officials for demolishing the wall. The officials also promised to decrease the height of the wall to four feet,” Santhosh said. TPDK general secretary Ku Ramakrishnan said the wall divided people based on their caste. “Whenever rights are denied by caste Hindus, TPDK will fight for justice,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/wall-blocking-way-to-dalit-settlement-brought-down/articleshow/84958283.cms||---

The authorities in Muzaffarnagar said that there is some issue with the phone networks and they are trying to fix it. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Abhishek Yadav said, “We are investigating the matter and trying to know the exact cause of the problem. Will take up the matter with the dial 112 team in Lucknow." According to locals, when, during an emergency, they call 112 or the women’s helpline 1090, it is received in Uttarakhand capital Dehradun. Recently, when a woman dialed 112 to report harassment, it was received by someone in Dehradun. Hina Khan (name changed), a resident of Kakrauli area in Morna block, called 112 to complain about some unsocial elements standing in the street and harassing women. But her call was picked up in the police control room in Dehradun and she was told that she should have called UP police. “It was then that I called the police station of the area. But it is a serious issue that needs to be addressed,” she said. Another villager in the area, Amit Kumar, wanted to report an accident in which the victim needed immediate medical help a few days ago. “I made several calls on dial 112. But, every time, the call reached Uttarakhand. No help reached the man till I was present at the spot. Then I left. Don’t know if he got any help or not at all,” Kumar said. Uday Veer Singh, a farmer union leader, wanted to report about a cow carcass lying near his house in Bhokarehdi village this week. “My call was received in Uttarakhand. When I told them my concern, someone over the phone told me that I should dial 0522 before 112 (0522 is Lucknow's STD code). I tried, but to no avail. Later I called the nagar panchayat office and filed a complaint.” Another resident, a local journalist, Qazi Amjad, said, “Over 12 villages in the region are facing this problem for quite some time. People don’t know where and whom to make a complaint because it is a technical fault.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/sos-calls-from-a-block-in-ups-muzaffarnagar-landing-in-uttarakhand-cops-probing-technical-glitch/articleshow/84953954.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Fitness professionals have also created special home-based workouts to ensure that their clients reach their target as easily as they would at the gym. Objects easily available at home, such as bottles, chairs, or the building stairs, have replaced tyres and ropes, while flat mates, spouses, parents and children have turned into gym buddies. Michael Demello and his fiancé signed up for home-based workout sessions conducted by an online portal to achieve their weight loss target ahead of their wedding in November. “Our workout is designed to make us burn calories while bonding through partnership. Not only do these exercises increase stamina and make us lose weight, but they also build trust. We receive videos demonstrating exercises that we follow together. Some of the exercises require one person to support the other such as hook squats or using your partner’s body weight to increase the intensity of push-ups.” Fitness expert Sumit Dubey, who has been training clients for over 14 years, said, “There has been a noticeable increase in consistency among women in the age group of 35-45 during the last year as they have been partnering up with their children for workouts. Currently, over 250 women have enrolled and regularly attending our online home-based workouts. Children learn what they observe, and when they see their parents exercising regularly, this habit is inculcated in them as well. We conduct dance-based fun exercises that combine strength training, cardio and aerobics for parents and children.” Amaresh Ojha, business head of a fitness portal, said that while monotony is bound to set in, fitness enthusiasts can switch things up using basic and old-school techniques. “If you stay in a multi-storied building, you can do cardio by climbing stairs. Start with five stories, then scale up by ten minutes every day. At the end of the month, you should be able to climb up 25 stories. This worked for me at the beginning of the pandemic when I did not own gym equipment.” Skipping ropes have made a comeback as a popular choice for cardio at home. Fitness entrepreneur Chirag Barjatya said, “A backpack full of books is good to do weighted squats and lunges. Some people even use empty LPG cylinders, but it can be risky and cause injuries. For pull-ups, using storage slabs became very common during the lockdown.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/at-home-workouts-get-a-family-oriented-rejig/articleshow/84958287.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Kamlesh Kumar, 26, was working with a group of labourers in a cane field at Dokarpur village in Mitauli area of the district when a tiger lurking amid the stalks suddenly pounced on him. Hearing his screams, the others rushed to his aid, brandishing batons and shouting. On seeing them, the tiger vanished in a flash. Kamlesh was rushed to the community health centre. The doctor treating him said he had sustained injuries on his back but his vitals were fine. Villagers said the tiger had probably strayed from Dudhwa forest and was hiding in the cane field. It had been sighted several times by locals. The forest department had been informed but the officials had not taken any steps to push the big cat back into the forest. Samir Kumar, divisional forest officer, said, “We have sent a team to the village and have ensured best possible treatment for the victim. Our team will monitor the area and check if the tiger is injured or has any other problem. Prima facie it appears to be an accidental attack as the victim entered a dense cane field and came face to face with the tiger by chance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-injured-in-tiger-attack-in-kheris-cane-field/articleshow/84951685.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

One of the deceased, Vishnu Kumar (35), was the son of a retired associate professor of BN College. He was shot inside his room at Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar hostel at Saidpur under Bahadurpur police station area at around 10pm on Saturday. The other was an autorickshaw driver, identified as Jitendra Kumar Singh (55). He was killed in front of Parsa Bazar railway station on Sunday morning. Vishnu, also called ‘Sigma’ by other students in the hostel, was the son of Dr Nandlal Paswan, who had recently retired as an associate professor of psychology from BN College of Patna University. Police said Vishnu was shot in his head. An empty cartridge of 7.65mm was recovered from his room, Bahadurpur police station SHO Sanovar Khan said on Sunday. The hostel is for SC/ST students and originally belongs to the state’s social welfare department. But it is run by the university. Khan said Nandlal was earlier the warden of the same hostel. Vishnu was a slow learner and had been living there for the last several years. “He used to cook food for other hostel students and eat himself in lieu of that,” Khan said. The SHO said Nandlal presently lives in the nearby Professors’ Colony. He said the other hostel students heard a sound of firing and informed the police. There was no eyewitness to the incident, he said and added: “The reason behind the killing is still unknown. Even family members are not able to say anything.” Vishnu’s brother has lodged an FIR against unknown persons. In the second incident, unidentified criminals shot dead Jitendra when he was inside his autorickshaw with a friend and waiting for passengers outside Parsa railway station. Parsa Bazar police station SHO cum DSP (probation) Priya Jyoti said people must have seen the killers, but no one told anything to the police out of fear. Preliminary investigation revealed that Singh had two wives. “His first wife lives at Khaira with her three adult sons from Singh. The second wife went missing five years ago. Singh had one son, named Mukesh, from her. Both lived together in Parsa Bazar market area,” Priya said. She said there was a dispute among Singh’s sons from two wives over his property at his native village New Etwarpur under Parsa Bazar police station area. “Mukesh suspected his stepbrothers’ involvement in his father’s killing. He has also alleged that they killed Singh with the motive to grab his property,” the trainee DSP said. “Raids are on to nab Singh’s sons from first wife,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/retd-profs-son-shot-in-patna-hostel/articleshow/84956174.cms||Debashish Karmakar

It ushered in the era of ‘work from home’ and online learning, which we all enjoyed for the first few days. As time passed, the online school became a source of mental fatigue, with minimal interaction. The pandemic year also marked another important year in my academic life since I progressed to Std X, which is considered a crucial year for students. However, with online classes, the pandemic slowly reduced us to mere geeks, studying aimlessly with very little excitement. Everything virtual meant I wasn’t able to meet my friends and teachers. Even though our teachers tried their best, I felt that it simply lacked the soul. The final straw came when the board exams were cancelled. It seemed as if all the hard work went in vain.

Their number is growing, squeezing out locals from the list of recipients, say the civic authorities. Anirban Jana, a second-year college student from Ghatal in West Midnapore, set out for Kolkata last Thursday afternoon along with his brother Anilava, a first-year student. The duo reached the city in the evening and went straight to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation mega vaccination centre at Ahindra Mancha (Chetla). They stood in queue for obtaining coupons to get the shot on Friday afternoon. The brothers were among 1,500 recipients of Covishield vaccines that were administered from the Chetla based centre. According to a KMC medical officer, of the 1,500 recipients (both first and second doses) over 60% had come from districts. And the number is growing by the day, the medical officer said. “Our vaccination records at clinics and mega centres confirm that a large number of recipients are from districts, including many who are reaching the city a day in advance and collecting coupons for the shots to be administered the next day. This trend is getting stronger as supply of vaccines in the districts is not adequate,” said a KMC health department official posted at the civic headquarters. According to Anirban, he had been trying hard to get the shot from Ghatal. However, an acute shortage of vaccines for a longer period couldn’t help his cause. “I had a cousin in Behala who advised me to visit the Ahindra Mancha centre where the supply of vaccines has been adequate. I took this opportunity and came along with my brother and got jabbed,” he said. Similarly, Shamima Khatun, a resident of Uluberia who is studying management had her first dose of Covishield from a KMC run mega centre at Bhowanipore Education society this weekend. Khatun said she has a friend in Bhowanipore who informed her about the centre and its steady stock of vaccines. This centre in Bhowanipore is taking care of the vaccination needs of over 500 recipients (on an average) in a day. The civic body’s mega centre at Jai Hind Bhawan on Harish Mukherjee Road is also drawing huge crowds from outside the city limits. This centre is getting a daily allocation of around 800 vaccines in a day. “We have ample stock of vaccines for our mega vaccination centres which are catering to the vaccination needs of citizens of Kolkata as well as people from districts. We can’t say no to people who are coming from districts in large numbers,”said a KMC health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/recipients-from-districts-flood-vax-mega-centres/articleshow/84956122.cms||Saikat Ray

As part of a special operation launched a fortnight ago, the GRP has managed to trace 15 of the 92 missing people in 15 days. All these people were reported missing from Pune, Shivajinagar, Daund, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Miraj and Solapur railway stations, which fall under the GRP (Pune)’s jurisdiction. Sadanand Wayase-Patil, superintendent of police (GRP), said, “Special efforts are being made to trace these persons and we have already reunited 15 of them with their family members.” Last week, the GRP officials reunited a 24-year-old man with his parents. He had left his Rasta Peth home in a fit of rage after arguing with his parents in 2017. He was ‘last seen’ at the Pune railway station. His father had lodged a ‘missing person’ report with the GRP unit at the Pune railway police station. Police kept on searching for him but he was not traceable. In the second week of July, the GRP (Pune) was able to locate this missing man at Hadapsar and reunited him with his family. Wayase-Patil said, “The number of trains either starting from Pune or passing through Pune has been reduced to 50% and as a result crimes under railway jurisdiction have lessened. Thus, we decided to pay attention to the files of missing persons.” Policemen of different police stations under the GRP are calling up relatives of the missing persons to know if the missing persons have return home. “If the missing person has not been found, then a team works on the case. The team tries to locate his cellphone and checks out old CCTV footage. Police then try to locate them,” he said. Police said that the team also contacts other police stations and attempts are being made to locate the missing persons. Photographs are being sent to other police stations to seek their help too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/railway-cops-search-for-missing-persons-as-part-of-special-operation-15-traced-so-far/articleshow/84958366.cms||---

Now, as 16-year-olds, it feels weird yet amazing to live in that very future. Unlike many other students, the push towards online learning wasn’t abrupt for us. With previous experience of e-learning via Middle Years Programme at Victorious Kids Educares, moving to an online school was a smooth transition for most of us. Having said that, we had our challenges like the lack of a physical library. We overcame it through our school’s internet library. E-classes allowed us to do internships and pursue extracurricular activities — free of any physical limitations. The sky was the limit for our productivity with better optimization of time on our hands. Though the Covid-19 pandemic has been stressful, it allowed us to explore ourselves — our identities as global citizens and learners. Our president Robbin Ghosh (sir) often said, “Our children are no longer the people we’re in school. If we try to teach them the way students of yesteryears learned, we would rob them of their tomorrow.” As International Baccalaureate (IB) students, we collaborated with international organizations, attended fairs and conferences, all of which helped us to connect with like-minded international students. Every new window on the internet is a path to knowledge. We believe the future of learning is inclusive and global. So, if you look at it, the pandemic has been a blessing in disguise. It has helped us get closer to our families. It also gave us a chance to prepare for a world of tomorrow.

Even though it was raining when the Delhi zoo opened its gates at 8am, hundreds of people turned up to meet the animals. Many were carrying umbrellas as they roamed around the zoo campus. “Rain could not deter the spirit and enthusiasm of the visitors, especially young ones. We are trying our best to make their visit worthwhile,” said Ramesh Pandey, director, Delhi zoo. The number of guests increased in the second slot — 1pm to 5pm — as all tickets were sold out. “We are allowing only 1,500 people in a shift to ensure compliance of Covid guidelines. Online ticketing is available and as our second slot on Sunday was fully booked, we request visitors to check the availability of tickets online before coming to the zoo,” said Pandey. DN Sharma who visited the zoo along with his wife and daughters said, “We have been waiting for days for the zoo to reopen. We enjoyed our trip as we spotted many animals.” Apart from enclosures of animals like tigers, elephants and rhinos, the recently created selfie point at Delhi zoo attracted many visitors too. The zoo was temporarily shut due to a rise in Covid-19 cases in the national capital during the second wave. After lions in Hyderabad and Jaipur zoos tested positive for Covid-19, National Zoological Park was reopened on Sunday allowing only a limited number of visitors. Officials said the zoo campus is disinfected in the break between the two shifts. Visitors to the zoo will soon be able to enjoy a tree garden as well as zoo authorities are developing a lawn with 100 tree species. “It is designed to educate school children about different species of trees through games. Plans are being discussed to introduce a walk through the woods programme, where children would be asked to trace hidden treasures by identifying tree species,” said Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-a-three-month-hiatus-2500-people-visit-delhi-zoo-on-day-1/articleshow/84956110.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||East, west bank canals of Mettur dam opened||Salem: District collector S Karmegam opened the shutters of east and west bank canals of the Mettur dam on Sunday to help farmers undertake cultivation in Salem, Namakkal and Erode districts. He has appealed the farmers to use the water wisely.Pointing out that 300 cubic feet per second (cusecs) water was being released through each canal, he said the quantity would be increased up to 1,000cusecs based on the irrigation requirements of the farmers.Earlier, the state government had directed Public Works Department (PWD) officials to release water through both the canals for 137 days from August 1 to December 15, based on the farmers’ request. Karmegam said the water would be released into the canals from the Mettur dam in three stages.According to a PWD official, the east and west bank canals were dedicated for public use in 1955. While east bank canal is 40.20-mile long, the west bank canal is 27-mile long. “We are releasing water through the canals on the traditional date of August 1 after a gap of 12 years.”The water from the canals could be used to irrigate nearly 45,000 acres land - 16, 443 acres in Salem, 11, 327 acres in Namakkal and 17, 230 acres in Erode.M Karuppanna Gounder, a member of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam, said the water was always released through the canals based on the water level in the dam. “As such, the water release date used to vary.”The farmers thanked chief minister M K Stalin for releasing water through the dam’s canals on the traditional date.On Sunday, the water level in the dam was recorded at 82.53ft, against its full capacity of 120ft. Inflow to the dam has reduced to 12,77 cusecs from 21,692cusecs, as the water being released from KRS and Kabini dams in Karnataka has come down to 10,000cusecs from 25,000cusecs. However, the water being released to delta districts has increased to 14,000cusecs from 10,000cusecs, as the demand has gone up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/east-west-bank-canals-of-mettur-dam-opened/articleshow/84958348.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 24-year-old held for raping, impregnating minor girl||NEW DELHI: A 24-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly befriending, raping and impregnating a 16-year-old girl. Akash Jain alias Rahul, a resident of Mahavir Enclave, was arrested after a woman cop honeytrapped him online. On July 30, cops were informed by a hospital about a girl who had come for an abortion. Probe revealed that she was sexually assaulted repeatedly. She was 45-day pregnant. “The girl did not have any contact number of the suspect. We only had his name. A case of rape and under the POCSO Act was registered and all Facebook profiles with the name Akash were scanned. We zeroed in on the suspect after the survivor identified him in one profile,” said an officer. A Facebook ID of sub-inspector Priyanka was created and a message was sent to Jain. “After repeated attempts, he accepted the friend request and shared his mobile number. Priyanka called Jain and asked him to meet her,” said the officer. A meeting was fixed at Dashrathpuri Metro station and a trap was laid, but the accused didn’t turn up. He then called Priyanka to Dwarka Sector 1. “The team immediately rushed to the area, but the accused ditched again,” said he added. Jain now fixed an appointment at Srimata Mandir in Mahavir Enclave, and asked Priyanka to make a video call as he was suspecting something amiss, the cop said. The team noted his background during the call and arrested him when he came to meet her. The girl has been admitted to a hospital. The survivor met Jain at a bangle shop where he worked and “had been sexually assaulting her for the past many months by inducing her to marry in future”, the officer said. The accused used to change his house often and didn’t have any permanent address.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/girl-raped-gets-pregnant-youth-held/articleshow/84956134.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Kochi||House surgeon was shot thrice; SIT to visit Bihar||KOCHI: Special investigation team (SIT) probing the murder of dental house surgeon Manasa in Kothamangalam will soon begin investigation in Bihar to confirm whether the accused (Rakhil) acquired the pistol used for the crime from that state. Last Friday, the Kannur native barged into Manasa’s house in the afternoon and shot her before taking his own life. According to official sources with Ernakulam rural police, the woman was shot thrice —two shots to the head and one in her chest— as opposed to the primary understanding that she was shot twice by the culprit. Sources said police also received statements that imply that Rakhil purchased the gun from Bihar and it is trying to confirm the same. Police suspect that he got the idea of purchasing the gun from Bihar after a guest labourer told him about its availability. Police are also investigating whether Rakhil sold his car to commit the crime. Meanwhile, Kannur bid a tearful adieu to the deceased as the bodies of Manasa and Rakhil were cremated at their respective native places on Sunday. After visiting Manasa’s home, minister MV Govindan told the media that it was a north Indian-style murder. “Police have received evidence suggesting that the perpetrator had gone to Bihar. What I understand is that a few days ago, he and a friend went to Bihar,” said Govindan, adding that he had talked to SP Karthick on Saturday night who told him that a team was soon going to Bihar. Police are awaiting the autopsy reports of Mansa and Rakhil. On Sunday, Mansa’s home at Narath witnessed emotional scenes as villagers paid their last respects while her family was inconsolable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/house-surgeon-was-shot-thrice-sit-to-visit-bihar/articleshow/84956186.cms||---
---||Delhi||Two key stretches of Delhi Metro’s Grey & Pink lines to open on Friday||NEW DELHI: Two important stretches of the Delhi Metro — the extension of the Grey Line (Dwarka-Najafgarh) to Dhansa Bus Stand and opening of the ‘missing link’ between Trilokpuri and Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 stations of the Pink Line (Shiv Vihar-Majlis Park) — will open this Friday. The sections would be inaugurated by the Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on August 6 via video conferencing, said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. Both the sections have recently received the mandatory approval from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety. “While the inaugural function will be held online in the morning, passenger services will commence on the same day at 3pm on both the sections,” Dayal said. With the opening of this extension, the Metro network will become 390-kilometres long with 286 Metro stations. The almost 1-kilometre-long (891 metres) Najafgarh-Dhansa Bus Stand section will take the Metro further into the interior areas of Najafgarh, Dayal added. The Dwarka-Najafgarh section of the 5.4 km long Grey Line opened in 2019 with three stations — Dwarka, Nangli and Najafgarh. The ‘missing link’ of Delhi Metro’s longest corridor Pink Line at Trilokpuri lead to the Line functioning as two separate corridors for two and half years after the Line first opened. DMRC finally managed to bridge the gap between Trilokpuri and Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 metro stations in June. The 58.6-km-long Pink Line is one of the most ambitious corridors built by DMRC and is also known as the ‘ring corridor’ as it functions as an arc, connecting all the existing corridors of metro. However, the issue of unavailability of land at Trilokpuri had meant that DMRC couldn’t construct a crucial stretch. As a result, while one section of the corridor operates from Majlis Park to Mayur Vihar Pocket 1, with trains reversing back from Mayur Vihar Pocket 1, trains coming from Shiv Vihar return back from Trilokpuri station. On Friday, this section will connect the two ends of Pink Line and will provide seamless connectivity to a long range of localities and connect important transport hubs, such as Nizamuddin Railway Station, Sarai Kale Khan ISBT, Anand Vihar ISBT and Railway Station, Delhi Cantt. Railway Station and prominent markets like Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar and INA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/missing-link-on-metro-map-soon/articleshow/84956161.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Landslides bury tourism in Konkan||NAVI MUMBAI: Tourism in the Konkan has been hit after heavy rain and landslides as tourists, usually from Mumbai and Pune, have cancelled or rescheduled trips. It has not helped that the Alibaug sub-divisional officer has banned tourists from visiting various sites in Raigad district, including Alibaug, Revdanda and Murud. The tourism business in the Konkan, which came down from Rs 2,000 crore annually to Rs 400 crore due to Covid, is expected to suffer further losses. The estimates have been arrived at by Konkan Paryatan Udyog Sangh (KPUS), a body comprising representatives from five districts: Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Raigad, Thane and Palghar. “The tourism situation at the famous Ganpatipule beach is very bad after floods ravaged Ratnagiri. Hence, we are here to help in cleaning works,” said Suraj Pawar, a Ganpatipule resident. “The regular arrival of 50 lakh tourists per annum has gone down to 10 lakh in the Konkan region. Business will further come down as Mahad and Chiplun’s collective share of Rs 100 crore will be affected after floods and landslides. Earlier, the Nisarga and Tauktae cyclones had caused a lot of damage,” said Sanjay Yadavrao, president, KPUS. Meanwhile, six dams and waterfalls in Revdanda, Alibaug and Murud, under three different police stations, have been shut to visitors. The decision was taken to avoid untoward incidents. The prohibited dams include Teenvira and Umte in Alibaug, Garambi dam and waterfall in Amboli, Savatkanda waterfall and Nagshet. These tourist spots attract large numbers of visitors from all over the state, but particularly from Mumbai, Thane and Pune. One of the reasons for the prohibitory order is also to prevent the spread of Covid-19. “Nobody is allowed to enter dam and talav areas… until further orders. Selfie and photographs are not allowed at dangerous spots. Besides, the ban is effective on the parking of vehicles and speedy driving around the areas,” said Prashant Dhage, who is the sub-divisional officer of Alibaug.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-landslides-bury-tourism-in-konkan/articleshow/84958390.cms||Umesh K Parida

The museum will preserve and document its century-old collection of Buddhist relics from Sind that point to a unique period in the history of Undivided India.The museum possesses 297 remains of the lost Kahu Jo Daro Buddhist stupa of Mirpurkhas that date back to the 5th century CE. The artefacts include statues of Buddha and Kuber as well as fragments of terracotta bricks. The remains will be transferred into conservation-grade storage units this year. In 2022, they will be researched, documented and a selection will go on display. Research findings will be published in 2023. Kahu Jo Daro is one of the finest examples of Indo-Roman terracotta art and architecture of the pre-Independence era. Reportedly 10,000 Buddhists lived in monasteries in the region.Museum director Sabyasachi Mukherjee said, “In 1909-10, two caskets of these relics were excavated by Henry Cousens, superintending archaeologist of ASI, and member of PoW museum committee. Many of the remains were deposited here."“The size of the sun-dried bricks led experts to believe the original structure was built during the Mauryan era of Emperor Ashoka. It is also said the ashes of Buddha or his disciples were found here. This collection will be of particular interest to the Sindhi community because it shows Buddhist influence over Sind in the pre-Islamic era,” he said.Bank of America has donated Rs 25 lakh for the task. Kaku Nakhate, president and India country head, said, “Supporting art and culture is an important area of our social investment. The restoration of Kahu Jo Daro is another step we are taking with CSMVS to conserve our rich heritage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-museum-to-preserve-fifth-century-buddhist-relics-from-stupa-in-sind/articleshow/84958422.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

---||Delhi||Delhi: PWD fills cave-in under IIT flyover, DJB fixes pipeline||NEW DELHI: A portion of Aurobindo Road under IIT flyover that had caved in due to water leakage on Saturday was filled with mud, sand and loose gravel by PWD on Sunday. The underground water pipeline was repaired by Delhi Jal Board, while an upstream manhole was being plugged. The cave-in had resulted in formation of a crater of 15-feet length, 10-feet breadth and 10-feet depth. The damaged area had been cordoned off, but the crossing was opened to the public by Sunday evening. Earlier, DJB had issued an advisory stating that repair work could disrupt water supply in Green Park, Hauz Khas, RK Puram, Sarvapriya Vihar and adjoining areas. While the main cave-in site was filled and traffic movement restored, work on the deep sewer towards IIT continued till late in the evening. Consequently, vehicles coming from Aurobindo Marg from AIIMS were barred from turning right towards IIT and only one lane was available for traffic coming from Adhchini on Aurobindo Marg. Additional commissioner (traffic) SD Mishra said as an alternate route, vehicles coming from AIIMS on Aurobindo Marg and seeking to turn towards IIT could take a right turn on Outer Ring Road, make a U-turn under Panchsheel crossing and use the flyover to cross towards IIT. Alternatively, they could go straight on Aurobindo Marg and take a U-turn from Adhchini T-point. “All commercial vehicles on Aurobindo Marg from Mehrauli seeking to take a left turn towards IIT can take a left turn at Adhchini crossing on Shaheed Jeet Singh Marg. They can then go towards Aruna Asaf Ali Marg and Vedant Desika Marg for their onward journey,” added Mishra. PWD and water minister Satyendar Jain tweeted: “The tireless efforts of Delhi Jal Board officials ended in restoration of the broken water pipeline under the IIT flyover before yesterday midnight. PWD officials worked round the clock and repaired the sunken road in record time.” “The repair work was carried out in less than eight hours and water supply was restored before midnight, the next supply time. Hence, people were not affected,” said an official. On Sunday, roads were also damaged in Y-Block Mangolpuri, Shani Mandir signal and near Raj Nagar flyover. Damaged water and sewer lines were the key reasons behind cave-ins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pwd-fills-cave-in-under-iit-flyover-djb-fixes-pipeline/articleshow/84956215.cms||---

But now, due to various reasons, the trend has been changing in the last three years. “There has been a sharp decline in the requirement of water tankers in the city,” an official of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) said. The official said that that the reasons for this include uninterrupted and adequate water supply, a rise in new water connections, drinking water sources that are filled to the brim due to surplus rainfall, and a rise in the ground water table. On average, every day, HMWS&SB’s metro customer care number (MCC) used to receive 800 calls for tanker booking. The number has now gone down to 500 to 600 a day. “During peak summer, we used to sometimes receive as many as 3,000 calls per day requesting a tanker,” the official said. At present, the water board is plying a total of 800 tankers to meet the demand. “We cannot yet declare the city as tanker-free. Tankers are required for some special events, or if a consumer’s borewell is defunct. In fact, when compared to domestic consumers, there is a higher demand from non-domestic consumers (which includes commercial units, hostels, hospitals, and colleges),” he added. At present, bookings in bulk are being made at the HMWS&SB’s divisions-VI (SR Nagar), IX (KPHB Colony), XV (Hafeezpet) and XVIII (Manikonda), the water board official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/demand-for-tankers-trickles-down-in-city/articleshow/84960163.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Pune||Rise in passenger footfall leads to chaos at Pune airport||PUNE: With the number of flights and passenger traffic at Pune airport witnessing a steady rise, several flyers have expressed concern over crowd management at the facility, alleging that social distancing norms were being ignored. Sudhir Mehta, president of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), who was travelling from the airport on Sunday morning said that it took him 75 minutes from checking-in to clear security. “The passenger management system is in absolute chaos. The number of counters is inadequate and no social distancing norms are being enforced. Airports reflects the ethos of the city and we should be able to do better,” Mehta told TOI. “Passengers were being made to walk in the rain, while an aerobridge located just 5 meters from the aircraft lay idle,” he added. A source at the airport said, “The airlines must pay the airport a sum to use its facilities, including aerobridges. Most times, the aerobridges are used and all of them are occupied. Sometimes, certain airlines may decide not to use them as even they are running on losses.” On Sunday, the airport had 108 flight movements, 54 arrivals and 54 departures, in total. On Friday, July 30, more than 7,000 passengers travelled via Pune airport. Another flyer said, “The situation becomes chaotic often with passengers queuing up without maintaining any social distancing norms. There is so little space that it is almost impossible to maintain social distancing at security checks. While the airport has always been chaotic due to space constraints, it is concerning now due to the pandemic and regulations.” Manoj Charath, who recently travelled from Pune to Delhi, was taken aback by the chaos. “My wife was scared as there was no social distancing anywhere. There are markings on the floor and blocked chairs, but they don’t really see if it is being followed. I recently travelled from Goa and the security check at the airport there was outstanding. In times of Covid, such issues can have huge ramifications,” said Charath, a businessman based in Delhi. An airport official said that flyers must be patient and follow regulations. “Even with flights increasing, the regulations remain, and flyers must follow them. Our staff tell passengers to maintain social distancing, but they should be wise enough to follow them. They should reach the airport earlier than usual so that they don’t panic later. As for the airport’s infrastructure, we know it is a concern and are working on it,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rise-in-passenger-footfall-leads-to-chaos-at-airport/articleshow/84958411.cms||Joy Sengupta

The CPI(Maoists) observe martyrdom week between July 28 and August 3 each year to commemorate their fallen comrades and attempt strikes against the security personnel and key government installations. Maoist operatives had held hostage the station master of Chaura railway station in Jamui district of Bihar for a few hours in the intervening nights of July 30 and July 31. The incident had affected railway movement in the Jamui-Jhajha rail section for several hours. “The patrolling of RPF personnel along the railway routes has been intensified. We have also established close coordination with Jharkhand Police and are conducting joint security patrols to thwart any such incident. RPF personnel are also on board the key express trains that are passing through our jurisdiction,” a senior official of the Chakradhapur railway division under South Eastern Railways said. The official said particular focus has been put on the Chakradharpur-Manoharpur-Goelkera route. “It is a regular protocol to step up security surveillance of the railway routes during the martyrdom week, which is observed by the Maoists at this time each year. We are closely working with the state police this year as well,” a senior official at Ranchi railway division said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rail-divisions-in-state-on-alert-after-bihar-incident/articleshow/84957323.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Two girls from the state — Salima Tete (Simdega) and Nikki Pradhan (Khunti) — are part of the Indian squad. It is for the first time that the national women's team is playing in the quarterfinals in the Olympics. Simdega’s joy knows no bounds and the entire hockey fraternity as well as Hockey Simdega, broke into celebrations on Saturday when the team stormed into the semi-finals. A few cheers went up for local girl Salima on the ground where she practised. As part of the celebrations on the hockey astroturf in Simdega, players of the district under the guidance of Hockey Simdega president Manoj Konbegi and coach of Simdega residential hockey centre along with Salima's mentor Pratima Barwa chanted, “Cheers for India, Go for Gold, Wishing Victory for India, Repeat the History of 1980 (when India's men's team had won gold)”. Interestingly, the hockey stadium which resonated with cheers has been named after legendary hockey player of the district Michael Kindo, who had been part of the team which won a bronze in the 1972 Munich Olympics. “We are sending our wishes to both the men’s and women’s teams,” said Barwa. “Simdega has been organising different programmes to support national sides,” said Konbegi. The national men’s team is already in the semis by beating Great Britain 3-1 on Sunday.

---||Ranchi||BJP claims credit for CBI probe in Dhanbad judge ‘murder’ case||Ranchi: A day after chief minister Hemant Soren gave his nod to a CBI probe to investigate the alleged murder of Dhanbad additional district magistrate Uttam Anand, opposition BJP on Sunday claimed credit for the move, saying Soren’s hands were forced by their sustained campaign against the incumbent state government’s “inefficiency”. Anand died after he was hit by an autorickshaw during his morning walk last week. Police have arrested two persons in connection with the incident and a special investigation team (SIT) is probing the case. Talking to reporters at the party office, state BJP chief and Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash claimed that they had been demanding the CBI probe from Day 1 of the crime. “The murder of the judge has not just rattled the judiciary but is also a testimony of the return of the jungle raj in Jharkhand,” he said. Prakash also spoke on a wide range of issues of the state and announced that from August 20 onwards, the party will hit the streets through various campaigns against the “unpopular” and “anti-people” government. “The way law and order in the state has been degrading with every passing day since the Hemant government assumed office 18 months back, is reminiscent of Lalu Prasad’s ‘jungle raj’. Today, the situation is such that after 7 pm, people are fearing to come out on the roads,” he claimed. Stating that the state’s crime graph is rising, Prakash said, “So far this year, 780 murders have taken place in the state and in 2020, a total of 1898 murders occurred. In 2020, there were 1,791 cases of rape and 632 rapes have already occurred this year. In the last 18 months, the total number of heinous crimes has crossed the 10,000-mark. This is Hemant sarkar.” The Jharkhand high court had also recently expressed concern over the law and order situation and dubbed the murder of the Dhanbad judge and an advocate in Ranchi as a direct attack on democracy and the judiciary. Raking up the issue, Prakash added, “The high court’s observation against the shoddy policing in the state must have put the government in shame.” The veteran BJP member also questioned why the case of Rupa Tirkey, a woman police officer who died under mysterious circumstances in her official quarters in Sahibganj in June, is not handed over to CBI. “Rupa’s family has already demanded CBI probe and BJP, too, has been asking for it. Why is the Hemant government shying away from it? This proves that there is something fishy about the incident,” he claimed. Prakash also came down heavily on the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance government, saying it has duped the voters with false promises of providing five lakh jobs per year only to grab power but is now running away from it. “The government had announced 2021 as the ‘niyukti varsh’ (employment year) but ironically, scores of youths are struggling on the streets to seek jobs. Be it para teachers, anganwadi workers, civil service aspirants, contractual workers… all are crying hoarse today,” he said, taking a dig at chief minister Hemant Soren, who reportedly said he would retire from politics if he can’t fulfil his promise. Prakash added, “Of the five lakh plus government posts, more than three lakhs are currently vacant but the state government is running away from filling them up. Before the election, Soren said that he will take 'sanyas' if he can’t give five lakh jobs per year. He should at least fulfil this promise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-claims-credit-for-cbi-probe-in-dhanbad-judge-murder-case/articleshow/84957208.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Congress president and state’s finance minister Rameshwar Oraon, while hailing the Centre’s move, said it is part of the BJP’s attempt to woo OBCs before the Uttar Pradesh polls. But he maintained that chief minister Hemant Soren too must work towards it as both the Congress and JMM had promised to increase reservation for OBCs to 27 per cent. Speaking to reporters at his residence on Sunday, he said, “The state government must not delay it any further and must start working towards it. Both JMM and Congress promised to do it during the 2019 Assembly elections. We must now work towards fulfilling it.” Currently, OBCs enjoy 14 per cent reservation but people belonging to this community have been pushing to raise it to 27 per cent. However, according to constitutional provisions and Supreme Court’s order, the overall reservation comprising all the categories must not cross 50 per cent. Oraon, however, added that the state government must start working towards it. “OBCs are now asking us what happened to our promise. Despite being in the government, we don’t have ready answers. I, as the president of the Congress, urge the CM to start working towards it,” he said, adding that all stakeholders of the government must sit to work out modalities at the earliest. Replying to a raging controversy surrounding many of its MLAs of alleged horse-trading bid, Oraon reiterated that the party is vigilant and all its lawmakers are united. “The BJP’s attempt to destabilise the government will never succeed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-cong-unit-pushes-for-rise-in-share-of-obc-quota/articleshow/84957282.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Nagpur||PWD fells 29 trees near Bapu Kuti in the dead of night||NAGPUR: In a violation of procedures, the public works department (PWD), Wardha, felled 29 trees on Sewagram-Wardha Road adjoining Bapu Kuti sometime in the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. The trees were felled under police protection. “The secretive felling of trees raises concerns about the undemocratic functioning of PWD, and comes as a painful reminder of the illegal felling of several trees in Sewagram last year. The trees have been cut despite continuous opposition by Vriksha Bachao Nagrik Samiti (VBNS), which has communicated its concerns and appeals constantly to the collectorate office and PWD about safe road construction without damaging the trees,” said ecologist Alok Bang. “Felling of trees in the dead of the night is unethical as thousands of birds take shelter on these trees. Many bird nests must have been destroyed and where must have these birds gone at night, as most of the avians are diurnal,” said Bang. In its last meeting on July 26, with district collector Prerana Deshbhratar, executive engineer PN Boob and civil society representatives who are demanding tree cutting to avoid accidents, it was decided that VBNS and PWD will conduct a joint survey of the road to ascertain the number of trees that must be cut to maintain road safety. “The decision to cut the trees was to be taken only after consensus of both parties and consent of VBNS. Moreover, as per the collector’s mandate, any cutting of trees was to be first preceded by tree transplantation. Boob had himself promised that any tree would be felled only after planting 10 times the number of trees to be cut as replacement. None of these promises have been fulfilled,” said Sushma Sharma of VBNS. The constant appeal by VBNS to protect these heritage trees had earlier reached three generations of the Gandhi family, who pleaded collectively to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to protect the trees in Sewagram. The chief minister’s office constituted a committee, which promised that trees will be saved. Yet, in the past few months, Wardha has witnessed mindless construction plans by the PWD, which has endangered the safety of trees and passers-by. “While the PWD has tried to portray VBNS as an irrational group, we would like to clarify that it has constantly attempted to communicate with them regarding road safety, and hoped to reach a solution that honours development, ecology, as well as human lives,” said Dr Anupama Gupta. On Sunday, when VBNS approached Sewagram police to register an FIR in tree felling case, they refused, citing that the case is concerned with government land and the government does not require permission from anyone to cut trees. The police accepted the application with a verbal promise that due investigations will be done. However, police doublespeak has been exposed, as they knew about the tree felling plan on July 31 morning. The plan was executed with police support by blocking the road on Saturday night, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pwd-fells-29-trees-near-bapu-kuti-in-the-dead-of-night/articleshow/84958584.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Bitten by snake, 10-year-old refused first aid at six hospitals, battles for life||NAGPUR: For the last three days, Rakesh Mishra and his family members have not returned to their home in East Nagpur where on the intervening night of July 29-30 his second son was bitten by a common krait while they were sleeping on the floor. Adarsh (10) was admitted in a critical state to Lata Mangeshkar Hosptial (LMH) at Hingna, about 41km from his home, after six hospitals — starting from the closest to his home — allegedly refused to treat him. Lack of snake antivenom, ventilator, and ICU bed were the excuses given to the Mishra family. Mishra, a resident of Bharatwada, his wife and two more sons are camping near LMH premises as Adarsh battles for life in the ICU. The incident took place around 2.30am on July 30. “All of us woke up suddenly hearing Adrash’s cries. He complained of something having bitten him on the right hand index finger. We searched and found a snake hiding under the sofa,” said Mishra, who cooks for a catering service. Before sarpmitras (snake catchers) reached, Mishra had packed his son and family members in his loading vehicle and rushed to the nearest private hospital. What followed over the next two hours was a bigger nightmare for the family than the snakebite. Among the six hospitals which refused admission, two are state-run Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMC). GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande refuted the allegations. “We have enough stock of antivenom medicines, no shortage of any type of beds,” he said. IGGMCH officials didn’t respond to TOI calls. “It is shocking that government hospitals didn’t have antivenom. We kept hopping from one hospital to another until Lata Mangeshkar Hospital admitted Adarsh. So far, I have spent Rs70,000 on the treatment,” said Mishra. After GMCH expressed inability to admit Adarsh, Mishra hired an ambulance as his son’s condition deteriorated. He next approached two private hospitals before heading to Hingna, on the outskirts of the city. Mishra said due to recent rains and flooding in the area, it is common for residents to encounter reptiles. “We had been asking the civic body to clear the area of wild growth and large water pools, but to no avail,” he said. The snake was rescued by local sarpmitras and released in a safer habitat, said Mishra. LMH officials said, “Adarsh was bitten by common krait (according to sarpmitra) on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. They took the child to GMCH and Mayo Hospital and some private hospital. All of them refused to admit the child giving reason of non-availability of ventilator. None of them gave first aid with antivenom. At around 5.20am, the family brought the child to our institute, by that time he already had ptosis (evidence of neuro paralysis). The child was immediately admitted in PICU, given 10 vials of snake antivenom.” “No improvement was seen and additional 10 vials of antivenom were given. Soon the child developed respiratory involvement and was put on ventilatory support. Next day, the child developed pneumothorax on the left side for which intercostal tube drainage was put. The child had 2 episodes of cardiac arrest and was successfully revived. At present he is on ventilatory support and inotropic support. His condition remains critical, but vitals are stable with present advanced critical care,” they added.

---||Goa||Reconsider major ports laws that could impinge on state’s powers, Goa to Centre||PANAJI: The laws introduced by the Union ministry of shipping, particularly the draft Indian ports bill and the Major Ports Authorities Act, 2021, could dilute and impinge on the powers of the state government with respect to minor ports and enable their privatisation, the Goa government has said. While chief minister Pramod Sawant wrote to the Union ports minister on June 17 conveying Goa’s concerns regarding the Major Ports Authorities Act, 2021, the Captain of Ports submitted the state’s concerns regarding the draft lndian ports bill 2021 on June 23. Strangely, while revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate said that the Act would not have any implications for Goa, particularly on the rivers and port limits, TCP minister Chandrakant Kavlekar said that the Central law is in “conflict with the Land Revenue Code and other state Acts” and should be reconsidered. “The likely implications include redundancy of the Goa Town & Country Planning Act and the Regional Plan/ODPs prepared thereunder, the Goa Municipalities Act, Goa Panchayat Raj Act, Goa Land Development and Building Construction Regulations, 2010, and Goa Land Revenue Code in respect of area under the port limits constituted by major ports, subject to any rights of private property therein and consequent revenue loss,” said Kavlekar. Sawant wrote to the Union shipping minister on June 17 conveying Goa’s concerns. “The members of the legislative assembly have raised their concerns regarding the above bill. The verbatim recordings of the assembly proceedings are attached to highlight the concerns of the members of the Goa legislative assembly for your consideration,” said Sawant in his letter. A letter by the revenue department has also been sent, asking the Centre to reconsider the bill in view of Goa’s laws and the conflict between the Major Ports Authorities Act, 2021, and Goa’s Land Revenue Code and other state Acts. CoP has also submitted a list of concerns and suggested changes in the draft Indian ports bill. Ports minister Michael Lobo said that the Goa government is aware that the draft bill contains several provisions that directly and indirectly dilute and impinge on powers of states with respect to minor ports and enables their privatisation. Lobo said that while Goa is still seeking comments from stakeholders, it has also communicated Goa’s concerns to the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/reconsider-major-ports-laws-that-could-impinge-on-states-powers-goa-to-centre/articleshow/84958828.cms||---
---||Goa||Niz Goemkars object to use of ‘bhumiputra’ for all Goans||MARGAO: Legal experts, as well as protagonists of Goan identity and culture, haven’t taken kindly to the use of the term ‘Bhumiputra’, which literally translates to sons of the soil, in the title of the Bill that provides for bestowing ownership rights to dwelling units to those occupying them for the last 30 years. The Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill was passed in the Assembly on Friday after the Opposition staged a walkout in protest. In the Goan context, original settlers of the land are usually referred to as Bhumiputras or Niz Goemkars“The use of the word ‘bhumiputra’ is a misnomer to hoodwink and placate the local sentiment,” Prabhakar Timble, lawyer and former state election commissioner, said. “The bill just puts a residential requirement, which cannot satisfy the tests of being clothed with the status of ‘bhumiputra’ as understood in common local parlance. This is to pull wool over the eyes of Goans as the bill provides rights to those who are understood as non-bhumiputras. This bill will not only give rights and ownership to these them but also elevate them to bhumiputras.” Veteran Konkani writer and noted lawyer, Uday Bhembre concurred. “There’s a difference between being a Goan and being a ‘bhumiputra’,” he said. “While one may become a Goan by virtue of being born in Goa — though his parents may have migrated from elsewhere — a ‘bhumiputra’ is the one whose at least 2-3 generations must have resided in Goa. Residing in Goa for 30 years, as the term is defined in the Bill, doesn’t make one a ‘bhumiputra’.” “The Bill is an open encouragement for illegal squatters on government and Comunidade lands. The move is nothing but a move to appease migrant voters,” said Manoj Parab of Revolutionary Goans. A highly placed bureaucrat said that the government could have avoided the controversy over the domicile period by setting the cut-off date at February 1968 as delineated by Presidential Order dated 19th February, 1968.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/niz-goemkars-object-to-use-of-bhumiputra-for-all-goans/articleshow/84958833.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Bhumiputra bill is populist poll stunt’||Panaji: Hitting out at the Goa Bhumiputra Bill on land ownership rights, former Goa RSS chief Subhash Velingkar termed it a hastily passed ‘populist’ move by the state government with an eye on the upcoming assembly polls. The Manohar Parrikar-government had earlier brought in a bill claiming that the Mayem evacuee property issue will be resolved, but the affected Goans have still not received their rights yet, he said. “The latest bill is also just a farce. All the things envisaged in it will never materialise. When the bill pertaining to Mayem was brought in, the government had made a big show of how the issue of evacuee property has finally been resolved. But those affected in Mayem still appear to be living under a foreign rule as the issue from Portuguese colonial era persists,” said Velingkar. Velingkar said the so-called ‘sanads’ issued to the affected in Mayem have no legal standing and the promises under the latest bill are headed in the same direction. “If the government really believed in it, it would not have waited for four-and-a-half years to bring in the Bhumiputra Bill. They could have brought it immediately after forming the government in 2017. By now it would have been clear how serious the government is in enforcing what they have promised,” said Velingkar. He said that the state government was also meting out injustice to the 129 para teachers, who are not being given priority during recruitment for teachers’ posts. The para teachers, who have all the required qualifications and have been engaged for teaching at primary school level, deserve to be accommodated against permanent posts, Velingkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bhumiputra-bill-is-populist-poll-stunt/articleshow/84958851.cms||---
---||Goa||High drama as BJP, Congress workers clash outside CM’s Sakhali home||BICHOLIM: Tensions mounted at Sakhali on Sunday afternoon as hundreds of BJP and Congress workers were locked in a duel of protests, very close to chief minister Pramod Sawant’s residence in Sakhali. The result was a massive police intervention.  Traffic at Sakhali junction also came to a standstill for hours together. It all began with around 100 Congress workers marching from the Sakhali junction towards the chief minister’s residence. They were protesting his recent comments in the assembly over the Benaulim gangrape case.  As Congress’s ‘Sadbuddhi Yatra’ was announced a day earlier, nearly 3,000 BJP workers had already gathered at the spot as a counter-protest and in support of Sawant. Congress members, led by state president Girish Chodankar, said they had only intended to present Sawant with a boquet of flowers so better sense prevails, after the chief minister’s comments that ‘parents also need to take responsibility for their children’. Chodankar said they also intended to question Sawant over the Goa Bhumiputra Bill related to land ownership rights. However, the BJP workers who had already gathered on the main road began a public meeting at the spot with a public address system. Among those present was Sawant’s wife and BJP Mahila Morcha president Sulakshana. To outdo the public meeting, Congress members began shouting slogans and singing as they marched ahead towards Sawant’s residence. At this point, the police intervened and blocked Congress’ rally by parking a bus across the road, bringing traffic to a halt in the process. For around an hour, Congress workers struggled to get past the police. Later, when the police tried to allow vehicular traffic to pass, two to three female protestors tried to make a dash towards CM’s residence. During this struggle, the clothes of a female Congress worker were torn, leading to Congress members blaming the police for manhandling her. Mahila Congress members said they will file a police complaint against the police personnel for tearing her clothes. The protestors were detained and later released. Interestingly, despite heavy rainfall, both Congress and BJP workers refused to relent. Finally, after over two hours, the police managed to ensure that the protestors had dispersed. Police personnel were seen deployed in large numbers at the spot. Bicholim taluka deputy collector Deepak Vaigankar, DySP Sandesh Chodankar and his team were present to bring the situation under control. Chodankar said the BJP was trying to suppress the voice of Congress. Meanwhile, BJP Sakhali block president Gopal Surlakar said that people have shown Congress how they can stand in support of Sawant when the need arises. BJP Yuwa Morcha president Ganesh Ghadi said that it was Congress leaders who were in dire need of ‘sadbuddhi’ or good sense.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/high-drama-as-bjp-cong-workers-clash-outside-cms-sakhali-home/articleshow/84958919.cms||---

There are many other options available to you’ll in the state, as well as in other parts of India and abroad. When I made enquiries recently, I learnt that many of our students go abroad to pursue their graduate studies and I felt happy. I felt proud that our Goan students are going to pursue various courses not just in other parts of India but abroad, too,” said Sawant. The online webinar was organised by the CMO and the directorate of higher education to introduce Class XII passouts to the various career options available, besides the obvious general streams. “Discuss it with your parents and teachers and then decide on your career options. Besides job, you also have entrepreneurship options available,” said Sawant. He said that there are career options also available to students who are unable to clear their Class XII for some reason. “I congratulate all students who have cleared their Class X and XII exams.

Suggesting that the upcoming state assembly elections could be held as early as November, Sardesai said that if Congress continues its casual approach towards the elections, it would have to wait till 2027 to form the state government. “There will be many modalities when the alliance will be declared, but we will not sell out our candidates. The situation is such that the elections could be held in November 2021 so there is a need to show haste. If Congress remains susegad, then they will be left behind,” Sardesai said. A week earlier, Sardesai had said that Congress’s desk in-charge for Goa, Dinesh Gundu Rao had informed him that an in-principle approval had been given for an alliance. Refuting the announcement, state Congress president Girish Chodankar said that discussions about the alliance had not started with local functionaries. The former NDA ally said that GFP is pressing for an immediate decision on the alliance with the Congress as the former wants to form the government in 2022 and not in 2027. “We are asking for very few seats and we have a history where our candidates contest and they win. We don’t put up candidates just to contest,” Sardesai said. Further, he said that the Mandrem ticket will be given to Deepak Kalangutkar. The GFP functionaries met with the local taxi operators at Mandrem on Sunday where they assured the taxi owners that their concerns will be addressed. Sardesai also said that the Entertainment Village proposed at Mandrem by the current state government is a land scam. Visiting the proposed site for the 1,65,000 sqm Entertainment Village, Sardesai said GFP will stand by locals who have opposed the project. Sardesai described the project as yet another example of Goa’s “resources being put up on fast track auction” by chief minister Pramod Sawant and the BJP government. While campaigning for Kalangutkar, Sardesai met with former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar at Arambol. Sardesai claimed that the two discussed ways to take Mandrem forward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-nudges-cong-to-make-up-its-mind-on-alliance/articleshow/84959022.cms||---

Patel accompanied by district collector and officials of state-run SSG Hospital explored the three options including the empty plot at Yavteshwar compound, space available near staff quarters behind Kirti Mandir and infectious disease hospital at Karelibaug.  Last year, the state government had announced setting up this facility at a cost of Rs 180 crore which was budgeted. Of this, Rs 50 crore have been sanctioned as first instalment.  The hospital is proposed to be equipped with modern equipment, maternity and paediatric departments, ICU for pregnant women, NICU for children, PICU and nutritional rehabilitation centre among others.

Candolim PHC health officer Dr Roshan Nazareth appealed to people who are bed-ridden and the elderly to contact their local panchas to avail of the facility. “Besides visiting many old people at their houses, our teams have also visited old-age homes to vaccinate the inmates,” Nazareth said. In May, the Candolim PHC became the first centre to offer drive-in vaccination facility. Senior citizens could be brought in a car to the centre and would get vaccinated without having to disembark or enter the vaccination booth. Nazareth said in all, over 38,000 people have been vaccinated through the Candolim PHC up till the end of July.

That has enraged citizens. How parents manage children is a matter between parents and their wards,” general secretary of the Goa unit, Iftiyaz Sayed stated. “The chief minister should be making sure that men who misbehave with women are punished under the law. He should also remember that girls are entitled to their own liberties,” he added. Reacting to his statements on citizens blaming the police, the confederation stated that the law and order is crumbling in the state. “People need answers from the chief minister, accompanied by swift and firm action. The chief minister must guarantee that the law and order machinery protects the public. Had only the Colva police been alert and agile, this whole crisis may just have been averted,” the confederation stated. “In the face of this, the government seems to be lame,” Sayed stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-must-guarantee-better-policing/articleshow/84959217.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It is also a resounding slap to all the families that they had to leave behind. Goans will never forget how health minister Rane, chief minister Pramod Sawant and their government failed Goa, at its time of need, which resulted in so many needless and untimely deaths,” Goencho Avaaz president Swapnesh Sherlekar said. . He said Rane seems to be experiencing “convenient memory loss” and needs to be reminded of his statement in May where he had said that many patients were dying because of problems with oxygen supply and asked the high court to probe why so many deaths were taking place at GMC in the early hours. “Has Rane forgotten about his fracas with the chief minister, which resulted due to the difference in opinion about the abysmal way that the government was handling the second wave, where he even referred to the CM as being ‘misinformed’, for refuting his lack of oxygen claim?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ranes-denial-of-oxygen-shortage-an-insult-to-dead/articleshow/84959382.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

For the last 17 months, the traffic police haven’t heard this excuse much from citizens who have committed traffic offences. Barodians have now taken to digital mode to shell out the traffic fines after being sent e-challans.  In 2020, over 83% of citizens paid e-challans digitally. “It is a big change in the last few years as people used to visit the police station or police bhavan earlier to pay the penalty. In last couple of years, most people have begun paying online. And it is convenient for the cops too,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. Citizens are either paying through the website or the mobile app.  In 2019, the police department collected Rs 6.11 crore traffic penalty through e-challans of which 66% was paid online. The police department has recently started collecting on the spot traffic penalties through point of sale (PoS) machines. The traffic cops have been given 120 PoS machines that cover 60 different points in the city. Whenever commuters are caught committing a traffic offence, cops offer them an option to either pay by cash or debit/credit card.  In the last 45 days, the cops have issued 11,412 traffic memos and collected Rs 63.77 lakh. Out of this, 9,531 memos were paid by cash while the rest was by card. “Gradually, we will remove all the challan books and use the POS machines for challans. The digitization will help us keep a record of all such fines,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/83-barodians-paid-fines-digitally-in-2020/articleshow/84954869.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Pune||Pune: Traders’ body to protest against curbs tomorrow||PUNE: Federation of Traders Association Pune (FTAP) president Fatehchand Ranka said on Sunday that its shopkeeper-members are set to stage a protest on Tuesday and would keep establishments open from 11am to 7pm with or without the local civic bodies’ nod from Wednesday. Ranka was speaking to reporters about the plight of shop owners and traders in the wake of prolonged Covid-19 restrictions that are in place across the Pune metropolitan region (PMR), which includes Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations, the three cantonments and areas under rural Pune. His statement comes close on the heels of state Home Minister Dilip Walse-Patil declaring last Friday (July 30) that the government will take a final call on relaxations in the next two/three days. On Saturday, the Pune municipal corporation followed up by issuing a fresh order stating that the prevailing restrictions will continue till further notice, much to the disappointment of traders who are calling for lesser curbs as Pune’s Covid positivity rate has come down below 4%. The federation comprises 82 associations of shops and trade establishments and has more than 40,000 members across PMR. “As a symbolic gesture to wake up the government to the plight of traders, participate in the agitation ‘Ghanta Naad Aaandolan’, by ringing bells for 15 minutes from noon at various locations across the city,” said Ranka. In a letter to the chief minister, the deputy chief minister and Pune’s guardian minister, besides the divisional commissioner, district collector and Pune municipal commissioner and police chief, the FTAP on July 30 demanded that either all the shops (excluding the non-essential ones) be allowed to function from 11am to 8pm on weekdays or should be allowed to function on all seven days of the week between 11am and 7pm. “In case these demands are not met by the local administration, all the shop owners will keep their shops open till 7pm from August 4 and would be ready to face the consequences. The number of cases in the rural parts of the Pune district should not be the reason of curbs in Pune city. Current deadline of 4pm is not suitable for shopping and is inconvenient for shop owners as well as customers,” said Ranka. He added, “During the last 18 months, shop owners have faced losses to the tune of Rs75,000 crore due to the restrictions imposed on them. Uncertainty, due to lockdowns and curfews, have caused many to lose their jobs, leading to severe financial strain on the families and employees of traders. Unscientific policies of the local administration and the state government have made the business class worse off than the disease. Heavy financial pressure and not being able to pay salaries of employees, rent, loans, interest installments, taxes, electricity bills, house expenses and more have even led many business owners to die by suicide. Continuing with the restrictions will just be rubbing salt on the wounds of traders.” Mahendra Pitlia, secretary of the federation, pointed out that the government has not taken any decision on vaccination of traders, employees and their families despite regular follow-up from the association. “The federation has set up all the vaccination facilities at its own cost but inoculation has been delayed due to lack of vaccine supply,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traders-body-to-protest-against-curbs-tomorrow/articleshow/84958194.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Pune||Officials cast wide Zika net, districts near Pune on alert||PUNE: Maharashtra on Sunday ramped up disease surveillance across rural and urban areas to check for Zika virus infections, a day after it registered its first case — a 50-year-old woman from Belsar village in Pune district's Purandar taluka. State officials said authorities in Pune's neighbouring districts — including in Ahmednagar, Solapur, Satara, Raigad and Thane — have been put on alert. People with travel history to Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and those living in areas with many mosquito breeding sites are also being monitored. Samples of suspect cases will be sent for tests to the Pune-based National Institute of Virology to rule out Zika virus infection, officials said. In Belsar village, where the woman tested positive for Zika and Chikungunya coinfection, the gram panchayat has intensified efforts to destroy mosquito breeding sites. The villagers have also been asked to observe abstinence and use precautions to avoid pregnancies during the next three months, at least. Currently, 22 pregnant women in the village have been asked to prevent mosquito bites by using nets and repellants. Studies have confirmed that women contracting the Zika virus during early pregnancy stages are 17 times more likely to have a child with microcephaly (small brain or brain defect). Researchers have also found that one-third of children aged three or younger, exposed to the Zika virus, experienced below-average brain development. State surveillance officer, Pradeep Awate, said, “The monsoon season supports widespread proliferation of the Aedes mosquito, which is a vector for the Zika virus. We have alerted border districts and intensified preventive measures in over 44 rural and urban pockets in Maharashtra, where dengue and chikungunya cases are currently being notified.” Zika virus symptoms include fever, rashes, conjunctivitis, joint pain etc. Awate said district vector-borne disease control officers have been instructed to intensify vector management through environmental modification or manipulation, surveillance of both adult mosquito and larvae, personal protection measures and chemical control at the household, community and institutional levels. Belsar’s deputy sarpanch, Dhiraj Jagtap, said, “In addition to urging villagers to delay pregnancies for three months, steps have been taken to destroy mosquito breeding indoors and in peridomestic areas.” As for Pune’s urban centres, officials from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said they have intensified surveillance across areas with high construction activity, including in Baner, Balewadi and some neighbourhoods in the outskirts. Construction sites are known mosquito breeding grounds. “We have stepped up control measures. Citizens should also do their bit by keeping their surroundings clean,” said head of the PMC's insect control department, Sanjeev Wavare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/officials-cast-wide-zika-net-districts-near-pune-on-alert/articleshow/84958205.cms||Umesh Isalkar

It is a hassle considering that it will take one full day for the reports to arrive,” said Gadgil, who lives in Pashan. On Saturday, the Karnataka government made it mandatory for all travelling into the state from Maharashtra and Kerala to have an RT-PCR negative report, despite full or partial vaccination. With checkpoints having come up along the borders, private bus operators said that they were hurrying to inform passengers about the guideline. “It is a real hassle. Almost 60% travellers have cancelled tickets and sought refunds since they were not prepared. It will be impossible to run buses to Karnataka due to this order as there will not be enough passengers,” said a private bus operator. MSRTC’s Pune division traffic manager Dnyaneshwar Ranavare told TOI that they had not decided to suspend bus operations to Bijapur and Ganagapur in Karnataka as yet. “The buses will keep running for now. However, since the order is fresh, we will take stock on Monday. Last time such orders had been implemented, we had stopped inter-state services due to the restrictions,” said Ranavare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/travellers-hassled-over-ktakas-new-guidelines/articleshow/84958312.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Girl falls to death from 11th floor in Pune||PUNE: A 17-year-old girl fell to her death from the 11th floor of a residential apartment in Nanded City off Sinhagad Road around 9am on Sunday. Senior inspector Sadashiv Shelar of the Haveli police citing the circumstances and a preliminary investigation said it appeared to be a case of death by suicide. “The girl’s mother told us that her daughter had been depressed for the last few days and she was not able to cope with her Std XII science online studies. We are continuing with our investigation.” The police have yet to record the parents’ statements. They were in their first floor flat along with their five-year-old son. The father runs a training academy for budding horse riders at Katraj-Ambegaon and the girl had participated in national level horse riding competitions. She had scored 95% marks in her Std X board exams, the police said. Shelar said, “CCTV footage from the area in front of the lift on the building’s first floor shows the girl reaching for the lift going up to the 11th floor after coming out of her flat around 9am. She went to the 11th floor corridor that links the flats on either side of the building. Nobody saw her falling. The corridor has no CCTV surveillance. It difficult to assess how she fell. No suicide note was found at the site.” A first floor resident of the same building was standing in the balcony of his flat when he heard a loud thud. He rushed down the stairs and raised an alarm. The security guards and other residents of the society came to the spot. They picked up the injured girl and took her to a private hospital in Erandwane where she was declared dead. The postmortem at Sassoon General Hospital said she died of multiple injuries. A local resident told TOI the family had decided to take her to an academic counselor. Another resident said the girl was creative and was taking drawing classes. An amateur horse rider from Nanded City said, “ I used to ride horses with her at their training facility. She was a prolific rider and had participated in many state and national-level competitions. She used to trek too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teenage-girl-falls-to-her-death-from-11th-floor/articleshow/84958533.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Ghaziabad||14-year-old taken to flat in Delhi, gang-raped by 4||GHAZIABAD: A 14-year-old girl was allegedly persuaded to go on a long drive by a youth she knew, taken to a flat in Delhi and gang-raped by four. While three of the accused have been arrested, the fourth one is on the run. According to the complaint filed by the girl’s father — a clerk in a private firm — the Class 9 student was called by one of the accused, Karan, to a temple near her home on July 27. From there, she was taken to a park, where Karan allegedly introduced her to three of his friends — Golu, Lefty and Suraj. The youth then persuaded the girl to go on a drive with them in his car, but was taken to a flat in the Kondli area of Delhi.  There, she was gang-raped by the four youths — all in their early twenties. “The accused dropped her on the main road near her house and threatened her with dire consequences if she blurted out anything about the assault on her. However, the girl relied on her parents and narrated what had happened. The family then approached police,” the complaint said. What allegedly followed was an episode of struggle to convince the cops to register the complaint. A member of the girl’s family claimed that a cop at the local police station tried to persuade them to strike off the name of one of the accused from the complaint. “It’s unfortunate how the police behaved with us when we approached them. They tore our complaint twice and turned us away several times. Later, we approached some senior officers, who helped us file the FIR,” the girl’s relative said. Abhay Kumar Mishra, the circle officer of Indirapuram, said a medical test had been conducted on the girl, but the reports were awaited. “An FIR was registered against the four accused under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 363 (kidnapping), 376 (rape) of the IPC and relevant provisions of the Pocso Act,” he added. Asked about the allegations that the police delayed registering the complaint, Mishra said, “We had called the family to the police station to record their statements, but they are yet to come. Initial findings do not suggest any lag in police behaviour. However, an investigation is underway and suitable action will be taken against anyone found guilty,” he added. On the absconding fourth accused, Mishra said, “Police teams have been formed. He will be nabbed soon.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/teen-taken-to-delhi-flat-gang-raped/articleshow/84958119.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

Department in a tweet on Sunday said that class 9 and 10 will be open twice in a week. The department will release SOPs soon. Department has already opened classes 11 and 12 since July 26. It clarified that online classes will continue. Meanwhile, school associations have not decided anything about school reopening. “We have not taken any decision about it. Our online classes will continue,” said Vinny Raj Modi, vice-president, MP Association of un-aided private schools. Missionary schools have also decided to keep their schools closed. “As of now our schools are not opening,” said Sojan Jospeh, secretary, Bhopal Sahodaya Complex. There are 72 CBSE affiliated schools in Bhopal including 26 missionary schools. Schools, buses to operate on 50% attendance with Covid protocolsChief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday had said that class 9 and 10 are also being started from August 5. At present these classes will be held for only two days a week. Sources said that the SOPs for opening class 9 and 10 will be the same as it was for class 11 and 12. Sources said that class 9 students will go to school on Saturday and class 10 students can attend on Wednesday. Tuesdays and Fridays are for class 11 and Monday and Thursday for Class 12. Parents’ consent is mandatory for students to attend offline classes. As announced by the CM earlier, there can be 50% attendance in school on any given day. School buses will be allowed, but with no more than 50% occupancy. In other protocols, schools must ensure Covid protocols are to be strictly followed, and classrooms, toilets, other facilities and buses are adequately sanitized. No gathering will be allowed which means no morning assembly. Swimming lessons will also be prohibited too. The SOPs will make schools accountable for vaccination of all employees. “It will be the responsibility of the school principal to ensure that teaching staff and other employees are vaccinated at the scheduled time. Action will be taken against principals who fail to follow the instructions on vaccination,” sources added. It will also be mandatory for schools to get hostel staff vaccinated too. The accommodation and other facilities, particularly washrooms, must be sanitized and cleaned thoroughly before opening classes for 9 and 10. Coaching classes for class 12 may also be allowed to open from August 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-schools-to-reopen-for-class-9-10-from-august-5/articleshow/84961863.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Kolkata||TMC stands firm on Pegasus debate, gives 4 notices in Parliament||KOLKATA: Refusing to budge from its demand that either Prime Minister Narendra Modi or home minister Amit Shah participate in a “structured discussion” on the Pegasus issue, Trinamool Congress has given four notices in Parliament to discuss the topic by suspending all other business. The party said all “discussions on Pegasus” have to be “inside Parliament and not outside”, dismissing reported efforts by the Centre to reach out to opposition parties to break the ongoing Parliament deadlock. Dismissing claims by the Centre suggesting that Rs 130 crore of the national exchequer was being wasted due to disruptions in Parliament, a senior Trinamool leader said: “Democracy, and upholding fundamental rights, cannot be measured in Rs 130 crore.” Since 2014, the leader added, not a single notice given under Rule 267 (which allows Parliament to suspend all business to discuss a topic) had been allowed. Party sources indicated its fresh notices to discuss Pegasus mentions “surveillance, national security, espionage and military spyware” to highlight the subject’s importance. Trinamool said it, along with all other opposition parties, would continue its protests with placards, written in seven different languages, including Bengali, in both Houses. Trinamool is part of a 15-party coalition of opposition parties that is coordinating strategy to corner the Centre on the Pegasus and farm laws issues. The party said strategically it would keep seeking division of votes, should the government introduce any bill. “The division of votes will in all probability be denied, which will only prove our assertions that democracy is being murdered,” a leader said. Opening another front in its attack on BJP, Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee is leaving for Agartala on Monday. He is likely to visit the Tripureswari temple and later in the day, address media. The Biplab Deb government’s attempts to first detain and then slap criminal charges on 23 I-PAC team members in Tripura have come handy for Trinamool, which is eyeing a foothold in the state. Abhishek’s visit is largely to assess the ground situation and gauge whether Trinamool needs to weave together a broader anti-BJP coalition in Tripura or can take the fight to BJP on its own. Ahead of Abhishek’s visit, former Tripura CM Manik Sarkar, of CPM, had already spoken out against detention of I-PAC members, and a senior Congress leader, also a lawyer, had argued for their bail in court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-stands-firm-on-pegasus-debate-gives-4-notices-in-parl/articleshow/84959000.cms||---

But among his other Facebook posts on Sunday, one was critical of Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh. Posting two statements, one made by Ghosh, Supriyo said he would not have to “deal” any more with “uncouth” comments after he quit politics. It is learnt BJP seniors have reached out to Supriyo. “At least I don’t have to deal with such personalities or uncouth statements daily. I will be able to use the positive energy for honest work,” the former Union junior minister posted, followed by screenshots of comments by Dilip Ghosh and Trinamool Congress spokesperson Kunal Ghosh. In another late-night post, Supriyo wrote: “Hence, reiterating that I am not joining any other political party.” He clarified that the paragraph on his future political course of action got deleted while editing the post. On Sunday, Dilip Ghosh said: “I cannot comment on something which has not been conveyed to us officially. However, it is evident that he is finding it difficult to adjust to the changing roles. This will take time. Definitely, party seniors will have a word with him.” He added that “if anyone expresses anything on social media, that is his personal choice”. BJP sources indicated that Supriyo had spoken to party national president J P Nadda on Saturday night. Supriyo could not be reached for comment. Bengal BJP did not confirm or deny the reports. A senior Trinamool leader said: “Parliament is in session. He is an MP. He must resign in person before the Lok Sabha speaker. We will take his statements seriously if he does that.” Trinamool national spokesperson Derek O’Brien said: “BJP is imploding in Bengal and that is common knowledge.” On Sunday, Supriyo, who is the Asansol MP, listed the projects he had undertaken for the constituency. “I have brought projects worth Rs 200 crore to Asansol and will go to inspect those. I cannot be stopped as a common man to visit these places and monitor the work progress.” He claimed he would fight for people with the help of human rights commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/babul-future-buzz-continues-says-wont-join-any-other-party/articleshow/84959158.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||After 56 years, train chugs into Bangladesh via Haldibari-Chilahati||JALPAIGURI: The Haldibari-Chilahati rail route was revived after 56 years when a goods train chugged into Bangladesh on Sunday over the line that was abandoned in 1965 following the Indo-Pak war. Bangladesh was East Pakistan then. The train’s first run, however, was not smooth. It was held up at Haldibari station for nearly five hours owing to inadequate paperwork. The engine pulled 40 wagons carrying 2,400 metric tons of stone chips across the border at 4.36pm only after the Customs cleared the train following paperwork revision. The train was supposed to enter Bangladesh at 11.30am. The goods will be unloaded at Parbatipur in the neighbouring country. Bhutan has shown keen interest in using this route to export materials to Bangladesh. The revived route was inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart, Sheikh Hasina, on December 17 last year. The countries had also decided to run passenger trains from March this year. But the Covid pandemic spike postponed the launch. If everything goes right, passenger trains will start running on this route from December, sources said. “We are eagerly waiting for trains to run between NJP (New Jalpaiguri) and Sealdah via this route. This, we believe, will open new opportunities for people of this region and uplift socioeconomic condition,” said Biswajit Sarkar, secretary of Haldibari Byabsayee Samiti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-56-years-train-chugs-into-bdesh-via-haldibari-chilahati/articleshow/84959064.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

They will also meet key Union ministers, including road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari. While Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh is leaving for New Delhi on Sunday night, others will join him there later. “We have sought time from the prime minister on Monday or Tuesday. We are waiting for the response from his office,” a state unit leader said on Sunday. Last week, Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari had met PM Modi and discussed “political issues”. “The chief minister has demanded an electronic vehicle factory and vaccine manufacturing facility. But her government cannot provide land for that. The Centre should know about it,” Ghosh said. He has already spoken to Gadkari after the Union minister met the CM over projects for Bengal. “We want development for the state. We also do not want corruption in the name of development. Our MPs will meet each of the ministers such as for shipping, sports, health, panchayat and agriculture, and apprise them about ground realities in the state. We will also speak to the agriculture minister about Kisan Samman Nidhi benefits to farmers,” Ghosh added. State BJP leaders will hold a week-long protest programme in Bengal from August 9-16 when they will take to the streets over issues such as fake vaccines and corruption. “We have given charge to different morchas to hold agitation programmes,” Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-didi-bengal-bjp-team-may-call-on-pm/articleshow/84959477.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mitra urges FM to stop public insurance cos’ privatisation||Kolkata: Questioning the “anti-people policy” of privatising public sector insurance companies LIC and United India Insurance Company, Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra in a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman urged her to stop the privatisation attempt that will jeopardise investments of crores of people. Mitra said amendments to General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act (GIBNA) is only to facilitate this privatisation. In his letter, Mitra wrote: “We must recognise that LIC’s quantum of investment in our economy is a staggering Rs 36.7 lakh crore (FY 2020-21) out of which Rs 23.7 lakh crore is in government securities. Furthermore, LIC’s loans to government, government bodies and corporates is over Rs 21,000 crore. From these noteworthy figures it is evident that privatising LIC would lead to Pandora’s Box, throwing into insecurity 30 crore policy holders.” He argued this move would also “put into jeopardy the livelihoods” of 12-15 lakh insurance agents and will “throw into uncertainty the lives of 1.1 lakh employees”. Mitra also wrote that United India Insurance Company has 1.7 crore retail insurers belonging to poorer sections of society and provides employment to 13,961 employees. He said the company has invested Rs 11,396 crore in government securities and government guaranteed bonds and in short term treasury bills and other government securities. Privatisation, Mitra argued, “will raise hydra-headed financial problems while undermining the confidence of common retail insurers of the poorer sections of the society”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mitra-urges-fm-to-stop-public-insurance-cos-privatisation/articleshow/84958983.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Anil’s daughter gets CPM notice for articles in TMC mouthpiece||Kolkata: Rabindra Bharati University academic Ajanta Biswas’s four-part series on women in Bengal politics, which included Mamata Banerjee as the state’s first woman CM, has earned her a show-cause notice from CPM. The party has asked her to explain why she chose Trinamool mouthpiece ‘Jago Bangla’ to publish the articles. Biswas, who is the daughter of late CPM state secretary and politburo member Anil Biswas as well as a member of the party’s RBU unit, has responded to the show-cause, sources said. In an audio message on WhatsApp attributed to Biswas, it was said the topic of her research was women’s participation in politics in the state. “From the historical perspective, the articles are about women leaders during the struggle for Independence and the period after that. It also mentions the role played by the women leaders of Congress and the Left Front. Mention of the chief minister Mamata Banerjee in the article is therefore quite pertinent,” she said in the audio clip. Biswas did not speak to the media nor issue a statement since her articles were published in ‘Jago Bangla’. The articles mentioned prominent women in politics, including Basanti Devi, Sarojini Naidu and Suniti Devi. “Our party members publish their articles in different newspapers and magazines. But ‘Jago Bangla’ is the mouthpiece of a party opposed to us. How can she, being a party member, contribute an article to that? We have asked her to show the causes of her actions,” said Kallol Bhattacharya, secretary of CPM’s Kolkata district committee. Biswas, who was earlier a leader of CPM students’ wing SFI, has drawn criticism from party members and supporters over the articles. Bhattacharya also spoke to her, asking her to not get the articles printed any more. Trinamool state spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said the series was absolutely impartial and CPM was trying to create irrelevant political discourse around it. “Biswas had conveyed her explanation in writing to the party. They are now trying to malign her,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/anils-daughter-gets-cpm-notice-for-articles-in-tmc-mouthpiece/articleshow/84959359.cms||Rohit Khanna

---||Chennai||Negative RT-PCR test result or 2 jabs must to enter Tamil Nadu from Kerala||CHENNAI: The state government on Sunday announced that travellers entering Tamil Nadu from Kerala should either carry a negative RTPCR test report or certificate showing that they have taken both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Individuals should have taken the second dose at least 14 days prior to the date of entering Tamil Nadu by air, rail or road, the government said. The new measures, announced amid a spike in cases in Kerala, will come into effect from August 5. Kerala reported more than 20,000 cases a day last week. Meanwhile, chief minister M K Stalin warned of another lockdown if people failed to adhere to Covid-19 guidelines and avoid overcrowding. Tamil Nadu health minister Ma Subramanian, who inspected Covid-19 protocol measures at the Chennai airport on Sunday, said authorities have been directed to intensify surveillance at interstate borders and allow people only if they have necessary documents. “The 13 points of entry from Kerala to Tamil Nadu in Coimbatore and border districts like Kanyakumari are of particular concern,” the minister said. 3rd wave could be more infectious: CMAt present, travellers from Kerala are subjected only to thermal screening and oxygen saturation levels are checked for some of them. While airlines are likely to check documents at the time of boarding to Chennai, a railway official said they were awaiting instructions regarding this new requirement. “It is not clear yet if TTEs will be told to check the certificates in trains,” he added. An airport official said that in all probability, passengers will have to show the certificates during boarding at the airport of origin. Airlines may be told to issue instructions in the coming days, he said. Subramanian said all passengers from the UK, South Africa, Brazil and middle east countries were administered RT-PCR tests as per the Union government’s guidelines. It costs ?900 per test and passengers have to wait for four hours to get the result, he said. Answering a question on rapid RT-PCR tests, which were recently approved by the state government to screen departees in the international airport, the health minister said preparatory work was under way and would be completed in three days. In a video message, the CM said compared to the first two waves, the third wave could be more infectious like the Spanish flu. The government has created necessary health infrastructure but people should not act in a negligent manner as there is no clarity yet on how much damage it could cause, he said. Stalin also said the state has utilised all the vaccine doses provided to them and stressed on the need to sanction more vials for TN.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/negative-rt-pcr-test-result-or-2-jabs-must-to-enter-tamil-nadu-from-kerala/articleshow/84962030.cms||---

The SNDP Higher Secondary School at Udayamperoor has started a project to provide Rs 2,000 each to families of 200 children who are financially not sound. The school authorities have handed over the amount to around 200 families for the first month in July. It is using the donations from the staff that the school management mobilized the funds required for the project. “We have 103 staff members. All of them contributed amounts ranging from Rs 10,000 to 25,000. We have already collected Rs 14 lakh,” said school principal E G Babu. “Our teachers identified the poor families after conducting proper inquiries,” Babu said. “Our school had been into charity for quite some time. When the pandemic hit, we thought of giving food kits or so to the needy. Then, we could understand that there are government and other agencies to do it. Parents in many of the beneficiary families had been working with textile shops, buses, etc. and have lost their jobs,” Babu said. “We hand over money to the mothers of the students,” he said. On Wednesday, office-bearers of Cochin International Book Festival committee felicitated the staff of the school. “The staff of the school are giving a message of compassion. Even a local self- government institution can’t undertake such a task. That’s why we decided to honour them,” said book festival committee president E N Nandakumar. “We expect that the staff of other schools will also replicate the model,” said Nandakumar, a member of the board of trustees of National Book Trust. The school had won the best school award at state level with a cash prize of Rs 16 lakh during 2018. The school management is exploring different methods to mobilize funds for the scheme in the coming months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ernakulam-this-school-includes-charity-in-its-curriculum/articleshow/84962053.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

At least nine different projects including the mass cleaning drive that began nine weeks ago and has so far removed 17,500 tonnes of garbage and debris have been taken up. About 77,000 posters have been removed from walls at 2,100 locations and artwork and painting of walls projects ordered on three stretches. About 300 public toilets have been cleaned. Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi goes on regular inspections, ordering zonal engineers to plant flowering plants on the pavements and road sides. A total of 99 medians and traffic islands will sport fountains, plants, art work and statues made out of scrap. New parks are being planned, too. Comprehensive meetings are held every week with zonal officials and regional deputy commissioners to finalize ideas to beautify major junctions such as Madhya Kailash and city square. Powerpoint presentations are being made for each zone on how major streets and junctions can be beautified including by setting up water ponds, fountains and colourful lights. Unlike earlier, when just one stretch like Pondy Bazaar was chosen for beautification, the civic body wants to give the entire city an aesthetic look. About 15 statues made of scrap have been placed at prominent places like the Kathipara flyover, Indira Nagar, Besant Nagar and the Marina. Since end-May, when the mass cleaning programme – the chief minister’s dream project – was taken up, workers have been diligently at work in slums and on roads and pavements. Posters are going from walls and the plan is to adorn them with artwork, but funding is a problem. “We are looking to tie up with major IT companies and other industries for CSR funds,” said chief engineer (roads), S Rajendiran. As part of the plan to bring colour to streets including beautifying 99 medians, residential welfare associations are being roped in. Regional deputy commissioners and zonal officials have held meetings to find people who can fund, repair and maintain them. “It has to be a citizen centric movement. We will allow them to set up boards or advertise,” said RDC (central) Sharanya Ari. In the next two weeks, work on revamping at least 30 junctions/traffic islands in each region on the lines of the Anna Nagar Roundabout will begin. The ultimate aim, says Bedi, is to change the look and feel of the city. “When people ride or drive around, they should be able to see the greenery, artwork and experience beauty. More projects including renovating parks and setting up new ones will be taken up. Once it is finalized, we will share all details,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-makeover-gathers-pace-as-civic-body-steps-on-the-pedal/articleshow/84962093.cms||Komal Gautham

Parents will have to submit written consent before sending their wards to schools. The government has also given choice to the students to opt for online classes instead of attending the school physically. Singla also directed the education department officials and school managements to ensure proper cleaning of premises and classrooms. He asked the officials to ensure that teaching and non-teaching staff receive both doses of vaccination before allowing them to conduct physical classes. The district education officers will have to arrange the availability of vaccines for school staff on a priority basis in liaison with the respective district administration. The minister said random testing would also be conducted in schools with the ratio of 100:1 students and secretary school education would review the situation on a weekly basis. As per the standard operating procedures, there must be at least six-feet distance between students and schools have been advised to mark the seats that students have to occupy.

In his three-page order, Justice Rajasekhar Mantha commented that although the “entreaties made by the petitioner appear to be attractive... considering the fact that punishing the writ petitioner with limited amount of imprisonment under the 2006 act would not bring back the trees, compensating the state/forest department/society would be just and fair penalty, penance and retribution. The compensation shall be used to develop the environment in general and maintenance of better vigil against illegal tree-felling.” The 2006 act under which the prosecutions had been initiated — and which the judge referred to — is Section 11(1) of The West Bengal Trees (Protection And Conservation In Non-Forest Areas) Act, 2006. Under this, one can be fined Rs 5,000. It also has a one-year jail term. A court can also grant both. And till the requisite number of trees are replanted, the person charged under this offence needs to pay a fine of Rs 50 a day. “This is a compoundable offence,” said Manoj Malhotra, who argued for the state. The petitioner’s advocates could not be contacted for comment. It is still not known whether any fresh petition has been filed challenging this order. The HC’s order, detailing the offence, says: “It is submitted that the hacking of trees occurred in course of compliance with a notice of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation to remove stagnant water that accumulated in the property to discourage disease-carrying insects. The cutting of trees has nothing to do with the removal of accumulated water.” The court said the offences would be compounded if the Rs 40-crore amount is not paid in 15 days. Even after paying the fine, the group must comply with all laws to develop the property, the order adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pay-rs-40cr-plant-100-trees-for-axing-62-calcutta-hc-tells-realty-group/articleshow/84959555.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||AAP likely to announce its CM face for Punjab soon||NEW DELHI/CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday held a meeting with AAP Punjab functionaries and MLAs regarding the 2022 Punjab state elections. Punjab AAP chief Bhagwant Mann said in the meeting, which lasted for about three hours, Kejriwal took stock of the work done by the MLAs at every booth in their constituencies and asked how they planned on improving in the areas where they were lacking. “The party will work on the issues on which it was lacking during the 2017 election and we will fight the 2022 elections strongly,” Mann said. Punjab’s leader of opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema was also present in the meeting at the Delhi chief minister’s residence “We talked about the farmers’ issues at length. The Delhi government has taken a resolve of getting the three farm laws repealed. We should rise above politics and help the farmers who have been distressed for a long time now,” Mann said. “The Delhi government is already working towards that cause. We hope to do so in Punjab as well,” he added. “There will be big announcements in the forthcoming days. Some MLAs also recommended that the party should think of naming a CM face soon, to which Kejriwal seemed to be in agreement,” he said. “He is our chief and AAP is in the opposition in Punjab so he will be regularly visiting the state in the coming days,” he added. The Sangrur MP said there was open discussion on how the party would contest the elections in 2022 and said all the MLAs were “very happy with AAP’s performance in the state”. Statement issued by the party said Kejriwal gave special directions to all the MLAs, saying the party’s flag and agenda should be put aside and the farmers’ movement should be supported at all levels. He also advised the Punjab MLAs and the entire leadership to focus on drawing a positive line to liberate Punjab from the mafia rule in the 2022 Punjab assembly elections. He said the people were eager to oust these parties and therefore, they should be connected and made aware of the constructive programmes of the Aam Aadmi Party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-likely-to-announce-its-cm-face-for-punjab-soon/articleshow/84962159.cms||---
---||Chennai||Colleges in Chennai step up admission security to thwart brokers||CHENNAI: Colleges in the city are putting up an extra layer of security in online portals, informing students in advance about admissions before releasing them in public and warning students not to fall prey to brokers. Most institutions say they will reject applications if the involvement of a third party for admission by money and donation is found. Colleges have given contact numbers in applications asking students to alert management if they are contacted by middlemen. Many touts posing as consultants take out advertisements promising admissions in top colleges. In many colleges, a close watch is maintained at the gates to prevent touts from cheating desperate parents. Loyola College has asked the members of its online team to provide an additional layer of security to make the admission portal safe from hacking. “We have updated our firewall and tested with ethical hackers to make sure all student data is safe. We have also introduced one time password (OTP) to register applications to prevent any middlemen exploiting the students,” said principal Thomas Amirtham. Details of students who filled their own applications were accessed by some brokers. “So, we fear they will try to hack our admission portal to have simultaneous access to information they can use to exploit parents and students,” he added. Since the entire admission process is online, touts are taking advantage of publication of admission lists online. “This year, candidates who have secured admissions will be informed a day before the list is made public,” said M G Ragunathan, principal of Guru Nanak College in Velachery. “A few applicants alerted us that a person was demanding ?10,000 for getting them admission in our college. We immediately called that number and warned her that if she tried again, the college will file a police complaint," he added. An advertisement mentioning the top four colleges is doing the rounds. “After seeing the advertisement, I alerted all the four principals about it. Once the admission process starts, more such ads will surface. There are no middlemen involved in the admission process. It is a direct process involving only college and students. If people come forward and complain, we will file a police complaint,” said Lilian Jasper, principal of Women’s Christian College. Madras Christian College in Tambaram suspended two admissions last year after it was found out that they were secured through a third party. “The college does not accept donations for admission. If anyone promises admission on payment of donation in cash or kind, it must be brought to the notice of the principal immediately. If not, it will lead to cancellation of admission," said principal Paul Wilson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/colleges-in-chennai-step-up-admission-security-to-thwart-brokers/articleshow/84962170.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||India||Assam & Mizoram bury hatchet on Shah prod; FIR on Sarma to be nixed||GUWAHATI: Six days after the flare-up on the Assam-Mizoram border which saw six Assam Police personnel being killed in firing by Mizoram police, chief ministers of the two states buried hostility on Sunday — which happened to be the International Friendship Day — following Union home minister Amit Shah’s intervention and agreed to sit down for talks to resolve the border dispute once and for all. Shah had telephonic conversations with Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Mizoram counterpart, Zoramthanga, separately. Subsequently, Zoramthanga, who is in quarantine after contracting Covid, called up Sarma before the two CMs went public on their peace moves. In another clear indication that hostilities are subsiding, the Mizoram chief secretary said the FIR against Sarma filed at Vairengte police station, which accused him of attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy, would be withdrawn as “Zoramthanga did not really approve of it”. Read Also‘No plea for neutral probe into Assam-Mizoram border clash'A ‘neutral’ probe by a central agency into the July 26 Assam-Mizoram border clash is unlikely with the Centre unwilling to escalate the issue any further and chief ministers of either state have made no such request, according to sources in the government.Focus is on keeping NE spirit alive’Stressing the need for resolving the border dispute, Sarma said: “If the Centre takes an initiative, we have no problem talking. The Assam government is ready to talk to the Mizoram government at any point of time and at any place, be it Guwahati, Aizwal or New Delhi. If the Mizoram CM wants us for discussion, we are always available.” “We do not like these frequent border skirmishes. We have come for development and these border tensions are a big deterrent,” he said, while emphasising on a final decision on boundary demarcation. The interstate border demarcation is a central subject and both Assam and Mizoram are now looking up to New Delhi to find a permanent solution, which has been pending before Mizoram was carved out of Assam. Sarma’s statements came soon after Zoramthanga announced on Twitter: “As per telephonic discussion with the Union home minister and Assam CM, we agreed to resolve the Mizoram-Assam border issue amicably through meaningful dialogue.” “In the meantime, in order to prevent any possible escalation of the situation, I request the people of Mizoram to avoid posting sensitive messages and make judicious use of their social media platform,” the Mizoram CM added. Hours later, Sarma reciprocated by tweeting: “Our main focus is on keeping the spirit of North-East alive. What happened along Assam-Mizoram border is unacceptable to people of both states. Mizoram CM had promised to call me post his quarantine. Border disputes can only be resolved through discussion.” At the same time, Sarma asserted that the incident of July 26 when six Assam policemen were killed in firing from the Mizoram side needs to be investigated. “We don’t want to file an FIR against anybody. But if somebody dies then there is a case which needs to be investigated. I have proposed that this case be investigated by a neutral central agency like the NIA and not by either Assam or Mizoram.” Earlier, Sarma invited Mizoram police to arrest him if it helped resolve the boundary dispute between the two states. However, Mizoram chief secretary Lalnunmawia Chuango said that the FIR will be withdrawn. “In fact, our CM did not really approve of mentioning the name of the Assam CM in the FIR,” Chuango said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assam-mizoram-bury-hatchet-on-shah-prod-fir-on-sarma-to-be-nixed/articleshow/84962173.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Minimum fare up in buses to allow free travel for women||CHENNAI: Government buses, which allow free commute for women, are collecting Rs 10 as minimum fare from men. The minimum fare was Rs 5 earlier. Regular bus users allege the state transport corporation is illegally overcharging male passengers to cover the additional expenses incurred towards free bus travel for women. When contacted, Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), Villupuram, said it will rectify the mistake. The corporation is responsible for running town and mofussil services in Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram — suburban areas outside Chennai metropolitan area. But it stopped operating town buses to interior locations a few years ago citing poor patronage. Only mofussil services, which charge much higher compared to town services, are being operated Women can travel for free only in town services and not in mofussil services. But TNSTC mofussil buses, which depart from Thiruvallur bus stand, carry boards on front saying women can travel for free in them too. “If so, it must be categorised as a town bus service, for which the minimum fare is ?5. If they continue to collect ?10 per head, then it can't allow women to travel free,” said 'Citizen' Senthil, a resident-activist from Iyyapanthangal. Such violations have become common in town buses from Thiruvallur to Uthukottai, Periyapalayam, Ramacheri, Kanchipadi, Thiruvalangadu and Sriperumbudur routes. There are two categories of mofussil services — ordinary and express. The latter is a limited bus stop service and fare is a bit higher. “However, express category buses halt at almost all the bus stops en route. There was no difference in travel time compared to an ordinary category bus. Then why charge more,” asked Senthil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-minimum-fare-up-in-buses-to-allow-free-travel-for-women/articleshow/84962193.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: PG-qualified women among 8,000 applicants for 6 ‘dom’ posts||KOLKATA: Bandana Mistry is a postgraduate in Bengali literature, Swarnali Samanta is a history graduate, while Sikha Sinha is a graduate in political science. Their subjects of study in higher education might differ, but what’s common to them is their desperation to get a “secure job”. On Sunday, the three young women were among 300 final-round applicants for six posts of laboratory assistants, called ‘doms’ in local parlance. An overwhelmingly male-dominated profession, the job requires one to handle corpses at a city medical college and hospital — at a salary of Rs 15,000 a month. Covid-induced financial insecurity and the lure of a permanent government job drew an unusually high number of women applicants — there were 50 women who appeared for a written test — for the post of six doms at NRS Medical College Hospital’s Forensic Medicine and Toxicology department. More than 8,000 applications were received for the post, which included nearly 500 postgraduates, 2,200 graduates and another 100 engineers. As many as 784 of them, including 84 women, were shortlisted for the written test. Around 300 of them appeared for the exam on Sunday. Rajarhat resident Sikha (32), whose husband, a security guard, lost his job earlier during the pandemic, is desperate for a job, any job. “When the employer is not discriminating between men and women while inviting applications and selecting candidates for the written exam, why would I have any inhibitions? A job is a job. I desperately need a job now, and believe I am capable of working alongside men,” she said. Bandana (23), a resident of Habra, dreams of teaching. But it was the promise of a government job that made her overlook its profile. “I don’t care about my qualifications. I need a job for my family. Hence, I have put on hold my ambition of teaching students and am trying my luck for this government job at this moment. If I succeed, I know I have the mental strength to overcome the challenges associated with the job,” she said. Banita Mondal, (22), an HS passout, says the notification, published in December last year, had sought applications from Class VIII passouts within the age range of 18 to 40. “The entry of so many highly qualified persons has made the task difficult for us,” said Banita, who works at a pathological clinic as a lab assistant in Bamangachi. “But I am ready to break into the male bastion if I get a chance.” Indira Dey, the medical superintendent and vice-principal (MSVP), said she was surprised with the large number of women appearing for the post. “Many of the applicants are overqualified, but that will not influence the selection criteria. We will however give preference to those with experience in the job, and try to announce the results in less than two months,” she said, adding that the rush of overqualified candidates was probably due to the “security element” of a government job. The hospital now has four doms, including a woman. “Our hospital also has the only female dom in the city and we know how to make the place and the job comfortable for them,” Dey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pg-qualified-women-among-8k-applicants-for-6-dom-posts/articleshow/84959759.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kochi||Teachers go extra mile to connect with students in Ernakulam||KOCHI: In order to ensure the mental and academic well-being of students at home during the lockdown, the teachers of Ramamangalam High School in Ernakulam have started a new programme called Karuthalum Kavalum. As part of the project, the teachers pay a surprise visit to the students at their houses to monitor their academic as well as social well-being. They will check the learning atmosphere at home, interact with parents, clear the students’ doubts, evaluate assignments, etc. The project is aimed at giving the students a feel that their school and teachers are with them at a time when they go through a tough period in learning. The teachers visit each house in small groups of four or five and they make sure that the teachers who take online classes are in the group. Over the past two weeks, teachers have visited the houses of around 300 students out of the 500 students, studying in Classes V to X. Anoob John, a faculty and the project coordinator, said that the surprise nature of the visit is to prevent students and parents from being prepared for the visit. Covid protocols are strictly followed during the visit, which happens even on holidays. “The houses are spread in four panchayats and each team will cover up to 12 houses a day. At each house the teachers spend up to 30 minutes,” John said. Other than focusing on the academics, the visit helps the teachers know the social and economic backgrounds of the students. “During the visit to one of the houses, we found that the house does not have electricity connection. The school authorities intervened and managed to get power connection to them. In another case, we found a parent who is an alcoholic. We arranged professional counselling to him and he became normal,” John said. The school also arranged a help desk to provide counselling to students. Also, a digital library was launched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/teachers-go-extra-mile-to-connect-with-students/articleshow/84962195.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

Members of TET-pass ETT Unemployed Teachers Union claimed that Surinder Pal was brought down in the evening with the help of a belt tied around him and district officials helped union members in bringing him down. The protester was later rushed to Government Rajindra Hospital in Patiala in an ambulance and kept under observation before doctors discharged him. Union president Deepak Kamboj, said, “Surinder Pal had to undergo several tests, including ECG. He was given medicines by doctors, who said his health is normal. Doctors also gave him medicines for joint pain.” He added, “The government met our demands and issued notification for recruitment of 6,635 posts of ETT teachers. The government also met our demand to give first preference to ETT teachers in the recruitment and changed the rules.” Kamboj said union members honoured Surinder Pal with garlands as he fought till last. He added one more meeting with education minister Vijay Inder Singla had been fixed for Monday over one of the demands that the government was yet to meet. Union members said they had tabled their demand for age relaxation in recruitments as a number of unemployed members had turned overage in the last five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/patiala-demands-met-tower-stir-ends/articleshow/84962194.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Covid-19 can be transmitted from tears of infected patients: Study||CHANDIGARH: Tears of patients with and without ‘ocular manifestations’ can be a potential source of Covid-19 infection, suggests a study by Government Medical College, Amritsar. Although the primary transmission of the infection is from respiratory droplets, the risk of transmission through other routes such as faecal-oral and conjunctival secretions cannot be ignored, according to the study that evaluated and compared the presence of Covid-19 in tears of positive patients with and without ‘ocular manifestation’. The term ‘ocular manifestation’ refers to an eye condition that directly or indirectly is caused by a disease in another part of the body. The study was conducted on 120 Covid-19 infected patients, 60 with ocular complaints and 60 who had no ocular manifestations — conjunctival hyperemia in 41 patients, follicular reaction in 38, chemosis in 35, mucoid discharge in 20 patients, and itching in11. About 37% of the study participants with ocular symptoms had moderate Covid-19 infection, while about 63% had a severe infection. In the second group, about 52% of the patients had moderate disease and over 48% had severe disease. The samples of tears were taken within 48 hours of admission from both the eyes of enrolled patients for evaluating the presence of Covid-19 by conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method of testing, considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of Covid-19. In total, 17.5% of patients — 21 of 120 — under evaluation for RT-PCR of tears were positive for Covid-19 out of which 11 patients (9.16%) had ocular manifestations and 10 (8.33%) did not have any ocular complaint, pointing out that coronavirus infected patients can shed the infection in conjunctival secretions even in the absence of ocular involvement. INFECTIOUS TEARS‘Ophthalmologists need to be more careful’The study by Dr Prempal Kaur, Dr Gaurang Sehgal, Dr Shailpreet, KD Singh and Bhavkaran Singh observed that tears can be a potential source of infection for health care workers and called for extra caution. It added that ophthalmologists need to be more careful because of close proximity to the patient’s nose, mouth, and tears while examining them. It also recommended that all healthcare professionals should wear face masks and protective glasses while examining positive patients during the pandemic, in addition to maintaining strict hand hygiene. The study published in the latest edition of Indian Journal of Ophthalmology concluded: “SARS CoV 2 can be present in tears with or without ocular involvement, therefore, prevention is the most important aspect to be remembered by all emergency physicians and ophthalmologists to protect their patients and themselves by adopting required precautions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-19-can-be-transmitted-from-tears-of-infected-patients-study/articleshow/84962057.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Kolkata||Requests pour in for Kolkata Municipal Corporation doorstep vaccination enrolment||KOLKATA: A day after the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) announced the vaccination-at-doorstep programme, enquiries started pouring in from families of elderly, infirm and bedridden people who are yet to receive the shot. KMC ward coordinators across the city said they were flooded with requests to get names enlisted as recipients of the scheme. Sumita Mitra, a resident of Jamir Lane in Ballygunge, has been confined to her home since she suffered a pelvic bone fracture four months ago. Her husband Raja said he was finally hopeful of getting his wife vaccinated. “This is a unique scheme which will benefit thousands who are immobile and hence need vaccination at home,” Mitra said. Local ward coordinator Sudarshana Mukherjee said she has a long list of applicants who want to get enlisted for the vaccination-at-doorstep scheme. “I had been waiting to help those who can’t visit centres. Now, the opportunity has come and we need to utilize it fully,” Mukherjee said. Tridib Sadhu, a resident of Padmapukur Road in Bhowanipore, is elated at the prospect of getting his octogenarian mother Basanti vaccinated at home. Sadhu, a chartered accountant, had earlier tried to arrange for the shot for his mother but failed. “My mother is 88 and can’t walk. I have submitted a photocopy of my mother’s Aadhaar card to the local ward coordinator, Ashim Bose, requesting him to do the needful. If need be, I shall approach the KMC medical officer to book a slot for my mother,” Sadhu said. Anima Sengupta, an octogenarian from Laha Colony Ground in north Kolkata, is bedridden and can’t visit the KMC-run Covid vaccination clinic (CVC) close to her residence. Local CPI ward coordinator Karuna Sengupta on Sunday assured her that she would talk to the medical officer of the vaccination centre to try and ensure that she receives the shot at her home. “I am preparing a list of recipients who are immobile and have approached me to consider their names for the vaccination-at-doorstep scheme. I shall talk to the KMC health department officials to implement the scheme in my ward,” the ward coordinator said. Ashim Bose, a Trinamool Congress ward coordinator at Bhowanipore, had introduced vaccination at doorstep in early June, but had to call off the programme as there was no official sanction from the KMC. Bose on Sunday expressed satisfaction that now he would be in a position to bring relief to those families which had approached him for shots for family members who can’t leave the house. “Vaccination at doorstep is the need of the hour. I shall cooperate with the KMC vaccination team to make it a success,” Bose said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/requests-pour-in-for-kmc-doorstep-vax-enrolment/articleshow/84955877.cms||Saikat Ray

Both the hideouts, in Pakistan’s Bahawalpur town, are located in residential areas and in the vicinity of two mosques, making it difficult to launch an operation against the terror mastermind. According to details accessed by Times Now Navbharat from a dossier prepared by the national security establishment in New Delhi, the two hideouts are just four km apart. One of them is located in a posh locality where VIPs reside, just one km away from the Bahawalpur bench of Lahore high court. One of India's most wanted terrorists, Masood Azhar is the mastermind of major terror attacks like the 2001 Parliament attack and the 2019 Pulwama carnage. Pakistan’s continued patronage of terrorism is established by visual evidence of uniformed personnel of Pakistan army in bullet-proof jackets guarding Azhar’s hideouts. This flies in the face of the claims that Islamabad has been making to escape economic sanctions that it does not aid or abet terror. It is once again established that Pakistan continues to shelter, secure and safeguard terrorists and use terror as a state policy. Azhar’s first hideout is located right next to the Osman-O-Ali Masjid which is near the National Orthopaedic & General Hospital. With a mosque and a hospital in the vicinity, launching an Osama-like operation against Azhar becomes virtually impossible. The second house is next to the Jamia Mosque, which is just a km away from the Bahawalpur bench of the Lahore high court. The district collector's office is 3 km away. After the Abbottabad fiasco – when Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden was found hiding near the military headquarters – Pakistan seems to have ensured that Azhar’s hideouts remain in densely populated areas in order to avoid suspicion and a possible raid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pak-soldiers-guard-jem-chiefs-twin-hideouts-in-bahawalpur-expose-islamabads-lies-on-terror/articleshow/84959425.cms||---
---||Shimla||Himachal Pradesh: 40 survive 2 hungry days in Lahaul-Spiti cave||MANALI: Stuck in a cave since the Tuesday evening cloudburst in Himachal Pradesh’s Lahaul-Spiti district, 40 villagers from Changut in the remote Miyar valley hills went two days without food and water. Their three houses, standing crop, and most of the agricultural land washed away, the villagers now look to relocate and rehabilitate. The hamlet has just 14 houses, reachable after a 15-kilometre drive from Udaipur and another 10km of trek. On top of that, road links to the region were broken and telephone lines were dead, so the authorities remained unaware of the cloudburst. The terrified villagers ran for life, crossed a flooded nullah, and took refuge in a small cave below the rocky mountain. They could not bring meals, water, or warm clothes. The water level in the nullah was so high that it took two days to recede, while the group, including women, senior citizens, and children, had no escape. A village woman said: “Five days have passed but nobody came to know our fate and provide us with relief. We are cold, hungry, drenched, and underclad. Our houses, source of living, farmland, crops, all are gone. The village is no more safe. We want the government to move us to a secure place.” The villagers blamed delayed response but the officials had no idea about the damage in the Miyar valley. The flood could have killed all of the villagers. Resident Neeraj said: “Only a patwari reached out to us to assess the damage, after a few days. What can he do? They should have sent at least an SDM. Only a small chunk of land is left and we can’t reach that without a path or a bridge. We must start afresh.” The supply of electricity to Changut was restored but there cannot be any cultivation for some time. Now when they have lost most of their land, nobody wants to stay back. They have no other land, so they look to the government for help. Cabinet minister Ram Lal Markanda was to visit Miyar on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/himachal-pradesh-40-survive-2-hungry-days-in-lahaul-spiti-cave/articleshow/84962335.cms||Suresh Sharma
---||Kolkata||Kolkata hospital recalls Olympic boxer’s visit with mom||KOLKATA: When India’s latest boxing sensation Lovlina Borgohain takes to the Olympic boxing ring on Wednesday, the country will be praying for the 23-year-old. But a hospital in Kolkata will be giving a special shout-out to the Assamese pugilist who had visited it in February, without letting anyone know she was training for the Olympics. Lovlina’s 45-year-old mother Mamoni had undergone kidney transplant at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) on February 15. The boxer had flown down to Kolkata to be by her mother’s side, taking two days off from her training. On Friday, when the news of Lovlina’s win over Chinese Taipei’s Nein-Chin Chen in the fight for the bronze medal came through, something rang in the mind of RTIICS’s nephrology head Deepak Shankar Ray — The boxer’s surname and native place sounded familiar. Ray ran through the transplant record and zeroed in on Mamoni Borgohain, who, he realized, was the boxer’s mother. He then dialled Tiken, the patient’s husband, and congratulated the proud parents. “We see a lot of patients from the northeast. They don’t show off. That is why we had no inkling that we were actually treating the mother of a potential Olympic medal winner. We will be cheering for Lovlina as she takes her next bout on Wednesday,” said Ray, who had led the transplant team. Mamoni had visited the hospital in October last year and doctors found both her kidneys were failing. Transplant surgery was the best option, but she had to wait on dialysis till a matching donor was found. Though the patient was discharged after the transplant, she stayed in Kolkata till May 3 for regular follow-ups. “Lovlina was in Kolkata for two days in February. She flew back for her training only after her mother regained consciousness post surgery. Now she calls home every day from Tokyo to enquire about her mother, who is now doing very well,” Lovlina’s father Tiken told TOI from Assam. The phone has not stopped ringing at the Borgohains’ place after Lovlina’s win. However, the 23-year-old is not the only boxer in the family. Her elder twin sisters are medal winners in kickboxing at the national level. While Licha is posted at the BSF training centre in Siliguri, Lima, works for CISF at Jodhpur airport. “Two of my daughters are in the nation’s security service, the third has earned a medal for the country. We are proud,” said Tiken. The Borgohains will come to Kolkata in mid-August for a follow-up after six months of the transplant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-hosp-recalls-olympic-boxers-visit-with-mom/articleshow/84955947.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The accused has been identified as Rahul from Bilaspur, they said. The incident was linked to a dispute between two gangs over a 1,000 square yard plot in Basai. Multiple arrests have been made in this case in the past one year. Rahul was involved in five more criminal cases, including double murders in Rewari, said an officer. He was working for the Pawan Nehra gang. “Rahul had killed three members of the rival gang. He had fled the city soon after the murders but was in touch with his gang members. This helped us trace him,” said ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan. The murders were a fallout of the rivalry between the two gangs — the Johnny gang and the Hariom gang. The gangs have been responsible for killing around six persons from each other’s clan in the last two years. According to police, Amit alias Kala, a close aide of Hariom had illegally sold a plot of Johnny and Monny and it had led to conflict between the two groups. A few months back, Amit had allegedly killed Monny in Rewari. To avenge the murder of his brother, Johnny killed Amit’s associate Sanju. Amit and Johnny were arrested and sent to jail. Amit’s mother Bala Devi (57) and his uncle Narender (53) managed to get Amit released on parole on August 13, 2020. Amit wanted to avenge the murder of his associate and he planned to kill Johnny’s associates. Amit engaged his cousin brother Pawan Nehra and a few others and killed Johnny’s associates Sashikant alias Sunny, Anmol and Sameer. A case was registered in this case at Sector 9 police station on August 21 under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 148, 149 of IPC and various sections of the Arms Act. On August 20, Anmol, Sunny and Angrez were discussing something on a vacant plot in the backside of the Wing Apartment in sector 9 when six youths on three bikes arrived and fired indiscriminately. Angrez managed to escape while Sunny and Anmol were shot dead. The accused fled from the spot on their bikes. Around 3 km away in Basai a youth identified as Sameer was shot dead by a group of youths. ACP said the situation has calmed down with the arrest of multiple members of both gangs. Johnny and Hariom are also in jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/another-sharpshooter-held-in-basai-triple-murder-case/articleshow/84956557.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Now, I have several health issues and deficiencies,” said a 20-year-old woman who stays in Sohna and has two children. “I was never given a chance to decide about my life or follow my dreams,” she added. The young woman was among several others from Sohna and Nuh who spoke about their early marriages during an online session, Lado Panchayat, held on Sunday, and demanded that the minimum age of marriage for girls be raised to 21 years. The programme was part of a campaign that aims to take the demand to the Prime Minister and the women and child welfare ministry. The initiative was undertaken by the founder of Selfie With Daughter Foundation Sunil Jaglan in July and the objective is to prepare a report based on direct consultations with adolescent girls who attend the sessions. “If we talk about equality between men and women, we have to start by having the same minimum age of marriage for them. Hence, we demand that the minimum age of marriage for girls be raised to 21 years, like it is for men,” said Anjum Kumari, a member of Selfie With Daughter Foundation. “We have seen that several parents produce forged birth certificates for their daughters, who were married off early, to escape legal action. Hence, there should be a minimum educational qualification criteria before girls can be married off,” Anjum said. According to members of the foundation, 15 Lado Panchayats would be organised, one every Sunday, and at the end of the campaign, the members will draft a fact-finding report based on experiences and stories shared by the participants and demands raised by girls across Haryana and other states. The report will be submitted to the prime minister’s office (PMO) and the women and child welfare ministry, demanding that the minimum marriageable age be raised. “Through these sessions, we are trying to dig deeper into various social and economic reasons behind early marriages of girls and the impact it has on young women. When we organise these panchayats, we observe that most girls who were married off very early were not allowed to continue with their studies, although they wanted to,” Jaglan said. “We will organise 15 such panchayats and based on the discussions we have during these sessions, a report will be prepared,” he added. Nuh resident Nasreen (name changed), who attended the third edition of Lado Panchayat on Sunday, said in their locality, parents start looking for grooms as soon as their daughters attain puberty. “When girls from cities go to schools and colleges, we are forced to become young brides and mothers. This takes away the opportunity of personal growth that men get,” said the 21-year-old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/at-panchayat-a-call-for-parity-on-marriage-age/articleshow/84956607.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Jaipur||BJP MP Kirori Lal Meena exposes chinks in security at Amagarh fort||JAIPUR: BJP Rajya Sabha member Kirori Lal Meena has become an unmanageable intelligence challenge for the city police. He exposed the chinks in security at magarh Fort area after he trekked through littleknown pathways before hoisting a flag in one of the ramparts on Sunday morning. No one in the police anticipated that the elderly leader could suddenly spring out of the thick bushes near the hill fort at the crack of dawn. But the city police were caught napping when Meena breached the cordon and posted pictures from the spot. This was not the first incident where Meena kept the city police on the backfoot, in fact, he regularly springs up surprises in some of the heavily guarded areas of the city, sending cops into a tizzy. In April this year, Meena shook the Jaipur police when he came to the city with the body of a priest from Tekari village of Dausa district. Meena and his supporters organized a dharna with the body near the Civil Lines railway crossing, barely a few meters away from the high-security zone. Jaipur police had a hard time admitting that Meena could come all the way from Dausa and reached the city, crossing the jurisdictions of over a dozen police stations in his wake. “He has a large number of supporters in cities and small villages, he swiftly marshals his supporters from different areas into small groups before organizing a big gathering. It is difficult to keep a tab on his every movement,” an official said. However, Meena has long been an issue frequently mentioned in repeated intelligence failures of local police. Recently, he had arrived at Civil Lines area with people, seeking relief packages for children orphaned during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-mp-kirori-lal-meena-exposes-chinks-in-security-at-amagarh-fort/articleshow/84962412.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||‘Power erratic, upkeep shabby’: Global Heights builder faces residents’ protest||Gurgaon: Residents of Breez Global Heights in Sohna’s Sector 33 staged a protest against the developer on Sunday over erratic power supply and shabby maintenance in the society. Hundreds of flat owners took part in the agitation holding placards and banners and raising slogans against Breez Builders and Developers Private Limited for failing to provide basic amenities, like regular power and water supply and security. Despite raising several complaints on the matter, the developer is not willing to listen and address the concerns, the residents alleged. According to the agitators, they have been facing frequent outages for 8-14 hours almost every day, which is affecting their daily routine, especially since many people are working from home and children have online classes. They have also alleged that the developer is arbitrarily charging maintenance fees from them. Society resident Asmita Pathak said: “We have been facing frequent power cuts due to which our children are struggling with their online classes and some are not being able to take tests. When we asked the service provider, we were told inferior quality of cables is causing frequent outages, this despite the fact we have paid more than Rs 4 crore as external development charges.” The affordable housing project was launched in 2015 and possessions were given in 2020. Currently, around 500 families stay in the society. Residents also said the lifts malfunction frequently, the quality of construction material is poor and there are cracks on walls. The developer, however, refuted all allegations. “We are not making any profit and levying only usable charges and many residents are not making payments on time. The facility is being managed by a private firm and whatever issues arise, they are attended to on time. Despite increased expenditure, we have not raised the charges and we are doing our best so that the residents do not have to face any inconvenience,” said Rajeev Jain, director, Breez Builders and Developers Private Limited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/power-erratic-upkeep-shabby-global-heights-builder-faces-residents-protest/articleshow/84956635.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Lucknow||Under Yogi Adityanath, UP government is top in law and order, says Amit Shah||LUCKNOW: In a strong endorsement of the Yogi Adityanath government in the runup to the high-voltage state elections early next year, Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday lauded the chief minister for taking UP ahead of all other states in terms of law and order situation. Coming days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the UP government for his Covid management, Shah's remark is yet another affirmation of Yogi as a key leader to spearhead the BJP's bid to retain power in the state. Earlier, BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh had also hailed the party’s saffron mascot for his management in battling corona pandemic. Union home minister Amit Shah plants a sapling on Sunday“Not only law and order, UP is leading other states in implementation of other 44 developmental schemes of the Centre. UP has developed in all fields…It is a matter of pride for us,” Shah said after laying the foundation stone of UP State Institute of Forensic Sciences in Lucknow. The institute, which will be affiliated to Gandhi Nagar (Gujarat) based National Forensic Science University, is proposed to come up at an estimated cost of Rs 200 crore. Shah also emphasised that the Yogi government worked exceedingly well in controlling the pandemic through sample testing and vaccination. His assertion was seen as BJP’s stern counter to opposition which seeks to corner the saffron dispensation over mismanagement of Covid during the devastating second wave. The home minister categorically tore into the opposition, accusing it of having pushed UP into a state of anarchy and instilling fear among people by fanning communal tensions until the BJP came to power in 2017 assembly elections. ‘BJP set to form govt again with overwhelming majority in 2022’I have seen UP closely since 2014. There was migration of people in west UP, women felt unsafe, land grabbers used to usurp government/ private land and bullets were being fired in broad daylight,” Shah said. He said that the opposition leaders were nowhere in the time of crisis and when people, especially the farmers, needed them. “But when the election approaches these leaders come to the fore wearing new clothes,” he said, claiming that the BJP was poised to form the government once again with an overwhelming majority in the 2022 assembly elections. Shah urged the people not to be swayed by the opposition’s lies and see the work done by the BJP government to take UP forward. The home minister said that the state was on a progressive trajectory in terms of industrialisation, investments, farmers and women welfare, besides cracking down on corruption. He said that the state economy doubled from Rs11lakh crore to Rs 22 lakh crore in the past fourand-a-half years to become the second largest economy in the country. “We had promised that the government will not be for a specific caste or one particular family or one but for all,” he said, in an apparent jibe at the Samajwadi Party. “This is the very identity of BJP. The BJP government does not believe in nepotism and does not function on the basis of caste and communities. It works for the poorest of all and for a strong law and order situation,” he said. Admitting a low conviction rate, Shah said that the Centre was taking keen initiatives to support the state government in ensuring a proper law and order situation in the state. “The trained forensic manpower will help the state government in ramping up the conviction rate,” he said, adding that the police earned a bad name either because of “no action” or “extreme action”. Raising a nationalist pitch, Shah invoked freedom fighter Lokmanya Gangadhar Tilak on his 101st death anniversary to assert that the forthcoming generations will never be able to forget the contribution he made for the country. Tilak is known for giving the popular slogan, “freedom is my birth right” that shook the very foundation of the British Empire. “We expect that his ideology and patriotism will continue to inspire future generations,” Shah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/under-yogi-adityanath-up-government-is-top-in-law-and-order-says-amit-shah/articleshow/84962378.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Gurgaon||3 held in Gzb for sex determination tests||Gurgaon/Ghaziabad: Health officials from Gurgaon raided a shop in Ghaziabad on Sunday morning and three people were arrested on charges of conducting sex determination tests from there. Officials have recovered Rs 35,000 and a portable ultrasound machine from the spot. The arrested trio — a middleman, an ultrasound technician and his associate — have been booked under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994, and the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon, said he had received information about sex determination tests being conducted from an outlet at Prem Nagar, New Panchawati, Ghaziabad, and a team had been formed to look into the matter. Health officials took help of a pregnant woman from Gurgaon’s Bhondsi village and followed her to the testing facility on Sunday. “At the centre, the woman was asked to pay Rs 35,000 for the test and later, she was told the sex of her child. Once the process was over, the woman informed the health team about the operation and the place was raided. We came to know that the gang used to charge Rs 20,000-Rs 35,000 for each test,” Yadav said. In Ghaziabad, Sihani Gate police station was informed about the testing facility. Ghaziabad additional chief medical officer, Dr Sunil Tyagi, said the middleman, Gautam, had initially planned to take the woman to a testing centre in Delhi. But later, she was directed to a shop named Jai Ambe. Gautam had allegedly demanded Rs 35,000 from the woman. The two others who were arrested are ultrasound technician Premshanker and his associate Jaipal. Dr Tyagi said Premshanker is from Modinagar and earlier, he was an assistant to a radiologist at a diagnostic centre in Dadri.He added that the testing facility was being run from the shop that provided supplies for wedding functions.  Yadav said: “It was an inter-state racket. We will be conducting more raids to curb such practices. This was the 14th raid by the Gurgaon health department this year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/3-held-in-gzb-for-sex-determination-tests/articleshow/84956667.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Explainer: Why are flat owners in sectors 55-56 being told to pay enhancement?||The Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP, earlier Huda) has sent notices to group housing societies in Gurgaon, asking them to pay enhancement fee along with a delayed interest at the rate of 15% for a period of 6,756 days, or 18 years and five months. 1. What is this enhancement fee for?In 1990, 631 acres of land from three villages — Ghata, Wazirabad and Haiderpur Viran —were acquired by Huda to build sectors 55 and 56. It allotted the land for 48 group housing societies (GHS-90) in 1993. In 1996, the land owners approached a local court, which increased the compensation. In 1998, another group housing society scheme (GHS-98) was floated. Notices have been sent out to flat owners to claim the dues that accrued because of the higher compensation paid to land owners. Interest for all these years has been charged as well. The urban development authority says the enhancement was not included in the allotment charges for GHS-98. 2. When were the notices sent?In 2016, GHS-98 societies got enhancement notices, which included interest. In June 2021, the societies again received notices that if the dues are not cleared, sale and purchase will be banned and amenities will be cut off. 3. How much does a flat owner have to pay?The average enhancement, after adding interest, works out to Rs 3.5 lakh to Rs 4 lakh per flat. The government has served notices to a total of 52 group housing societies. The amount it intends to collect as enhancement fee and interest is around Rs 200 crore. 4. Why were the notices challenged?Through a Right to Information plea, residents’ associations found that the allotment price for GHS-98 had seen a major increase because of additional government charges of Rs 612 per sqm, which included Rs 500 as development charges. Residents’ groups contend no such charges were levied on allottees of GHS-90 and also question the logic of asking them to pay development charges twice, saying development charges were part of the allotment price anyway. Their other contention is that land for rural dairy zones, housing board and roads and parks was not excluded from the calculations, as it ought to have been. 5. What is the government’s argument?The government says the cost of the land was originally conveyed to the societies by the Huda chief administrator through a letter of intent (1999) for allotment, and that the chief administrator's office later conveyed that the rate of allotment did not include any enhancement. Which is why it is now recoverable from allottees in sectors 55-56 in accordance with regulations of Haryana Urban Development (disposal of land and building) Regulation Act 1978.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/explainer-why-are-flat-owners-in-sectors-55-56-being-told-to-pay-enhancement/articleshow/84956803.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

Part of another house also collapsed in north Kolkata but none was injured. In the first incident, a 50-year-old woman, identified as Jasvinder Kaur, died in a partial house collapse reported from the Bondel Road area in Old Ballygunge. Police said a portion of the roof — measuring 10 feet by eight feet — of a single-storey building collapsed trapping the woman. The incident was reported around 2.05 pm. By the time the locals, along with police and DMG, could rush her to the SSKM hospital, she was declared dead. The KMC officers later visited the building in Ward 65 and took stock of the situation. “The woman was alone at the house. She was busy cleaning her child’s clothes when the incident took place. A portion of the roof collapsed on her. There are six other families who are still staying in that house on rent,” said a police source. In the other incident, a portion of balcony — measuring six feet by three feet — of the second floor of a three-storey building collapsed on Nanda Ram Sen Street at Shyampukur. Fortunately, no one was injured in the incident that took place in Ward 9 around 1.10am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/50-year-old-killed-in-bondel-road-house-collapse/articleshow/84957014.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram saw 7 Covid cases a day in July, but nearly half came from 5 hotspots||GURUGRAM: July has been lenient on Gurugram in terms of Covid numbers. At seven cases a day on an average, the month’s figures are the lowest since July last year. However, five areas have still been a cause for concern for the health department, accounting for 44% of the total cases last month. These areas — Tigra, Wazirabad, Chanderlok, Badshapur and Patel Nagar —are densely populated, which means the infection can spread easily. Both slums and condominiums dot the area. Of the 210 cases that Gurugram reported in July, Tigra had 30 patients, Chanderlok 15, Wazirabad 23, Badshapur 14 and Patel Nagar 11. Officials in the health department said they were conducting focused testing in these areas. “Our teams have been carrying out focused testing in all micro areas of the city from where fresh cases are being reported. Most patients are in the age group of 21-40 years. They are either frequent travellers or those who are yet to get vaccinated. We are increasing the number of vaccine camps in urban slums and carrying out target testing,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer. According to him, a large number of people from Tigra, Wazirabad and Chandralok have in the recent past travelled to states where the caseload is still high. “The new cases are mostly people who have travel histories. We have been monitoring them closely and carrying out contact tracing of each infected person to curb the spread,” said Yadav. At present, Gurugram does not have any micro containment zone. However, the district administration will seal off clusters that have more than five active cases. Random testing will be conducted in these areas. In terms of Covid numbers, the city had witnessed a sharp spike in April and May, which continued through the first week of June as well. After June 8, daily cases dropped to double digits and since June 25, Gurugram has added just single digits every day. This was a huge relief when pitted against the numbers during the peak of the second wave, when the district reported 5,000 new cases on some days. On Sunday, meanwhile, Gurugram reported nine fresh cases, taking the tally to 1,80,900. Of them, just 84 cases are active. The positivity rate stands as 0.1%. As many as eight persons recovered, bringing the total number of recoveries to 1,79,896. The recovery rate stands at 99.6%. A total of 73 patients are in home isolation while 11 are in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-saw-7-cases-a-day-in-july-but-nearly-half-came-from-5-hotspots/articleshow/84959298.cms||Ipsita Pati

The fatality toll due to Covid in Pink City stands at 1,970. Out of 33 districts, 22 did not report even a single Covid death in July, including Jaipur where the last death was reported on June 30. Since the first Covid death was reported on April 2, 2020 when an 85-year-old man died at SMS Hospital, Jaipur reported deaths every month. However, in January, February and March, Jaipur reported just 13, 5 and three deaths, respectively. But, in the next three months, the city witnessed an onslaught as 271, 1,091 and 86 persons died in April, May and June, respectively. Now, as the second wave has slowed down, Jaipur along with other 21 districts have not reported even a single death. Eleven districts reported 33 Covid deaths in July and out of those, 15 were reported from Udaipur and the rest 10 districts contributed 18 deaths, which took the state’s overall toll to 8,954. “Not much deaths due to Covid took place in July, which is quite encouraging for us. However, casualties have taken place in Udaipur in July and we are looking into it,”said a senior health department official. The state reported 21 cases on Sunday taking the tally to 9,53,688. Districts which reported new cases are Udaipur (8), Jaipur (3), Nagaur (2), Ajmer (2),Bikaner (2), Dausa (1), Hanumangarh (1), Jodhpur (1) and Sikar (1).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-sees-no-covid-deaths-in-july-after-1000-casualties-in-may/articleshow/84962554.cms||---
---||Noida||PIL for freehold properties: Allahabad HC seeks response in 3 wks||Noida: The Allahabad high court that heard a public interest litigation (PIL) on July 28 seeking freehold on properties in Gautam Budh Nagar has given three weeks’ time to the district’s development authorities and the state to respond on the matter. The next hearing is likely to be held this month. The Confederation of NCR Residents Welfare Association (CONRWA) had filed the PIL objecting to the 99 year leasehold system followed by the Noida Authority, Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority. “We had filed a PIL seeking that leasehold properties in Noida be made freehold. We submitted all relevant documents to state that there are no leasehold properties in any city of Uttar Pradesh or Delhi-NCR,” said PS Jain president, CONRWA. “The Noida Authority board had given its approval on the matter earlier and it is now pending with the state,” Jain added. The demand for freehold properties was first raised by the Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA), which got it approved by the Noida Authority board in November 2018. Last year, the proposal was approved again. In Gautam Budh Nagar, all properties are leased out for a period of 99 years and an agreement is signed between buyers and the local authority stating the same. Sushil Aggarwal, the founder member of FONRWA, who was one of the first to raise the demand, said: “Freehold policy has been in place for UP since 1995. It is applicable to all major towns and some industrial authorities have allotted freehold land to developers as well. The matter should now be expedited from the state government side, as barring Gautam Budh Nagar, no other place has a provision for 99 years leasehold on properties.” A N Dhawan, former secretary general, FONWRA and one of the residents to draft the initial demand, said Noida Authority had given its approval in the matter after almost 10 years. “Residents are now waiting for a final nod from the state,” he said. N P Singh, former president, FONRWA, said people have already paid a one-time lease rent and registration charges at the time of buying properties. “Now, imagine their family members going through the whole process once again to re-register their own property after 99 years,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/pil-for-freehold-properties-allahabad-hc-seeks-response-in-3-wks/articleshow/84957305.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Ten districts – Aligarh, Amroha, Etah, Farrukhabad, Hathras, Kasganj, Kaushambi, Mahoba, Pratapgarh and Shravasti – have been declared Covid-free. At least 23 districts reported new cases but in single digit. In view of the possibility of the third wave of coronavirus pandemic, the number of oxygen plants and ventilator beds have been ramped up in the state. Out of the 541 sanctioned oxygen plants, 254 have become functional. The government also claimed to have readied 156 beds for children of which 56 beds are equipped with ventilators. “The remaining beds have oxygen support through pipelines and the paediatric Covid ward is ready for use,” a government statement said. TimesViewIt is heartening to see a drop in active cases to the levels witnessed at the initial stage of the pandemic. However, instead of being complacent, people must continue to strictly follow safety protocols and take advantage of the mega vaccine drive. This is the only way to avoid the loss of lives witnessed during the second wave of pandemic in April-May this year.“Ventilator unit with 40 beds for children is also ready at Lucknow’s Balrampur Hospital and an oxygen generation plant is functional to fulfill the oxygen requirement of 100 beds,” it said. The daily positivity rate in the state stands at 0.01% which is the lowest in the country. Daily fresh cases have been limited to less than 100 for nearly 20 days now. With a density of 690 people per square kilometre, UP is also the only state in the country to have tested more than 3 lakh samples a day and over 6.5 crore samples so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/active-covid-cases-drop-to-664-in-uttar-pradesh/articleshow/84962579.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: 2 new bus routes to boost Delhi link by August end||GURUGRAM: Gurugram Mahanagar City Bus Limited (GMCBL) is planning to expand its services on two new routes, which will connect Gurugram to the national capital. By the end of August, the city bus service will add the new routes to Sarai Kale Khan and ISBT and run at least one bus each on both of them. The move comes after the GMCBL took note of the rising demands of residents to improve connectivity between Delhi and Gurugram. In the first phase, only two buses — one on each route — will run and the frequency and number of buses will be increased depending on the ridership, GMCBL officials said. The timings and route numbers are still being worked out. “We are fully geared up to extend our bus services to two new routes. We were seeing increased demand from the residents to run buses on these routes. We surveyed to check the feasibility and designed a route map. We have raised demands for two buses and if all goes as per the schedule we are hopeful to launch these two new routes by end of August,” said a GMCBL official privy to the matter. With the lockdown restrictions easing out and the public mobility showing an uptick, residents in the city have stepped up their demands for newer bus routes connecting Gurugram and New Delhi. Presently, there are two routes on which the GMCBL is running eight buses. Four city buses are running on route number 210 between Gurugram bus stand and Karol bagh. Another four buses ply on route number 202D between the Gurugram bus stand and Badarpur border. The GMCBL rolled out the survey to identify new routes and map the ridership demand to expand its services. The initial round of surveys carried out in July zeroed down on the two bus routes. It is also working on other routes between Delhi and Gurugram to expand its services. “The survey is an ongoing process as we are looking to expand our operations. Besides the two new routes that have been finalised, we are also assessing the feasibility of starting bus services on another route to New Delhi. One of them is Anand Vihar. The decision to start buses on that route will happen after we start services on the first two routes,” the official added. Once the two routes are open, at least 10 GMCBL buses will be plying on all the routes to New Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/2-new-bus-routes-to-boost-delhi-link-by-august-end/articleshow/84959342.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

He also made sure to use two different pens — black and blue — while writing the tests with his toes to make his answer sheets look more beautiful. A differently abled Class XII student Tushar Vishwakarma of Creative Convent College represented an indefatigable spirit by scoring 70% in his board results. “Since birth my both hands do not function, but I never considered it as a shortcoming. When my two elder siblings started going school I also requested my parents that I wanted to go to school, but the hurdle was how I would write. Trying to copy my siblings when they studied I made my toes my hands and began writing from it,” said Tushar who aspires to become an engineer. He said, “My father Rajesh Vishwakarma, who is in a small-time private job, went to several schools and finally I got admission in Model Public School and in class IX I got admission in Creative Convent College. I didn’t want my disability to become a hurdle in my success. I started writing with my toes when I was in nursery. With the practice of over six hours per day I trained myself in writing fast. From turning pages of the book to writing assignments and examinations, now my toes are my hands.” “My teachers have been extra supportive. They allowed me to sit on the floor and appear for the examination. I am happy with my marks in class X. I had scored 67% and in class XII my performance has improved further and I have scored 70%,” he said, adding that “with strong willpower anybody can overcome any shortcomings.” “Tushar never made excuses and is a sincere student and never missed any class. Also, his writing is very good and clean,” said his teacher.

---||Gurgaon||Focus on second dose, Haryana health minister Anil Vij tells all districts||GURUGRAM: Health minister Anil Vij on Sunday directed all districts to put emphasis on second doses of Covid vaccination. They have also been asked to submit daily report on second-dose vaccination. The health department has decided to set up 46 government session sites on Monday in the city. Of the 46 sites, Covishield doses will be administered at 40 sites, Covaxin at five sites and Sputnik V will be administered at one site. “We will receive 14,000 Covishield and 20,000 Covaxin doses on Monday and, therefore, we will be carrying out more sessions on Tuesday. At present, we are focusing more on the second dose of Covaxin,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. A total of 8,465 people in the 18-44 age group got inoculated on Sunday. In the 45-plus category, 1,996 people took the shots. As many as 30 healthcare staff and 89 frontline workers also received the jabs. On Sunday, 6,284 recipients were inoculated at government session sites whereas 4,296 shots were given at private vaccination centres. A total of 6,351 first doses were administered on Sunday and 4,296 second doses were given to recipients in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/focus-on-second-dose-vij-tells-all-districts/articleshow/84959567.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida top in vaccine coverage, but way short of July target||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: As Noida and Ghaziabad reeled under shortage of vaccine doses throughout July, both districts remained way behind their respective vaccination targets for the month. In July, Ghaziabad managed to administer 4.3 jabs to recipients — a little over 50% of the target set by the health department before the start of the month. Also, over 1.14 lakh doses were given in the third week alone. Meanwhile, GB Nagar gave 3.5 lakh doses in July, which is also just about half the number it had planned earlier. Although GB Nagar is placed at the top in terms of vaccination coverage in UP, it could also not achieve its target. The total number of vaccinations in July is also half of its figures in June - when around six lakh doses were administered in Noida. In Ghaziabad, about 4.6 lakh jabs were given in June. During the first week of July, the supply issue also led to the suspension of government vaccination drives for two days and walk-in vaccinations remained unavailable for around 10 days in Noida. The cluster-based campaign aimed at increasing vaccination coverage in all districts, which was planned to be launched in July, could not take off in both districts. In the past week, however, there was a slight rise in vaccine supply and the doses were being distributed to the districts more regularly. This led to a marginal increase in the total vaccination numbers in the last week of the month. In GB Nagar, around 84,000 jabs were given in the last week of July, compared to around 74,000 in the penultimate week. Over 2.13 lakh jabs were given in the last two weeks of July in Ghaziabad. Some of the private centres in both districts have been able to vaccinate in large numbers, despite more people preferring government centres due to the price gap. While the vaccines are available free of cost at government centres, it costs a minimum of Rs 780 at private centres. The number of private vaccination centres in Noida is half of the government ones, their contribution to the total vaccination is about 40%. Three of the top five centres that have jabbed the maximum number of people in GB Nagar are private ones. Kailash Hospital in Greater Noida has given over 73,000 shots, Felix Hospital has given 58,000 doses and Max Superspeciality Hospital has given nearly 52,000 doses. In Ghaziabad, there are just about 10-12 hospitals that are carrying out the vaccination drive. Max Hospital in Vaishali has carried out the maximum number of doses (67,800), while LYF Hospital has administered about 27,300 doses. Till now, 14.63 lakh doses have been administered in Ghaziabad, out of these 11.91 lakh were first doses and 2.71 were second jabs. A total of 7.75 lakh doses were administered to recipients in the 18-44 years age group, 4.4 lakh in the 45-plus age group and 2.46 lakh in the 60-plus age group. As many as 8.29 lakh doses were administered to men and 6.32 lakh to women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-top-in-vax-coverage-but-way-short-of-july-target/articleshow/84959807.cms||Snehil Sinha

The hospital will conduct researches on multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) among children, genome sequencing to identify variants of the virus in those who died of Covid, psychological stress differences between male and female healthcare workers during the pandemic, risks of post-Covid syndrome in western UP and tumours and lung cancers as a result of the virus. These five studies will be conducted by four doctors of the institute — Dr Vivek Gupta associate professor in the department of pathology, Dr Rakesh Gupta, the GIMS director, Dr Bharti Bhandari Rathore, associate professor, and Dr Rambha Pathak. A total of 10-12 research topics had been proposed to the ICMR in June. But the approval came only for five of them on July 23. The studies will be conducted on sample sizes ranging from less than 60 to more than 100 and may need one and a half years to complete. “We had applied for 10-12 research projects to the ICMR on June 30. Five of the studies were shortlisted and approved by the research centre on July 23. These will be funded by the ICMR. For the others, we will have to wait for approval,” said Dr Gupta. The research subjects awaiting approval include the effect of the second wave, both doses of the Covid vaccine on people and whether a booster dose is needed. GIMS had also proposed a study on mucormycosis in Covid patients and the relation between the two infections, the impact of the Covid vaccine on pregnant and lactating women and those who have reached menopause, vaccine hesitancy in rural people and the efficacy and safety of cross vaccination. The Greater Noida hospital is already engaged in nine research projects related to Covid. Some of them are the phase 2 efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma in treatment of Covid, the mental and social health of healthcare personnel involved in pandemic management, evaluation of rapid antigen test protocols and biomarker identification in Covid. “Some of these studies are nearing completion while we are going ahead with the others,” said Dr Saurabh Srivastava, the chief medical superintendent at GIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gims-gets-icmr-nod-for-5-research-topics/articleshow/84959823.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

According to police, the accused has been identified as Sonu Chaudhary, a resident of Ghaziabad who sells coconut water in Indirapuram. Abhay Mishra, circle officer, Indirapuram, and in-charge of cyber cell, said that in April this year, when the second wave of Covid hit, the man posted his contact number for business near Indirapuram area. “The 26-year-old woman had contacted him to deliver four coconuts for her father who was a Covid patient,” Mishra said. “After two days, Sonu bought a SIM card after submitting documents of his grandfather, who died five years ago. He then made a WhatsApp call to the woman. He disconnected the call after he got to know her name. Then he started sending her objectionable videos. He also made video calls to her where he could be seen in objectionable positions,” the officer said. He would take screenshots of video chats and blackmail the woman, police said. In May, the woman had made an online complaint with police. Later, the complaint was transferred to the cyber cell and an investigation started. When the cyber team traced the phone number, it was found that it belonged to a man who had died. With help of surveillance, police traced the location in Indirapuram. Cyber cell recovered the phone and found the details of 82 women on it. Police said the youth harassed all of them. “Sonu has been booked under relevant sections of the IT Act.

Sydney, Australia's largest city, is into its sixth week of a lockdown as it struggles with a spike in infections that added nearly 3,500 cases since the first one was detected in a limousine driver who transported overseas airline crew. Officials in New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, have implored residents to stay home to prevent more surges and brought in the military to help police enforce compliance after some defied lockdown rules. Some 300 army personnel, who will be unarmed and under police command, will go door to door to ensure people who have tested positive are isolating at their homes. After a steady rise in new cases, the lockdown rules in southeast Queensland, which includes Brisbane, will run until Sunday as officials fear there could be more undetected cases in the community and urged residents to get tested. Restrictions were due to end Tuesday evening. Thirteen locally acquired cases were detected in Queensland state, up from nine a day earlier. Australia is going through a cycle of stop-and-start lockdowns in several cities after the emergence of the fast-moving Delta strain and such restrictions are likely to persist until the country hits a higher vaccination coverage. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has promised lockdowns would be "less likely" once the country inoculates 70% of its population above 16 years, which now stands at 19%. Morrison expects to hit that mark by the end of the year. Although Australia's vaccination drive has lagged many other developed economies, it has so far fared much better in keeping its coronavirus numbers relatively low, with just under 34,400 cases and 924 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/army-patrols-sydney-streets-as-brisbane-extends-covid-19-lockdown/articleshow/84962854.cms||---

The deceased was a tailor and unmarried. According to police, the relatives of deceased identified as Rakesh Kumar was found in an unconscious state bleeding from his head and other parts. He was rushed to the hospital where he succumbed to the injuries. Soon after the incident came to the notice of the police, a team of senior officers along with the team of Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) rushed to the spot. “The deceased Rajesh had grave injuries on his head and other parts. His father Heera Lal is missing since the death. It was found in preliminary investigation that Heera Lal had demanded money late on Saturday evening from his son to buy some intoxicant to which his son denied. Both had a verbal spat which was loud and was heard by the neighbours. Since his father Lal was missing, it appears that he could be behind the murder,” said a senior police officer of Raisinghnagar police station. Rajesh was lying unconscious in a pool of blood when the police team reached his house. The relatives are also surprised that the father of the deceased is missing and his phones are switched off. “It was also found that Heera Lal was an addict of various drugs, while Rakesh was earning his livelihood through tailoring. Both father and son had feuds earlier too since the son was always unhappy and irritated with the habit of his father asking money for liquor and drugs,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/denied-money-for-drugs-man-kills-son-in-rajasthans-sriganganagar-district/articleshow/84962949.cms||---

Designated spaces would be created and each would be provided a unique number, which would then be shared with the families. “We would also supply the sapling from government nurseries,” he said. A specific day will be allocated for each family and they will be invited to plant the sapling in their designated space. These saplings will be maintained by the GCC.
