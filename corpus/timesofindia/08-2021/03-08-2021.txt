However, the cutoff rank for Karnataka domicile candidates in general merit under the 25% horizontal reservation, which has been introduced for the first time this year, is 237. Students seeking seats under the domicile quota should have studied in Karnataka for at least 10 years. The batch consists of 120 seats, of which 93 are for general merit, 18 for SCs and 9 for STs. Under the 25% horizontal reservation, 30 seats — 23 for general merit, five for SCs and two for STs — are earmarked for Karnataka students. State topper Rishab Devaiah Ittira, who bagged all-India rank 14, is the first candidate from Karnataka to figure in the list and has been given seat under the all-India quota. While 84th all-India rank holder is the first to get the seat under domicile Karnataka quota under general merit, the student with all-India rank of 237 has landed the last seat. Holder of all-India rank 1037 has landed the seat under domicile Karnataka and People With Disabilities (PWD) quotas in general merit category. As expected, most of the top rank-holders have chosen NLSIU. Except for ranks 24, 35, 65, 69, 74 and 78, all others in the top 80 figure in the merit list for the Bengaluru law school.

The cutoff rank is 1936 for PWD candidates in general merit list. The 25% horizontal compartmentalised reservation for Karnataka students was introduced after resistance and long legal battles. The Supreme Court is still hearing an appeal against the Karnataka high court upholding the domicile quota but has refused to stay it. The provisional first list was released by the NLU consortium on its website. The allotment was made on the basis of merit-cum-preferences expressed by the candidates in their counselling form. The orientation for the new batch of the five-year integrated LLB programme began on Monday and will continue till Friday.

The incident came to light when the girl’s parents, daily-wage workers, returned home by evening. As she did not respond to calls, the father broke open the door to find her hanging from the ceiling in the bedroom. The girl had discontinued studies after failing in class 10 exams, family members told police. According to a close family source, the girl was demanding a new dress for her birthday, which was on Monday. However, owing to financial crisis triggered by the lockdown, the parents turned down the teenager’s demand. “She also liked a distant relative of hers and wanted to marry him. But both the families were against the idea and she was upset about this too,” family members told police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/parents-say-no-to-new-dress-for-bday-girl-16-ends-life/articleshow/84986517.cms||---

Vauhxx Booker, a local civil rights activist and member of the Monroe County Human Rights Commission, was charged with misdemeanour trespass and felony battery for his involvement in last year's Fourth of July incident at Lake Monroe, according to court documents filed Friday by a special prosecutor in the case. Booker condemned the decision, calling it an "outrageous act of punitive retaliation and prosecutorial vindictiveness." "This incident has been a continual case of a victim being re-victimized by the system," Booker's legal team said in a statement Monday. "It is the victim in this assault - Vauhxx Booker - who is being made to pay for having stood his ground against malicious racist name-calling, physical assault, and threats against his life." The alleged assault gained national attention last summer when Booker said he called 911 after five men assaulted him and pinned him to a tree at the lake just south of Bloomington. He said the men accused him of trespassing on private property and, after he tried to apologize, the situation got physical. Booker said the men threatened to break his arms and said, "get a noose," while telling his friends to leave the area. He said one of the men wore a hat decorated with a Confederate flag and that the men made statements about "white power." Witnesses who were with Booker that day said they heard racial slurs being shouted and that someone said "get a noose" and "leave the boy here, we will take care of him." Cellphone video posted on Facebook that showed part of the altercation was viewed millions of times online. The FBI said it was investigating the incident as a possible hate crime, although no further updates have been provided about the investigation. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources, which responded to the reported assault, recommended charges against everyone involved. Monroe County prosecutors only charged two white men, however. Sean Purdy faces charges of felony criminal confinement, battery resulting in moderate bodily injury and intimidation. Jerry Cox II was charged with felony criminal confinement and battery resulting in moderate bodily injury, as well as two misdemeanours. Cox and Purdy claimed Booker was trespassing and denied the allegations regarding a noose. Both maintain that Booker threatened them first, and their lawyers have said the two men are victims of a "smear campaign." The case against Cox and Purdy is still pending, awaiting a trial date. Monroe County Prosecutor Erika Oliphant recused herself from the case in response to public concern about whether she was impartial. The charges against Booker, filed in Monroe Circuit Court by special prosecutor Sonia Leerkamp, are the same recommended by IDNR investigators last summer. An initial hearing is set for Sept. 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/black-man-assaulted-at-indiana-lake-faces-criminal-charges/articleshow/84986577.cms||---

Presenting his plan to challenge the Taliban assault before a joint session of parliament, he blamed the abrupt US exit from Afghanistan for the worsening security in the country. "The reason for our current situation is that the decision was taken abruptly," he told parliament, adding he had warned Washington the withdrawal would have "consequences". "The protection of the people is our duty and we will maintain it at any cost," he added. "We have a security plan, a six-month security plan, to change the situation on the battleground and to stabilise the security situation. The security forces are capable enough to stabilise the situation," Ghani said in his speech. The president, however, did not give details about the plan. Ghani said an "imported" and "hasty" process was imposed on Afghanistan, which resulted in legitimising an insurgent group instead of achieving peace. "We have paid a high price for peace and showed great gentleness, but instead war was imposed on us," President Ghani said, indirectly referring to the release of the 5,000 Taliban prisoners by his government earlier as part of a peace process. He said the Taliban are "not committed to any values". The president urged lawmakers and political leaders to seek unity, saying it was the only way towards "our" victory. Responding to the president’s security plan, the Taliban released a statement calling Ghani’s statements "nonsense" and saying "his time is over". "He was trying to control his own bad state and mistakes," the statement said. "The nation has decided to prosecute national traitors and bring them to justice. Declarations of war, making accusations and providing false information cannot prolong Ghani’s life," it stated, adding, "His time is over, God willing." After President Ghani’s address, both Houses of parliament released a joint statement expressing their full support for his security plan. In the statement, lawmakers declared their "firm" support to the republic, human rights, women’s rights and freedom of speech. The legislators also said they stand with the Afghan National Security Forces, "who sacrifice their lives for the nation". Fighting has intensified since May in Afghanistan and the Taliban, after making rapid territorial gains in the country’s sparsely populated rural areas, has been mounting pressure on some of the major cities. In recent weeks, the militants had captured key border crossings with neighbouring countries, which increased pressure on the provincial capitals. Currently, the militants are involved in a turf war with Afghan forces in the cities of Herat and Lashkar Gah while engaged in fierce fighting on the outskirts of Kandahar and parts of Nangarhar province.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/ghani-says-he-has-security-plan-blames-us-withdrawal-for-worsening-security/articleshow/84986603.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Between 11pm and 11.40pm, the flying objects were spotted hovering over military establishments twice at Bari Brahmana, once at Smailpur-Bishnah road and Birpur areas falling under the jurisdiction of Bari Brahamna police station in Samba district. Instead of opening fire, however, the Army troops kept watch and quick response teams of the Army launched search operations in the area, but the flying objects disappeared, said sources. A similar suspected drone activity was noticed in the same area on Saturday as well. On July 30, Jammu police had launched a search operation after a suspected drone was spotted near the bordering village in Akhnoor area. Apart from the suspected drone activity in Akhnoor, a drone was also spotted thrice at different locations in bordering Samba district on Thursday night. On July 24, Jammu police shot down one hexacopter fitted with a 5kg improvised explosive device near the Kanhachak-Akhnoor area. There has been a considerable spurt in drone activities in the Jammu area, especially after the bombing of Indian Air Force station in Jammu on June 27 in which two personnel were injured and a building partially damaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/drones-spotted-in-jks-samba/articleshow/84986662.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

According to traffic police officials, heavy showers caused landslides at different spots in Poshana area, forcing the closure of the road — which connects south Kashmir’s Shopian with Jammu’s Poonch and Rajouri districts — for vehicular traffic. The administration has pressed men and machinery into service to restore traffic on the road, which serves as an alternative to the Srinagar-Jammu highway, the main lifeline of Kashmir valley. DSP traffic Aftab Hussain Shah said, “Routine traffic will only be restored after receiving a green signal from district officials and traffic police personnel posted at different places.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/landslides-disrupt-traffic-on-jks-mughal-road/articleshow/84986711.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Later, a massive search operation was launched in the city to locate and identify the duo. “Two men in combat dress were seen at a barber shop in the railway station where some Army personnel were already sitting. Seeing them in uniform, the Armymen got suspicious and asked them to show their ID cards. Sensing trouble, they pushed the Army personnel and managed to flee from the spot,” a police officer said. Following the episode, the Army and police launched a search operation and all video footage from cameras installed at the railway station was being scrutinized to ascertain the suspects’ identity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/two-men-in-military-combat-uniform-flee-on-seeing-armymen/articleshow/84986819.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website showed that 60.6 percent of adults, and 49.7 percent of the total population, have now been fully vaccinated. The Biden administration initially targeted the country's Independence Day to hit the goal and declare victory over the worst of the pandemic. But falling vaccination rates, particularly in politically conservative regions in the South and Midwest, and among groups like younger people, those with lower income and racial minorities, meant the objective was missed. Recent weeks however have seen an uptick in the vaccination rate in the regions hit hardest by the latest Covid wave, which is being driven by the hyper-contagious Delta variant. States such as Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, and Florida have all seen significant increases. The national average of daily cases is currently higher than 60,000 and rising rapidly. However, with 80 percent of seniors fully vaccinated, hospitalizations and deaths are rising far slower than in previous waves. While one dose of an mRNA vaccine by Pfizer or Moderna conferred strong protection against previously dominant variants, new peer-reviewed research highlights the need for two doses against the Delta variant. Federal health authorities are also debating whether a third dose may be required for certain groups such as the immunocompromised. The CDC has also reinstituted guidance for fully vaccinated people to wear masks indoors in high-risk areas, after a preliminary analysis suggested that people who have breakthrough cases of the Delta variant might be able to transmit the virus onward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-hits-bidens-covid-vaccination-goal-almost-a-month-late/articleshow/84987078.cms||---

Till this March end, the cumulative borrowing stood at approximately Rs 3.1 lakh crore compared to Rs 74,742 crore in March 2017. In a written reply to a question from BJP lawmaker Sushil Kumat Modi, Union highways minister Nitin Gadkari said the NHAI has availed external borrowing to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore and only in 2020-21, the highways authority paid Rs 18,840 crore as interest. On the mechanism being adopted for servicing the debt, the minister said, “The NHAI creates valuable road assets which are financially viable. Since 2017, NHAI has constructed a total 17,042 km of public funded roads, with an expenditure of about Rs 4.08 lakh crore. The completed public funded road assets are being tolled. The NHAI is also monetizing the assets through ToT/ InVIT modes, to generate revenue for repayment of the loans and further construction. Since 2017, NHAI has serviced its debt amounting to Rs 74,337 crore. The NHAI is doing regular exercises for balancing its assets and liabilities ensuring a sustainable debt level. The minister also said there are 140 arbitration cases pending before various arbitral tribunals with Rs 91,875 crore claims from contractors and Rs 44,600 crore counter claims from the NHAI. Another 240 cases are in courts with claims of Rs 21,600 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nhais-borrowing-increased-4-fold-in-5-years/articleshow/84987414.cms||Dipak K Dash

Both are the latest in a series of measures taken by both sides that have strained US-Russia relations. In an interview with the National Interest magazine, ambassador Anatoly Antonov said that the embassy received a list of 24 Russian diplomats that are expected to leave the US by Sept. 3. “Almost all of them will leave without replacements because Washington has abruptly tightened visa issuing procedures,” Antonov said. The Russian ambassador said the situation with the embassies in both countries hasn’t changed for the better since the June summit in Geneva between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden. It was after that summit that Antonov and his US counterpart John Sullivan returned to their posts after being recalled for consultations. “Russian diplomatic missions in the United States are still forced to work under unprecedented restrictions that not only remain in effect, but are stepped up,” Antonov said. “The expulsions of diplomats are implemented under far-fetched pretexts now and then. Last December the State Department unilaterally established a three-year limit on the assignment period for Russian personnel in the United States that, as far as we know, is not applied to any other country,” he said. Antonov’s interview comes several days after the State Department announced laying off 182 locally employed staffers at the US facilities in Russia to comply with a ban on local hires the Kremlin imposed earlier this year in response to US expulsions of Russian diplomats and tit-for-tat closures of numerous diplomatic facilities in each country. The expulsions occurred in the context of US sanctions imposed over Russian interference in the 2020 US presidential election, the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, the arrest of opposition figure Alexei Navalny and crackdown on his supporters, as well as involvement in the SolarWind hack of US federal agencies. All are activities that Russia has denied. After the announcement of the ban, the US Embassy in Russia suspended routine consular services and since May has been processing immigrant visas only in the case of life-or-death emergencies. The suspension of consular services has also left Russian businessmen, exchange students and romantic partners adrift because they are no longer able to obtain US visas in Russia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ambassador-us-orders-24-russian-diplomats-out-by-september-3/articleshow/84988023.cms||---

Mass evictions could potentially worsen the recent spread of the Covid-19 delta variant as roughly 1.4 million households told the Census Bureau they could “very likely” be evicted from their rentals in the next two months. But the Biden administration said it is unable to take action, though it noted that state-level efforts to stop evictions would spare a third of the country from evictions over the next month. “Our team is redoubling efforts to identify all available legal authorities to provide necessary protections,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a Monday statement. The Biden administration also emphasized in the statement that $46.5 billion has been provided to keep renters in their homes, but “too many states and cities have been too slow to act.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday it’s “unfathomable” that Americans will be ousted from their homes during the Covid-19 crisis, and backed by the Congressional Black Caucus intensified pressure on the Biden administration to immediately extend the nation’s eviction moratorium. An estimated 3.6 million Americans are at risk of eviction during a Covid-19 surge, some as soon as Monday, after the eviction ban expired over the weekend. Pelosi and the Democratic leadership has called it a “moral imperative” to reinstate the eviction ban until some $47 billion in already approved housing aid can be distributed to renters and landlords owed back pay. They called on President Joe Biden’s administration to extend the moratorium through Oct. 18. “We all agree that the eviction crisis is an enormous challenge to the conscience of our country,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues. “It is unfathomable that we would not act to prevent people from being evicted.” Pelosi said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen would hold a virtual briefing Tuesday with lawmakers as they push to more quickly ensure the states distribute the federal aid. Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio., the chairwoman of the influential Congressional Black Caucus, said the group has been in talks with the White House. “Thousands of Black families and children could lose the roof over their heads at a time when the deadly pandemic is surging once again,” she said in a statement. The CDC put the ban in place as part of the Covid-19 response when jobs shifted and many workers lost income. The ban was intended to hold back the spread of the virus among people put out on the streets and into shelters. Late last week, Biden announced he was allowing the ban to expire, rather than challenge the Supreme Court which signaled it would not allow the moratorium to be extended unless Congress stepped in with legislation. Democratic lawmakers said they were caught by surprise by Biden’s decision on Thursday, days before the moratorium was set to expire, creating frustration and anger and exposing a rare rift with the administration. Congress was unable to pass legislation swiftly to extend the ban, which expired at midnight Saturday, and the House Democratic leaders have said it was now up to Biden’s administration to act. Progressive lawmakers, led by Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., and including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been protesting at the Capitol. The St. Louis-area congresswoman has camped at the building overnight for the past several days. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said that Democrats had to “call a spade a spade” and pointed to her own party. “We cannot in good faith blame the Republican Party when House Democrats have a majority,” the progressive congresswoman said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” The White House, which has urged localities and states to tap aid already approved by Congress, had no direct response to the Democrats’ call for action. The administration and its allies in Congress have focused on the slow pace of pandemic relief already approved by Congress, nearly $47 billion in federal housing aid to the states that has not made it to to renters and landlords owed payments. Biden has called on local governments to “take all possible steps” to disburse the funds immediately. Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council, appeared on “Fox News Sunday” to echo that sentiment. “No landlord should evict without seeking that rental assistance, and states and localities need to get that money out urgently, and they can do that,” Deese said. Landlords also have argued for speeding up the distribution of rental assistance and opposed another extension of the moratorium. As the deadline approached Saturday night, Pelosi urged House Democrats to check into how the money already allocated had been distributed so far in their own states and localities. The White House has maintained that Biden wanted to extend the moratorium but that concerns remained over challenging the court. Doing so could lead to a ruling restricting the administration’s ability to respond to future public health crises. When the Supreme Court voted 5-4 in late June to allow the broad eviction ban to continue through the end of July, one of those in the majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, made clear he would block any additional extensions unless there was “clear and specific congressional authorization.” While racing to respond to Biden’s announcement Thursday that congressional action was needed, Democrats strained to draft a bill and rally the votes. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the chair of the Financial Services Committee, produced a draft of a bill that would require the CDC to continue the ban through Dec. 31. At a hastily arranged hearing Friday morning to consider the bill, she urged her colleagues to act. In the end, Democratic lawmakers had questions and concerns and could not muster support to extend the ban.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/cdc-cant-stop-evictions-as-biden-calls-on-states-to-act/articleshow/84988197.cms||---

That blue-checked Twitter account for the famous, and famously media-shy author is fake.  "The account referenced was verified by mistake and that has since been reversed," a Twitter spokesperson told The Associated Press on Monday. "The account will also be required to adhere to Twitter's parody, newsfeed, commentary, and fan account policy."  The McCarthy account, @CormacMcCrthy, had more than 48,000 followers as of midday Monday, among them Stephen King. It was established in September 2018 but was only recently given a blue check for verification. Another McCarthy parody account from 2012 managed to fool Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who tweeted at the time "We have the best authors in the world right here."  McCarthy, 88, rarely speaks to the press and has no known presence on social media. His novels include "All the Pretty Horses," "No Country for Old Men" and the Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Road." Some of the tweets on the current parody account make light of his unfamiliarity with technology.  "My publicist is on my case about my infrequent use of this infernal website," reads a tweet from last week. "He says engagement is down and so are metrics and something who cares."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/a-road-not-taken-verified-cormac-mccarthy-account-is-fake/articleshow/84988383.cms||---

Citing the security sources, Tolo News reported that the blast targeted a bus carrying civilians, and women are among the victims. "Three civilians were killed and 10 more were wounded in an explosion in the city of Herat this evening, health officials said. According to security sources, the blast targeted a bus carrying civilians, and women are among the victims," Tolo News tweeted. So far, no group or individual has claimed responsibility for the blast. Meanwhile, clashes entered the sixth day in the city of Herat on Monday. Herat is the second provincial capital city along with Lashkargah where heavy clashes have been underway for the past few days. "We have air support and the Taliban's gatherings have been targeted in various parts of Herat city where they have sustained heavy casualties," Tolo News quoted Herat governor general Abdul Saboor Qani as saying. Over the last few weeks, they captured several districts in Afghanistan including Takhar, the country's northeastern province. The Taliban seized over 193 district centres and 19 border districts, according to the Afghan foreign ministry. The Taliban have also taken control of 10 border crossing points across the country in Takhar, Kunduz, Badakhshan, Herat and Farah provinces leading to the complete shutdown of cross border movements and trade in these areas. Earlier, the ministry disclosed that since April 14, nearly 4,000 ANDSF personnel had been killed, over 7,000 injured and about 1,600 captured by the Taliban. As many as 2,000 civilians, including women and children, were killed in the violence, while 2,200 were injured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/3-civilians-killed-10-wounded-in-explosion-in-afghanistans-herat/articleshow/84988187.cms||---

Their bodies were buried in a forest area at Puttur in Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor district. The killers looted at least 150 sovereigns of gold jewellery worth around 54 lakh and 50 lakh in cash from the safe in the house, an officer said. Police identified the deceased as Sanjeevi Reddy, who runs a private chit fund in Tiruttani, and Mala, and said Reddy’s nephew Ranjith Kumar, 28, and his friend Vimalraj were picked up in Puthur and charged with the murder of the elderly couple. They will be sent to jail soon. The issue came to light after Reddy’s granddaughter Lochi of Chittoor, who spoke to him following her mother Jothi Shree’s death on July 28, couldn’t reach him the next day. His mobile kept ringing and was later turned off. Lochi called another grandfather Balu, a resident of Pattabiramapuram village near Tiruttani, and requested him to visit Sanjeevi Reddy’s house. As the door was locked from outside, Balu and a few villagers broke open the door and found the safe and cupboard tampered with. The gold and cash in the safe were missing. They lodged a complaint with the Tiruttani police. Investigators checked the mobile tower location of Reddy’s phone and found it had been turned off near Mandala Samuthiram forest area in Puthur. One team went to the forest area, while another checked Reddy’s call details and found that Ranjith Kumar, son of Reddy’s sister, had made a few calls before the older man and his wife went missing. Police questioned Ranjith Kumar, a resident of Tiruttani who runs a sweet stall near his house. After first denying his involvement, he later confessed to bludgeoning his uncle and aunt to death to steal their cash and gold. Ranjith Kumar and Vimalraj were taken to Puthur where they identified the place where they buried the bodies. The bodies were sent to the government hospital in Tirupati for autopsy. The two accused will be brought to Tiruttani to recover the missing valuables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/elderly-couple-murdered-buried-in-forest/articleshow/84988517.cms||---

A senior PWD official said the lack of a treatment plant at the Poondi reservoir led to loss due to evaporation at the rate of 31 cubic feet per second (cusecs) and water was sent to the reservoirs at Red Hills and Chembarambakkam. Currently, the official said, some repair work was in progress in the canal carrying water from Poondi to Red Hills and the release is likely to begin before Friday. Initially, the rate of release will be about 250 cusecs. At present, water from the Kandaleru reservoir over the Krishna river in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh is being released at the rate of 800 cusecs into the Poondi reservoir. This quantity is expected to go up in the coming days and hence, it has been decided to release the water to Red Hills, the official said. Within the next fortnight, release from the Krishna river is expected to touch two thousand million cubic feet (tmcft). Already, Tamil Nadu has realised 1.8tmcft since the beginning of the water year, which extends from July 2021 to June 2022, said the official. As on Monday, the combined storage level in the five reservoirs supplying Chennai stood at 8,032mcft (million cubic feet), or 68% of the capacity of 11,757mcft. Poondi reservoir had a storage level of 1,922mcft against its capacity of 3,231mcft; Cholavaram 621mcft against a capacity of 1,081mcft; Red Hills a level of 2,759mcft against its capacity of 3,300mcft; Kannankottai Thervoykandigai 449mcft against its capacity of 500mcft and Chembarambakkam reservoir had 2,461mcft against its capacity of 3,645mcft. Veeranam lake in Cuddalore district, from where Metrowater also draws supply, is slowly filling. Now, it has 131mcft against a capacity of 1,465mcft. Once the Mettur reservoir in Salem district touches 100ft level, water will be released into the Veeranam lake, said the official, adding that the city’s requirement is 1tmcft of water per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pwd-to-release-water-from-poondi-to-red-hills-soon/articleshow/84988524.cms||P Oppili

Then, he had said that seeking their blessings matters to him the most. His mother Gangamma Somappa Bommai passed away in 2002. Bommai has a special respect for his late mother, in whose memory he has published six books through a trust since 2006. Four more are in the pipeline. Mallikarjun Bommai aka Mahesh Bommai, younger brother of the CM and the vice-president of Smt Gangamma Somappa Bommai Trust, told TOI that they have been helping thousands of poor children with textbooks, notebooks and learning materials. “We organise programmes on January 26, the birth anniversary of our mother, at Hubballi, Savanur and Shiggaon. We also encourage young writers and honour senior writers by presenting them awards and publishing their books since 2006,” he said. Chandrashekhar Vastrad, who edits the books, said that they had decided to publish 10 books themed on ‘avva’ (mother). “These books could be of any genre — poetry, stories, autobiographies, novels or the commoners’ experiences. The first book on mother, a compilation of poems by contemporary poets, was published in 2006. The very next year, we had the second book which was a collection of stories about mother by different Kannada story writers,” he said. The next set of works pertain to mother in autobiographies of great personalities. “We have compiled stories of Russian writer Maxim Gorky, Italian littérateur Gracial Garda, Hindi writer Mahashwetadevi, Marathi writers Saneguruji, Pramod Karnad an Kannada writers AaNaKru, Niranjana among others. Themes like folklore, mother in ancient Kannada works, and mother in plays were also covered in the subsequent works,” he explained. “Though the trust holds programmes annually, publishing of books needs time as it calls for research. Also, the trust has instituted Akka Award for women writers, Janapada Siri Award for folklore talents and Aralu Moggu Award for budding writers,” he added. Veteran scholar Veeranna Rajur said Bommai’s affection and respect towards his mother is extended to all mothers of the world. “While participating in the trust’s programmes, we have observed that Bommai is a good reader, thinker and a literature enthusiast,” he said. B L Santhosh, national general secretary (organisation), had once tweeted about Bommai’s passion to publish books as a tribute to mothers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/cm-bommai-has-published-six-books-in-memory-of-his-mother/articleshow/84981632.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||India||Covid tests per million population: Kerala tops, Rajasthan at bottom||NEW DELHI: With the recent uptick in Covid cases, the focus is again on whether states are testing enough to detect cases well in time. Data shows that Kerala, which is in the news for reporting the highest number of cases, is also the leader in testing rates among larger states with a seven-day average of 4,587 tests per million. At the other end of the spectrum, Rajasthan is at just 378 tests per million and West Bengal, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat all below 1,000 per million. The average was less than 3,000 tests per million for most relatively large states. Assam and Delhi were among the exceptions at 3,563 and 3,336, respectively. Among smaller states (with a population less than a crore), Mizoram reported the highest seven-day average testing rate on August 1 at 4,916 per million, slightly higher than Kerala. Read AlsoDelhi, 12 other states see a rise in weekly Covid casesIt is not just Kerala and its neighbouring states where Covid-19 infections have been rising over the past few days. As many as 13 states recorded an increase in cases last week, apart from Tamil Nadu which saw no change, although absolute numbers remained low at most places.The data also shows that current testing rates in most states are well below the highest levels they have achieved in the past, though in some like Kerala they are at their highest or close to it. Although testing has declined from the peak rate achieved typically during the first week of June, most states are conducting more tests now than in the pre-second wave period early this year. In 14 large states, the current average was less than 2,000 tests per million, meaning their rate was less than half of what Kerala and Jammu & Kashmir are doing. Other than the five states with below 1,000 tests per million, the rate is just 1,196 for Bihar and 1,052 for Uttar Pradesh. Among smaller states, the testing rate averaged between 2,000 to 3,000 for Goa, Sikkim and Tripura while for Manipur and Meghalaya it was between 1,500 and 2,000 tests per million. Nagaland was the only state on the list where this average was less than a thousand tests per million. Smaller UTs are excluded from this comparison as tiny populations mean even a minor increase in testing can inflate the rate. Past data also reveals that many states did not cross the 2,000 tests per million mark even during the peak of the second wave. For instance, the highest daily testing rate achieved by Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan in 2021 was always less than 2,000 tests per million.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-tests-per-million-population-kerala-tops-rajasthan-at-bottom/articleshow/84988785.cms||Atul Thakur

The decision is taken based on the clinical studies, the strict assessment to approve the emergency use of this vaccine and the local evaluation that complies with the approved regulations, Gulf News reported. This decision will help UAE to further ramp up its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. "Research so far has shown that Covid-19 vaccines are remarkably effective and safe. In addition, children have been safely receiving vaccines for multiple diseases and viruses for generations. The Sinopharm vaccine is similar in concept to all of these vaccines," Dr Ahmed Alsuwaidi, Associate Professor of Paediatrics and Infectious Diseases, at the United Arab Emirates University said during the launch of Sinopharm. Meanwhile, more than 64 per cent of the UAE population have been vaccinated, the country has administered more than 15.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Earlier, the Sputnik V was also registered in UAE in January 2021 under the emergency use authorisation procedure. The Russian Direct Investment Fund also announced that the efficacy of Sputnik V in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was confirmed at 97.8 per cent among over 81,000 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/covid-19-uae-stamps-on-use-of-sinopharm-vaccine-among-3-17-year-age-group/articleshow/84988826.cms||---
---||India||Preventive detention can’t be invoked over law & order fears, says Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: In an important decision, the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the provision for preventive detention cannot be invoked over apprehension of law and order problems and said a person can be detained only in cases where public order is directly affected. Differentiating between the two, the apex court said that "law and order" comprehends disorders of less gravity than those affecting "public order", which affects the larger public, leading to harm, danger or alarm or feeling of insecurity. "There can be no doubt that for ‘public order’ to be disturbed, there must in turn be public disorder. Mere contravention of law such as indulging in cheating or criminal breach of trust certainly affects ‘law and order’ but before it can be said to affect ‘public order’, it must affect the community or the public at large," a bench of Justices R F Nariman and Hrishikesh Roy said. The court quashed an order passed by the Telangana government to detain an alleged habitual fraudster on the ground that he was likely to cheat more members of the public if allowed to move freely. Justifying the action, the government contended that multiple FIRs were filed against the person and he was detained as he got anticipatory bail in all criminal cases. It pleaded the bench to give a liberal interpretation of "public order" to allow preventive detention but the court turned down the plea, "Further, preventive detention must fall within the four corners of Article 21 (protection of life and liberty) read with Article 22 and the statute in question. To therefore argue that a liberal meaning must be given to the expression ‘public order’ in the context of a preventive detention statute is wholly inapposite and incorrect." "On the contrary, considering that preventive detention is a necessary evil only to prevent public disorder, the court must ensure that the facts brought before it directly and inevitably lead to harm, danger or alarm or feeling of insecurity among the general public or any section thereof at large," the bench said. The court passed the order on a plea filed by the wife of the accused challenging his detention order. Allowing her plea, the bench said, "While it cannot seriously be disputed that the detenu may be a white-collar offender... yet a preventive detention order can only be passed if his activities adversely affect or are likely to adversely affect the maintenance of public order." Advocate Gaurav Agarwal, appearing for the petitioner, contended that the order was perverse as it was passed only because anticipatory bail was granted to the accused. The correct course of action would have been for the state to move to cancel the bail, he said. Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the state, said the detenu had created fear among the gullible public, and since he was likely to commit similar offences in future, it was important to preventively detain him, as the ordinary law had no deterrent effect on him. The bench, however, rejected the plea of the state and said, "If a person is granted anticipatory bail/bail wrongly, there are well-known remedies in the ordinary law to take care of the situation." The court said the state can always appeal against the bail order granted and apply for cancellation. It ruled that the reasons for detention cannot be successful obtaining of anticipatory bail orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/preventive-detention-cant-be-invoked-over-law-order-fears-says-supreme-court/articleshow/84989028.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||Supreme Court ropes in HCs to nix cases under 66A||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to involve the high courts to facilitate a quick burial for hundreds of cases lodged by state police under Section 66A of the Information Technology Act even though the provision was annulled by the apex court more than six years ago to protect freedom of speech in social media. A bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai agreed with senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, counsel for petitioner NGO People's Union for Civil Liberties, that the high courts and the district judges should be involved in the process for closure of cases under Section 66A pending before the trial courts. The bench issued notices to the registrars general of the high courts for this purpose to explore a mechanism by which the judiciary can oversee the process of implementing the SC's landmark Shreya Singhal judgment delivered on March 24, 2015 striking down Section 66A as unconstitutional. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that the Centre has repeatedly written to the chief secretaries of the states about the nullity of Section 66A after the SC's 2015 judgment and that they must implement it in letter and spirit. The bench agreed and said, "the states and Union Territories must be impleaded in this case as parties so as to enable us to pass a comprehensive order. Ultimately, police and law and order is squarely within the domain of the states." The bench issued notices to all states and UTs and sought their response in four weeks. It was Justice Nariman who on July 5 had termed the action of state police authorities to continue slapping cases under Section 66A, despite it being struck down, against citizens for social media posts as "terrible, shocking and unacceptable". However, after four weeks the matter would be taken up by another bench as Justice Nariman will retire on August 12. The Centre in its affidavit put the onus on states and UTs for the implementation of the 2015 SC judgment and said it has repeatedly advised them to drop all cases under the defunct provision. PUCL had pointed out that states have registered thousands of cases post-judgment. "The Section (66A) has become null and void with effect from the date of the judgment," the Centre had said and informed the court that between February and May 2019, as many as 21 states and Union territories have responded to the Centre intimating that police have been directed not to register cases under Section 66A and that no prosecution has been undertaken by the state under this provision after March 24, 2015. PUCL said Maharashtra had registered 349 cases prior to the judgment, and post-judgment, went on to register 381 more. The Centre said the Maharashtra government on February 21, 2019 had informed that it has "complied with the Supreme Court judgment and that no prosecution has been initiated post March 24, 2015." PUCL had also claimed that Uttar Pradesh had registered just 22 cases before 2015, but its police went on to file 245 more cases after the judgment. It had said that Jharkhand had just 43 FIRs prior to the order, but went on to register 291 FIRs after the verdict. The Centre's affidavit does not mention any response from the UP or Jharkhand governments. PUCL had accused Rajasthan of having only 75 cases, but going on to register 192 more FIRs post-judgment. The Centre said the Rajasthan government on February 22, 2019 had responded saying it had issued appropriate directions to police and complied with the judgment. In its rejoinder to the Centre's bald affidavit, the PUCL sought a series of directions for the implementation of the SC's judgment in letter and spirit by the states and highlighted the proactive role the Centre should play in protecting citizens from getting booked under the defunct provision for posting messages in social media. PUCL said the state governments must be directed to collect and collate all information about cases lodged and pending under 66A and order their immediate dropping/withdrawal. This could be achieved by a direction to the DGPs to take the necessary steps and to the HCs to issue suitable advisories to the district judges for closure of cases in the courts within their jurisdictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-ropes-in-hcs-to-nix-cases-under-66a/articleshow/84989277.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Osagie Ehanire said the vaccines, which arrived on Sunday, are undergoing validation by the country's drug regulator. He said the doses will be distributed to the local states once they are certified fit for use. The US government last week shipped nearly 10 million doses to two of the most populous African countries - Nigeria and South Africa. "Vaccination in Nigeria should soon begin with the arrival ... of Moderna vaccines, thanks to the United States government," Ehanire told a coronavirus briefing in Abuja. He said Nigeria would receive over 40 million doses by the end of the year, without providing details. The primary healthcare agency said last month that Nigeria had exhausted an initial supply of nearly 4 million shots and expects to receive nearly 8 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of August, including the US government donation. Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has seen a rise in coronavirus cases since mid July. Some 174,315 cases and 2,149 deaths have been recorded since the pandemic began in early 2020, official data shows. It recently detected the highly contagious Delta variant, with the health minister warning that the country was going through a third wave of the infection. Resident doctors in Nigerian public hospitals began an indefinite strike on Monday over grievances that include the delayed payment of salaries and allowances, the doctors' union said, as coronavirus infections rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/nigeria-receives-4-million-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-from-us-government/articleshow/84989036.cms||---

Azad, while talking to media on Monday night, was referring to the restoration of statehood and holding elections after delimitation in Jammu and Kashmir as assured by the prime minister and the home minister to J&K leaders in the meeting last month. Batting strongly for holding assembly elections, he said for the past four years, there is “no representative” in J&K, which is the biggest cause of under development in the union territory. "It will be our request to the Central government that assurances given by Prime Minister and Home Minister to the all-party meeting should be implemented in short-term rather than long-term, or medium-term, as it will benefit the people," Azad said. He said the governor's rule is not enough for ensuring progress in J&K. "Governor's rule alone is not enough to make progress in Jammu and Kashmir. It is very important to have an assembly too. We have got feedback from the people as well," the Congress leader said. He said that it is very important for everyone including political parties to participate in the elections in J-K at this stage now because if anyone refuses to contest the election, “we will be in trouble again which I don't want at all”. He said people will take part in the polls in a “good number if J&K is given the status of a state first”. Azad, while replying to a question about the Pegasus row, said he was not bothered about it. Replying to another question about a new order of government in J&K related to security clearance for people to get passports or jobs, Azad said that in Kashmir stone-pelters used to be locked up in jails even before this order. "This is nothing new and everyone knows that anyone who speaks against the country has to stay in jail and it doesn't require any verification,” he added. Azad downplayed the differences in the party in J&K.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/azad-urges-centre-to-implement-its-assurance-to-jk-leaders-on-statehood-in-short-term/articleshow/84989353.cms||---

At Powell and Market, one of the cable car's stops, a line of people snaked around waiting to ride a car to Ghirardelli Square or Fisherman's Wharf. "Our cable cars are part of what makes San Francisco a world-class destination, and their return is just the latest sign that our city is bouncing back," said San Francisco Mayor London Breed. Breed said it will be free to ride the cable cars in August and asked people to be patient because the service won't follow a regular schedule until September when the historic trolleys will resume full service in all three lines and start charging a riding fee. Frank Miller, of San Antonio, said he and six members of his family arrived in San Francisco last week and have already visited some of the city's top landmarks. They rode a ferry to Angel Island and visited Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf but Miller said riding the cable cars was a highlight for him. "I grew up watching 'Full House' so, everybody knows the cable cars. We definitely want to ride the trolley cars through the city,'' said Miller, 40, who was waiting with his family to ride from Powell Street and Market to Fisherman's Wharf. Before the pandemic, 25 million tourists visited San Francisco annually, with many of them riding the cable cars that are as synonymous with the city as Alcatraz Island and the Golden Gate Bridge. About 17,000 riders a day packed onto the cable cars daily before they were parked in March 2020 as the city locked down and sheltered in place. It was the longest shutdown since the 1980s, when the system was fully reconstructed, according to the San Francisco Metropolitan Transportation Agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/san-franciscos-iconic-cable-cars-are-running-again/articleshow/84989450.cms||---

The forecast is almost in sync, barring aberrations in northwest India including Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, with what was predicted first in mid-April and later on June 1 about the summer (southwest) monsoon. The prediction will be reassuring as it holds the promise of growth in the rural economy at a time when several sectors have been hit by Covid. The "normal" rainfall in August-September will help in accelerating kharif (summer sown) crop-sowing operations which remained depressed during mid-June to mid-July due to slow progress of monsoon towards northwest India and the overall "break" phase of seasonal rainfall from June 21 for nearly three weeks. Though the overall sown area has already crossed the threshold of "normal" acreage, the pace of sowing operations is now expected to bridge the gap compared to 2020 in coming days. "As the changes in the sea surface temperature conditions over the Pacific and the Indian Ocean are known to influence the Indian monsoon, we are carefully monitoring the evolution of sea surface conditions over these ocean basins," said M Mohapatra, director general of IMD. The weather forecasting agency said the overall rainfall during the next two months is most likely to be 95 to 105% of the long period average (LPA). The LPA of August to September rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1961-2010 is 428.3 mm. As far as the monthly forecast is concerned, the Met department said rainfall in August is most likely to be normal at 94 to 106% of the LPA. The spatial distribution of probabilistic forecasts for the tercile categories (above normal, normal and below normal) for August-September suggests "below normal to normal" rainfall over many parts of the northwest, east and northeast parts of the country. On the other hand, most parts of peninsular India and adjacent central India would experience "normal to above-normal rainfall" during the second half of the monsoon season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/monsoon-2nd-half-likely-to-be-normal-in-good-sign-for-economy/articleshow/84989396.cms||---

The couple filed for divorce on May 3 after 27 years of marriage, but pledged to continue their philanthropic work together. The Gateses said at the time that they had reached agreement on how to divide their marital assets. No details of that agreement were disclosed in the final divorce order filed on Monday in King County superior court in Seattle. The court did not issue money, property or spousal support judgments in the divorce. It said the couple must comply with the terms of the separation contract that was not filed in King County superior court. The Seattle-based Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has become one of the most powerful and influential forces in global public health, spending more than $50 billion over the past two decades to bring a business approach to combating poverty and disease. The Gateses have backed widely praised programs in malaria and polio eradication, child nutrition and vaccines. The foundation last year committed some $1.75 billion to Covid-19 relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/bill-gates-melinda-french-officially-divorced-court-document/articleshow/84989570.cms||---
---||India||‘Belong to both states’: CJI offers to recuse from Krishna case||NEW DELHI: At a time when rains have cooled tempers by putting Krishna river in spate, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana Monday suggested to both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to resolve the dispute over apportioning of its water through mediation and not spend time and energy over litigation. Heading a bench also comprising Justice Surya Kant, the CJI told AP counsel Dushyant Dave that both states willing, he would supervise the mediation process for equitable sharing of Krishna water among them. “But, if you want adjudication of legal issues raised by Andhra Pradesh in its writ petition, I will recuse and post the petition before another bench,” he said. “I belong to both the states. I can arrange for mediation and supervise it for a possible resolution of the Krishna water-sharing dispute,” the CJI said. Dave termed the CJI’s suggestion worth considering and said he would take instructions from the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government and get back. Appearing for Telangana, senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan said there is plenty of water and both states are enjoying a surplus at the present. “The problem is not felt during the rainy season. The problem arises when there is scarcity of water,” the CJI said and posted the matter for hearing on Wednesday. In its writ petition, Andhra Pradesh accused Telangana of depriving its people of their legitimate share of Krishna water for drinking and irrigation. It alleged that Telangana was deliberately not following decisions taken on river water management in the Apex Council constituted under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act of 2014, as also the directions of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) constituted under the 2014 Act and the directions of the central government. AP had also blamed the Centre for not notifying the exact jurisdiction of the KRMB. “This is resulting in illegal acts on the part of Telangana and its authorities, creating serious constitutional issues,” it said. However, a day after AP moved the SC, the Centre on July 16 notified the Godavari and the Krishna river management boards, giving them more teeth to administer, regulate, operate and maintain projects listed on these two rivers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh as per the mandate of the AP Reorganisation Act. Jagan Reddy government’s petition stated: “Fundamental rights, including right to life of its citizens, are being seriously impaired and infringed on account of unconstitutional, illegal and unjust acts on part of Telangana and its officials, resulting in the citizens of Andhra Pradesh being deprived of their legitimate share of water for drinking and irrigation purposes.” The bone of contention is the Telangana government’s June 28 order, which stated that “to tap more hydel generation in the state, the government has taken a decision to generate hydel power up to 100% installed capacity.” The order directed the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation Ltd (TSGENCO) to “generate hydel power up to 100% installed capacity in the state”. AP alleged that Telangana had issued the notification days after the Union ministry of Jal Shakti on June 17 communicated to the director (hydel) of TSGENCO, requesting the latter “to stop further release of water immediately through Srisailam Left Power House and follow the water release orders issued by the KRMB, except in case of extreme grid urgency.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/belong-to-both-states-cji-offers-to-recuse-from-krishna-case/articleshow/84989763.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Supreme Court rejects ‘marriage bail’ plea of rapist ex-priest & survivor||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday firmly rejected a joint plea by a rape survivor and the convict, defrocked Kerala Catholic priest Robin Vadakkumuchery, for grant of interim bail to him to allow them to get married and give legitimacy to the child born out of the priest’s sexual assault on the woman when she was a minor. Sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment by the Thalassery Pocso court in February 2019, in what is infamously known as the ‘Kottiyoor rape case’, a 52-year-old Vadakkumuchery through counsel Amit George argued before a bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari that he had a fundamental right to marry and the court cannot refuse him that right. The rape survivor, who was repeatedly sexually assaulted by the priest when she was just 16 years old and gave birth to a boy in February 2017, too requested the bench through senior advocate Kiran Suri that grant of interim bail to Vadakkumuchery would enable them to get married and give legitimacy to the child, who needs a name of his father for admission to school. Keeping in view the consistent ruling of the SC that the proposal to marry the rape survivor after getting convicted for rape warranted no leniency, the bench of Justices Saran and Maheshwari told Vadakkumuchery, who was expelled by Pope Francis in February last year from all priestly duties and rights, that the conviction still stands against him. “Whatever relief you want you must appeal to the Kerala High Court which is in session of your appeal against conviction,” the bench said. “As far as the present appeals are concerned, we will not entertain them,” the bench said, throwing out the orchestrated marriage plea from both the rape survivor and the rapist. The modus operandi and pressure tactics brought on by the former Catholic priest was evident from the fact that immediately after the minor girl gave birth to a child, the woman’s own father claimed that he had raped his daughter and impregnated her. Only later, he had broken down and confessed that the real father of the illegitimate child was Vadakkumuchery, which was established beyond doubt through a DNA test. In February this year, the Kerala HC had dismissed Vadakkumchery’s petition seeking bail to marry the rape survivor. After considering the 52-year-old’s contention that it was consensual sex and that he had renounced his priesthood to marry the survivor, Justice Sunil Thomas of the HC had said the trial court’s finding that the survivor was a minor at the time of the alleged rape is still in force. As Vadakkumuchery’s appeal against the conviction is pending before the HC, allowing the parties to get married while the trial court’s finding that the survivor was a minor remains, would mean granting judicial approval to the marriage, the HC had said. The SC on Monday said there was no ground for interfering with the well-reasoned order of the HC refusing bail. The HC had said, “The trial court has arrived at a finding that the victim was a child at the time of incident. As long as that finding remains, which itself is one of the crucial issues involved in the appeal, granting bail to enable the parties to get married and have custody of child will be giving legal sanctity to such marriage and thereby prejudging the crucial issue involved in the appeal. Allowing the prayer will amount to granting judicial approval to the marriage directly, indirectly or by implication. I feel that, in such circumstances, this Court should ‘remain absolutely away’ from such issues, as indicated in Supreme Court's 2015 judgment in Mandanlal’s case, so that appeal can be heard and decided on merits, untrammeled by any finding in his application.” In its July 1, 2015 judgment in Madanlal’s case, the SC had said, “We would like to clearly state that in a case of rape or attempt of rape, the conception of compromise under no circumstances can really be thought of. These are crimes against the body of a woman which is her own temple. These are offences which suffocate the breath of life and sully the reputation.” In April this year, the Kerala High Court had quashed criminal proceedings initiated against a man for having allegedly raped a 17-year-old girl. The HC’s decision came when the rape accused informed the court that he and the rape survivor have entered into marriage. The HC said, “In the light of the fact that they have entered into a matrimonial relationship, there is no purpose in continuing the proceedings. Even if the trial court is allowed to proceed with the trial, it is certain that material witnesses who are respondents 1 and 2 are not going to support the case. That means, it would be a futile exercise to continue the proceedings... For the well being of the couple also, it is only expedient to terminate the proceedings. The proceedings are quashed, no public interest is going to hamper.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-rejects-marriage-bail-plea-of-rapist-ex-priest-survivor/articleshow/84989946.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Australia, which was invited by India to join the Malabar exercise with the US and Japan in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea last November after a gap of 13 years, in turn, now also wants India to take part in its largest biennial wargames called `Talisman Sabre’ in 2023. This year’s Talisman Sabre concluded at Queensland on Sunday with the participation of over 17,000 personnel, 18 warships, 70 aircraft and 50 helicopters from seven nations – Australia, the US, Japan, the UK, Canada, South Korea and New Zealand. Indian officials say the flurry of military exercises by `like-minded countries’ in the Indo-Pacific, which included the Quad-plus-France La Pérouse’ exercise in the Bay of Bengal in April, reinforces the growing strategic congruence in ensuring “a free, open, secure and stable” Indo-Pacific against China’s expansionist behavior in the region. Incidentally, after conducting an exercise with India in the Bay of Bengal in late-July, the UK’s aircraft carrier strike group led by the new 65,000-tonne HMS Queen Elizabeth, with fifth-generation F-35B `lightning’ stealth fighter jets, also entered the contested South China Sea last week. An agitated China threatened to “expel” the aircraft carrier if it intruded on Chinese-claimed islands and reefs. India this week is also dispatching a naval taskforce, including guided-missile destroyer INS Ranvijay, stealth frigate INS Shivalik, anti-submarine corvette INS Kadmatt and guided-missile corvette INS Kora, on an over two-month operational deployment to South East Asia, the South China Sea and the Western Pacific in pursuit of its `Act East’ policy. The Indian flotilla will take part in the quadrilateral Malabar wargames as well as conduct bilateral exercises with Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia. “The deployment of Indian warships seeks to underscore the operational reach, peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly countries in the Indo-Pacific towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain and commitment towards freedom of navigation at sea,” said an officer. With the Quad countries declaring their firm intent to deter any “coercion” in the Indo-Pacific during a summit of their leaders on March 12, a multi-tier cooperation and coordination mechanism is now taking shape to advance security as well as counter threats in the region, as was earlier reported by TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/malabar-drill-in-august-to-send-out-quad-message-to-china/articleshow/84990193.cms||Rajat Pandit

This was stated in a study published recently in the journal BMJ Global. These findings call the global estimates of anaemia prevalence, which have been predominantly generated using capillary (or fingertip) measurements, into doubt, stated the study. This was earlier also flagged by Indian experts who had analysed data from the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) in 2019. In a paper based on the CNNS survey published in June 2021 in the medical journal, The Lancet, the authors had stated that “datasets, including those from India in field settings, indicate a higher haemoglobin estimate (up to 0·6–0·9 g/dL) in venous blood than in capillary samples.” The BMJ Global study done by a group of infectious diseases experts, maternal and child health specialists and haematologists from Australia, Bangladesh, Malawi and the US looked at the difference in measurement of haemoglobin concentration in blood drawn from the veins (venous) as opposed to that drawn from the capillaries in children and pregnant women. Accurate and precise measurement of haemoglobin concentration is critical for estimation of population level anaemia prevalence, which forms the basis for defining nutrition policy choices and monitoring programmes, noted the study. It added that population-based anaemia prevalence statistics derived from capillary haemoglobin concentrations may be inaccurate and lead to incorrect classifications of public health severity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/way-sample-collected-might-be-inflating-anaemia-figures/articleshow/84990303.cms||Rema Nagarajan

The blaze at National Salvage and Services Corp, which started Sunday evening and was still going Monday, didn't injure anyone, fire officials said. Authorities hoped that rain from passing storms would at least keep the flames contained. While no evacuations were needed and the fire didn't spread to other property, the company wasn't sure how much was lost. "We're gathering facts and trying to learn as much as we can,'' said Tim Rushenberg, a spokesman at company headquarters in Bloomington, Indiana. The company yard at Burnsville typically holds "thousands upon thousands'' of chemically treated railroad ties that are ground up and used for fuel, primarily in industrial boilers, Rushenberg said. An apparent lighting strike started the fire about 6 p.m. Sunday and neither rain nor the work of firefighters stopped it from growing, said Billy Barrett, chief of the Valley Grande volunteer fire department. "We put about 50,000 gallons of water on it and it didn't faze it,'' he said. Video and photos shared on social media by the Valley Grande volunteer fire department and others showed the fire growing from a small blob atop a giant pile of ties to a massive blaze that burned long past dark and turned the night sky orange. Forecasters said the smoke plume was so large it appeared on radar. Fire crews eventually had to move away and let the fire burn because the flames grew so large and hot, Barrett said. "With all that creosote and all, it's going to burn for awhile. It could burn for days, maybe a week,'' he said. The company is working with fire and environmental officials to determine what to do next, Rushenberg said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/huge-blaze-engulfs-railroad-tie-recycling-plant-in-alabama/articleshow/84990266.cms||---

As many as 13 states recorded an increase in cases last week, apart from Tamil Nadu which saw no change, although absolute numbers remained low at most places. The hill states of north India saw the maximum rise in fresh cases during the week ended Sunday (July 26-August 1) as compared with the previous seven days. Himachal Pradesh registered a surge of 64%, the highest in the country, with cases rising from 670 in the previous week to 1,100. Uttarakhand logged a 61% increase in infections, although numbers in the state were still quite low — 437 last week as compared with 272 in the preceding period. J&K logged a surge of 26%. Delhi, where weekly cases had dropped to this year’s lowest count of 381 in the week before last, saw a 15% rise in infections. The city recorded 440 fresh cases last week. Neighbouring Haryana too registered a minor rise of 2%. While in absolute numbers these spikes were largely marginal, what’s significant is that all these states had been registering a fall in infections till the week before last. In total numbers, Kerala’s weekly surge was by far the highest. The state logged nearly 1.4 lakh fresh cases, 20,000 more than the count in the previous week, translating to a 27% spurt in infections. Karnataka’s weekly total was 12,442, a 17% rise from 10,610 cases recorded in the previous week. Meanwhile, the surge in the northeast (minus Assam) slowed to 2%, from 16% in the previous week. Significantly, worst-hit Maharashtra recorded an 11% drop in infections, the steepest percentage fall in six weeks. The state recorded 45,272 new infections during the week, down from 50,732 in the previous seven days. Meanwhile, India recorded 29,853 fresh cases on Monday (with Delhi’s data yet to come in till midnight). The tally was lower than the number recorded last Monday (30,619) although Kerala’s cases remained relatively high at 13,984. Cases drop sharply every Monday due to lower testing and staff shortages over the weekend. There were 419 deaths reported during the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-12-other-states-see-a-rise-in-weekly-covid-cases/articleshow/84990495.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||India||If no new variant strikes, 3rd Covid wave to be mild: Study||NEW DELHI: IIT researchers who predicted a nearly accurate peak of the Covid-19 second wave believe that the third wave, if at all it comes, may not be as scary as the second one as long as no new mutant which may pass through all kinds of immunity arrives on the scene. Their mathematical model suggests a rise in cases of infection this month in sync with gradual opening up of various activities and that this may lead to a peak of over 1 lakh of daily cases in October in the worst-case scenario. The second wave peak had touched 4 lakh cases a day in May. Times ViewIt is good news that a new model suggests that a potential third wave is likely to be less severe. However, there’s no reason to drop our guard. Rather, one should be on the watch. Covid-appropriate behaviour must continue. And yes, vaccination must be speeded up to optimum levels.“There will be a slight increase towards the end of August and through September. It’s mainly because the lockdown is lifted. It’s not due to any new variant. There is no sign of any new mutant anywhere. So, without a new variant, the third wave will just be a ripple,” Manindra Agrawal of IIT Kanpur told TOI. Agrawal, involved with the national ‘super model’ initiative, known as SUTRA, on Monday said, “The third wave will certainly not be as significant as the second one. We don’t expect any scary scenario in future.” Underlining that peak of daily cases may be much lower (around only 50,000 cases) in absence of any new variant of Covid-19, he said, “If the third wave comes, the load on hospitals will be even lower than the first wave situation.” The analysis and graph, released by researchers in early July, show that the overall number will eventually start tapering down after peak in October and is most likely to reach at a negligible number in December. Agrawal, however, added a caveat, saying any significant rise would happen only if a new variant comes which may pass through all kinds of immunity. The SUTRA model has factored in multiple scenarios - loss of immunity, Delta variant, rate of vaccination etc. - while arriving at the conclusion. Since mathematical modelling is a continuous process while taking into account the latest data, the researchers including Agrawal and M Vidyasagar of IIT Hyderabad, will this week come out with a detailed prediction and analysis. “We are doing a fairly detailed analysis on what might happen in future. We will factor in all data of July and share its outcome,” said Agrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/if-no-new-variant-strikes-3rd-covid-wave-to-be-mild-study/articleshow/84990625.cms||Vishwa Mohan

---||World||Dems ask McCarthy to recant Pelosi taunt as tensions rise||WASHINGTON: Several House Democrats have called on House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy to apologize to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or resign after audio surfaced of him saying at a weekend fundraiser that it would be “hard not to hit her” with a gavel if he’s sworn in as speaker after the 2022 midterm elections. The comment is emblematic of the rising tension between the two leaders since the Jan. 6 insurrection, in which a violent mob of former President Donald Trump’s supporters broke into the Capitol and some hunted for Pelosi by name. After initially condemning the rioters and blaming Trump for inciting them, McCarthy and his leadership team have recently tried to lay blame on Pelosi, falsely claiming that she was responsible for a delay in military assistance. And McCarthy has remained close to Trump, who often insulted his political rivals in personal terms. Democrats responded quickly, noting the threats on Pelosi’s life on Jan. 6, when the insurrectionists broke into her office, stole some of her belongings and called out for her. “Threatening violence against the Speaker of the House is no joke,” tweeted New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney. “This is the kind of reckless language that led to a violent insurrection.” Threatening violence against the Speaker of the House is no joke.This is the kind of reckless language that led t… https://t.co/o5aMFYQiwr— Sean Patrick Maloney (@RepSeanMaloney) 1627839661000The public strain between the two — extraordinary even by congressional standards — has moved beyond the insurrection into most every matter between them as McCarthy is eyeing the speakership and an election map that could be favorable to Republicans next year. McCarthy last week blamed Pelosi for a renewed mask mandate in the House as “a decision conjured up by liberal government officials who want to continue to live in a perpetual pandemic state.” Pelosi shot back that he was a “moron.” On Saturday, McCarthy was attending a Tennessee Republican Party Fundraiser when he was gifted an oversized gavel with the words “fire Pelosi” on it, according to local publication Main Street Nashville, which also posted audio of the comments. McCarthy responded by saying that he wanted the crowd to watch Pelosi hand him the gavel if he wins the speakership, and “it’ll be hard not to hit her with it, but I will bang it down.” Asked about the comments, McCarthy’s office said in a statement that “he was joking.” But Democrats suggested the remarks were part of a broader problem. New Hampshire Rep. Annie Kuster noted that McCarthy had voted against the Violence Against Women Act, legislation designed to protect women from domestic violence that passed the House in March. Rep. Madeleine Dean, tweeted: “There’s nothing funny about hitting Speaker Pelosi or any woman,” adding that he “continues to reminds us that nothing will get in the way of his ambitions — including joking about hitting a woman to excite his small base.” There’s nothing funny about hitting Speaker Pelosi or any woman.Leader McCarthy is a failed leader. He continue… https://t.co/VsyavEbToY— Congresswoman Madeleine Dean (@RepDean) 1627833334000Democratic Reps. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and Eric Swalwell of California said McCarthy should step down. ” I’ve said it before & I’ll say it again—he should RESIGN!!” tweeted McGovern. While already disagreeing on most policy matters, McCarthy and Pelosi have also clashed in recent weeks over the mask mandate, which some Republicans have resisted and argued is not based on science. The requirement was re-instituted in the House after a recommendation from the Capitol Physician. Asked about her “moron” comment last week, Pelosi responded: “To say that wearing a mask is not based on science, I think is not wise, but that’s all I am going to say about that.” McCarthy also withdrew five members from a select committee established last month to investigate the insurrection after Pelosi rejected two of his members, saying they couldn’t sit on the panel because of their “antics” defending Trump after the attack. McCarthy called the move an “egregious abuse of power” and the committee a “sham.” Holding a news conference ahead of the committee’s first hearing, in which police officers spoke emotionally about their physical and mental pain after the rioting, McCarthy and his leadership tried to shift blame from the Trump supporters who laid siege to Pelosi herself. McCarthy said there were “questions into the leadership within the structure of the Speaker’s office” about delays in the National Guard’s arrival that day. However, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called for the guard’s help after the fighting began, and Pelosi’s office has said she did not weigh in on the guard’s presence before that. The delays were instead due to communications between security officials in the Capitol and the Pentagon and a lack of preparedness ahead of the attack. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who was then majority leader, had identical authority over the guard as Pelosi. But McCarthy has repeatedly ignored all questions about his role.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/dems-ask-mccarthy-to-recant-pelosi-taunt-as-tensions-rise/articleshow/84991149.cms||---
---||World||Treasury's Yellen urges Congress to raise US debt limit||WASHINGTON: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday called on Congress to take steps to address the federal government's borrowing limit which was hit on Sunday. Congress suspended the debt limit in 2019, but the two-year suspension lapsed July 31, forcing Treasury to begun taking "extraordinary measures" to remain under the ceiling and continue funding government operations. But private economists estimate those steps will only buy the government a few weeks after which debt repayments would be at risk unless the debt limit is increased or suspended. "I respectfully urge Congress to protect the full faith and credit of the United States by acting as soon as possible," Yellen said in a letter to congressional leaders. The debt limit was reset to the total as of Friday, just over $28 trillion, according to Treasury figures. The US national debt and deficit have soared during the Covid-19 pandemic after Washington approved three massive spending bills aimed at lessening the damage from its economic impacts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said this year's budget deficit will be $3 trillion, second only to the record deficit in 2020. In a letter earlier in July, Yellen reminded lawmakers that raising the debt limit does not increase spending but simply allows Treasury to finance actions already approved by the legislature. CBO estimates Treasury should be able to keep paying the government's bills until October or November, after which point it would have to either delay making payments or default, which could cause economic chaos. Raising the debt ceiling has been a contentious issue in Congress for the past several years, and a 2011 standoff caused the United States to lose the coveted AAA debt rating. However, the Democratic majority in Congress might be more sympathetic to resolving the issue. Like Treasury secretaries before her, faced with a debt limit debate, Yellen said that through September 30, Treasury would stop selling State and Local Government securities, and suspend investments in various government retirement funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/treasurys-yellen-urges-congress-to-raise-us-debt-limit/articleshow/84991324.cms||---

Similarly, the amount of compensation under ‘no fault liability’ in case of death and grievous injuries in a road crash involving insured vehicles will be increased by 10 times. These increased compensation is aimed at bringing quick relief to the victims and their immediate kin. “The draft rules for this increased compensation are being issued and we will notify the final rules subsequently,” a source said. As per the finalised norm, the compensation for a person killed in any hit and run case will be fixed at Rs 2 lakh and for grievous injuries it will be Rs 50,000 compared to the current compensation norm of Rs 25,000 and Rs 12,500 respectively. According to the latest official data of 2019, at least 29,354 persons were killed and 67,751 persons were left injured in hit and run cases in the country. In a written reply to a question from BJP lawmaker Sushil Kumar Modi in the Parliament last week, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had said his ministry will issue the draft rules for quick compensation to such victims. Since in these cases the offender cannot be caught and made to pay the compensation, the government will set up a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund, which will release the compensation. The general insurance companies have come on board to contribute to this corpus. Similarly, for anyone getting killed or left seriously injured in road crashes where the vehicle and its owner can be traced, the ministry has proposed to increase the compensation - Rs 5 lakh for death and Rs 2.5 for in case of grievous hurt. But in this case the insurance company concerned, which has provided third party coverage, will pay the compensation to the victims or their kin. “Since this is a provision under the ‘no fault liability’ the insurance companies will make this compensation offer to the victims or their kins within one month after the crash. They will have the option of either accepting the compensation or they can go to the Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal (MACT),” said an official. In those cases where the offender's vehicle is not insured, the matter will automatically go to the MACT. “But we are confident that there will be hardly any uninsured vehicles plying with improved enforcement. The penalty for plying uninsured vehicles has also been increased substantially,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-hit-and-run-death-government-plans-rs-2-lakh-compensation/articleshow/84991356.cms||Dipak K Dash

According to Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority, the state has so far received 488mm of rainfall, while the average is 471mm. While in June Karnataka recorded 198mm as against the normal rainfall of 199mm (-1%), the figure for July was 290mm as opposed to the normal of 271mm (+7%). Seven districts which received below-normal rainfall are Hassan, Shivamogga, Chikkamagaluru, Mysuru, Udupi, Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada. After lashing the state in June and early July, monsoon had lost vigour in mid-July, leading to slowing down of kharif sowing, besides inducing fear of water shortage across the state. However, it gained momentum during the second half of July with almost 70 per cent of the districts witnessing surplus rain. Manoj Rajan, commissioner, KSDMA, said the state received abundant rainfall between July 22 and July 26, reducing the shortfall and ensuring huge inflow to major dams (486 tmc ft), which is 56% of the gross storage. While south interior Karnataka received 78% excess rainfall in July, for north interior Karnataka, it was 37%, he said. Increase in sowing:Sowing too picked up pace and is well above average now. Rajan said sowing of kharif crops has gone up to 59 lakh hectares compared to 52 lakh hectares during the corresponding period (June-July) the previous year. This is better than the five-year average of 48 lakh hectares. “With decent monsoon, sowing so far has been good, and we are hopeful of reaching the target of 77 lakh hectares in the next few weeks,” said Brijesh Kumar Dikshit, commissioner, agriculture department, adding that sowing of maize has increased significantly this time. The second half (August-September) of monsoon also seems promising. Quoting IMD data, Rajan said the percentage probability of rainfall forecast for the state will be normal and above normal. “If one goes by the pattern over the past five years, surplus rain has been recorded in August and September, leading to floods and landslides. We are well-prepared to handle the situation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/state-records-4-surplus-monsoon-rain-despite-deficit-in-seven-dists/articleshow/84991616.cms||ManuAiyappa Kanathanda

While the mass migration of blackbucks towards Hindupur in Anantapur of Andhra Pradesh has caused concern among environmentalists and animal lovers, the antelopes are also foraging farmlands for food drawing farmers’ wrath. Blackbucks need open grasslands for food and free movement and to escape from predators. Spread over 798 acres, Jayamangali, near Mydananahalli, was declared a blackbuck conservation reserve in 2007. Environmentalist TVN Murthy blamed the forest department for the food shortage faced by blackbucks in the reserve. Acting on complaints that clumps of Nilgiri and other trees on the grasslands were forcing the antelopes to forage nearby farmlands for food, the forest department not only cut the trees but also razed the grasslands, he said. Chikkanna, a farmer from Mutharayanahalli, said every year he is incurring crop losses due to damage caused by the blackbucks. Over 70% of Chikkanna’s mulberry plants were devoured by the animals. The farmer lamented that the crop loss compensation provided by the forest department is meagre and will not even fetch the expenses incurred in filing the application seeking relief. While Murthy said the antelopes are also migrating to Sira and Pavagada taluks of Tumakuru district in search of food and water, Tumakuru district secretary of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) Shankarappa said they are are moving towards Gauribidanur of Chikkaballapura district. Shooed away by farmers keen on saving their crops, the blackbucks are moving from one farmland to another. Murthy expressed concerns that the antelopes may be killed in road accidents or by poachers if they cross the boundary of the reserve. Murthy said the forest department has to improve the habitat in order to prevent migration of blackbucks. He demanded the state government conduct a census of the blackbucks and open a wildlife wing of the forest department in Tumakuru district. District conservator of forests S Ramesh said crop loss compensation rates have to be revised at the government level. Recently transferred to the district, he said he would take measures to improve the habitat by removing the vegetation, bushes and weeds. He would conduct a study of the grasslands and submit a report on habitat improvement to the government. Ramesh, however, said the rising blackbuck population could also be a reason for food shortage and consequent migration, adding that they will return to the reserve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/habitat-in-peril-madhugiri-blackbucksmigrating-in-search-of-greener-pastures/articleshow/84991618.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru teen who lost forearm was injected with painkiller at b’day party: Cops||BENGALURU: A 17-year-old boy whose right forearm developed a swelling after he attended a birthday party and had to be amputated later was injected with a painkiller, forensic tests of his blood samples have revealed. The boy, who lived with his mother in Chamrajpet, had attended the birthday party of a friend on May 31 night in Chamrajpet. The host of the party, a college dropout, had injected the painkiller laced with water into the forearms of four boys, three of them minors, telling them that it would give them a high similar to smoking ganja. As the organiser of the party could not arrange ganja, he decided to provide the powdered painkiller, sources said. Four days later, there was a swelling in the boy’s right arm. His mother took him to Sanjay Gandhi hospital where doctors found that a ‘poisonous substance ’ had spread internally, forcing them to amputate it. The boy’s mother had filed a complaint with Chamrajpet police, accusing the man who hosted the party of drugging her son. “The reports from FSL confirmed that there were traces of the tablets in the victim’s blood. According to the boy, the accused had powdered some tablets, mixed them in water and injected it into the forearms of four others and himself,” sources said. The accused, who was arrested later in a motorbike theft case and was in judicial custody, was taken into police custody. Other participants of the party were also questioned and they confirmed that the accused had drugged them all. “Two other participants will depose their statements under CrPC 164 before the court. After recording the statements, chargesheet will be submitted soon,” an investigating officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/teen-who-lost-forearm-was-injected-with-painkiller-at-bday-party-cops/articleshow/84991623.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

A village outreach programme was launched to cover 1,785 gram panchayats in 57 taluks to reach out to farmers in Cauvery basin districts of Karnataka within two months. Speaking to reporters on Monday evening about the programme, Sadhguru said the on-ground initiative led by fully vaccinated volunteers will connect to 24 lakh farmers in nine districts of the Cauvery region in Karnataka. “Cauvery Calling is the biggest initiative involving farmers in a big way and has seen enthusiastic participation from them so far. The new outreach programme will reach Karnataka farmers through 890 trained people who will create awareness on tree-based farming in the nine districts. If successful, it will be a game changer not just in the Cauvery region but in India and the tropical world,” said Sadhguru, founder of Isha Foundation. He also stated as part of the initiative, they aim at planting 3.5 crore saplings in the Cauvery region by 2022 through farmer participation, compared to 1.1 crore last year. This will be a long-term step towards strengthening soil with organic content and water and increasing revenue of the farmers by 300-800 per cent. Sadhguru said the pandemic has not slowed down their efforts in planting saplings as participation in the programme has been overwhelming. The outreach programme will host 1,800 events to promote tree-based farming among the farming community in the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3-5-crore-saplings-to-be-planted-in-cauvery-basin-by-2022-sadhguru/articleshow/84991625.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka farmers dump tomatoes on road||KOLAR/BENGALURU: Many roadsides in Kolar district give an impression that they have been painted red. The red though is no road design but the result of distressed tomato growers dumping their produce in desperation. For two seasons now, tomato growers from Kolar district are at the receiving end of either the lockdowns or the rainy and humid weather. Left with no buyers during the lockdowns, the farmers were forced to reduce the prices and many of them preferred to dump the produce by the roadside or allowed the crop to wither away in the fields. When the latest lockdown was lifted and the price of a 15 kg box of tomatoes went up from Rs 30-50 to Rs 150-200, the recent rain and continued humid conditions are turning the spoiler. The price of the box is now down to Rs 50-80. According to CR Srinath, proprietor of CMR Tomato Mandi in Kolar, said the weather conditions prevailing in Kolar district have affected the crop at many places. Black spots were found on tomatoes and buyers were reluctant to purchase the crop. He said West Bengal, a major consumer of tomatoes grown in Kolar, is experiencing heavy rain during the last few days. The rain has washed away many roads which affected transportation of tomatoes. As against 45 hours usually taken to reach West Bengal, trucks are now requiring nearly 60 hours to cover the same distance and thus affecting the quality of tomatoes. At many places in West Bengal, tomatoes are lying in trucks as rain has hindered the unloading process in markets, he said. Vinay, assistant director (technical), horticulture department, said the dampness in the atmosphere has hit the quality of tomatoes. He said the bouts of drizzle that occurred in the district over the last few days has resulted in the plants developing black fungus. He said as the season is coming to a close, farmers are harvesting the last pickings which normally lack quality and farmers are dumping them on the roadside, he said. The retail price of tomato in Kolar is about Rs 10 per kg. Vegetable traders in Bengaluru though have a different tale to tell. They admit the size of tomatoes aren’t as big as they used to be but their retail price is fluctuating between Rs 16 and Rs 18 per kilogram. An employee from Hopcoms said: “The cost has not dropped below Rs 10 in a long time. If the retail price of a good-quality tomato is Rs 18 per kilo, the farmer should get Rs 12. The government also facilitates more markets for farmers to be able to sell their produce.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/farmers-dump-tomatoes-on-road/articleshow/84991628.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru to get more battery swapping stations for e-vehicles||BENGALURU: In a boost to electric mobility, Bengaluru is likely to get more battery-swapping stations (BSS). For many EV owners, inadequate and time-consuming plug-in charging are major concerns and BSS where drained batteries are replaced with fully charged ones in a few minutes are a better alternative. App-based two-wheeler rental firm Bounce has set up BSS under its subsidiary Zuink. Vivekananda Hallekere, CEO and co-founder, Bounce said: “We have more than 200 BSS in Bengaluru and another 1,000 will be added in the next six months. Currently, we have a BSS every two km in the city. Most of these 200 partners are small business owners like kirana stores. We have recently partnered with HPCL petrol bunks to set up BSS.” He said they have enabled 10 million EV kms in Bengaluru from our BSS since 2020. This translates to 2 lakh swaps done through this network. “We are asking users to pay per swap and they don’t have to invest in owning a battery. Autorickshaws and two-wheelers can use the same batteries and swapping infrastructure once they start working with us. A user using our mobile app can see the nearest BSS and pick a battery from there,” said Hallekere. Sun Mobility, an electric mobility solutions provider, has facilitated ‘Swap Points’ stations in Indiranagar, Koramangala and JP Nagar. “We plan to expand to over 100 stations in the next 12-18 months. Batteries will contribute 30%-40% of total vehicle cost for two-wheelers and three-wheelers, making it the most expensive component in a vehicle. Hence, battery swap will continue to remain relevant for a price-sensitive market like India,” said a spokesperson from Sun Mobility. In April, Bescom had sought proposals from private firms for setting up EV charging/battery swapping stations at 79 Bescom premises on rental basis in Karnataka. It will soon invite a tender regarding the same. CK Sreenath, deputy general manager, Smart Grid and Electric Vehicles, Bescom, said: “Firms like Sun Mobility, Zuink and Ola have expressed interest to set up BSS in the city. The number of battery-swapping vehicles in the city is less but once Ola’s electric scooters enter the market, the demand might go up.” “Since we keep more than two batteries in each location, we are not able to get the benefit of lower tariff given by Bescom. Bescom needs to install a new meter, which is tough for us to do in every kirana store. We want to enable small business owners to become energy distributors. We are also in talks with BMRCL to get space for this at all Metro stations,” said Hallekere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-to-get-more-battery-swapping-stns-for-e-vehicles/articleshow/84991632.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

It all started when Bangalore Randonneurs (BR) threw the Monsoon Challenge in August 2020, asking the riders to do 100km on any of the 10 consecutive days that month. While 60 of the 80 riders successfully met the challenge, Kadsur kept on doing 100km daily, thereby inspiring many a cyclist along the way. Food consultant K V Nandakumar and chemistry professor Dephan Pinheiro said they owe their cycling commitment to Kadsur. While both of them have done 15days-51km (another challenge by BR), Nandakumar has registered for the second edition of 100x10 challenge this August. "Being an epitome of discipline, Kadsur perspires and inspires," he added. With clock-like precision, Kadsur starts his day at 2.50am and ends it around 7pm, dividing the time between rides and fitness sessions in south Bengaluru. "City's traffic is something which I dread," said Kadsur, speaking on the challenges he faced over the last year. "Wish motorists are not short-fused," he said, recounting two instances of being kicked by a biker and a cabbie for no fault of his. "Otherwise, it's been an awesome journey," he said, adding he will continue the century rides, the challenge of riding a fixie (fixed-gear bike having a drivetrain with no freewheel mechanism) notwithstanding. While the members of the cycling community wished Kadsur with a citation on Sunday morning, Bengaluru Sotuh MP Tejasvi Surya handed him a letter of appreciation applauding the unprecedented feat. The MP's letter read: "Today, as you complete 365 days of cycling for 100km everyday, I appreciate your indomitable will and spirit in promoting a healthy lifestyle among the people of this city and the country."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/fixie-rider-does-100km-daily-for-1-yr/articleshow/84991634.cms||Charan Sadu

At a press conference on Monday, Shia cleric Jawad objected to the internal police communication document that went viral on social media on Sunday. Police, however, said it is an internal communication meant for briefing district police officers about the security during Muharram and the part of it which is being called objectionable was about anti-social elements. However, raising questions on the intent of the DGP and police, the cleric appealed to Muharram committees and Anjumans across the state, Sunni and Hindu Azadars (those who commemorate Muharram), to boycott all meetings of the police and the administration. “The DGP should apologise and withdraw the circular first before we take part in any future meetings to be held by them,” he said. All India Shia Personal Law Board (AISPLB) also condemned the document along with other clerics and appealed to Azadars across the state to give a memorandum against the DGP on August 8 to their DM concerned. Prashant Kumar, ADG, said: “A detailed order of dos and don’ts was issued on July 31 for all the officers on the field, for Muharram. This is an internal order based on ground realities and events that have happened earlier.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/muharram-order-objectionable-act-against-dgp-says-shia-cleric/articleshow/84991687.cms||---

In a written question, AIMIM’s Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi asked the government to confirm how many “oil shipments from Sandesara’s Nigerian business, SEEPCO Nigeria, were re-sold via Glencore, UK” and seized by Indian enforcement agencies since January 2018 till date. In some foreign media reports, it has been speculated that Sandesara, despite being declared ‘fugitive economic offenders’ by Indian courts and having pending non-bailable warrants and Interpol’s Red Corner Notices against them, had been using a UK registered firm supplying oil to some Indian public sector oil companies. “No oil shipments of SEEPCO Nigeria have been seized by Indian enforcement agencies since January 2018 till date,” minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said in a written reply. The minister, however, did not mention if Indian PSU oil companies were either dealing with Sandesara’s front entities or had any connection directly or indirectly. Chaudhary said that the various agencies have initiated prosecution proceedings against the two Sandesara brothers. “In an order dated June 22, SEBI restrained Nitin and Chetan Sandesara from accessing the securities market for a period of five years and debarred them from holding any management position in any listed company or any intermediary registered with SEBI,” the minister said on actions taken against them. The Enforcement Directorate has already attached assets worth Rs 14,500 crore of Sandesara brothers, which includes oil rigs, private jets and luxury properties in the US, the UK and Dubai worth over Rs 9,700 crore, according to the agency. The total attachments exceed Rs 14,500 crore. However, the attachment orders seem to have made no difference to the finances of the Sandesara brother’s as they continue to operate a global oil supply chain, interestingly with Indian government entities too. Information received here by agencies revealed the two brothers, who fled India in 2017 with family members, shuttle between Nigeria and Albania and have taken citizenship of both the countries. Nigeria, a source said, had in the past refused to entertain India’s request for extradition of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/are-fugitive-sandesara-brothers-selling-oil-to-india-via-uk-companies/articleshow/84991700.cms||---

When our government seeks to turn technology into a mission, then several political leaders and some specific types of experts raise questions. But today, the government has proved them wrong…. Today, we see technology as a tool to help the poor and in their development. The world is witnessing that technology is bringing about transparency and honesty in India…. How it is creating new opportunities… it has reduced dependence on the government and red-tapism,” he said, while launching e-RUPI, an electronic voucher scheme. Modi cited several examples – from Fastags at toll plazas to the government e-market place portal apart from Aarogya Setu and Co-Win – to argue how technology had aided citizens, something that was inconceivable eight to 10 years ago. When it comes to innovations, the use of technology in service delivery, India has the ability to give global leadership along with big countries of the world, he said adding that e-RUPI will also be a successful initiative in the coming years. “Not just the government, but even other institutions can use this to help someone for medical treatment, education or other purposes. They will be able to transfer through e-RUPI instead of cash. This will ensure that the money being given is used for a specific purpose. Initially, this scheme is being implemented for health sector benefits,” Modi said. He explained how transfers can be done to purchase beds in a senior citizens’ home or to feed the poor. “In the national context, if the government wants to provide funds to purchase books, then e-RUPI will ensure that the money is being used to buy books,” the PM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/modi-launches-e-rupi-says-subsidy-dbt-saved-rs-1-7-lakh-crore/articleshow/84991719.cms||---
---||India||Amid opposition protests, Lok Sabha passes insurance bill||NEW DELHI: Amid protests by the Opposition over Pegasus issue and farm bills, Lok Sabha on Monday passed a bill to amend the general insurance law to allow the government to reduce its stake in state-owned insurers. The General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2021 is aimed at generating required resources from Indian markets so that public sector general insurers can design innovative products. While the bill was moved for passage, Congress leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury says the proposed law is “anti-people” and “anti-national”. Calling the allegations “baseless”, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, “The government is not taking away anyone’s rights. Companies in the private sector are giving good policies to people. Therefore, the Congress leader is speaking untruth and misleading the people. If he has to speak more against the bill, he should allow the House to debate.” Proceedings were also disrupted In Rajya Sabha which too witnessed multiple adjournments even though the House passed the Inland Vessels Bill-2021 amid the din. The bill aims to bring uniformity in the application of the law relating to inland waterways and navigation within the country. Lok Sabha has already passed it. When some opposition members sought a division, Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh asked all MPs to go back to their respective seats first. As the MPs refused to do so and some even tore papers in the well of the House and tossed them in the air, the bill was finally passed with a voice vote. Two appropriation bills were also moved in the House later. Later TMC Rajya Sabha member Derek O'Brien hit out at the Union government for rushing to pass bills, pointing out that 12 bills were passed "at an average time of under seven minutes per bill". "In the first 10 days, Modi-Shah rushed through and passed 12 Bills at an average time of UNDER SEVEN MINUTES per Bill. Passing legislation or making papri chaat!" Derek O'Brien tweeted. In the morning, RS Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said he was willing to consider a discussion on farmers' problems if members cooperate. Naidu also congratulated PV Sindhu for winning a Bronze medal at Tokyo Games and said she has scripted history by becoming the first Indian woman to win two Olympic medals. He said Sindhu along with her father used to travel 120-km daily for training. “It is appropriate to take note of the role of Sindhu's parents and family in her spectacular rise and achievements in Badminton that brought her laurels for our country."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-opposition-protests-lok-sabha-passes-insurance-bill/articleshow/84991731.cms||---

In a written reply, the road transport ministry said while 4.7 lakh crashes were recorded in 2018, this fell to 4.5 lakh in 2019 and to 3.6 lakh during last year. The sharp decline registered last year was also due to Covid-19 induced nationwide lockdown and subsequent restriction on movement across different states. The ministry said the amended law passed by Parliament focuses on road safety and has provisions such as hike in penalties for traffic violations, electronic monitoring of violations and enhanced penalties for juvenile driving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/road-accidents-down-by-18-govt/articleshow/84991744.cms||---

ADJ Naresh Kumar Laka has written to the PM requesting him to ban two online games — Free Fire and PUBG India — on the lines of the government’s earlier decision to disallow PUBG Mobile. Times ViewSeveral studies have shown that many children spend an unacceptable number of hours playing video games. This affects both their physical and mental health. Banning video games, however, is unlikely to solve the problem. The issue is primarily about parental responsibility and needs to be tackled in individual households. Parents must devise their own ways to deal with it.“The citizens of the country appreciated your action in banning the notorious game PUBG Mobile which caused devastating adverse effect on the development of children. But recently two similar games, namely, Free Fire (Garena Free Fire — Rampage) and PUBG India (Battle Grounds Mobile India), are also causing adverse impact on the children like the previous PUBG,” he wrote. Laka said children spend long hours playing such games, which disturbs their normal life and affects their family and social behaviour. He suggested a law be framed to restrict exposure of children to such games.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ban-games-like-free-fire-pubg-india-judge-writes-to-pm/articleshow/84991862.cms||---

Two women officers of the state cadre have struck a blow for “nari shakti” by showing nerves of steel to stamp their presence on a ring presumed to be the preserve of battle-hardened male officers. Cachar DC Keerthi Jalli and her IPS batchmate of 2013, district SP Ramandeep Kaur, have come in for praise from various quarters for their deft handling of the volatile situation on the Assam-Mizoram border since the July 26 firing in which six police officers from the state were killed. CM Himanta Biswa Sarma has compared the duo to Goddess Durga. “I have complete trust on them and women can do the job better than anyone else…woman is another form of Devi Durga,” he said. While Jalli has been the DC of Cachar for some time, Kaur was the police chief of Hailakandi district, which also shares the border with Mizoram, until the day violence erupted. “On July 26, after six of our men were killed and the SP of Cachar was injured in the firing, I received a call to rush to Lailapur (Cachar district). As soon as I got there, I was tasked with evacuating all the slain policemen and injured personnel,” Kaur said. Kaur and her batchmate find the plaudits being showered on them a departure from what civil servants usually get. “What the honourable CM has said about nari shakti, it is huge compliment, and we feel proud that he has reposed his trust on us,” Jalli said. Every day since the violence started, they get into a bulletproof vehicle and patrol the border that stands beyond a reserve forest at the heart of the dispute. “The day never ends,” Kaur said, describing how both would stay well past midnight deep inside the forest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/on-assam-mizoram-border-two-women-officers-fight-the-good-fight/articleshow/84991887.cms||Prabin Kalita

Raisi, a hardliner and known to be close to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, won the presidential election in June by a landslide. India’s presence at such a high level is significant particularly as India and Iran get closer in the wake of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Last month, Jaishankar stopped over in Tehran to meet the just-elected Raisi as the first foreign leader to visit. Jaishankar’s visit came even as Tehran was playing host to a conference of Afghan leaders hoping to come to a peace deal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jaishankar-may-attend-iran-presidents-swearing-in/articleshow/84991917.cms||---

The memorandum said, “We would like to express our disapproval of the attempt by sections led by the Congress party to use this as a means to indulge in one-upmanship.” “Former PMs Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi were not sensitive to aspirations of Mizo and Naga communities,” the memorandum signed by the MPs, including Union ministers Kiren Rijiju and Sarbananda Sonowal, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-playing-politics-bjp-mps/articleshow/84991920.cms||---
---||India||Mizoram cops may still face trouble||NEW DELHI: Even as Assam on Monday reciprocated Mizoram’s de-escalation gesture to withdraw the FIR against Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, by abating the proceedings against Mizoram MP in its own FIR on the July 26 border clashes, a source investigating the matter hinted that Mizoram police may find it difficult to escape criminal liability under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and Indian Penal Code (IPC) for the killing of Assam police personnel in firing. In fact, the source reiterated that with two state police involved, the right course of action would be to have a “neutral” agency like CBI or NIA probe the matter. However, with neither the Assam government nor Mizoram government having sought a CBI probe, an officer said even NIA was competent to probe the matter under the Arms Act. NIA Act empowers Centre to order an NIA probe on its own. An Assam police official indicated that the role of civilians was also under the scanner and if substantial evidence emerges of civilian involvement in firing on Assam police, sections of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act would be added to the FIR. The source quoted the Criminal Procedure Code and Indian Penal Code to buttress that Mizoram Police may not escape action for killing six Assam police personnel in the firing. As per Section 46(2) and 46(3)of CrPC while police can use all means necessary to effect an arrest, nothing gives them a right to cause the death of a person who is not accused of an offence punishable with death. Besides, Section 129-132 of CrPC state that while using civil force for dispersal of unlawful assembly, an officer of the armed forces shall use as little force, and do as little injury to persons and property, as may be consistent with dispersing the assembly”. The source also pointed to Sections 96 to 106 of IPC, which state that the quantum of harm while exercising one’s right to private defence or self defence shall in no case be in excess of harm that may be necessary for purpose of defence. The source also cited the Mizoram Police Manual 2006 Chapter XIV, Article 779 (C) (vi) which states that “the aim in such firing should however be aimed low and rapid fire shall not be used, if single round fire suffices”. Assam Police have said that light machine gun fire had killed their personnel on July 26. So while Assam and Mizoram have withdrawn cases or proceedings against Assam CM and Mizoram, the basic FIRs on both the sides remain. “An FIR once filed is a court document. Police have no ownership. It can either be quashed by a superior court, or prosecution withdrawn by state government (which also has to be approved by the court). Also, FIR may be withdrawn after a final report is submitted,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mizoram-cops-may-still-face-trouble/articleshow/84991924.cms||Bharti Jain

J&J had sought approval in April to conduct a bridging clinical study of its vaccine candidate in India. With an aim to increase availability of jabs and enable faster access to foreign-made Covid vaccines, the government had done away with bridging trial studies prior to grant of emergency authorisation for shots approved by recognised regulators like US FDA or UK’s MHRA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jj-withdraws-plea-to-hold-vax-trials-as-govt-relaxes-norms/articleshow/84991939.cms||---
---||India||Gujarat HC tears into SDM for banishing MLA’s critic||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court pulled up the authorities on Monday for externing a citizen from eight districts for calling up Godhra MLA CK Raolji’s son and questioning him about the MLA’s work. Staying the externment imposed on Pravinbhai Charan, Justice Paresh Upadhyay sought an explanation from the sub-divisional magistrate and the MLA. The judge said such action was unacceptable. “We do not run kingdoms. We are a democratic republic. Is this a republic in which a citizen cannot question his elected representative? Externment orders are passed upon doing so?” The court questioned the “atrocity” committed against people at large. Charan was booked in June this year by the Panchmahal police for calling Raolji’s son, Malavdeepsinh, on the phone and telling him that the MLA was not doing his work. He was accused of issuing death threats. The government tried to defend the preventive measure by citing the alleged threat. To this, the court said, “If so, the government can put him behind bars, but externment?” The judge added, “If somebody expresses his grievance before the MLA, then file an FIR? This should be stopped. Today, the person is externed for seeking an account of an MLA’s work. It is confirmed that if you don’t vote for me, you will be externed... only one step away from doing so (sic).” The SDM based his externment order on three FIRs lodged against Charan since 2017, the immediate cause being the complaint filed by the MLA’s son. The HC said the SDM needed to be immediately shifted from his position because he did not work as a custodian of the people’s trust but as custodian of a politician’s interests. “You want to send a loud and clear message that you do not call the MLA’s son and ask about the MLA’s performance,” the judge said. The court also issued notice to the MLA by making him a respondent. The court said it was impleading the MLA, and not his son, in order to question him on whether he approved of such practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gujarat-hc-tears-into-sdm-for-banishing-mlas-critic/articleshow/84991984.cms||Saeed Khan

Sinha was appointed as adviser in the PMO after he retired in February 2020 from the IAS as rural development secretary. He was looking after the affairs of rural and social sectors. As rural development secretary, Sinha played a key role in putting the MGNREGS back on track after it floundered in the first two years of the Narendra Modi government. The geo-tagging of houses built under PMAY was a key step in transparency in rural development works initiated by him. Key rural schemes on roads, housing and rural livelihoods picked up pace during his tenure. In the Prime Minister’s Office, he was the man behind the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana which was designed to provide work to migrant workers returning home from urban centres during the pandemic-induced displacement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amarjeet-sinha-resigns-from-pmo/articleshow/84991992.cms||---

He will, however, continue to remain an MP. Supriyo did not clarify whether he was going to contest the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. “You will not see Babul as a politician any more. Unfortunately, I cannot back out from the decision of quitting politics as I have made up my mind already,” he said after emerging from the home of BJP national president J P Nadda in New Delhi on Monday. Thanking Union home minister Amit Shah and Nadda for trying to dissuade him from quitting politics, Supriyo said: “I am changing my decision and remaining an MP.” Supriyo said he would continue to accept a salary in the absence of any other “source of income” but would “relinquish” his New Delhi bungalow and security cover. “I will now shift back to Mumbai or Kolkata,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-remain-an-mp-but-quit-politics-says-babul/articleshow/84992026.cms||Rohit Khanna

A similar situation is likely to be created in other states of the country, they said. “There are a total of 1,874 PG medical seats in the state. If the new rules that are proposed in the draft are implemented Gujarat will see a decline of about 600-700 seats,” said two experts in the know of the matter. The maximum intake of postgraduate students in specialities where units are prescribed shall not exceed three PG seats per unit per academic year, according to clause 16.2 in the draft regulations. Presently, there are six seats per unit per academic year. “A unit consists of one professor, one assistant professor and an associate professor. While three seats are earmarked for the professor, two are for assistant professor and one seat is marked for one associate professor. There is a cap of six seats per unit. The proposed draft aims to change this by limiting the seats to three per unit,” said one of the two experts. He said that at a time when the government is planning to increase the number of seats for PG medical students, the new set of rules could put the government’s ambitious plans off track. “The institute can have any number of units to meet the needs of the workload. But only the minimum number of units required as per the Minimum Standard Requirements for annual MBBS admissions Regulations, 2020 of the NMC shall be taken into account to calculate the number of postgraduate seats to be sanctioned,” according to clause 16.6 of the draft. The draft also proposes to change the criteria for professors in three-year PG courses. This could further impact the student teacher ratio, said experts. So far, assistant professors were required to have four year of work experience to qualify for the post of professors. “The draft aims to change this to five years and also have two eligible research publications in the past three years as professor,” said an expert. The draft has been opposed by many states who are of the view that if the proposal sees light of the day in its current form, the power of the state would be undermined. The experts had red flagged a provision of the draft PG regulations aimed to centralise and designate the Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India as the designated authority for counselling for state quota seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/draft-pg-medical-regulations-may-reduce-guj-seats-by-30/articleshow/84987857.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Not only is there a scramble to bring talent on board — with emphasis on immediate joining — a significant number of hires are women, with companies offering them up to 70% jump over their last-drawn package. Hiring today is largely centered in IT, with nearly 65% of overall recruitment in this sector. TeamLease Services found that women candidates formed 43% of the total hiring by IT companies since March this year. TeamLease Services co-founder & executive VP Rituparna Chakraborty said there is a surge in hiring women at the mid-management to senior level. Although hiring in other sectors is yet to gather momentum, there are clear indications that diversity is the focus across industries. Avtar, a leading firm in diversity, inclusion, and belongingness, says it has seen “a never-before increase” in diversity hiring across IT & non-IT sectors over the last quarter. Avtar founder Saundarya Rajesh said: “Women candidates are in great demand. In sheer numbers, the demand in just Q1 (April-June) is almost as much as what we witnessed throughout FY21.” “Not only are companies hiring in really large numbers, but the salaries being offered are also very attractive, with hikes of almost 60-70% over their current pay. Here too, second career women are in high demand — their salaries are often more affordable since the pay packet being matched is only their last drawn, several months or years ago,” said Rajesh. However, this is not a secular demand being witnessed across the country. While diversity hiring is mostly done by major companies, small and medium enterprises too are slowly catching up. Avtar, which pioneered the concept of second careers for women in 2006, said while organisations, in different stages of diversity maturity, adopted this practice to different levels over the past few years, this year (FY22, beginning April) has been exceptional. “Organisations are keen to hire women on breaks and this trend extends across all industries. A key reason could be that second career women are immediate joiners — with no notice period for the organisation to wait out. Companies that are looking at filling positions instantly are betting big on returning women,” said Rajesh. In India, work-from-home (WFH) has boosted gender parity and emerged as a great equaliser in terms of gender diversity with an increase in female representation across key sectors. WFH had increased opportunities for women, especially for those looking to re-enter the workforce. “There has been a dramatic rise in the number of WFH jobs, as well as the number of applications for women. This trend has been a boon for married women in India. As WFH becomes the norm, more organisations are looking at hiring women. Around 50% of 150-plus companies — multinationals, large companies, high-growth startups, and early age startups are hiring more women,” said Chakraborty. The pandemic has shown that despite handling household responsibilities, along with a full-time job, women have been performing well. “Women lost jobs much more than men did during the pandemic. But those women who were retained, the ones who stayed, are performing very well. In a recent round-up of performance appraisals in a mid-size company, women outnumbered men when it came to promotions and increments,” said Rajesh. To ensure they retain women candidates, companies are also making policy changes to the maternity leaves they offer. According to TeamLease Services, 45% of all companies said they offer six months of maternity leave, with 13% offering more. Large enterprises have especially stepped up efforts, with 20% of them offering more than the stipulated time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-offer-big-hikes-to-women-in-hiring-rush/articleshow/84990004.cms||Namrata Singh

The profits were higher than expected considering that last year the earnings in Q1 were boosted by over Rs 1,000 crore following a sale of HDFC Life Insurance shares to comply with RBI regulations. The company’s consolidated net profit rose 31% during the quarter to Rs 5,311 crore as compared to Rs 4,059 crore a year ago. After the announcement, shares of the company rose almost 1% to Rs 2,462. Keki Mistry, VC & CEO, said that the first quarter disbursement stood at Rs 25,518 crore compared to Rs 9,047 crore in the first quarter. “We saw a sequential decline in disbursement during the second quarter compared to Q4FY21 because the second half of April and whole of May was impacted because of the second wave,” said Mistry. He added that there was a dip in construction loans because of the lockdown. The current quarter has seen a resurgence in demand. Mistry said that disbursements in July 2021 were the highest ever if quarter-ending months were excluded. Overall disbursement was the third highest in history. The average loan amount crossed Rs 30 lakh. “We are seeking a structural increase in the demand for housing. The increase in value is because people are buying larger houses and sales have picked up in metros,” he added. Of the home loans, 56% were for new apartments, 36% for resale properties and the rest for self-constructions. The board of directors in their meeting approved the appointments of Rajesh Narain Gupta, MD, of law firm SNG Partners, as an independent (additional) director and P R Ramesh, former director, Deloitte & Touche as additional (non-executive non-independent) director both effective August 2 for five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-profit-flat-at-rs-3000cr-in-q1/articleshow/84989873.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The delegation also submitted a memorandum, signed by all the 16 JD(U) Lok Sabha members from Bihar, to Shah on the issue. “It has been informed by the government in the Monsoon session of Parliament that caste-wise enumeration of population would not be done. We are disappointed by this information, because our Union government is known for welfare of people of backward and disadvantaged groups. This information is very disappointing,” the opening para of the JD(U) memorandum reads. Nalanda MP Kaushalendra Kumar, who was part of the delegation, told TOI, “Bihar assembly had passed unanimous resolutions in 2019 and 2020 for a caste census. It is now for the Union government to take a final decision.” He said the delegation urged the home minister to issue a fresh order for caste-wise counting of population during the forthcoming census. Shah, he said, assured the delegation that the matter would be discussed at a proper forum. “The actual number of different backward and other caste people could be known only through the case-wise census. Today, most of the people and political parties support the demand of caste census,” Kaushalendra said over phone from Delhi. In fact, the JD(U) MPs’ delegation had sought time from the PMO to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press for its demand, but they were asked to meet Shah. Earlier on Saturday, the JD(U) national executive committee passed a resolution in support of the caste census. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar also urged the Centre to reconsider its decision of not enumerating caste-wise population in the forthcoming census.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-mps-meet-home-minister-for-caste-census/articleshow/84980322.cms||Madan Kumar

July’s deal value is second highest since the Reliance Jio-dominated period of May 2020 ($10.7 billion) and deal flow in the month is second only to March 2017, a period of consumer internet boom, which saw 135 deals. Early-stage funding deals (seed, series-A and -B) worth over $304 million were sealed across 80 deals in the month compared to just $131 million across 37 deals in the immediately preceding month June. Sectorally, thanks to Covid-induced push for digitisation, IT/ITes companies recorded a 14x increase in deal value from the year-ago period at $7.1 billion. Besides Flipkart’s $3.6 billion raise from CPPIB, SoftBank and others, the month saw 14 mega deals (over $100 million in size) aggregating to $7.6 billion — 87% of total value. Fidelity IIFL, and others investing $600 million in fintech major Pine Labs, Pharmeasy’s $500-million fund infusion from Think Investments, B Capital and others, and Swiggy’s $450 million raise from SoftBank, were other large deals. “Even without Flipkart’s large raise, the month was encouraging in terms of PE-VC deals as it brought growth across the board in terms of stages and across sectors,” Arun Natarajan, founder and MD, Venture Intelligence, said. Early-stage investment activity has bounced back after a pause in May, and the pipeline for August also seems strong, he added. A third wave of the pandemic and resulting lockdowns could however disrupt this trend. Natarajan added that with more new age internet companies going for IPOs, the linkages between public and private markets are likely to get stronger, and the stock markets’ fortunes may cascade to the startup ecosystem. Liquidity boom in global markets increased dry powder to investors resulting in July as a standout month for Private equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC) investment. Both deal count and deal value across the stages and not just among late-stage startups witnessed record growth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pe-vc-funding-grew-4x-y-o-y-in-july/articleshow/84987167.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Kolkata||On their day, Anglo-Indians vow to stand by each other in trying times||Kolkata: The revelry including singing, dancing and feasting may have been missing or muted, but most programmes organised by the Anglo-Indian community in the city on World Anglo-Indian Day on Monday bordered on spirituality and the idea of supporting each other in these trying times. The Rangers Club, which is the only Anglo-Indian club in the world, was supposed to celebrate its 125th anniversary on Monday on a grand scale. But such programmes have been shelved for now. On Sunday, however, the club organised a small get-together with just 50 members to mark the occasion. The feast included the customary yellow rice ball curry, pork vindaloo and salad, but members said they missed the fun and laughter. “We are a community that lives large and enjoys every moment. But this year the celebratory spirit was missing,” said club president Shane Calvert. Those who attended tried to make the most of it. “We were so happy to see Richard Alford and his wife Geraldine, the oldest members of the club,” said social secretary Blossom Rae. Hundreds from the city now settled abroad connected with their families and friends here for a virtual ecumenical service organised by The Calcutta Anglo Indian Service Society (Caiss) on Monday evening. It was a hybrid programme with the physical service conducted by Father Orson Wells at Church of Our Lady of Vailankanni, and attended by 50 members of the community, and the livestream that was attended by the rest. Some parts of the services were conducted by Anglo Indian clergy, like Father Pat Walsh from Kharagpur and Father Nigel Pope from Melbourne. “It was an emotional moment as hundreds prayed for good health and pledged to stay by each other. We have been reaching out to all members in need and many living abroad are sending financial assistance,” said Colin Fitzgerald, convenor of Caiss. Many city schools that have a large representation of Anglo-Indian teachers, like La Martiniere, Julien Day School and Welland Gouldsmith, organised virtual programmes where teachers spoke about the contribution of the community. “We spoke to the boys about sportsmen the community has produced, like Leslie Claudius and Leandar Paes. The latter was a Martinian. We told them about legendary teachers of the community who built the backbone of the English education system,” said Joseph Edmund Paul, a teacher of LMB who participated in the virtual event. The Association of Heads of Anglo Indian Schools, too, organised a thanksgiving service, said Francis Gomes, association secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-their-day-anglo-indians-vow-to-stand-by-each-other-in-trying-times/articleshow/84986287.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Patna||‘Bihar universities may be allowed to conduct exams soon’||PATNA: Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary on Monday said that the state universities may be allowed to conduct their pending examinations soon. A final decision regarding this is likely to be taken in the next meeting of the state crisis management group scheduled this week. The minister told this newspaper that the government is seized with the problems being faced by the final year students due to inordinate delay in the conduct of examinations and publication of results. “Students are unable to join higher education institutions due to delayed results,” the minister said, adding that some have also reportedly lost job opportunities. “Taking all these facts in consideration the government may allow the universities to hold examinations under strict Covid-19 protocols,” he said. The minister, however, asserted that a decision on the resumption of junior classes in schools would be taken only after making a proper assessment of the latest Covid situation. A state of confusion prevails at the administrative level due to contradictory indications about the pandemic in different parts of the country. “While in Bihar the situation is getting back to normal with a decline in Covid cases, several other states have started showing a rising trend,” he said. Choudhary further pointed out that even though the Indian Council of Medical Research had pleaded for reopening of schools, many scientists and health experts have predicted the possibility of a third wave. “The Delta variant of the virus has very high transmissivity and is deadlier. The government will not risk the lives of children by sending them to schools unless the situation is fully under control,” the minister assured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/univs-may-be-allowed-to-conduct-pending-exams/articleshow/84983085.cms||B K Mishra

The estimate amount required for a road restoration work related to one of the projects had recently peaked from Rs 16 lakh to Rs 3.74 crore, as reported by the Kerala water authority (KWA). In the recently held state-level technical committee meeting, KWA has reported that the amount for road restoration as per technical sanction related to supplying and laying transmission main at Akkulam to connect stilling chamber at Bypass Junction to pumping station at Akkulam was Rs 16.87 lakh. However, as per the actual site conditions, Rs 3.74 crore was required for road restoration. The work has recorded 37% completion. With the increase in road restoration charges, the sanctioned amount was revised from Rs 6.73 crore to 10.03 crore. It has been decided that the corporation shall meet the additional cost from the savings made from 18 stormwater drainage projects, which have been completed. Between December 2018 and March 2019, an amount of Rs 15.51 crore had to be spent on execution of projects under water supply and sewerage and a major share was spent on meeting road cutting and restoration charges. Around 24 works, including laying of transmission main and sewer networks, replacing existing lines, rehabilitation of sewer lines and supply and laying of sewer main, would require road cutting and restoration under Amrut, including the newly constructed NH. Of these, 13 works will require cutting of BM&BC road, which was estimated to cost Rs 5,396.29 per sq m as per the revised rates in 2019. The newly-laid NH road was also included in the list and there are three works for which road cutting needs to be done on NH. This work includes supplying and laying 600mm DI pumping main from pump at Edathara to Sewage treatment plant at Muttathara. Water resources minister Roshy Augustine recently told the assembly that delay in road cutting sanction from NHAI was one of the reasons for the failure in completing projects within the timeline. The project officials said that sanction has now been received for almost all the works. Public works department had fixed the rates for road cutting based on Delhi schedule of rates 2016and all the rates for various categories of road went up by three to four times the old rates. KWA managing director had reported that the time-bound completion of many pipeline works of KWA had been obstructed due to non-availability of road cutting permissions from PWD. The government constituted an empowered committee to ensure that unwanted delays at the field level are avoided and projects are executed in time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/road-restoration-estimate-peaks-for-sewerage-work/articleshow/84986442.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Excerpts: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is emerging as the main player in the opposition camp? What is the Congress strategy?She is a ‘street fighter’. Congress is trying to unite the opposition. Soniaji and Rahulji have taken initiatives in this regard. Besides, it is the ‘political compulsion’ for the opposition to unite against the BJP.

This is despite the fact that the education department had issued funds to the district almost a month ago. Sources attributed the non-payment of salaries to the ad hocism in the district education department ever since the transfer of the DEO in June. The district programme officer (DPO) of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and the DPO (establishment) have also been transferred. Senior DPO, Prabodh Kumar, who has been given additional charge of Buxar DEO, told this reporter on Monday, “The process of salary disbursement can be initiated only after I get financial powers.” The state secretary of the Bihar Primary Teachers’ Association (Gope faction), Nassem Ahmed, claimed that the body had made special efforts to get funds issued by the education department to the districts well before Bakrid. “It seems the non-payment of salaries will ruin other festivals as well,” he lamented. When contacted, the education minister’s OSD, Naveen Kumar, said Vijay Kumar Choudhary had taken cognizance of the issue and instructed the officials concerned to resolve it. “In all likelihood a new DEO will be posted in Buxar in a day or two,” he added. Meanwhile, the DPO of the SSA, Rajendra Prasad Choudhary, who was transferred from Buxar on June 30 along with the DEO, is yet to be relieved from his post. Asked about him, Naveen replied, “Choudhary will also be relieved within a day or two.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/8k-buxar-teachers-rue-delay-in-salaries-for-three-months/articleshow/84979475.cms||K Kamlesh
---||Patna||Manjhi’s son meets UP CM||PATNA: Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) national chief general secretary Santosh Kumar Suman alias Santosh Manjhi met UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Monday at Lucknow in his bid to explore the party’s poll prospects in the coming assembly elections there early next year. Former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and his Suman will be in Delhi on Tuesday to discuss the related matters, sources said. The meeting with Adityanath was the second one that the top HAM(S) leadership had with the top brass of the BJP in the last one month. Earlier, on June 30, Jitan and Suman, who is a minister in the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar, had met Union home minister Amit Shah and other senior BJP leaders in Delhi, spurring the talks that HAM(S) could contest UP assembly elections as part of the NDA. On the surface, HAM(S) has been trying to expand itself in other states. UP is the fifth state where it has been trying to gain a toehold, after Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Tripura. “Suman formally called on the UP CM. HAM(S) has been trying to expand its base to UP and is also in the process of building its organisational structure there, like in four other states. Therefore, a meeting between the two happened,” HAM(S) spokesman Danish Rizwan said and added that nothing was discussed about UP assembly elections. Curiously, since Jitan and Suman met Shah on June 30, HAM(S) appears to be trying to recast itself in the image of the BJP. On Sunday, Suman held a meeting with his party’s UP committee members. The press note drafted in English circulated on the day is revealing. While in Bihar, HAM(S) talks in terms of being a Dalit outfit with core base among the Musahar caste people, the Sunday press note from Lucknow described the party as being of the “common mass”. Further, it stressed on “one nation, one education” as its motto and expressed belief in “socialism”, besides working for the “social, political and cultural upliftment on the ground.” In his meeting with Shah, Jitan had demanded 16% job reservation for Dalits in the private sector, quota in judiciary and the Bharat Ratna award to late Dashrath Manjhi (Mountain Man) from Gaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhis-son-meets-up-cm/articleshow/84979890.cms||Abhay Singh

They also recovered IFCN with a face value of Rs 7.5 lakh and an SUV used in transportation of the notes. Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant told this reporter over the phone that a special team, headed by additional SP (west) Syed Imran Masood, was set up to track a family travelling by an SUV. “The cops intercepted the vehicle between Motipur and Motihari. Initially Mahto tried to mislead them by saying he was travelling with his wife and two children and had no connection with the IFCN racket,” the SSP said, adding that Mahto’s relative Raja Singh used to send him papers for printing the notes from Nepal. Mahto, a resident of Patahi in East Champaran district, had been involved in the illegal activity for the last six months. He used to print the notes at his native village, which is close to the India-Nepal border. The SHO of Motipur police station Anil Kumar said raids were conducted at Majorganj in Sitamarhi district and some suspected hideouts of Mahto’s gang members in East Champaran and Muzaffarpur districts. “Police also arrested Mahto’s wife Sunita Devi and their two children,” he added. Police did not rule out the use of the seized consignment of the IFCN in the upcoming panchayat polls. An investigation officer claimed, “No connection of the arrested people with any terror outfit operating in India or abroad has been confirmed so far.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fake-currency-racket-busted-in-muzaffarpur-9-held/articleshow/84979699.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kolkata||West bengal: Transgender turf war claims one in Nimta||KOLKATA: A transgender person was arrested on Monday after a 35-year-old eunuch group leader was gunned down by bike-borne miscreants in Nimta on Sunday night. Cops suspect this was the fallout of a turf war between two groups. Victim Sumana Dhar was shot thrice while on her way home from Titagarh. Dhar was the leader of around 25 eunuchs residing at Nimta’s Sabitri Pally who were operating in the Nimta-Belgharia-Sodepur area. According to sources, the Nimta group developed a rivalry with a Titagarh group over control of the Titagarh-Khardah area. Dhar’s colleague Payel Roy said supari killers were engaged to kill her. Roy alleged Dhar was being targeted by members of the Titagarh group as she had built up a healthy relationship with some eunuchs in Titagarh. On Monday, accused Sheikh Ladla was arrested from a Titagarh hideout. “We suspect a rivalry between two groups of transgenders over control of the area could have led to the murder. A transgender person was arrested and produced in court,” said Ajoy Prasad, DCP, South Zone, Barrackpore Commissionerate. Ladla has been remanded in police custody for five days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hijra-turf-war-claims-one-transperson-held/articleshow/84986257.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

The state government has taken this decision in view of the threat of the third wave. Recently, the state sentence review board had recommended the release of these life convicts who had good conduct. The board is headed by home secretary and the secretary of the board is the judicial secretary. Senior police officers of Kolkata and Bengal along with ADG (prisons ) are members of the board. All these convicts have completed 14 years in jail, said an official. Among the 63 life convicts, 61 are male and two are female. The females with age over 55 years and males who were over 60 years were considered for the release. An official said that the convicts were released under Section 432 of CrPC as the state government has the power to suspend or remit the sentence of the convicts and allow them premature release. ADG (prisons) Peeyush Pandey said they were released keeping in mind the age of the convicts and their conduct in prison. Earlier, in May 2020, around 3,000 inmates were released on bail or parole by the state government to decongest the jails.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/63-lifers-released-to-decongest-prisons/articleshow/84986173.cms||---
---||Kolkata||RCTC plans tree audit to assess green loss at Russell Street plot||Kolkata: Royal Calcutta Turf Club, which owns the 156 cottah plot on 11, Russell Street, on Monday expressed shock and dismay at the way the green cover was destroyed on the premises. It will conduct a tree audit to assess the loss. The property was leased out to a developer in 2007, apparently for building a hotel without harming the trees and grade-I heritage club house on the premises. The Calcutta High Court on July 26 ordered the real estate group or its representative to pay Rs 40 crore within 15 days and plant 100 trees to drop prosecution for illegally felling 62 trees on a plot. RCTC, in an official statement released through a committee member, said, “The news came as a bolt from the blue. In its 175th year, nothing can be sadder than the news that ancient trees on premises owned by the club have been axed. RCTC has always stood for the cause of environment protection and beautification and though the Russell Street premises have been leased out to a private developer, it is understood the trees inside will be protected.” “The developer has not kept its promise of a deadline of the project and a communication is on about whether they would continue with it. Since the property had been leased out, RCTC has not kept vigil. Hence it will launch an investigation about how many trees were chopped. There are club seniors who are aware of which tree stood where. A tree audit report will be prepared by the club before it seeks an explanation from the developer. If the latter had engaged in cutting trees, it would be separately dealt with since such loss cannot be quantified in terms of money,” the statement said. A TOI visit to the premises revealed the club building in need of renovation and the garden was overgrown. There used to be six guards in each shift, but now there are just two. “The garden was cleaned a few years ago. We don’t know if trees were felled,” said a guard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rctc-plans-tree-audit-to-assess-green-loss-at-russell-street-plot/articleshow/84986145.cms||---
---||Patna||Devotees throng Singheshwar Sthan in Bihar's Madhepura||MADHEPURA: Hundreds of devotees thronged the famous Lord Shiva temple at Singheshwar Sthan in Madhepura on the second Somvari of the holy month of Shravan to worship the deity from outside. They offered milk, water, flowers and ‘belpatras’ at the entrance gate of the temple as it remained closed. It may be mentioned here that Singheshwar Sthan temple was closed on April 9 after the second wave of Covid-19 hit the state. Even small vendors were seen busy selling puja materials near the temple premises. The local administration had to deploy police forces to regulate the crowd, which had gathered outside the temple. The temple trust also swung into action and deputed volunteers to clean the flowers and ‘belpatras’ offered at the entrance gate. Most of the devotees also violated the Covid norms and did not wear masks and flouted the social distancing norms. “Festivals are an important part of our culture. Coronavirus can’t dampen my spirit,” Raghuveer, a devotee who visited the temple, said. However, Rajeev Singh, a resident of the locality was taken aback to see crowds gathered there. “I was shocked when I saw people not following the Covid-19 rules.” Local vendors, who thrive on their traditional business around the shrine area, had made a fervent appeal to the local administration to permit the month-long Shrawani Mela to be held this year as the number of Covid cases has plunged to zero in this district. But their hopes were shattered when the SDM, who is the ex-officio president of the temple trust said, “The closure would continue according to the state government directive till August 6.” “We are facing a tough time ever since the first Covid wave surfaced last year,” said Bambam Thakur, who used to sell flowers on the temple premises. “Lagaichhay eho sawan unahi gujartay (This Sawan will pass like the previous one),” he added. Jamun Malakar and Santosh Mandal, who also used to sell flowers and garlands near Singheshwar Sthan, had borrowed money to feed their family members on promise that they will pay back the amount in Shrawan. “Unfortunately, we will not be unable to pay back the amount as we do not have any other source of income,” Mandal said. In fact, this iconic Lord Shiva temple draws thousands of devotees from Mithila, Kosi and Simanchal region and neighbouring country Nepal every year on the occasion of Shravani Mela. The world-famous Mela is organised in the months of July and August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/devotees-throng-singheshwar-sthan-on-somvari/articleshow/84979370.cms||Deo Narayan Saha

The cases of land disputes and matters of utter negligence by the block-level officers are continuously pouring in at the janata darbar. Majority of the matters are related to negligence by the officers of the circle office and local police stations. It has also surfaced that the orders by the public grievance redressal officers under the Bihar Right to Public Grievance Redressal Act-2015 are not being executed by the officers concerned. People are complaining that the circle officers are not executing the orders,” Nitish told the chief secretary. The CM also pointed out that a committee headed by then chief secretary was constituted in 2018 to look into the issues and disputes related to Bhoodan movement land. “Till date, the report of that committee has not been submitted,” Nitish said. He further asked the chief secretary to review as to what work the committee has done so far and what kind of progress the committee has made so far. The CM heard the grievances of 153 visitors from different districts and issued instant instructions to the officials concerned. Cases related to the general administration department, home, revenue and land reforms, prohibition, excise and registration, vigilance and mines and geology departments were heard by the CM during the programme. A youth from Muzaffarpur complained that no work was executed without paying money as bribe in the office of DCLR and land registrar. Employees at the registrar office demand even up to Rs10,000 for providing certified copies of land records. “When I told the employees that I am going to complain to the CM, they taunted and said nothing adverse would happen against them even if I go to the PM office to complain against them,” the youth said and also alleged that the registrar office employees even make unsavoury remarks against the CM. Hearing the youth’s complaint, the CM expressed displeasure and asked the additional chief secretary (revenue and land reforms) to conduct a thorough probe into the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/people-complain-to-nitish-about-rampant-corruption-in-offices/articleshow/84980455.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Covid-19 in Kolkata: Night violations, repeat offenders worry cops||KOLKATA: The increasing trend of repeat offenders being prosecuted for violating the 9pm-5am curbs is becoming a concern for police. The numbers in the past week are probably an indication of the problem. On Sunday, the police prosecuted 1,733 violators in a two-hour drive between 9pm and 11pm. On Saturday, the numbers had hit a record 1,745 — the highest night prosecutions since the pandemic hit last year. On Friday, there were 1,073 prosecutions. The weekend prosecution — 4,551 — is also one of the highest in the past two months since easing of restrictions. In fact, for the entire week, the city police consistently prosecuted over a thousand people. The only exception was Thursday night when pouring rain forced cops to call off the checks. Even then, 285 motorists were found violating the norms. Even the local police ended up prosecuting over 2,500 others for violating night curbs. Cops say what was worrying was that the violations were not restricted to commercial and popular eating joints of the city alone, like Park Street or Park Circus. Instead, most repeat offenders were covering longer distances, and even guards situated on the periphery, like Ultadanga, and in added areas like Garia and Tiljala — 102 cases in all — witnessed a high number of cases. TimesViewViolations of Covid protocols need to be dealt with sternly. Violators are not putting only themselves at risk; they are exposing the entire community to greater danger.On Sunday, yet again, it was the south, southeast and east guards which witnessed the maximum violations. Between them, they cover the majority of south Kolkata between Park Street and Ballygunge-Gariahat. As many as 325 motorists were prosecuted in this zone. Even Ultadanga traffic guard became a major contributor to prosecutions by recording 112 cases. Senior officers at Lalbazar and OCs at traffic guards said repeat offenders are not aware of the difference between normal traffic prosecutions and penal prosecutions because these prosecutions are being done during naka checks. Police prosecutions under penal sections are forwarded to courts. Only the court can dismiss the charges. Till then, pending penal cases reflect against an individual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/night-violations-repeat-offenders-worry-cops/articleshow/84986135.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

So far, banks were enjoying the float, where they used the fund in those two days. With this move, we can instantly use the money credited and earn interest on the same,” Arulselvan D, CFO at Cholamandalam Investment & Finance said.Reeju Datta, co-founder of payment platform Cashfree says with RTGS becoming 24x7 recently, these new rules mean that customers will no longer have to wait for a bank working day for their salary, subsidy transfer, dividend payout or pension to be credited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/now-get-salary-pension-credited-on-sundays-and-bank-holidays/articleshow/84986617.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Badshah is likely to challenge the verdict in high court. The Alipore court on Saturday held Badshah guilty under various penal sections, including murder. While the judge was hearing the last submissions before announcing the punishment, Badshah tried to bring up his physical handicap and t that he had four children. Public prosecutor Tamal Mukherjee, however, pleaded that Badshah, having been convicted of murder, should be hanged since the hooch tragedy fell within the ambit of “rarest of rare” cases. Judge Pushpal Satpathi took a 10-minute break after hearing both sides before delivering the judgement.  Tanima Bewa, who lost her husband in the incident, or Md Ghiasuddin and Kashinath Ghosh, who lost their sight, said they had expected Badshah to be hanged. “My children are barely surviving from the little I can earn. Badshah has taken everything from me. At least, he cannot come out of jail now,” said Tanima.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/khora-badshah-gets-life-for-2011-hooch-deaths/articleshow/84986151.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

He accompanied the old couple to their house on Saturday and gave them the possession of their rooms that were locked by their only son. Arun then verified prima facie the allegations that the old couple was allegedly assaulted by their son and his wife and ordered an FIR against them and sent them to jail. The incident came to light on Sunday after the video of police action went viral on social media. Two months ago, Anil Kumar Sharma of K Colony had a dispute with his son Abhishek and daughter-in-law over some issue. After which his son and daughter-in-law allegedly beat him up. The elderly couple had filed a case against their son and daughter-in-law at Chakeri police station. Even after this, their harassment by the son and daughter-in-law did not stop. For one reason or the other, the elderly couple were harassed by their son and daughter-in-law. Troubled by the harassment, they also complained to the police and DCP East but all in vain. Two days ago, the son and daughter-in-law again allegedly beat them up and pushed them out of the house. Not only this, they put locks in both the rooms after packing their belongings. The aggrieved couple approached the police commissioner. On Saturday, the police commissioner called the elderly couple to his camp office and took them to their house. He got the locks of their rooms open in front of him. After this, he had sent their son Abhishek and daughter-in-law in police custody for assaulting the elderly couple. Late on the same night, the Chakeri police booked the son and daughter-in-law under the section of breach of peace and on Sunday produced them in the court and sent them to three-day judicial custody. “This is a lesson for all those who misbehave with their parents. . In this case, though a case had been lodged against the son and daughter-in-law, they did not mend their ways. Now, they have been arrested and sent to jail under the section of breach of peace. If a similar complaint is received, strict action will be taken,” said Arun on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/city-police-chief-comes-to-rescue-of-elderly-couple-harassed-by-son/articleshow/84988838.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

After the child went missing, his parents in Punjab had reported it to the local police, but they were unable to find him due to which the case was eventually closed. The boy’s father, unable to bear the trauma of losing his only child, became unwell and died a couple of months ago. The teenager managed to get on a train, which brought him to Jodhpur, where with the help of pictures he conveyed that he hailed from Punjab and was taken there by officials of Rajasthan child commission and handed over to his mother.Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights (RSCPCR) chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, “Gopi was brought to the shelter in Jodhpur in July 2020 and for the first few months, he did not divulge much information about himself. Gradually, he opened up and started sharing details and when we showed him pictures, we figured that he is from Punjab and we got in touch with our counterparts in the other state, but their response was lukewarm.” Following a counselling session, the officials decided that the best way to find the boy’s family was to send him to Punjab with child panel’s team. “He had identified places like the Golden Temple and the bus stand at Attari in Punjab. When he reached there, he further recognised more places and eventually it was found that he hailed from a village in Tarn Taran. The village including his mother had been searching for him though unfortunately when the cops could not find him, his father lost the will to live and died couple of months ago,” added Beniwal. Officials found that while his parents did not allow him to go anywhere alone, a village foreman under false pretext took Gopi along with him and made the boy work for an entire day in July last year. Following this, the boy was in a dilemma whether to go back home or not and decided to instead board a train from where he landed in Jodhpur. The RSCPCR team which went to Punjab is getting further details from their counterpart as well as the local police before heading back to Jodhpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/punjab-teen-with-disabilities-reunited-with-mom-after-1-yr/articleshow/84988671.cms||---

The health department officials said the number of people yet to take the second dose of Covaxin is relatively low. They admitted that since the second wave of the pandemic has currently ebbed in Nashik, there is some laxity among beneficiaries who are no longer fearful of contracting the infection. As a result, many are either unwilling to take the second dose or are procrastinating. “Thanks to the availability of vaccine doses, the rate of inoculation has currently increased — but mostly for first dose beneficiaries. However, there is still some concern about completion of second dose vaccinations,” said Dr Kailas Bhoye, the Nashik taluka health officer. “We have allotted more centres for those who are scheduled to take their second dose after completing the mandatory wait period. We want more people to forth get fully vaccinated,” said Ravindra Chaudhari, the additional district health officer. The health department is also trying to ensure that a maximum number of people get fully vaccinated before the third wave of the pandemic starts. “When people are fully vaccinated, they will be in a better position to fight off the infection as the vaccine would cut down the criticality of the disease. We are, therefore, appealing to the masses and contacting the beneficiaries through the ASHA workers so that the people get their second doses,” Chaudhari added. Those who are yet to take the second dose also include healthcare and frontline workers. There are a few people who contracted the infection after the first dose and, therefore, have to wait for some time before taking the second dose. However, others have no such reason. “People are now getting casual since the number of infections has gone down. Almost all patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Even the critical patients or casualties are now mostly those with comorbid conditions,” Bhoye said, adding that people should not take the matter lightly and get vaccinated at the earliest. As of now, in Nashik district, 19.2 lakh people have got the shots. Of them, 4.8 lakh are fully vaccinated and 14.3 have got just the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/73000-due-for-2nd-covishield-dose-yet-to-take-the-jabs-in-nashik-dist/articleshow/84984237.cms||Abhilash Botekar

While discharging all five persons accused under Sections 376 and 114 of IPC, the court has ordered them to be charged under Section 417 of the IPC for cheating and deception. In this case, the woman had lodged an FIR with Navrangpura police in 2015 against three persons, one of them for having physical relationship with her by making a false promise of marriage. More than three years later, when the person did not marry her, she found out that he was already married and had two children. He had even changed his name. Other persons, the friends of the main accused, were also accused of abetment in the crime of rape. The police filed a chargesheet and two sessions cases were instituted against the accused. They filed a discharge application and argued that nowhere had the victim stated that the physical relationship was a forced one. No case can be made under Section 376 of IPC because there was no allegation of force involved. It was a consensual relationship between the two persons. Moreover, the woman also knew about the real name of the principal accused because when they stayed in a city-based hotel, the real name of the accused was mentioned in the register. After hearing the discharge plea, the court said that there is no allegation of forcing the victim into sexual intercourse with the accused. “…this court is of the opinion that even if allegations made are assumed to be true, no offence punishable under Section 376 IPC can be said to be made out as against the applicants. Significantly, the allegation of concealing the real name of accused or his marital status as against the applicants would bring the said ommission within the purview of offence punishable Section 417 IPC,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-discharges-rape-accused-orders-trial-for-cheating/articleshow/84987930.cms||Saeed Khan

According to RJD sources, the meeting was held at Misa Bharti’s bungalow which is opposite Akhilesh Yadav’s bungalow. After the meeting, Lalu shared several photos of the meeting on his official twitter handle in which the duo can be seen sipping tea and holding hands. Lalu wrote that their concern is for the same issues like farmers, poor, uneducated and unemployed. “Met the senior most socialist friend of the country, Sri Mulayam Singh Ji, to know about his well-being. Farmland, farmers, uneducated, poor and unemployed are our common concerns which we are fighting for,” reads a part of the tweet shared by Lalu. In another paragraph, he wrote, “The country does not need capitalism and communalism, it is in dire need of equality and socialism.” Apart from the two veteran leaders, Mulayam’s son and former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav was also present at the meet. In fact, Akhilesh had also shared the photos of the meeting on his twitter handle. The meetings, ahead of UP elections, have given rise to speculations. However, RJD sources said that both Lalu and Mulayam are relatives and it was a family get-together. Last Wednesday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar also held a meeting with Lalu at Misa’s bungalow. The meeting was organised a day after NCP announced its alliance with the SP for the upcoming UP assembly elections. However, Pawar tweeted that he met his old colleague only to inquire about his health.

Parents of seven out of 10 children who responded to the survey said they are not ready for offline classes for their children. Across India, this number was even higher. Parental consent is a must for students to attend physical schools. Schools across the country have been shut since March last year due to the pandemic. States like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh welcomed back higher secondary students to schools last month. The online survey conducted last month by LocalCircles, a community social media platform, across tier 1, 2, and 3 districts in the country found that ‘lack of vaccination’ was the biggest concern among parents. In June, when a similar survey was conducted, 37% of parents spoke of vaccinating students before sending them to school. “The third wave targeting children and the government’s plans to vaccinate those aged 12 and above may be the reason for a 11% jump in parents wanting vaccination before physical schools,” said chairperson and founder Sachin Taparia. The survey found that parents would like schools to vaccinate children. The survey received feedback from 32,000 parents from 361 districts across the country. In Maharashtra, schools in rural areas free of Covid are open for classes 8-12. IIT professors, doctors and parents last month wrote to the chief minister of a few states to setup a task force to look into reopening of schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/parents-want-kids-to-study-online-and-bunk-physical-school-for-now-in-mumbai/articleshow/84991762.cms||Sandhya Nair

KSHRC chairman Justice Antony Dominic has sought the superintendent to submit a written report on the issue within four weeks. In the complaint filed before the commission by Jose Y Das and Najeeb Basheer, it is stated that there was a shortage of medicines required for newborn babies. Also, the hospital lacks medicines and medical supplies that cater to the treatment of infants in ventilator. As the hospital pharmacy doesn’t have these things, people are forced to buy medicines and medical supplies from outside medical shops at a hefty price. And these medicines cannot be purchased with the aid of medical assistance schemes, as these are not available at Karunya pharmacy, the complaint said. Hospital denies report: Meanwhile, the hospital authorities have denied the reports suggesting the shortage of drugs. Dr Susan Uthuppu, hospital superintendent in charge, said: “It was unfortunate to portray the prescription to avail free medicines through various schemes as a prescription to get medicine from private medical stores.’’ According to the hospital authorities, the required medicines were being given on time for both the children undergoing treatments in the ICU and wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rights-panel-seeks-report-from-sat-superintendent/articleshow/84986465.cms||---

The region received a record 5,493 complaints of online frauds in just six months of 2021 as compared to 8,292 complaints in 2020 and 5,000 in 2019. Following the sharp increase in such cases, the ADG (Agra zone) has planned to launch a 62-day cyber awareness campaign for eight districts on Tuesday. Talking to TOI, ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna said that with 28 sessions, the 62-day campaign will focus on major aspects of cyber safety through hour-long interactive live programs on YouTube channel and Zoom, where experts from Cyber Peace Foundation (CPS) will make people aware on how to deal and avoid being victims of such crimes. “Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerabilities of cyberspace, which can only be dealt with awareness and that is the reason why we have facilitated this program,” the ADG said. The official said that cybercriminals are taking advantage of panic and confusion in the society due to Covid-19 and this campaign will help the common man.

---||Lucknow||This year’s ‘August Kranti’ to feed 15cr in UP||Lucknow: Call it an auspicious date or favourable planetary positions, August 5 has been crucial in the BJP’s scheme of things in the past two years – be it scrapping of Article 370 in 2019 or laying the foundation stone of Ram Temple in Ayodhya in 2020. This year, too, the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Yogi Adityanath government in the state are set to launch the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana in the state on August 5. While some political analysts term it as the ‘August Revolution’ of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as all its big plans were executed on August 5, others call it BJP’s bid to start a new political discourse. However, political scientist Ashutosh Misra believes that though an interesting observation, it is nothing but reading too much into the move. The ambitious food grain distribution scheme aims at providing free ration to 80 crore people across the country, including 15 crore in Uttar Pradesh. Food grain will be distributed among 80 lakh beneficiaries from at least 80,000 fair price shops in UP on Day one. CM Yogi Adityanath has termed the free ration distribution as ‘anna mahotsav’. BJP MPs, MLAs and workers have been asked to visit local fair price shops and put up hoardings and banners with messages thanking the PM and the CM. The same day, the PM will also interact with public representatives present at price shops, through video conferencing. During interaction, the beneficiaries will share their experiences of the ration distribution system and how it changed their lives amid the coronavirus pandemic. At least 100 beneficiaries will be invited at each fair price shop who will be given free ration in 25kg bags. The CM has directed the officials to ensure transparency in distribution, for which a nodal officer will be appointed at each shop. Officials have been asked to install television sets at various locations so that maximum people can get guidance from the Prime Minister. To help migrants, poor and underprivileged sections of the society tide over the hardships of the pandemic, the government is providing free 5 kg food grain (3kg wheat and 2kg rice) to over 15 crore beneficiaries in the state under PMGKAY. To reduce the woes of marginalized sections and to ensure that no one sleeps hungry, the state government has distributed approximately 100 lakh MT free food grain since the first wave of coronavirus pandemic. As per the CM’s directives, the distribution was carried out through PoS devices with biometric Aadhaar and dealer authentication in a transparent manner. The state government has distributed around 76,39,379 MT of free food grain under PMGKAY and about 23,60,402 MT free ration separately, which is ‘over and above’ the distribution under PMGKAY. The total distribution amounts to 100 lakh MT. Distribution by the state government continued from April to June in 2020, while in 2021, the government announced distribution to be carried out for the months of June, July and August. There are 1,30,07,969 units of beneficiaries under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana and over 13,41,77,983 units under priority household cardholders, 43,572 cardholders in other states and 6,616 cardholders from other states took ration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/this-years-august-kranti-to-feed-15cr-in-up/articleshow/84990662.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

Police have also identified three more involved in stealing of the goats and the murder. According to the police, the assailants killed two persons identified as Krishna Kumar (35) and Rajesh (37), who were sleeping in the farm on Sunday. “We were sure that it was a clear case of murder for gain, as marks of struggle were found on their body.

With the help of some local inputs, we have arrested five persons in this connection so far,” said a senior officer of Churu police on Monday.

---||Kochi||Min: Will act after getting probe report||Thiruvananthapuram: The local self-government department is awaiting report from urban affairs director on the controversy surrounding Attukal pongala waste management. LSG minister M V Govindan told the assembly on July 28 in reply to a question by Congress leader Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan that the allegation has come to the notice of state government. “The government has asked the urban affairs director to conduct a detailed probe into the matter. The report is yet to be received. Further action will be taken upon receiving the report,” the minister said in the assembly. Sources in urban affairs directorate said that the report filed by city corporation secretary has been scrutinized and that further inquiry needs to be done before a final report can be submitted. In June, the demand of BJP for vigilance probe into pongala waste management was rejected through voting during the special council. Fifty-four councillors opted against vigilance probe while 33 councillors of BJP were in favour of vigilance probe. Thirteen councillors of UDF did not take part in voting. BJP demanded a special council after an agenda came up in the council meeting about ratifying the anticipatory sanction given by mayor Arya Rajendran for taking 21 trucks on rent at a cost of over Rs 3 lakh for cleaning works related to Attukal pongala. BJP mainly centred their allegations around two demands — there should be a vigilance probe into the waste management during pongala and that the agenda may be passed only after clearance from local fund audit department. The mayor said contrary to the allegation that only 60 workers were deployed on pongala day, there were 395 workers in various health circles on duty. The city corporation had in May completed a high-level internal inquiry to the circumstances which led to corporation availing the service of 21 trucks for the removal of pongala waste. When the tender file was first prepared in December, it was mentioned that around 50 trucks were required. Later it was revised to 35 and then to 20. The corporation secretary also suggested that 10 trucks may be arranged on call basis if at all requirement arises for waste management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/min-will-act-after-getting-probe-report/articleshow/84986505.cms||---

Additional sessions judge Kuldeep Narayan said releasing the accused, Suraj, on bail would give a wrong message to the society. “From the FIR it is apparent that motorcycle of the complainant was looted in broad daylight from public place and during that the complainant and his father were also beaten,” the court said in its order.

With addition of these six schools, the total number of schools that have been closed by the ZP has now gone up to 13. The schools in rural parts of the district were allowed to hold classes on campus for students from Std VIII to XII only if there was no active case of Covid-19 for the past 30 days. “As per primary information four more schools were asked to close down in Sinnar from Monday. The number of such schools in the taluka has increased to six. Four villages reported fresh Covid cases forcing us to take the action,” Manisha Pingalkar, extension officer of secondary department of Nashik Zilla Parishad, said. Two schools in the taluka were closed earlier after teaching, non-teaching staff and a student tested positive for the infection. The RT-PCR reprots of other students in the schools have come out as negative. Similarly, in Niphad, two schools were closed down after the RT-PCR reports of six teachers tested positive. Till date, eight teachers, three non-teaching staff and two students have been tested positive for Covid-19 across the district. As many as 332 schools out of 852 had shown interest to start the physical classes for students from Std VIII to XII. Since July 19, a total of 224 schools had started the classes on campus with focus on physical distancing, personal hygiene. Of the total of 60,337 students enrolled, around 31,000 students were attending the schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/6-more-nashik-zp-schools-told-to-shut-down-due-to-new-cases/articleshow/84984312.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Flush with doses, private hospitals seek nod to cater to districts||MUMBAI: Faced with shrinking demand within the city, some private hospitals have sought a go-ahead to vaccinate outside Mumbai where private coverage is scarce. Paid vaccination in Mumbai has seen a 41% drop in demand in July compared to June. Dr Sanjay Kapote, director of Apollo Clinic, believes private hospitals that have doses and the resources should be allowed to spread the net. The chain, he said, has got several requests from Raigad and Ratnagiri. But since the hospital is registered for vaccination in Mumbai, it cannot set up camps outside the city. “We have around 10,000 doses with us currently. If we are given permission, we can vaccinate people in the peripheral regions of Mumbai. After all, vaccination will work only with maximum coverage,” said Kapote. Another hospital head said they had to turn down several requests from Alibaug. “There is a master vaccination ID that is generated for centres who want to operate in Mumbai. That cannot be used outside the jurisdiction,” he said, adding that they had to decline or advise the Alibaug residents to travel to Mumbai. In May and June, private hospitals from Mumbai were flooded with calls from other districts. However, since these had their hands full with corporate and housing society tie-ups, not many showed keenness to travel to other districts. Now many are willing to reconsider with hundreds of their slots going begging every day. A civic official said according to rules, a private Covid vaccination centre registered to vaccinate in Mumbai cannot hold drives elsewhere with the same ID number. “It will mess with the data process since the ID is used to count vaccinations done in particular corporations and districts,” the official said. BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said if the local corporation generates a new ID, hospitals should be able to operate. Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana Group, said they were given special IDs when they set up a camp in Ratnagiri in May. However, they couldn’t vaccinate in Khopoli or other places due to this rule. “One solution is for the Mumbai hospital to tie up with a local hospital in that district and use their ID to vaccinate,” he said. Private hospitals in Maharashtra have picked up the highest volume of vaccine doses, but they are largely concentrated in a few districts, including Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik and Kolhapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-flush-with-doses-pvt-hosps-seek-nod-to-cater-to-dists/articleshow/84988770.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Total testing in Navi Mumbai, which has a population of about 15 lakh, breached the 14-lakh mark on Monday, including 8.2 lakh rapid antigen tests (RAT) and 5.9 lakh RT-PCR tests. NMMC’s 2.16 lakh tests in July is second only to its April tally of 2.23 lakh tests at the peak of the second wave. The RAT tests are high as nodal health officials of the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) have been carrying out random tests with an eye on the possible third wave. The satellite city reported just 30 cases on Monday, the lowest in 15 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/navi-mumbai-ran-2l-tests-in-july-daily-cases-down-to-30-on-mon/articleshow/84988798.cms||B B Nayak
---||Ahmedabad||Yellow metal imports down 75% in July||AHMEDABAD: As the demand for gold and gold jewellery continued to remain muted and the exchange of gold 666increases, imports of the yellow metal declined by 75% in July. About 0.93 metric tonnes (MT) of gold was imported into Gujarat in July, according to the data compiled by the Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex (AACC), down 75% against 3.72MT in the same month last year. “Liquidity issues in the market have been rampant since the second wave of Covid-19 and people are not spending on luxury commodities such as gold,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). Acharya added: “People are saving money for medical emergencies.”  Acharya went on to say: “Moreover, the monsoon has been relatively weak due to which the buying sentiment has not yet picked up despite the festival season being around the corner.” Gold prices stood at Rs 49,600 per 10 gram on Monday in the Ahmedabad market. Jewellers suggest that the demand for gold ornaments is off to a very slow start. “We do get orders for weddings scheduled after Diwali. However, at least 50% of the transactions are done in exchange of old gold,” said Manoj Soni, a city-based jeweller. “For instance, if someone is investing in 100g of gold, at least 50g of old gold will be exchanged. This reflects the overall weak spending capacity of consumers.” Industry players said that people have sold off a lot of gold to meet cash requirements for medical and other emergency expenses. TOI recently had reported IBJA estimates of 22MT of gold being sold off to meet cash needs since the pandemic. “Due to this, more gold has accumulated with stockists and jewellers, and therefore, the overall volume of imports is low,” said an Ahmedabad-based jeweller. Most orders that jewellers fulfilled over the past two months were pending ones from before the lockdown. Fresh purchases are limited, said jewellers. Even the demand for bullion has decreased. “Gold prices have stabilized at about Rs 49,500 per 10 gram at present. However, people are still in the wait-and-watch mode, expecting prices to plunge further,” said an Ahmedabad-based bullion trader. “Also, many investors are increasingly going for digital gold, that is, sovereign gold bonds as well as gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) due to which physical volume of gold imported is low.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/yellow-metal-imports-down-75-in-july/articleshow/84986567.cms||Niyati Parikh

Dr Kafeel, a paediatrician was suspended from service on August 22, 2017, from BRD Medical College following the death of about 60 infants in the hospital due to lack of oxygen. Hearing a writ petition filed by Dr Kafeel, Justice Yashwant Varma on July 29 directed to list this case on August 5 for the next hearing. In the present writ petition, the petitioner Dr Kafeel has challenged an order of suspension dated August 22, 2017. An additional challenge has also been made to an order of February 24, 2020 passed by the disciplinary authority, which has while accepting the report submitted by the enquiry officer in part dissented with the findings returned by the enquiry officer in respect of two charges and directed a further enquiry to be conducted. Earlier, the petitioner approached this court by filing a writ (no-3511 of 2019) on the ground that although he had been suspended way back in the year 2017, yet the enquiry proceedings had not been concluded till the filing of that petition. Acting on this writ petition, the court by an order dated March 7, 2019 disposed of the writ petition with a direction to the respondents to conclude the enquiry within three months. Pursuant to that direction of the high court, the enquiry officer submitted his report on April 15, 2019. Thereafter, the disciplinary authority chose to pass the order under challenge after almost 11 months. Taking note of this, the court observed, “The delay in taking further action on the part of the disciplinary authority is not explained. The respondents are also obliged to justify the continuance of the order of suspension which has continued for more than four years”. It was also contended by the petitioner that as many as eight persons were suspended along with him in this oxygen shortage case, but all of them have been reinstated except the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-govt-reply-in-dr-kafeelswrit-petition-against-his-suspension/articleshow/84989027.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Indoor & outdoor sports opens; theatres, multiplexes stay shut||MUMBAI: With Covid cases reducing, the Maharashtra government eased curbs on Monday for the bulk of the state except 11 districts including Pune. In a boost for the retail sector, the BMC has allowed shops in Mumbai barring those inside malls to stay open on all days till 10 pm. Medical shops can remain open for 24 hours through the week. However, there is no major relief for hotels and restaurants in the city except that they can now be open till 4 pm on all days for dining in, including weekends. So far, they were allowed to raise their shutters only on weekdays. Movie halls and multiplexes have not been granted any concessions, nor have places of worship. However, the BMC has allowed indoor and outdoor sports barring the operation of swimming pools and other sporting activities involving close contact. It has also allowed film shootings in Mumbai in compliance with Covid norms and within prescribed timings. Earlier, a few members of the Maharashtra cabinet including deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and public health minister Rajesh Tope had indicated that government would ease curbs to a greater degree for restaurants, malls and multiplexes, but the final order held no such prospect. The hotel sector is upset with the decision. “We are being singled out and a vicious campaign is being run against us. We find no logic in not extending restaurant timings till 11pm at least,” said Shivanand Shetty, president of the Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association. Retailers were relieved. “We will ensure our staff is fully vaccinated and are hopeful that this decision in taken in Thane as well,” said Viren Shah from the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association. In its order, the state government relaxed curbs in 22 of the 36 districts including Nagpur, Aurangabad and Nasik while it allowed civic bodies to decide on lifting restrictions in three other districts: Mumbai city, Mumbai suburban and Thane. The relaxations for 22 districts include increased timings for shops, malls, gymnasiums and parlours. Both government and private offices have been allowed to function at full capacity. Restaurants have been allowed to function with 50% capacity till 4 pm on weekdays. However, cinema theatres, drama theatres and multiplexes (including those inside malls) have to remain closed. Places of worship too will continue to remain out of bounds. And restrictions will continue on birthday celebrations, political social and cultural events, elections, election campaigning, rallies and protest marches. BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal’s directive said Mumbai has a positivity rate of 1.76% and oxygen bed occupancy of 18.97%. This puts the city in the lowest range among districts classified on the basis of the two parameters. The decision on lifting restrictions in Thane district, which includes Navi Mumbai and Kalyan Dombivali, will be taken on Tuesday. The state has not relaxed restrictions in 11 districts reporting a relatively higher positivity rate. These include Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Pune, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Beed, Raigad and Palghar. The local disaster management authorities have been allowed to impose “effective restrictions” in Sindhudurg, Satara and Ahmednagar since the positivity rate is high and there is a greater emergence of fresh cases.

---||Varanasi||HoD, others booked on charge of student’s murder in DDU Varsity||Revised Gorakhpur: Barely two days after body of a female student of home science department of DDU Gorakhpur University was found hanging in a storeroom of the university on Saturday, police on Monday registered a case of murder against the head of the department and her associates on the written complaint of the student’s father. The body of the 24-year-old student, Priyanka Kumari, was also cremated on Monday by her family. Though initially the police and the university administration claimed it to be a case of suicide, a case of murder was registered on the written complaint filed by the deceased student’s father Vinod Kumar, who raised several questions: “Why were the girl’s feet touching the ground? Why were her clothes soiled in dust and mud? Why were her sandals lying away from the body in the room?” Her father also claimed that he saw injury on her head and her wrist watch was missing. “On the basis of the written complaint given to us by Priyanka Kumari’s father Vinod Kumar, a resident of Shivpur in Shahbazganj, a case under section 302 (murder) of IPC has been registered against the head of the department of home science of DDU Gorakhpur University and also against her assistants,” SP City Sonam Kumar told TOI on Monday. Giving further details, SSP Gorakhpur Dinesh Kumar P said, “The postmortem of the deceased was conducted by a panel of two doctors and was video-graphed. As per the autopsy report, the cause of death is due to asphyxia as a result of antemortem hanging. However, on the request of the family, a panel of five doctors constituted by the chief medical officer (CMO) will review the video of the postmortem. Circle officer Chauri Chaura has been instructed to conduct an impartial probe and submit a report at the earliest.” Meanwhile, the death of the student under mysterious circumstances triggered a row with student wings of various political parties, including Congress and Samajwadi Party (SP), Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and local BJP MLA Radha Mohan Das Agarwal demanding justice for the family of the student. Congress party youth wing leader Manish Ojha demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) while Agarwal visited the home of the deceased student. He claimed that she was murdered and tweeted that he had “explained the postmortem report to the family that she died of an antemortem injury and suffocation, and asked the family to lodge an FIR so that murder accused could be arrested”. Priyanka’s body was found hanging with a ‘dupatta’ (scarf) in a store room of the university on Saturday. A BSc third year student, she had gone to the university to appear in an examination. Though police had claimed that she had hanged herself, her father had rejected the suicide theory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/hod-others-booked-on-charge-of-students-murder-in-ddu-varsity/articleshow/84988955.cms||---

It only seems to have become a pile of controversies that do not seem to end.The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) had started discussing the Vishwamitri project as the Vishwamitri Riverfront Project in 2008. The civic body was eyeing to develop it on the lines of the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad. Even the state government promised help and declarations were also made in this regard. It even found mention in the budgets, but work did not start. Besides developing a riverfront on the lines of Ahmedabad, the most crucial objective of the project was to ensure that the issue of flooding in the city is taken care of. Major widening and deepening of the river was planned to increase its capacity to carry water. A preliminary report on the project was prepared and it was shared with the civic body by an agency involved in the work at Ahmedabad. But major concerns were expressed regarding the concretization of the banks of the river and other aspects. In 2016, the project was even challenged in the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Wary of the development, VMC withdrew the application seeking environment clearance.After this, the civic body decided to alter the project plans and brought into focus the environmental aspects. The crocodile park proposed on the banks of the river was done away with as it too was violating the norms. To expedite work, the project was then included in the list of works under the Smart City initiative. Little was heard regarding the project till recently, when a tender to prepare a detailed project report for the river was placed before the standing committee.A VMC functionary said that a major reason for the delay was environmental complications. He added that the VMC had hoped initially that emulating the Sabarmati riverfront would be ideal as it was a successful project. However, unlike Ahmedabad, the civic body faced major hurdles.Advocate Niraj Jain who has taken up the issue of cleanliness of the ‘ghats’ on the river said that the city had an excellent pool of environmentalists and architects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/twelve-years-on-vishwamitri-riverfront-project-only-a-bundle-of-controversies/articleshow/84986487.cms||Sachin Sharma

The police said that the trio had planned the loot and done recce of the house in Sonali Society in Karelibaug over the last few days.According to the police, when 72-year-old Ranjan Gor was performing puja at her house at about 6 am on Monday, four persons barged in. They assaulted Ranjan and even injured her with a knife. “One of the accused, Ritesh Godadiya was wielding a knife and he kept forcing Ranjan to give the key to the locker. When she refused, he injured her with the knife,” said R I Jadeja, Karelibaug police inspector.Another accused, Akash Rawal, 19, then removed gold ornaments that Ranjan was wearing and also stole some cash, while Dimple Soni instructed him. The fourth accused, Arjun Kharwa kept an eye outside the house. “When all the four fled from the house, Ranjan raised an alarm and the neighbours too rushed in. A security guard posted at a mall near the house spotted the gang,” Jadeja told TOI.Godadiya even flashed a fake revolver to scare the crowd. But the guard managed to nab Rawal while the other three fled from the spot. The cops then questioned Rawal, who gave away the names and location of the other accused. “The entire plan was hatched by Dimple who has been working as a house help at Ranjan’s house over the last two months. She knew when Ranjan was alone and how to enter the bungalow from the first floor,” Jadeja added.Dimple took help of Rawal, Godadiya and Kharwa to commit the loot. She even wore shirt and jeans and covered her face to appear as a male while committing the crime. The police said that Godadiya, who has an offence registered against him in the city, is on the run. “We have recovered some of the looted valuables from the trio that said that the ornaments are with Godadiya,” Jadeja said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/three-including-maid-held-for-looting-elderly-woman/articleshow/84986448.cms||---

The consortium also clarified that of the 4,000-odd staffers who remained with Jet for over two years after it suspended operations, only 50 will be retained in Jet 2.0. The employment prospects of the remaining staffers would be rather slim. The consortium said that the liquidation value—the estimated realizable value of Jet Airways 1.0 assets on the insolvency commencement date—owed to the workers and employees is about Rs 100 crore. That is about 8% of the Rs 1,254 crore accepted claims Jet owes to its staffers towards payment of provident fund, gratuity, leave encashment and about six months’ salary. “So, for instance a loader with unpaid dues worth say Rs 5 lakh will be paid Rs 40,000. He will also be left jobless,” said a Jet staffer, requesting anonymity. The resolution plan, approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on June 22, had mentioned a sum of Rs 52 crore as payment towards staffers’ dues. Over and above this, whatever would be left of the liquidation value owed to the staff will be paid to them on a priority basis, the plan had said. But what has hit the Jet staff hardest is the prospect of being jobless. A total of 3,796 staffers hadn’t resigned hoping to be a part of the revival, said a Jet source. Under the resolution plan, only 50 will be retained in Jet 2.0 and the rest will be ‘demerged’ into a yet-to-be-formed ground handling subsidiary, Airjet Ground Services Ltd (AGSL). Jet will offer 76% of its shareholding in AGSL to the employees’ trust (not formed yet) and retain the remaining 24% shareholding. But if the trust refuses to accept the offer or challenges the implementation of this resolution plan “then Jet will retain 100% shareholding in AGSL and deal with it...as deemed appropriate by it, without any interference of any other person,” the consortium said. The Jet source said: “This essentially means they can liquidate AGSL and render the staff jobless. How can the staff accept the AGSL offer and run the company even if they manage to get the requisite approvals from the government? For instance, the consortium has said that ground support equipment, with a book value of Rs 10 crore, currently lying at the Mumbai airport will be handed over to the AGSL employees’ trust. But the equipment has been lying unused at Mumbai airport for over two years now. It has only scrap value.” Kiran Pawaskar, president of the All India Jet Airways’ Officers and Staff Association, said they have decided to challenge the NCLT order in the appellate tribunal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jet-staff-to-get-8-of-rs-1254cr-dues-50-of-4k-employees-will-be-retained/articleshow/84991781.cms||Manju V

The civic body on Monday started the pumping station at Shingnapur from where water is supplied to the treatment plants in Puikhadi and Kasba Bawda. Water from the treatment plant in Kasba Bawda is then supplied to around 60% of the E-ward — the most populous ward in the city. Ajay Salokhe, chief hydraulic engineer of KMC, said, “Water will reach the taps by late evening. Supply to Rajarampuri and nearby suburbs that depend on the Puikhadi filter plant will be restored from Tuesday onwards. We have already started pumping water from stations in Nagdevwadi and Balinga that helped us restore supply to rest of the wards.” The water pumping stations were submerged due to the floods for four days and over the past few days efforts were on to remove the motors and get them repaired and restored. Meanwhile, the civic body has appealed to the residents of flood affected areas to check whether the supply pipelines to the households or building are damaged. In 2019, over 3,500 connections were damages due to floods. “We have asked the residents to ensure storage tanks are cleaned properly. We expect less damage to the supply pipelines this time as compared to 2019,” added Salokhe. In 2019, the KMC had waived water bill, amounting to Rs 7 lakh, of the flood-affected residents for one month .The authorities claim waiver was provided to compensate the loss suffered by the residents to restore damaged pipelines and water meters. An official said no such waiver will be provided this year due to poor financial position of the KMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/water-supply-to-75-of-kolhapur-city-restored-kmc/articleshow/84984427.cms||---

Birla’s appeal, through a letter written to cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba on June 7, displays a last-ditch effort by the Indian group — which holds around 27% stake in VIL (UK’s Vodafone Plc holds about 44%) — to salvage the company ahead of possible defaults on statutory payments and bank dues.  Sources in the government, however, said that not much can be done for the company immediately as telecom companies had already been given relief in the form of spectrum payment obligations as well as AGR dues. Any relief for a particular entity does not appear practical, although the government is still trying to work out ways to ensure that there are “three private telcos” that operate in the country, the other two being Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio and Sunil Bharti Mittal’s Airtel, the sources added. Vodafone Idea, however, appeared to be in deep distress and the problems for the company — which was formed from the merger of Idea Cellular, controlled by Birla, and Vodafone’s India subsidiary in 2018 — are far from being resolved. Outstanding debt of the company, which has slipped to the third spot after being on top, was estimated at Rs 1.8 lakh crore at the end of March 2021 (see graphic). “It is with a sense of duty towards 27 crore Indians connected by Vodafone Idea, I am more than willing to hand over my stake in the company to any entity — public sector/government /domestic financial entity or any other that the government may consider worthy of keeping the company as a going concern,” Birla said in the letter where he made an appeal “to save the company and strengthen it in the national interest without any consideration of our private interest.”  In his letter, Birla said that the company “has been trying” to raise Rs 25,000 crore funding through “mostly nonChinese” investors, but the latter “want to see clear government intent to have a three-player telecom market (consistent with its public stance) through positive actions on long-standing requests such as clarity on AGR liability, adequate moratorium on spectrum payments most importantly, a floor pricing regime above the cost of service.” “In the absence of definitive steps in this regard, the potential investors have understandable hesitation to invest. I want to emphasise that without immediate active support from the government on these three issues (certainly by July ’21), VIL’s financial situation will drive its operations to an irretrievable point of collapse,” Birla said in his letter to Gauba. While the SC has refused to give any specific re-think on the AGR payment issue in its hearing on July 23, the floor price matter has been languishing with regulator Trai for over a year with not much headway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/birla-offers-voda-idea-stake-to-government/articleshow/84992089.cms||Pankaj Doval

Guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray on Monday inaugurated two centres at Adarsh Nagar near Worli Koliwada and Pratiksha Nagar in Sion that will be jointly run by Reliance Foundation and BMC. Reliance Foundation, through H N Reliance Hospital, will provide three lakh Covid-19 vaccination doses to be used across 50 locations in the city. The free vaccination drive will cover people in Dharavi, Worli, Wadala, Colaba, Pratiksha Nagar, Kamathipura, Mankhurd, Chembur, Govandi and Bhandup over the next three months. Thackeray said that private hospitals and institutions should aid in free vaccination to increase the number and speed of vaccinations. “Unless everyone is vaccinated, no one is safe,” he said. A mobile vehicle unit will conduct the drive with BMC and BEST providing infrastructure and logistical support. Last week, Jaslok Hospital started vaccinating people in Dharavi with doses procured by Citibank. They have jointly committed to vaccinate one lakh people over the next few months. A Jaslok Hospital official said since they cannot order the entire vaccine stock at one go, they would take 2-3 months to complete the drive. Dr Shreekant Sapatnekar of Godrej Hospital said they donated one lakh doses to BMC to aid in coverage of the city’s population who cannot afford to pay and get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pvt-firms-help-bmc-conduct-its-vax-drive-in-slum-pockets/articleshow/84988877.cms||---

Gas worth Rs 60,000 every month will keep the flame burning here at the special enclosure in Shaheed Smarak museum. Speaking to TOI, general manager of GAIL, Meerut region, Vinay Kumar said, “We have installed the gas pipeline and can supply the gas anytime as per the requirement of the district administration.”Pending since 1998, the hope for the installation of Akhand Jyoti (eternal flame) was rekindled after Lok Sabha MP from Meerut-Hapur constituency Rajender Agarwal raised the demand for it to be installed at Shaheed Smarak in Meerut in the Zero Hour in Lok Sabha on September 22, last year. Speaking to TOI, Agarwal said, “Because of the involvement of the multiple agencies including Cantonment Board, Meerut Development Authority, PWD, district administration, GAIL, etc. there was lack of coordination to some extent. After we took the issue with these agencies and brought them on a same platform, things began to work. District administration had a highly constructive role to play in establishing this coordination. Though we wanted the flame to be lit on the anniversary of the uprising against the British on May 10, but it could not happen because of Covid-19. But now we will see its inauguration on August 15."Curator of the Shaheed Smarak Museum in whose premises the Akhand Jyoti is being set up, Patru Maurya, said, “The eternal flame will be lit in the memory of all those who fell fighting against the British in the 1857 uprising that began from Meerut. It was indeed the beginning of the freedom struggle that eventually facilitated our independence on August 15 1947.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meeruts-akhand-jyoti-commemorating-1857-rebellion-set-to-open-on-august-15/articleshow/84984482.cms||Sandeep Rai

Disposing a writ petition filed by Rajendra Singh and four others, a division bench headed by Justice Sunita Agarwal directed the DM to decide the matter preferably within three months. These five petitioners were mostly from the Delhi-NCR, who were neither getting their ready-to-move flats nor the money paid to Supertech Private Limited, the petition says. According to counsel for the petitioners, Sandip Kumar, his clients took home loans from banks, kept paying its EMIs, while residing in rented accommodations without any hope of ever getting their flats from the builder. Aggrieved over it, the petitioners got recovery certificates issued by the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) almost a year ago, but they are lying unexecuted, the counsel for the petitioner added. The court, after hearing the parties, passed the above order, observing,"Looking to the innocuous prayer made in the writ petition, without entering into the merits of claim of the petitioner, the present writ petition is being disposed of with the direction the district collector/district magistrate, Gautam Buddh Nagar, to conduct the proceeding for execution of the recovery certificate issued by the RERA and take necessary steps in furtherance of the same, in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible, preferably, within a period of three months from the date of submission of copy of this order”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-directs-gb-nagar-dm-to-executerecovery-certificates-against-builder/articleshow/84989045.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Vector-borne diseases rear up in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: As the rains continued their hide-and-seek with the city, the cloudy weather, fall in temperatures and accumulation of water in many open areas have given rise to vector-borne diseases in the city. While cases of malaria are few, many patients are coming in with dengue and chikungunya, city-based doctors said. Dr Kirit Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA), said the increase in cases is manyfold. “Till mid-July, there were just a few cases reported. In the last seven to ten days, almost all areas of the city have reported a spike in cases. The hospitalization rate is still low with increased awareness, as the majority of such patients undergo Covid tests after getting a fever and then get diagnosed with dengue or chikungunya,” he said. “I used to see about one or two patients with vector-borne diseases 10 days ago. Today the number is 10-20 every day,” said Dr Rakesh Sharma, a physician based in Ghatlodia. “The number of chikungunya cases is more than those of dengue. Compared to the pre-Covid period, the severity of cases is greater, and several patients needed hospitalization.” Dr Pravin Garg, a city-based physician, added that the number of cases and severity have increased in the past few days. Their platelet counts drop rapidly, and patients also present symptoms such as severe stomachache along with fever, experts said. “If the cloudy weather persists, we expect more cases to emerge due to the conducive environment for mosquito breeding,” said Dr Mehul Shelat, a city-based physician. “As we exercised caution for Covid-19, we must be on guard to prevent vector-borne disease in our families. Ensure that water accumulation is not taking place near your homes. Avoid eating out.” Experts at both Asarwa Civil Hospital and Sola Civil Hospital said patients have started trickling in, but the numbers are still in single digits. They added that this may be due to early diagnosis and treatment at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vector-borne-diseases-rear-up-in-city/articleshow/84989896.cms||---

The court had held the accused guilty of double murder on July 3, and after hearing arguments on the point of sentence, awarded him life imprisonment. The court in its order observed that if the accused failed to pay the fine amount, he will have to undergo another jail term of six months. According to Jitendra Kumar Pandey, additional district government counsel (ADGC), sub inspector Santosh Kumar, in-charge Hanspuram police outpost of Naubasta police station in the report lodged on September 16, 2016, had stated therein that Chandra Veer Singh, a resident of Lalpur Naubasta came to him at the police outpost and informed him that he had killed his father Chandra Pal Singh and sister Kamlesh with a stick and brick due to domestic feud. The shirt he was wearing had blood stains, the S-I stated in the report. Later, the S-I along with three constables went to the spot and found two dead bodies lying in a pool of blood. The ADGC stated that land dispute was the cause of double murder. Chandrapal had four sons and a daughter named Kamlesh. Kamlesh despite being married used to live with her father and was demanding her share in the land owned by her father.  Chandraveer, who had retracted his statement given to the police, told the court that when he had gone to his relative’s place some unidentified persons killed his father and sister. But the prosecution successfully proved that the accused was present at the site of the murder when the incident occurred. Since his house was situated in a densely populated area, there was no possibility of dacoity. The prosecution produced as many as 13 witnesses in the case. The court, after going through the evidence on record, held Chandraveer guilty of double murder and sentenced him accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/man-sentenced-to-life-imprisonment-for-killing-father-sister/articleshow/84988889.cms||---

Diamonds worth Rs 7.80 lakh and cash was stolen from a diamond polishing unit in Palitana of Bhavnagar district. Bhavnagar police arrested Raju Thummar (35), a resident of Gadhadka village in Savarkundla taluka of Amreli district and Ramesh Khokhar (58), a resident of Pramukh Sai Society at Yogi Chowk in Surat for carrying out the diamond theft. Haresh Jadav (35), a resident of Pipardi village had lodged a complaint against unidentified persons after his polishing unit was burgled on the intervening night of 26 and 27 June this year. The thieves had used a gas cutter to cut open the safe and decamped with diamonds worth Rs 7.80 lakh and Rs 70,000 cash. The thieves had also stolen the CCTV camera and DVR (Digital Video Recorder) to destroy the evidence of the crime. Police went through the CCTV camera footage of nearby diamond polishing units but didn’t find a clue. “We then zeroed-in on the modus operandi employed to carry out the theft. In the past two such incidents of cutting open the safe to carry out theft, of Rs 22 lakh and Rs 82 lakh respectively, were reported from Surat,” a police official said. The cops then gathered information about the accused in these two cases, especially those who were out on bail. “We got the name of Raju Thummar and detained him for questioning and later he confessed to the crime and also revealed Ramesh Khokhar’s name.

---||Mumbai||Why are those vaccinated not allowed on locals: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Commenting on the impact travel curbs have on livelihood, the Bombay high court on Monday said all who are vaccinated must be allowed to travel by Mumbai’s local trains. “Spread your net wide. Not just lawyers but people from all walks of life,” a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni told the state while hearing a PIL urging restrictions be eased for lawyers. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said at a meeting with the railways a formula was worked out to allow lawyers partially or fully vaccinated, based on their age, to use the trains. He said the railways wanted a letter from the State Disaster Management Authority headed by the chief minister, who is now touring flood-hit areas. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Centre indicated that if such approval comes through, “immediately we’ll permit.” The AG said the SDMA was “slightly reluctant” to allow train travel for lawyers as it did in the first phase. “This time frontline, health and certain government employees are allowed. Even telephone, electric and other essential services are not allowed,’’ he added. The judges questioned the basis for these selective restrictions saying unlike last year people are being vaccinated. “What is the benefit of vaccination? Vaccinated persons are not expected to stay home. People have to earn their livelihood,” said the CJ. Senior advocate Milind Sathe, for State Bar Council, said around 4,000 advocates in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and not more than 1,000 in Mumbai would require train passes. But the judges wanted to know if there was a comprehensive plan to allow travel for all who are vaccinated. “This suspended position and uncertainty is affecting everyone and some sections of the population to an extent that there is burden on finances,” said Justice Kulkarni. The judges referred to the state of roads. “It takes three hours each way to reach Dahisar (from south Mumbai). Why population travelling by roads cannot travel by train?” asked Justice Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/why-are-those-vaccinated-not-allowed-on-locals-bombay-hc/articleshow/84988911.cms||Rosy Sequeira

For the same, the notice inviting bid (NIB) on engineering procurement and construction (EPC) mode has been published. In the recent project works committee (PWC) meeting, a proposal change in scope of work of consultancy work for RIC was also approved. An offical said, “Initial project cost was Rs 106 crore and the consultancy fee was based on 1% of the project cost. As there is escalation in price due to revision in design, the consultancy fee will also increase. Also, the interior work is also assigned to the same firm.” The construction was stalled after previous BJP government refused to provide its share for the project, which was started during Ashok Gehlot’s previous tenure in 2013. An official source informed TOI, “The total project cost is approximately Rs 135 crore. So far, JDA has spent over Rs 50 crore and completed the structure. The previous government did not release its share and wanted the project to be switched on public private and partnership (PPP) mode. As the new government has released the funds, the project will gain momentum”. Initially, the centre was modelled on the India Habitat Centre in New Delhi. However, after concerns were raised on the model, it was decided that the centre would be designed on the lines of the India International Centre, which is a cultural centre without any government offices. JDA is constructing the project on 25,980 sqm of land near Akshay Patra behind JLN Marg. As per the design, it would have three auditoriums, with the first one having a seating capacity of 700, while the other two auditoriums would accommodate 300 people each. For the project, the state government had earlier cancelled the lease of land near Jhalana institutional area which was allotted to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/furnishing-work-at-raj-international-centre-to-begin-soon/articleshow/84988899.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The average mosquito density per room rose from 1.3 in May to 2.78 in July. Dengue, chikungunya, and malaria cases spiked in July in the city, when compared to the same period last year. In the case of dengue, there were 22 cases last year in July. This year, the AMC has registered 72. In the case of chikungunya, just three cases were recorded last year; the number is already 34 this year. As for malaria, 44 cases were registered last year, but this year there have been 120 in July alone. Municipal health authorities have blamed the situation on several mosquito breeding spots. These include water storage on the terraces of dwellings; discarded items, within residential compounds, in which water collects; refrigerator defrost trays; flower vases; and household gardens. “We saw heavy breeding of mosquitoes in the peripheral industrial clusters of the city, especially in areas which manufacture and sell sanitary ware,” said an AMC official. “Water collects in ceramic ware lying in the open. Also, the city has not experienced heavy rain spells for a few days. So the rise in vector-borne diseases was expected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mosquitoes-fly-under-covid-radar/articleshow/84989816.cms||---

After the final rites, the family of the girl alleged that she had been sexually assaulted and murdered. They also carried out a protest against police on Monday. Police filed an FIR, initially for death due to negligence and destruction of evidence and arrested Radheshyam, the caretaker-cum-priest of the crematorium, plus three other men, Saleem, Kuldeep and Laxmi Narayan. Later, the cops added murder, sexual assault and criminal intimidation to the charges apart from invoking the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and the SC/ST Act. These were added after the statement of the girl's mother alleging murder and the intervention of the SC/ST committee. A medical examination could not be conducted as the body had already been cremated. The girl was the daughter of ragpickers and lived in a rented room opposite the crematorium. According to police, she went to get water from the crematorium around 5.30pm after informing her mother. Around 6pm, Radheshyam and the three men, all known to the mother, called her to the crematorium and showed them her daughter’s body, claiming she was electrocuted when having water from the water cooler. There were burn marks between the wrist and elbow of the left arm and the girl’s lips had turned blue, police cited the mother as having disclosed. Ingit Pratap Singh, DCP (Southwest) quoted the mother as saying that the priest and the other accused had advised her not to inform the cops because there would be a case and a post-mortem, during which the doctors would take away her daughter’s organs. However, a crowd gathered at the spot and police were informed. After the four men were taken into custody, the forensic and crime teams were called to comb the death spot. On Monday afternoon, local residents and members of Safai Karamchari Union blocked the road from Delhi Cantonment to Janakpuri in protest and raised slogans against the cops. They demanded a proper investigation of the death and ensure justice to the family.

The judges told advocate-general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the state task force, during its briefing to the HC administrative committee, said the third dose could be taken 10 months from the second dose of Covishield and six months from the second dose of Covaxin. The judges asked if a third dose was necessary. The AG said it would be a booster dose. “We (state) have not given a thought about it,” he added. The judges then said people should not be caught unawares. “It should not happen that we are happy with the second dose and there is an increase (in cases) after that,” said the chief justice. The judges asked the state to “find out about the third dose”. The CJ said, “Let us think ahead. Let us not wait for six months to get over.’’ Rosy Sequeira||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-asks-state-govt-if-third-dose-of-covid-vaccination-is-needed/articleshow/84988968.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Conservation efforts made in the recent past have started bearing fruits, as grown-up tiger cubs born at the reserve are marking new territories. The forest administration gave identification number ST- 22 to a female cub on Monday, which was born to tigress ST-10 last year. Field director of Sariska Tiger Reserve, RN Meena said, “The tigress is one-and-a-half years old. It has marked its territory in Beenak, Seerabas and Dharampura region.” Wildlife lovers believe that it’s a sign of flourishment and an indication that the forest has a decent strength of tigers. Dinesh Verma Durani, founder and general secretary of Sariska Tiger Foundation said, “It’s a healthy sign that young tigers are marking new territories. Recently, ST-6, which ruled over a large territory in the core area, was pushed by young male tiger ST-21. Entry of young adult males and females every three to five years is required to maintain a balanced population growth. Earlier, this was missing in STR.” A recent successful village relocation programme is also providing inviolate spaces for tigers at STR and allowing them to thrive in absence of human interference. Sunil Mehta, member of State Board for Wildlife (SBWL), said, “The young tigress has marked its territory in the region from where the villages were relocated. The area is sufficient and there will also be no overlapping of territory with another big cat.” At present, there are 23 tigers at STR including 4 cubs. “Recently, the sub-adult male tigers ST-20 and ST-21 have grown up and have marked their territory. It indicated that these big cats are not timid and living on peripheries to feed on cattle. Young tigers battling for territory is a good sign in Sariska,” he said. The reserve is spread across 1,281 sq-km area and is divided into six ranges. Experts claimed, constant conservation efforts will make Sariska self-sustainable and there was no requirement to relocate tigers from another reserve. Safaris closed at R’bore due to rain After heavy rainfall deteriorated the safari routes in the tiger reserve, the forest administration at Ranthambore National Park (RNP) closed the safari from August 2 (Monday) evening, till next orders. The RNP has already closed the core ( 1 to 5 zones ) area during the monsoon. However, zones in buffer (6 to 10) were open for safaris.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sariska-tiger-count-rising-cubs-mark-new-territories/articleshow/84988954.cms||---

Most people in the had been facing a severe shortage of clean water as the flooding had submerged the water pumping stations operated by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation. Due to the flood and rain-caused landslides, even the river water had turned muddy and unfit for consumption. Kolhapur civic chief Kadambari Balkawade had then approached the administration of the Shivaji University for the supply of fresh and clean water for drinking. Over the past few years, the SUK has been making efforts to conserve water on the campus. In fact, the university became self-sufficient in terms of drinking water a couple of years ago. The 800-acre campus has six ponds, three lakes and eight wells with a total storage capacity of 40 crore litre. Right now, the water requirement within the campus is low as there are no students there and classes are not taking place due to the Covid restrictions. D T Shirke, the SUK vice-chancellor, said, “Anticipating the drinking water shortage during flood situations, we had ensured that all the ponds and lakes have adequate storage. We are now supplying around 10-12 lakh litre of drinking water every day to the citizens through water tankers. Over the past few years, our water conservation efforts have yielded satisfactory results.” The conservation works include water recycling, trenching, removal of sediments from wells, rejuvenation of lakes and creation of farm ponds. Over Rs 1.5 crore was spent on the works. The aim was to reduce dependency on river water and to do away with the annual water bill — around Rs 50 lakh. The university administration has also allowed cattle owners to get green grass to feed their cattle. The grass is grown on large tracts of land on the campus. Currently, most fields in Kolhapur are inundated and the standing crops are damaged. Therefore, there is a shortage of green fodder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/over-1l-citizens-got-clean-water-from-ponds-lakes-wells-on-suk-campus-during-floods/articleshow/84984529.cms||---

Data shows that citizens have lost Rs three crore to cyber frauds till July this year. Of the total money siphoned off online, around Rs 1.34 crore was frozen in bank accounts or returned to victims after cops took action. Police have now launched a month-long awareness campaign Cyber Sanjivani to create awareness about such frauds. In all, 75 cyber crime cases were registered in the city up to July in 2020, but 203 have already been registered this year. “Our teams are working to identify victims, detect the cases and create awareness. Considering the rising numbers, we have started a month-long drive to prevent cyber crime cases,” said city police commissioner Ajay Tomar. Officials claim that the rise is inevitable as more and more people are exposed to unsecured use of the internet.  “Looking at the success in police investigation and recovery of money lost in cyber fraud, people have also started approaching police with complaints,” said Y A Gohil, assistant commissioner of police, cyber crime cell, Surat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/nearly-300-rise-in-cyber-crime-in-surat/articleshow/84986811.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The state tally on Monday was 4,869 cases, a tad higher than the 4,877 cases a week ago. These dips correspond to the fewer tests carried out on Sundays. While 26,768 tests were run in Mumbai on Sunday (results computed on Monday) as against 35,000 usually, 1.6 lakh tests were done across Maharashtra as against 2.3 lakh daily. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said more tests would be conducted now on. “As the restrictions have been relaxed, we expect more people on the roads. We will do more tests and restart checks and fines for Covid-inappropriate behaviour,” said Kakani. For the third straight day, the Mumbai region recorded less than 1,000 cases a day. In fact, only Kolhapur and Pune administrative circles reported four-digit tally on Monday while the six others had less than 1,000 cases. Addressing locals at Ankalkhop village in Sangli on Monday, CM Uddhav Thackeray advised using masks and following Covid rules. He also asked the district authorities in Kolhapur and Sangli to increase tests and hold medical camps as “Covid is not yet eradicated”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-cases-259-lowest-in-464-days/articleshow/84989026.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Cut-off marks for top courses likely to soar to all-time high||JAIPUR: The record Class 12 pass percentage attained by Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) students will make it tougher for CBSE students to get admission in premier institutes of the state. A whopping 98.98% of RBSE students have secured first division against CBSE’s 85%. Experts are expecting a rise of 4-6% in the cut off marks in most colleges. The state follows a percentile formula, which is seen as discriminatory for the CBSE students. The formula was dropped last year and this year too, it may not give any reprieve to central board students. “The kind of marks students have acquired will take the cut-off to an all-time high. In some of our premier courses like B.Com, we are expecting to touch 98%, while in BA and BSC, we are expecting to cross 92%,” said Rashmi Jain, former vice-principal of Maharani’s College and head of department, sociology, Rajasthan University. She argued it was even hard to imagine that 99% of students are in the bracket of 60% marks and above. “This year, even the average colleges will see the cut off hovering around 70%-80%, affecting CBSE students whose scores appeared to be not as high,” said Jain. The state has over 280 government colleges and constituent colleges under Rajasthan University. According to sources, 5,86,370 students of humanities have secured first division while 867 bagged second division and barely 2 students have secured third division with an all-time high pass percentage of 99.19. In science and commerce, no students have secured third division, making the competition tough. Experts say the unprecedented marks have gone against all trends in the marking schemes. “If it is a matter of pride, the government should disclose the reasons for the same,” said an expert. The admission are expected to start in the coming weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cut-off-marks-for-top-courses-likely-to-soar-to-all-time-high/articleshow/85000539.cms||---

On examining the reptile, the staff found it had injuries on its belly and are probing how it got hurt. Forest department officials surmise that the crocodile may have strayed into the village from some pond nearby. “The crocodiles thrive in ponds and during monsoon, swollen rivers flood adjoining areas, submerging ponds in the vicinity. That is when the crocodiles swim out, straying into villages,” said a forest department official. Villagers said a crocodile was spotted in a sugarcane field for the past two days. When the reptile entered the village, it was caught and tied to a tree. It was shifted to the ranger office building, where its wounds are being treated.M Semmaran, divisional forest officer, said, “A probe on how it sustained the injuries is being conducted.” According to forest officials, there are over 750 gharials in the stretch of the Ganga passing through Hastinapur sanctuary area. Besides, more than 700 crocodiles are known to dwell in ponds in the region and come out when the water bodies are flooded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/crocodile-rescued-in-bijnor-village-probe-into-how-it-got-hurt/articleshow/84984605.cms||Harveer Dabas

Right now, the old scheme is available only to teachers who began service before 2005. According to the petitioners’ advocate, office-bearers of teachers’ associations from various districts including Ahmedabad have filed a petition in the high court complaining that the new pension scheme offers a meagre amount. They submitted that they came to know about the futility of the new pension scheme after some of their colleagues passed away due to Covid and their widows were entitled to a meagre amount. The petitioners have submitted that the pension scheme, which has been made available to those teachers whose services began before 2005, should be made available to other teachers also. Many of them had joined before 2005, but the fixed pay for five-year scheme has deprived them of the benefit. They have demanded that the option of the old pension scheme should be made available to all teachers. It was also submitted that the government granted benefit of seniority to teachers in 2019, but it did not extend the benefits of the pension scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-issues-notice-to-state-govt/articleshow/84986814.cms||---

The most visited iconic Amber fort received over 4,800 visitors on Sunday, the count was 4,400 on Saturday. Similarly, Nahargarh, from where one can see the rain-drenched city turning green, attracted 4,100 visitors on Sunday. “If it rains on weekends, the crowd swells in these hill forts. Besides the people from nearby places in the Jaipur, the number of tourists from Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat are now slowly increasing. We expect the flow of visitors to rise further in coming months,” said P C Sharma, director of state archaeology and museum department. The footfalls were the highest since the monuments and museums were opened to visitors on June 16 after the lockdown. In the 15 days of June, the eight monuments of Jaipur received over 19,000 visitors, but in July their number rose to 1.38 lakh showing that people are now willing to go out on the back of decreasing Covid cases. The numbers are rising despite the lightning strike that killed around 24 people in the state and around 11 visitors to the Amber fort about 20 days ago. The rains, along with the lowest number of new Covid infections, in the Pink City has restarted the tourist rush from neighbouring states and cities. “Now, almost everything is open. The liberal timing restrictions are not a handicap. Tourists from NCR are coming in large numbers and hotels are having a good occupancy. It seems we are sort of starting to relive the good time again even though it will take a long time to reach there,” said a hotelier in the city. The hotelier said that if the third wave does not come, the tourism sector will be on the road to recovery from now even though there is a question mark over when the foreign tourists resuming visits to the state. Apart from Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai, Rajasthan gets a large number of foreign tourists, but Covid has halted that inflow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/downpour-attracts-record-visitors-to-iconic-monuments-in-pink-city/articleshow/84989037.cms||---

BMC said 1,997 people were vaccinated at Khambacha pada in Aarey on Monday. The drive for vaccination of bed-ridden people saw a better response on the second day. BMC said 62 bed-ridden people were vaccinated on Monday. The corporation and NGO Project Mumbai have started vaccination of people who cannot reach a vaccination centre due to physical or mental illness. The pilot run of the drive was held on Friday, where 37 people were vaccinated from K east. Monday’s drive was extended to K west. Additional municipal commissioner said extra initiatives are being taken to ensure majority of the city’s population was vaccinated as businesses gear up for normalcy. “At Aarey colony in Goregaon, access was an issue. Many people couldn’t reach the centres or have access to phones and internet to book appointments,” he said, adding that the estimated population of unvaccinated people at Aarey and areas inside Sanjay Gandhi National Park may be 8,000-10,000.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||No extension for PSC rank lists, says Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State government has on Monday rejected the opposition’s demand for validity extension of around 500 PSC rank lists, which are set to become obsolete by August 4. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan who rejected the demand said the validity of PSC rank is one in normal circumstances. Owing to special circumstances, the life of the rank lists can be extended up to three years. “All rank lists set to lose validity on August 4 are more than three years old,” CM told the House. He was replying to an adjournment notice given by MLA Shafi Parambil, urging the government to further extend the validity of 493 PSC rank lists beyond August 4. Vijayan, who blamed the opposition for trying to discredit PSC, said the demand for validity extension of the rank lists for the second time was unrealistic. “It’s practically impossible to give jobs to all those who figured in the PSC rank list. The number of candidates who figure in any PSC rank list is significantly higher than the actual vacancies,” he said. The practice of including too many candidates in the rank list started as a solution to complaints that appointments in several vacancies set aside for reserved categories don’t take place when the rank list is kept slim, he said. “The demand for frequent validity extension of rank lists would light up unnecessary hope in the minds of all those who figure in the rank list. Moreover, the frequent extension of rank lists would hamper the prospects of several youngsters waiting to prove their mettle in the competitive examinations. He hinted that PSC would challenge the administrative tribunal’s recent order in favour of a set of PSC rank holders. Shafi said the government was trying to engineer an undeclared recruitment freeze. “I would request the government not to degrade PSC to the level of Karuvannur cooperative bank. Government offices did not function for 115 days in the state after the outbreak of Covid. No proper reporting of job vacancies has taken place. There is a significant fall in the number of appointments during these times. The government should show some mercy to the PSC rankholders and extend the validity of the rank lists set to become invalid on August 4,” he said. Shafi said some of the rank lists that are about to lose their validity have hardly benefited from the validity extension the government had announced just before the assembly elections. Since the state administrative tribunal has directed PSC to extend for two months the validity of rank list for last-grade servants, the government should extend the validity of all lists by three months, he said. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said the government should not use the situation to wreak vengeance against PSC rank holders for protesting against the government. Following speaker’s denial for permission to discuss the issue by suspending all other businesses of the house, the opposition staged a walk out from the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-extension-for-psc-rank-lists-cm/articleshow/84986852.cms||---

Selja, who is Haryana Congress president, landed at Jaipur airport on Sunday night and held a brief meeting with Gehlot at his residence at night and then left for Delhi on Monday morning, party leaders said. The sudden trip has added to the speculation over the expected reshuffle. However, some sources claimed that it was a personal visit and had nothing to do with party affairs in the state. There has been no official statement on the meeting, but it is being speculated that Selja travelled to Jaipur to convey a message from the party’s central leadership. Selja is supposed to enjoy the confidence of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and is also considered close to Gehlot. She was the chairperson of the screening committee formed to decide the Congress candidates in the last assembly elections in Rajasthan.

---||Goa||Goa: Lockdown migrant exodus shows in enrolment dip||PANAJI: In the first indication that the exodus of migrant families during the pandemic has had an adverse impact on school enrolment, Goa’s gross enrolment ratio (GER) has shown a dip for the academic year 2019-20, right from primary to higher secondary level. However, other factors such as a dropping birthday rate have also been contributing to the dip. The drop in GER was the most at the higher secondary school level, to 68.5 from 71.9 recorded during the previous academic year 2018-19. At the secondary school level or Class IX and X, the gross enrolment ratio came down to 90.3 as compared to 91.8 the year before. GER is the number of children enrolled in schools from the total population in the school going age bracket. The Goa statistics emerged during the annual review carried out by central government officials of the implementation of Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) in the state. “The state would need to focus on improving GER at all levels by bringing back children to the age-appropriate classes by taking necessary initiatives including community mobilisation, and the outcome should reflect in the data for the academic year 2020-21,” state the instructions to Goa after the review, which is tied to fund release from the Centre. Central education ministry officials also noted that Goa’s programme of identifying and mainstreaming out of school children was also hit by the pandemic. State officials, however, told TOI that many migrant families that left during the pandemic never returned, affecting enrolment. “Earlier, migrant families of mining workers left for other states to seek employment. During the pandemic, many other migrant families left and that has had an impact as many did not return. It is not that there are students around who are at home and not enrolled in schools,” said a state official. He said that there are other contributing factors to the dip in enrolment. “In recent years, Goa’s enrolment has been going down even before the migrant exodus. This shows the effect of minor drops in birth rates. Also, while calculating enrolment ratio, a certain figure of population is considered of students in the school-going age group. But, for various reasons, this figure may already be an over-estimation of the actual population,” said that official. Nevertheless, Goa’s school enrolment at the upper primary level too has shown a downward movement during 2019-20. GER from Class VI to VIII was 91.8, as compared to 93.8 in 2018-19. At the primary school level, the enrolment stood at 99.1 as against 100.9 earlier. “The state also has to provide information about children of migrant labourers affected due to lockdown as a result of Covid-19 pandemic. The state has not identified out-of-school children in the age group of 16 to 19 as suggested by the ministry. This process needs to be completed early,” Central government officials remarked about Goa in the SSA review. The age group of those identified as out of school children has been upped to add those aged 16 to 19 also now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lockdown-migrant-exodus-shows-in-enrolment-dip/articleshow/84989059.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

But the number of tests per million in the district has fallen below 2,000-mark, as per the recent health department report. The department, meanwhile, says that testing is being ramped up.According to the state health department data of July 30 evening, the number of tests per million in the district was 1,865.At 2,257 tests per million, Muktsar is at the top of the state chart, Jalandhar is second (2,035) and Ludhiana third. Moga has the lowest tests per million at 414.The number of tests per million population (on the basis of seven-day average) was 2,772 on July 8 and fell to 2,337 by July 15 before further dropping to the recent value.The figure was 2,931 on June 24; 3,191 on June 15; 3,950 on June 3; 3,933 on May 18; 1,250 on April 9; 1,193 on April 13; 2,624 on April 30; and 1,201 on March 31. District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat says, “We will increase testing to 13,000 daily. Earlier, we have even conducted 16,000 tests a day.”A health department officer says a large number of tests are being conducted by government health centres, but the figure is low at private set-ups. “If we don’t test a large number of persons for Covid, we cannot ascertain the actual incidence of the disease and will get false data. Even as positivity is less, we should test more people so that we can get an idea of things happening on the ground. More tests help in identifying patients infected with Covid, including asymptomatic ones, isolating and treating them,” says former principal of DMCH Dr Daljit Singh.

Not only is there a scramble to bring talent on board — with emphasis on immediate joining — a significant number of hires are women, with companies offering them up to 70% jump over their last drawn package. Hiring today is largely centered in IT, with nearly 65% of overall recruitment in this sector. TeamLease Services found that women candidates formed 43% of the total hiring by IT companies since March this year. TeamLease Services co-founder & executive VP Rituparna Chakraborty said there is a surge in hiring women at the mid-management to senior level. Although hiring in other sectors is yet to gather momentum, there are clear indications that diversity is the focus across industries. Avtar, a leading firm in diversity, inclusion, and belongingness, says it has seen “a never-before increase” in diversity hiring across IT & non-IT sectors over the last quarter. Avtar founder Saundarya Rajesh said: “Women candidates are in great demand. In sheer numbers, the demand in just Q1 (April-June) is almost as much as what we wit nessed throughout FY21.”  “Not only are companies hiring in really large numbers, but the salaries being offered are also very attractive, with hikes of almost 60-70% over their current pay. Here too, second career women are in high demand — their salaries are often more affordable since the pay packet being matched is only their last drawn, several months or years ago,” said Rajesh. However, this is not a secular demand being witnessed across the country. While diversity hiring is mostly done by major companies, small and medium enterprises too are slowly catching up. Avtar, which pioneered the concept of second careers for women in 2006, said while organisations, in different stages of diversity maturity, adopted this practice to different levels over thepast few years, this year (FY22, beginning April) has been exceptional. “Organisations are keen to hire women on breaks and this trend extends across all industries. A key reason could be that second career women are immediate joiners — with no notice period for the organisation to wait out. Companies that are looking at fillingpositions instantly are betting big on returning women,” said Rajesh. In India, work-from-home (WFH) had increased opportunities for women, especially for those looking to reenter the workforce. “This trend has been a boon for married women in India,” said Chakraborty. “Women lost jobs much more than men did during the pandemic. But those women who were retained, the ones who stayed, are performing very well,” said Rajesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/companies-offer-big-hikes-to-women-in-hiring-rush/articleshow/84992129.cms||Namrata Singh

He assured full support to the family and said the government would assist them with financial and legal aid. “This is a shocking matter. I have spoken to the DCP and the DM and have asked them to fast track the investigation. The statement of the parents should be recorded without any delay.

Many villagers said the move has helped in making the area secure. “About 200 NRI families of the village are in the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Italy. They have contributed immensely in the development of the village infrastructure, including a lake, waiting halls, NRI guest house-cum-panchayat ghar, among others. They wanted us to have a robust security system in the village, so NRI Vikas Committee, which gets money from them for development of the village, got CCTVs installed,” said Gurmail Singh, a village panch. Another villager, Chamkaur Singh, said more than 40 high-definition cameras were installed at nine entry and exit points, near religious places and parks, among other public sites. He said a control centre for the CCTVs has been set up at the panchayat ghar. “Our village is an example of how NRIs can change the fate of villages, especially with infrastructure. We are thankful to them,” he added. Villagers, especially youth, said that the installation of the security system has been of great help. “Earlier the village saw a few theft cases and some anti-social elements would at night sell liquor. Such activities have been checked with the installation of CCTVs by the NRI Vikas Committee,” said Sukhjit Singh of Nawjawan Kisan Mazdoor Ekta Club of the village. He added that if a villager suspects something, he approaches the panchayat and a member comes with him and checks the CCTV footage. Ludhiana (rural) police are also all praise for the effort. “Chakkar had reported crime cases, but with the installation of CCTVs, there has been a lot of improvement. We appreciate the villagers, especially NRIs, for setting up systems that also help us in checking and detecting crime,” said Ludhiana (rural) SSP Charanjit Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/chakkar-villagers-can-sleep-without-stress-courtesy-nris/articleshow/84984729.cms||Shariq Majeed

The HC has now sought a “better affidavit” from the Centre and directed it to set out by next Friday “the entire procedure adopted for reaching vaccines to Maharashtra for distribution.” The HC also noted that the state has not filed its affidavit, and its lawyer sought a week’s time. The HC now wants a proper flow chart from the time manufacturers supply vaccines and they reach the state and then to different civic bodies for distribution. The HC is hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a teacher, Yogeeta Vanzara, for streamlining the vaccination process on the CoWin app and till the beneficiary gets the jab. Her lawyer, Jamsheed Master, said based on data from the CoWin app, in the state, soon one crore second doses will be needed, and the authorities should be asked to ensure supply before time runs out. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni said he needs to place such averment or application on affidavit for the court to have any basis to pass an order and asked him to file an affidavit within two days. The HC said if true, time cannot be allowed to run out for such beneficiaries. The HC also asked the state what percentage of population received its first and second dose and was told that the CoWin app shows 4.49 crore people got their shots, with 3.5 crore getting their first dose and 1.13 crore the second. A government official also addressing the HC said the supply is “not adequate” when the HC asked him, “Do you think there is a short supply?” But he said vaccination is based on what is received. The Centre said there are 56 consignee points, and that Maharashtra has 12,572 government Covid vaccination centres and 5,763 private centres active on the CoWin portal, and it provides 15 days’ “advance visibility” of vaccine allocation. The Centre said 75% of vaccines produced by manufacturers in India are procured by it and to “incentivise” production, it enables manufacturers to provide directly to private hospitals 25% of their monthly production. Master said the Centre’s affidavit was “silent with regard to a major part of the HC’s July 17 order,” and the HC bench said, “Having read the affidavit, we are constrained to observe” the deponent “has not been serious.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-unhappy-with-centres-reply-to-query-on-vax-supply/articleshow/84989099.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘House panel has power to scrutinize KIIFB accounts’||Thiruvananthapuram: Speaker MB Rajesh ruled that the finance subject committee concerned has the right and powers to scrutinize all capital expenditure accounts of KIIFB. Since the capital expenditure details are not specifically mentioned as an item to be scrutinized by the subject committee concerned, necessary changes should be made from next year onwards to list it specifically, the speaker ruled after considering a point of order raised by former minister AP Anilkumar that the finance subcommittee (eight) was denied an opportunity to scrutinize the capital expenditure details of KIIFB. Anilkumar had argued that the subject committee concerned was denied an opportunity to scrutinize the expenditure details of KIIFB as the house had expunged the CAG’s audit observations on KIIFB.  Though the chair had on July 4 2019 ruled that the KIIFB audit report should be made available for the scrutiny of the subject committee concerned, no steps were taken to ensure the same, the former minister had pointed out. The speaker said that the house had not rejected CAG observations, but only denounced some of the observations by CAG. Though there are enough provisions that empower the subject committee concerned to call for and scrutinize the expenditure details of KIIFB, the capital expenditure head is not specifically included in the scrutiny schedule of the subject committee. In the light of the point of order, the chair ruled that all details that come under the major head — capital expenditure — should be specifically listed in the scrutiny schedule for the inspection of the subject committee concerned. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/house-panel-has-power-to-scrutinize-kiifb-accounts/articleshow/84986897.cms||---

It once again exposed the lofty claims made by the civic authorities on the drainage system which led to inundated roads. A cyclist was killed after a tree fell on him in Chaura Rasta area. Torrential showers were witnessed in the morning across the city. In the afternoon the sky cleared for some time. However, in the evening heavy rainfall was witnessed once again in the city. “Rainfall of nearly 66mm was received in the Pink City,” said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. In the morning, many people on their way to their offices had a troublesome time to reach their workplace. “It took me 90 minutes from Sodala to reach my office at Jawahar Circle,” said Manish Sharma who works in an automobile company. Areas including Brahmapuri, Badi Chaupar, Ramganj, Choti Chaupar and Chandpole in the Walled City witnessed heavy inundated roads and streets. Many vehicles were stuck amidst heavy flow of water. Roads at Statue Circle, Tonk Road, Malviya Nagar, Gopalpura Bypass, Sawai Jai Singh Highway, Bani Park, Shastri Nagar, Adarsh Nagar, Bees Dukan and some parts of Goner Road were also not spared by the gushing water. Some of the low-lying areas including Jawahar Nagar Kachchi Basti and Bhatta Basti witnessed water-logging. People were forced to use buckets to flush out water that entered their rooms. In the past one week Jaipur has received an average rainfall of nearly 180mm despite the fact that initial 44 days after the onset of monsoon were dry for the city. Heavy rainfall was also witnessed in the Jaipur district including Dudu, Bassi, Chomu, Govindpura, Bagru and Kho Nagorian.

Incidentally, they both happen to be second cousins. This was the first CET conducted in the state for entry to Class XI science and diploma courses, and was answered by nearly 7,000 students. The two cousins will also now pursue their higher secondary education at the same institute, Mushtifund Aryaan at Cujira. While Adeep wants to follow in the footsteps of his parents, who are both engineers by qualification, Indrani’s immediate focus for now is her higher secondary education. Adeep, the son of former Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienker and corporate professional Sonia, has also been also an avid trekker from the age of 12, who has completed some tough Himalayan treks, including one to the Everest base camp in 2019. “In a beautiful coincidence, both Adeep and Indrani have the same great grandfather,” said Adeep’s mother Sonia. A deep was a student of Mushtifund High School, Cujira, till Class X. Margao-based Indrani is a student of Bhatikar Model High School, the daughter of business owner Ghanashyam Kakodkar and homemaker Shama. As the Class X public exam was cancelled this year due to the pandemic, to keep admissions to Class XI science and diploma programmes competitive, a CET was held for aspirants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cousins-adeep-indrani-top-state-cet-with-identical-score/articleshow/84989109.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Ahmedabad||Container crisis, spiralling freight rates to hit exports||AHMEDABAD: At a time when export prospects are looking up with recovery in global trade, container shortage and spiralling container freight rates continue to haunt exporters. This twin blow is feared to hit exports. Container freight rates had doubled and trebled in May depending upon the destination of consignments. The situation has worsened as freight charges continue to move upwards unabatedly, said exporters. “Freight rates are surging continuously. The charges for containers are increasing between $500 (Rs 37,000 approx) to $800 (Rs 59,000 approx) every fortnight,” said Ashwin Nayak, founder chairman, Federation of Indian Spice Stakeholders (FISS). For instance, a 40-foot long container for a shipment to New York will currently cost around $8,500 (Rs 6.32 lakh approx) which hovered around $7,000 (Rs 5.21 lakh approx) a month ago. The same rate was $2,500 (Rs 1.86 lakh approx) in pre-pandemic level. Some other destinations in the US and Canada have seen container charges reaching about $12,000 (Rs 8.92 lakh approx). For exports to Europe, rates have firmed up to $5,500 (Rs 4 lakh approx) currently from $4,000 (Rs 2.97 lakh approx) last month. The freight ranged from $1,000 (Rs 74,365 approx) to $1,200 (Rs 89,240 approx) before the outbreak of the pandemic, said exporters. Freight charges have spiralled for most export destinations, including Europe, Canada, Middle East. “Rates for LCL (less-than-container-loan) shipment, where small quantity cargoes are grouped together in one container, have surged 3-4 times,” said Bhupendra Patel, chairman (Gujarat) of Basic Chemicals, Cosmetics & Dyes Export Promotion Council (Chemexcil). Container shortage has further added to the woes of exporters as finding empty containers is also a daunting task, said exporters, alleging that hoarding of containers by China created a shortage and fuelled rates. “Freights have surged substantially. Exporters are not getting containers in time due to shortage. If you manage a container, then availability of vessel is also an issue. Hence, exporters have turned cautious because export cost has also gone up,” added Nayak. Smaller players have reduced export work and exporters now prefer to book free on board (FOB) orders and try to avoid C&F (cost and freight) orders, said an exporter. “Container shortage and high freight have led to delays in shipments, blockage of funds and higher cost of exports,” said Dilip Padhya, chairman (regional council) of Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “We are also losing export business as no containers are available for destinations such as Australia and Latin American countries even if exporters are ready to cough up exorbitant container freight rates,” he added. According to KG Kundariya, former president of Morbi Ceramic Association, high freight rates and container shortage have dented ceramic tile exports from Morbi by about 10%. Buyers are ordering consignment that are inevitable and tend to postpone consignments that can be avoided currently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/container-crisis-spiralling-freight-rates-to-hit-exports/articleshow/84986910.cms||Kalpesh Damor

According to traders, the reduction in demand when compared to the supply has led to the drop the price of the produce. Manoj Jain, an onion trader and senior member of Nashik district onion traders’ association, said demand for onions in the international as well as domestic markets have reduced to a great extent. “Apart from this, arrival of new onions have begun in states like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. This has also led to reduction in demand for the Nashik onions,” he said. “Moreover, the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), a central agency that continued procurement of onions in various APMCs for the past two months, has also stopped buying onions,” he added. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon on Monday were recorded at Rs 700 and Rs 1,800 per quintal, respectively. Around 10,000 quintal of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Monday. Currently, onions coming into the market are summer onions harvested in March and April. Unlike kharif and late kharif onions harvested between October and February, the summer onions have a shelf life of around six months and farmers prefer storing them with a hope of getting better price. The summer onions, stored by farmers, cater to the market until the arrival of fresh kharif onions by mid-September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/15-drop-in-average-wholesale-onion-price-at-lasalgaon-market/articleshow/84984760.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Goa||At secondary level, 10.2% drop out in Goa; fix it, says Centre||PANAJI: Goa has a high dropout rate of 10.2% at the secondary school level during the academic year 2019-20. The state also has 230 single-teacher government primary schools, despite the overall teacher numbers showing a surplus of 394, Central government officials pointed out at the review meeting for the implementation of samagra shiksha abhiyan (SSA) in Goa. “The state needs to take adequate measures to reduce the dropout rate and improve the retention rate,” Goa has been told at the meeting. The state has been asked to carry out a rationalisation, or redeployment of teachers at the primary level, in a manner that teachers in a school are as per the enrolment and there are no schools where a single teacher is struggling with students from Classes I to IV (primary). The pupil-teacher ratio is skewed in over 30% primary schools at present, the officials have pointed out to Goa. At the secondary school level too, only 44% institutes have teachers for all core subjects. “Subject-pupil teacher ratio is 62 (pupils per teacher) for mathematics, 49 for science and 100 for social studies. The state should ensure the required number of mathematics and science teachers at the secondary level,” the minutes of the SSA meeting state. Central education ministry officials also noted that Goa’s programme of identifying and mainstreaming out of school children was also hit by the pandemic. “Earlier, migrant families of mining workers left for other states to seek employment. During the pandemic, many other migrant families left and that has had an impact as many did not return. It is not that there are students around who are at home and not enrolled in schools,” said a state official. He said that there are other contributing factors to the dip in enrolment. “In recent years, Goa’s enrolment has been going down even before the migrant exodus. This shows the effect of minor drops in birth rates. Also, while calculating enrolment ratio, a certain figure of population is considered of students in the school-going age group. But, for various reasons, this figure may already be an over-estimation of the actual population,” said the official. Nevertheless, Goa’s school enrolment at the upper primary level too has shown a downward movement during 2019-20. GER from Class VI to VIII was 91.8, as compared to 93.8 in 2018-19. At the primary school level, the enrolment stood at 99.1 as against 100.9 earlier. “The state also has to provide information about children of migrant labourers affected due to lockdown as a result of Covid-19 pandemic. The state has not identified out-of-school children in the age group of 16 to 19 as suggested by the ministry. This process needs to be completed early,” central government officials remarked about Goa in the SSA review.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/at-secondary-level-10-2-drop-out-in-goa-fix-it-says-centre/articleshow/84989147.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The officials seized 1.25 quintal of banned plastic carry-bags from various shops and vegetable markets and issued challans of Rs 1 lakh. The shopkeepers were warned against using these and given two days to pay the challan amount. A team led by MC secretary Jasdev Sekhon visited various areas. It started with Field Ganj main road, where a shop was checked and its plastic carry-bags confiscated. As the shopkeeper had kept cloth bags as well, officials appreciated him for doing so. Two shops were checked at 16 Kutcha of Field Ganj. A shopkeeper argued with the officials that plastic carry-bags they seized from his shop were defective and he was not using those. Sekhon told him that those were banned and not allowed to be stored even if defective. The trader was issued a challan on the spot.After this, another shop was raided in Khud Mohalla and a number of plastic carry-bags were found there.The team then reached a vegetable market near Vardhman at Chandigarh Road and seized carry-bags from there. The vegetable vendors made officials talk to some political persons, but in vain.Sekhon said, “The seized carry-bags will be destroyed. The shopkeepers have been given two days to pay their challans. Else, these challans will go to court and they will have to appear there.” The Kesar Ganj Mandi shopkeepers were a scared lot when the news of checks reached them. They locked their shops and stood outside, fearing hefty challans.The officials said they will also challan residents found using plastic carry-bags. There is a provision of Rs 2,000 challan for the defaulters.The drive will remain restricted to carry-bags as thermocol is not banned, though it is a major cause of pollution. When the state government had issued ban orders for plastic carry-bags, even thermocol was included in the list. But in August 2016, the government, while issuing a notification, exempted thermocol from the ban.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/1-25-quintal-of-plastic-carry-bags-seized-rs-1l-challans-issued/articleshow/84984773.cms||---

While sports-lovers from Gujarat celebrated the occasion, very few know that the state has only one Olympic medal to its name. And that is in hockey. In the last seven decades, Gujarat has got only one Olympic medal that was won by Govindrao Sawant, a Barodian. Sawant was a part of the Indian hockey team that participated in the 1960 Rome Olympics. “The team had played in the Olympics at Rome and we had reached the finals against Pakistan. We lost the match and ended as runners-up. As a member of the team, Sawant earned a silver medal,” said Laxman Karanjgaonkar, secretary of Gujarat State Athletics Association. “After that, Gujarat has not won any Olympic medal in team or individual games. Though, this year three girls from Gujarat did participate in the Olympics,” Karanjgaonkar, who is executive member of Athletic Federation of India, added. Sawant, who was born in a humble middle-class family in erstwhile Baroda state on November 25, 1935, took to hockey at a very young age. He used to play for the Bombay province before Gujarat and Maharashtra were carved out as different states in 1960. “He played in the Rangaswamy Cup, a senior national hockey tournament, for the first time in 1951 where he represented Bombay province. Sawant used to play in the left-half position and his game was so good that he got selected for the Rome Olympics,” said Vikas Prajapati, assistant director, physical education department, MS University. Sawant was also offered a job by the state reserve police (SRP) and he retired as a deputy superintendent of police (DySP). After retiring from hockey in early 1970s, Sawant played a key role in the Baroda District Hockey Association and began coaching aspiring players. During his playing days, he used to run between Vadodara city and Padra taluka and cover a distance of nearly 50 kms to increase his stamina. Despite being an Olympian medal winner, Sawant was meted out a shabby treatment by the state government that didn’t recognize his achievement. In 2001, he underwent a knee replacement surgery at SSG Hospital as he didn’t have enough money. Sawant died in the same year within months of the surgery. The Baroda District Hockey Association had started a tournament in his name later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/gujs-only-oly-medal-winner-fades-out-of-memory/articleshow/84986951.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Ahmedabad||Toxic waste dumped on gauchar land||AHMEDABAD: In Gujarat, several legal fights between industrial units and villages have been witnessed where “conservation of gauchar (pasture) land” was the core issue. In an Ahmedabad village, gauchar land was used to dispose of hazardous industrial waste.  Now, police have swung into action and four men have been booked for attempted culpable homicide, for the dumping of toxic industrial waste. Officers of Ahmedabad rural police said Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) officials received an input that industrial waste was being dumped at Kuha village of Daskroi taluka. On the basis of the input, Kanbha police seized two trucks, one from Gandhinagar and another from Anand, which had dumped the waste on a plot of gauchar land in Kuha village on Saturday night. A GPCB team also rushed the village and collected samples of the industrial waste, which looked like soil, but had hazardous chemicals and a pH value of 8. The truck drivers, Dinesh Baria and Bharat Baria, told investigators that they had been instructed to unload the industrial waste at Kuha village. Two other accused, including Gopal Bharwad, the owner of the trucks, told the two to unload the trucks on the gauchar plot. Another accused, Lala Bharwad, who has influence in the Kuha village panchayat, identified the plot on which to dump the waste. Police sources said Lala and Gopal were paid by certain industrialists of Odhav and Kathwada GIDCs, to dispose of the industrial waste which was potentially lethal. “Police have been investigating to know where the waste was brought from and who are involved in the case. The cops have also been probing as to whether they had disposed of waste in this manner,” said an officer. The officer said the accused persons disposed of the waste without following environment protection rules to avoid paying money and endangered the lives of others. Kanbha police charged the four persons under IPC Sections 278 (making atmosphere noxious to health), 284 (negligent act with regard to poisonous substance to endanger human life), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 336 (rash or negligent act to endanger human life or the personal safety of others), 308 (intentional attempt of culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 120B (criminal conspiracy) along with charges under the Environment Protection Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/toxic-waste-dumped-on-gauchar-land/articleshow/84986990.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Dhavalikar said that AAP has invited the central committee to visit Delhi to see the development work done by the government in Delhi and then to finalise the alliance. “We have accepted the invitation. I will visit Delhi this month or next,” he said. Dhavalikar said that MGP will contest the assembly elections in 18 seats and the party has started groundwork in 22 assembly constituencies. He said that MGP will urge the people to give absolute majority to MGP and its alliance partners. “We will do alliance with a good political party. We will not have any alliance with BJP or Congress,” Dhavalikar said. Reacting to AAP statement of 300-units of free electricity in Goa, Dhavalikar said that anything is possible. He also said that MGP has promised to give water free. During the 2017 assembly elections, MGP had won three seats, but two of its MLAs swtiched over to BJP. Later Dhavalikar was dropped from the cabinet. Last month AAP’s national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who arrived on a two-day visit to Goa to review the party’s preparations for the 2022 polls, held a meeting with Dhavalikar and his brother MGP president Pandurang Dhavalikar. The meeting went on for around 45 minutes. During the meeting, both parties discussed the current political situation in the state, and how to go ahead in the future. MGP had told Kejriwal that they have to seek the opinion of the people before deciding on the alliance. In the recently concluded zilla panchayat election, AAP was able to open its account by winning the Benaulim seat when its 26-year-old candidate Hanzel Feliciano Fernandes won the three-cornered fight. Dhavalikar said that MGP has demanded that political parties should not give tickets to defectors. He also said that MGP had taken a resolution that no ticket should be given to a defector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mgp-to-contest-on-18-seats-yet-to-finalise-tie-up-with-aap-dhavalikar/articleshow/84989177.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||NMC diverts spl funds to complete works in Fadnavis’s constituency||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has diverted a major chunk of the state government’s special grant of Rs131 crore to complete works in former chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis’s south-west constituency. However, it irked the ruling party corporators from the other five assembly constituencies as due to shortage of funds, they are finding it difficult to improve existing infrastructure including roads and sewage lines. “We are facing public wrath due to potholed roads,” said BJP corporators. When he was CM, Fadnavis had sanctioned Rs157 crore state funds for 85 different works, mostly pertaining to construction of roads and retaining walls of nullahs etc for his south-west Nagpur assembly constituency. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra stalled the works sanctioned by him (Fadnavis), categorically directing the then civic chief Tukaram Mundhe to stall works wherein the NMC had not issued the work orders. Consequently, majority of works sanctioned in south-west Nagpur were stalled. In the meantime, NMC had received Rs131 crore special fund from the state government. The ruling party BJP in NMC had proposed various development works from this fund. However, the state urban ministry asked the civic chief to utilize Rs73 crore from this fund to complete the pending projects sanctioned in the south-west constituency. The civic body followed the directives and funded the ongoing various works in this constituency. Now, the move has created a shortage of funds and many works proposed across the city have been affected. Standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar was also provided with Rs60 crore civic fund for various works in corporation limits. Ruling party corporators met Fadnavis and requested him to get funds from the state government for the works sanctioned by him from the state fund. “On Monday, Fadnavis held a meeting with municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, who confirmed the development,” said Bhoyar. He pointed out that the diversion of Rs73 crore from the special grant has affected civic works in other parts of the city. “We could not compromise on this. So we urged Fadnavis to seek funds for pending works in his constituency. He assured us that it will be done soon,” said Bhoyar. Bearing in mind that the NMC is going for polls early next year, Fadnavis, who is also leader of opposition, also reviewed the status of land rights of slum dwellers in the city. He directed various government offices, including Nagpur collectorate and NMC, to expedite the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-diverts-spl-funds-to-complete-works-in-fadnaviss-constituency/articleshow/84989244.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Regulatory body to monitor private schools, colleges coming up||JAIPUR: The state higher education department is coming up with the Rajasthan State Education Authority, a body to regulate private colleges, schools and coaching institutes. The aim is to make institutes 100% accountable and provide a cover to parents and students from being cheated. “The body will address all the issues which we are facing with private education institutes, including coaching institutes. It has been designed in a way to protect the interest of parents and students,” said an official requesting anonymity. The body will ensure that every institute under them follows all infrastructure rules, pupil-teacher ratio, classroom student’s ratio, fees and academic quality. The vetting of claims on placements, infrastructure, facilities, distance, affiliations, international and national tie-ups made by the institutes often misleading students. The existing rules allow the institutes to frame any rules they want and claim anything misleading the students. The official said that the most common complaint which they receive is that institutes run courses which they are not permitted to. “Hike of fees in an abrupt manner, books with no MRP, no academic staff of the concerned subject etc., will all be addressed by the body,” said an official, who added that the proposal is before the CM for approval. Officials claim that the long-pending issue of documentation of coaching students will also be addressed by the body. “It will be compulsory for the local administration to provide immediate relief and help, along with a cap on students’ intake on the basis of infrastructure,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/regulatory-body-to-monitor-pvt-schools-colleges-coming-up/articleshow/84989164.cms||---

In reply to a submission by opposition MLA C R Mahesh, the chief minister said the police report on the incident refuted the allegations that police had thrown away fish worth Rs 15,000 of a fish vendor named Mary. “The police report says that no such incident has happened. It is true that the Covid caseload in Kalluvathukkkal area is high and is currently listed in category D. Owing to the instances of overcrowding complaints from people, police had asked the fish vendors to leave the place,” he said. However, the government has asked the police chief to inquire into the complaints and submit a report, the chief minister said. In his submission, Mahesh said that police were mistreating and penalising people in the name of Covid restrictions and the same could not be accepted. “At a time when people are finding it hard to make both ends meet, any restrictions and precautions should be for the good of people. It should not end up as an opportunity to punish people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-no-atrocity-against-fish-vendor/articleshow/84987059.cms||---

---||Nagpur||25% of total population vaccinated in 196 days in Vidarbha||Nagpur: Around 25.58% of the population of Vidarbha has been vaccinated in 196 days of Covid-19 vaccination programme. When it comes to eligible people, the coverage is 34.52%. Experts say inoculation should have been at least 60% by now as part of preparations for projected third wave. Data of the state’s public health department shows estimated population of 11 districts of the region is 2,55,12,946. People above 18 years, who are eligible for vaccine, number 1,89,02,637 in the region. Of these, 65,25,609 people have taken the first dose as on July 30. The government had rolled out vaccines on January 16. Thus, vaccination happened for 196 days till July 30. If one considers total population, 25.58% people have been vaccinated, with 34.52% of eligible people having taken at least one dose. This means on an average 33,294 people were vaccinated every day in the region. The coverage of the region is very less if one considers current data of Nagpur district. Vaccination of around 40,000 people per day is being done in the district since resumption of inoculation of 18-44 years age group on June 23. In fact, cumulative vaccination of the district is also very less, just like entire region. Of total estimated population of 52,72,665, some 18,14,577 (34.41%) have taken the first dose. People eligible for vaccine number 39,23,391, of which 46.25% have been covered. Daily average will come to 9,258 of the district. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Zilla Parishad are running 341 centres in the district where around a lakh can be easily inoculated in a day. The government had rolled out vaccine beginning with healthcare workers (HCW) from January 16 followed by frontline workers (FLW) from February 5, age-appropriate group (above 60-plus and 45-plus with comorbidities), 45-plus from April 1 and 18-plus from May 1. Apart from eligibility in phased manner, the supply of doses was irregular and the same situation continues till date. Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association Dr Anup Marar told TOI, “The current figures reflect the slow pace. We should have touched at least 60% by now. We need to gear up for the third wave, which is expected to be 1.5 times the peak of second wave. People should not be complacent and undertake vaccination at the earliest. They should understand that it would be impossible to arrange hospital logistics for such an anticipated figure. All social organizations should promote vaccination on war footing.” Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “70% of total population needs to be vaccinated to dissociate cases from hospitalization and deaths. Unvaccinated people will be most vulnerable in next wave. We must find innovative ways to increase vaccination rate. Now, the availability of doses is good.” Dr Shinde added, “The authorities should come up with schemes to promote vaccination and also give certain relaxations to people who are fully vaccinated. For example, allow only vaccinated people to run shops or restaurants etc, or give discounts for vaccinated people, which airlines are doing. Vaccination of all adults in educational institutions is must for resumption. Unvaccinated people can be threat to society.” Vaccination continued in the city and rural areas on Sunday. Some 14,549 people took the jab in the city and 1,330 in rural for a total of 15,879 in the district. NMC has announced continuation of vaccination in the city on Monday with availability of Covishield and Covaxin doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/25-of-total-population-vaccinated-in-196-days-in-vidarbha/articleshow/84986900.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Nashik||MSRTC proposes construction of four open body trucks||Nashik: The Nashik division of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has proposed construction of four open body cargo trucks under the Mahacargo fleet of the state transport utility. Citing demand for the such trucks for transportation of goods, the Nashik division has requested the state government for open body trucks that can be easily loaded and unloaded with industrial goods. “Mahacargo is getting good response from various segments of the market. However, there is specific demand for open body trucks in which industrial goods can be loaded quickly by using cranes,” Nashik division controller Rajendra Patil said. The MSRTC buses have been transformed into trucks by removing the seats and modifying it a bit. But the same metal body limits the usage of cranes for loading of goods due to which Mahacargo only gets orders for smaller cargo. Besides, the traders and the industrialists also find it a bit expensive to pay the workers for loading and unloading of the goods. On being asked whether such trucks would be constructed at the division level workshop, Patil said the permission from the central office will decide about the design, construction and all other aspects. “We can construct it here, but the decision from the central office is most important,” he said. Patil also pointed out that the Mahacargo has earned the best of its revenue so far in the month of July. The 50 Mahacargo trucks with the Nashik division have completed a total of 686 trips and earned a revenue of Rs 56.38 lakh during the month of July. The earlier best was in the month of March 2021 with the trucks completing 572 trips and earing a revenue of Rs 43.32 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msrtc-proposes-construction-of-four-open-body-trucks/articleshow/84984883.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Last week, the Union government implemented OBC reservation in the all India quota of NEET for undergraduate and postgraduate medical seats. “The fact is that the court had ordered this and the central government is misleading the public by patting its own back for OBC reservation in medical education. OBC organizations and leaders have fought hard for this and they are the ones who should get credit,” said Wadettiwar. When asked if this meant that their agitation has achieved all of its goals, Wadettiwar said there’s a long way to go. “Reservation in medical education was just one of our goals. We are now preparing to take this agitation to the national level where we will raise multiple issues related to both reservation and basic rights of OBC community,” said Wadettiwar. As a part of taking the ‘movement’ to the national level, OBC community leaders have started talking to major parties as well, said Wadettiwar. “We are speaking with Akhilesh Yadav (Samajwadi Party chief) about this. Our next step is to make our movement a pan-India one,” he said. Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh are due next year. To get data from the Centre about OBC population, the Supreme Court has been approached. Wadettiwar said, “We have filed a petition in the apex court through senior advocate Kapil Sibal. Through the judiciary, we are hoping to get OBC-related data from the central government. The state has already started working on it but it will take time. Hence, our appeal is that the Centre should step in and provide us the easily accessible data.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/obc-quota-rights-will-become-a-national-issue-wadettiwar/articleshow/84989271.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

It has been alleged that the gate was built on public works department (PWD) land worth Rs 13crore. On July 25, 2019, a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) court had ordered the demolition of the university gate within 15 days. The then SDM Prem Prakash Tiwari had also imposed a fine of Rs 3.2 crore on the Khan’s Jauhar trust. A few days later, the Allahabad high court had rejected a petition filed against the SDM court’s order and asked Khan to approach a lower court. The district court of Rampur, while hearing the petition, had put a stay on the decision back then. But now, after two years, district judge Gaurav Kumar Srivastava has set aside the stay, paving way for the demolition of the huge gate. The court also slapped a fine of Rs 1.6crore as damages for encroaching on government property from June 2016 to May 2019. The judge also said that Khan’s trust will pay Rs 4.55lkah per month till the removal of the encroachment. The complaint against the "illegal" possession of the government land was filed by a local BJP worker Akash Saxena in 2019. In his complaint, Saxena had alleged that the gate of Jauhar University was built on a road that was constructed by the PWD with a budget of Rs 13crore. Khan, 72, a former UP minister, is facing close t0 100 criminal cases. He is currently lodged in UP’s Sitapur jail since February last year. Saxena told TOI, “I had made an official complaint in the court of SDM (Sadar) that the university’s gate was made on government road. After finding my complaint correct, an order was passed to demolish the gate. But the Jauhar trust and Azam Khan had filed an appeal in district judge’s court. Their appeal has been cancelled now. “Now the old order of the SDM stands active. I request the district administration to demolish the gate immediately as local farmers face difficulties in commuting through that road.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/sprawling-gate-of-azams-varsity-to-be-razed-says-court/articleshow/84984960.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Women rank holders crop hair as a mark of protest||Thiruvananthapuram: PSC rank holders began fresh protests in front of the secretariat on Monday after the government refused to extend the validity of rank-lists further. Close to 500 PSC rank lists are set to expire on Tuesday. The rank holders for women police constable posts protested in front of the secretariat by cropping their hair. The other protestors include last grade, LDC and staff nurse rank-holders. The protesting rank holders from the women police constable list said that they have not received any rank list tenure extension benefit and their efforts would go down the drain if the rank lists expire. “The vacancies for women police constables were called by PSC in 2017 and our rank list was published on Aug 4 2020. The validity of our rank list will expire tomorrow and no extension was given for our rank list. Of the 2,100 members in the rank list, only 597 people received advice memos in the past four years which is not in sync with reality. At least 1,400 vacancies were expected,” said Minila from Kadakkal in Kollam, who is one of the protesting rank holders. She said that protestors are pinning their hopes on the verdict of the administrative tribunal. “We will decide on the further course of action on Tuesday. The chief minister has already said that the validity of the rank list will not be extended further. Even the benefits of the first extension were not applicable to us (our list),” she said. Meanwhile, PSC approached the high court against the administrative tribunal’s verdict to extend the validity of the rank lists. The rank holders had resorted to protest measures prior to the announcement of assembly elections. The government had then given several assurances to them, but the rank holders are saying that the majority of the promises given by the government have not been met.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/women-rank-holders-crop-hair-as-a-mark-of-protest/articleshow/84987118.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Covid-19 in West Bengal: Cinemas set to reopen after break||KOLKATA: Free tickets for Olympians, vaccinated staff and opportunity to book auditorium for private screenings of favourite content will be on offer when city multiplexes reopen this Thursday. A 2021 American superhero film based on the DC Comics team ‘Suicide Squad’ will be the first English film that Kolkata’s movie-goers will get to watch when multiplexes reopen after a gap of over three months. INOX at Quest, Swabhumi, City Centre 1, Metro, Liluah and Madhyamgram will reopen on August 5 with this James Gunn film that is a wacky take on the DC Comics story. Carnival Salt Lake will reopen on August 13 with ‘The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It’. PVR Cinemas is renegotiating with malls and will reopen as soon as that is done. Various plans have been undertaken to woo viewers back to the theatres. INOX has announced free movie tickets to all Indian Olympians for a year. “The medalists will be entitled to a free movie experience for their lifetime. The announcement is an extension of INOX group’s association with the Indian Olympic Association as the official sponsor of the Indian Olympic team,” said Amitava Guha Thakurta, regional director at INOX (East). Patrons can reserve an entire auditorium for a private show and choose content from either the current play list or an old blockbuster. In the current playlist, INOX will be screening ‘Mortal Kombat’ along with ‘The Suicide Squad’ from Thursday. The former has already been released nationally on July 30 in other states. Kushagra Jalan, who is distributing both these films on behalf of Warner Bros in Bengal, told TOI that quite a few Hollywood movies are lined up for August release. “On August 13, we will release ‘The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It’. The number of shows will depend on the number of screens that multiplexes decide to open. As far as NBC Universal and Warner Bros are concerned, there are at least one film up for release for the next five weeks,” Jalan said. Among them, significant Hollywood films are Vin Diesel’s ‘Fast & Furious 9 – The Fast Saga’, Bob Odenkirk’s ‘Nobody’ and M Night Shyamalan’s ‘Old’. “There are talks about ‘The Croods: A New Age’ and ‘Mukhosh’ releasing on August 13. Akshay Kumar’s ‘Bell Bottom’ will release on August 19,” said Sujit Kumar Bhukta, general manager (east) of Carnival Cinemas. Disney’s ‘Black Widow’ starring Scarlett Johansson is also awaited. According to Ujjal Biswas, senior executive, programming, PVR Cinemas, negotiations with various malls are on. “All are staffers have been vaccinated. We will reopen as soon as we renegotiate with the various malls. PVR Uniworld in Rajarhat might be the first to open. That will be followed by our properties in Jessore, Mani Square and Howrah,” Biswas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cinemas-set-to-reopen-after-covid-2nd-break/articleshow/84987098.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Bengaluru||Cabinet expansion likely in 1-2 days, says Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai||BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: The much-awaited Cabinet expansion is likely to take place on Wednesday or Thursday, Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai said on Monday. “It was a fruitful meeting with BJP national president (JP Nadda). The list of those to be inducted will be released by the central leadership by tomorrow evening. They will decide whether it will be a single-phase or two-phase induction,” the CM said after the meeting, which began around 9pm and went on for about an hour. Party sources said Bommai’s efforts to expand the cabinet at the earliest in view of the flood situation in parts of the state and the threat of a third Covid wave were stalled even after five days of becoming CM due to wrangling over ministerial berths. Bommai’s plan to induct 15-20 ministers was shelved after his predecessor, BS Yediyurappa, demanded that his son BY Vijayendra be made deputy CM, and that all migrant MLAs from Congress and JD(S), who helped him to form the government in 2019, be inducted. He also wants two of his detractors, Basannagouda Patil Yatnal and Arvind Bellad, to be kept out of the cabinet,” a source said. “Cabinet expansion will happen on Wednesday or Thursday. Unlike the previous cabinet, this time, we are considering parity in regional representation and social justice which needs to be meted out by way of inducting new members,” Bommai said. Asked about the former CM’s demands, he said cryptically, “All those details will be clarified when the list of ministers to be sworn-in is released officially.” After a two-visit to Delhi last week, Bommai flew out again on Sunday night. Early Monday morning, he met party national general secretary (organisation) BL Santosh. During his meeting with Nadda, sources said, the CM is likely to have discussed the number of deputy CMs — five or three — to be appointed in the new dispensation. Frontrunners for the deputy CM posts are R Ashoka and CN Ashwath Narayan (among Vokkaligas), Govind Karjol and Arvind Limbavali (Dalit), B Sriramulu (ST) and V Sunil Kumar (OBC), besides Lingayat representatives BY Vijayendra, Arvind Bellad, Murugesh Nirani and Basangouda Patil Yatnal. The biggest challenge will be determining the role of 15 “outsiders” who were accommodated in the Yediyurappa government. In all probability, the Bommai government may retain about 50% of the ministers from the previous government. There is speculation that former health and medical education minister K Sudhakar and deputy CM Ashwath Narayan will be inducted on priority as they were at the helm of efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. S Suresh Kumar, despite his efforts in conducting the SSLC exams in 2020 and 2021, may make way for SA Ramdas from his district, Mysuru, sources said. From the Hyderabad-Karnataka region, which was poorly represented previously, 38-year-old Dattatreya Patil Revoor’s name is doing the rounds as he fits the bill on regional representation and induction of youngsters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cabinet-expansion-likely-in-1-2-days-cm/articleshow/84992282.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Kerala, Maharashtra travellers sans certificate to quarantine in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Those entering Bengaluru from Maharashtra and Kerala without a Covid-19 negative certificate will have to undergo testing on arrival and remain in institutional quarantine till they test negative. “It is mandatory for travellers from these states to submit the RT-PCR negative report obtained within 72 hours. If the report is not submitted, then the healthcare team will swab them. The travellers will have to remain in institutional quarantine until the report is received,” BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta has said. He was speaking at a coordination meeting held between BBMP and the police department on enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour. Noting that a large number of travellers from Kerala and Maharashtra are coming to the city, the chief commissioner said teams have been deployed at major bus stops and railway stations in this regard. Bengaluru Urban deputy commissioner J Manjunath said the RT-PCR reports for those coming from Maharashtra and Kerala will be verified at checkposts. “If they are not carrying negative report, then they will be housed in Covid care centres or government hospitals until they are found negative,” Manjunath said. BBMP administrator Rakesh Singh said RT-PCR negative reports are not needed for inter-district travellers entering Bengaluru. Karnataka saw 1,285 new Covid cases on Monday, of which 290 were from Bengaluru. Of the 25 Covid fatalities reported in the state, five were from Bengaluru. “BBMP has been taking precautionary measures such as triage, contact tracing, isolation, and areas with three or more cases are made containment zones to stop the spread,” he said. Singh said BBMP officers must work in coordination with police to raise awareness among people. “If citizens are found flouting the rules, even after raising awareness, they must be penalised and cases must be filed against them,” he said. Gupta stressed the need to abide by the 10pm-5am curfew and said police cooperation is key. Awareness on norms must be raised through loudspeakers, he said. During the meeting, police commissioner Kamal Pant said those not following rules will be booked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kerala-maha-travellers-sans-cert-to-quarantine/articleshow/84992284.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Congolese man’s death triggers clash with cops||BENGALURU: Police resorted to a lathicharge to disperse about 25 African nationals demonstrating outside JC Nagar police station on Monday against the alleged custodial death of a Congo national, who, arrested for drug-peddling, manhandled cops. Two policemen and as many protesters sustained head injuries in the melee. Five men have been detained. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai defended police lathicharge since those involved in drug racket ‘behave violently’ and said the CID will probe the incident. “When protesters tried to assault cops, the latter took the correct action,” he added. City police commissioner Kamal Pant said the the probe will follow NHRC guidelines in such cases. DCP (North) Dharmender Kumar Meena said they caned the protesters when they attacked cops. The protesters were making false allegations that the Congo national, arrested on drugpeddling charges, was beaten up by police. The doctors say he died of cardiac arrest and there were no physical injuries. An investigation will reveal the reason behind the death. But the protesters started making false statements and attacked our men,” he said. According to Meena, Joan alias Joel Shindani Malu was caught with 5gm of MDMA tablets at Babusapalya, Hennur, around Sunday midnight. While his associate sped away on a gearless scooter, John was brought to the police station around 2am Monday. “An FIR under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was registered at the station. Later, John was kept there for want of ascertaining his identity and legal action. At 5.10am, staff at the station informed sub-inspector Raghupati, who had arrested John, that the detainee was complaining of chest pain. Raghupati shifted him to Chiraayu Hospital at 5.30am. On preliminary examination, he was diagnosed with bradycardia and administrated CPR and other lifesaving interventions. At 6.45am, he was declared dead due to suspected cardiac arrest,” Meena said. Another officer said John was overstaying his passport, which had expired in December 2017. “John was into drug-peddling and we wanted to catch him red-handed. And we did. Unfortunately, he died,” a senior cop said. Bosco Kaweesi, a legal adviser, All Africa Students’ Association, said, “It is unfortunate our men took the wrong step by provoking police for no reason. Police contacted me at 4am saying they have arrested John on drug-peddling charges. They updated me when he developed chest pain and was shifted to hospital.” Bosco claimed he was in the station throughout the day and was working with the cops on the issue. “Initially, cops were cooperative with us, but they lost patience when our men behaved improperly. If our people have any doubt on the cause of death, we should wait till the postmortem report comes. If we have evidence against cops, we must approach the embassy and not create ruckus on the road,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/congolese-mans-death-triggers-clash-with-cops/articleshow/84992286.cms||---

A circular was issued by the state government on July 31 and it has come into effect from August 1. Many states have suspended giving Covaxin for the first dose since the last week of July due to shortage. “Currently, only second dose of Covaxin will be provided at government centres,” said Dr Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National health mission, Karnataka. Administration of Covaxin as the first dose will resume as and when the supply situation stabilises, say authorities. Data from health and family welfare department shows about 6.1 lakh people took the first dose of Covaxin over four weeks ago and have not yet come forward to take the second dose so far. “We need to administer the second dose to all who are due,” said Chandrashekar. The state currently has about 22,000 doses of Covaxin at its buffer storage facility in Bengaluru and another 1.5 lakh doses have been already supplied to all districts, including BBMP. The health department has directed authorities that the emphasis should be on giving existing Covaxin recipients the second shot and fully vaccinating them. It also said awareness should be created among recipients to turn up for the second shot as and when it becomes due, without delay. Covaxin continues to be available for the first dose in private hospitals. The cost of one dose of Covaxin in private vaccination centres is Rs 1,410. Covishield first dose available:Covishield continues to be available for the first dose at all government vaccination centres.

On May 7, the health department had suspended the administration of first dose of both Covishield and Covaxin at government centres due to shortage of vaccines and said the entire supply would to be used for the second dose. By May-end, as supplies were streamlined, the department started administering both first and second doses. “Between Covishield and Covaxin, many prefer Covaxin because both doses will get over in four weeks,” said a district health officer. “We do tell them that both vaccines are effective. But the spacing of 84 days between the two doses for Covishield is pushing many to take Covaxin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/no-covaxin-for-1st-dose-at-govt-vaccine-centres/articleshow/85001065.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Many states have suspended giving Covaxin for the first dose since the last week of July due to shortage. “Currently, only second dose of Covaxin will be provided at government centres,” said Dr Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National health mission, Karnataka. Administration of Covaxin as the first dose will resume as and when the supply situation stabilises, say authorities. Data from health and family welfare department shows about 6.1 lakh people took the first dose of Covaxin over four weeks ago and have not yet come forward to take the second dose so far. “We need to administer the second dose to all who are due,” said Chandrashekar. The state currently has about 22,000 doses of Covaxin at its buffer storage facility in Bengaluru and another 1.5 lakh doses have been already supplied to all districts, including BBMP. The health department has directed authorities that the emphasis should be on giving existing Covaxin recipients the second shot and fully vaccinating them. It also said awareness should be created among recipients to turn up for the second shot as and when it becomes due, without delay. Covaxin continues to be available for the first dose in private hospitals. The cost of one dose of Covaxin in private vaccination centres is Rs 1,410. Covishield first dose available:Covishield continues to be available for the first dose at all government vaccination centres. The districts, however, have been directed to reserve a part their allocation exclusively for the second dose, reads the circular, a copy of which is with TOI. On May 7, the health department had suspended the administration of first dose of both Covishield and Covaxin at government centres due to shortage of vaccines and said the entire supply would to be used for the second dose. By May-end, as supplies were streamlined, the department started administering both first and second doses. “Between Covishield and Covaxin, many prefer Covaxin because both doses will get over in four weeks,” said a district health officer. “We do tell them that both vaccines are effective. But the spacing of 84 days between the two doses for Covishield is pushing many to take Covaxin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/no-covaxin-for-1st-dose-at-govt-vaccine-centres/articleshow/85001066.cms||Sunitha Rao R

According to a press release by MSEDCL, a total of 85,963 farmers in the state have been given 3, 5 and 7.5 horse power solar agricultural pumps. “All these farmers have been provided uninterrupted power supply during the day and have also been freed from electricity bills,” the release stated. Stating that state energy minister Nitin Raut has given a big impetus to the new connection of agricultural pumps through the policy of independent agricultural pump connection, the release added that chairman and managing director of MSEDCL Vijay Singhal conducted a review meeting, during which he instructed the authorities to “take special efforts”. Officials informed that priority is being given to farmers in remote and tribal areas. “Only 10% of the basic price of solar agricultural pump is paid by the farmers in the general category, and 5% of the basic price by the farmers belonging to the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe,” they added. So far, around 2.4 lakh applications have been received from the state.” This includes 46,700 from Aurangabad regional office, 20,199 from Nagpur, 13,091 from Konkan and 5, 973 from Pune. Over a lakh applications were rejected due to various reasons such as incomplete documents, solar pump connections found during inspection of place, non-availability of water supply, lack of water resource etc,” the release stated, adding that as the warranty period of installed solar pumps and panels is five and ten years respectively, the cost of maintenance for farmers is zero.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/solar-pumps-ensure-daily-irrigation-for-86000-farmers/articleshow/84989338.cms||Manka Behl

The bird, which has a highly distinctive nasal call, was spotted recently on top of a tree at the Priyadarshini Garden by four young nature-lovers — Chinmay Pathak, Sakshi Save, Shubham Shinde and Gayatri Jaiswal. “We were documenting different insects found at the Priyadarshini Garden and had a sighting of the Brahminy Kite. The find is definitely surprising as the bird is mostly seen near waterbodies such as lakes and it feeds on aquatic creatures such as fish and crabs,” Pathak said. Common in western and eastern parts of India, but rare in Marathwada, Brahminy Kite has a brick-red-coloured back and white on the front and its head. “Priyadarshini Garden has a small lake and that may have attracted the bird. The garden also has tall trees that are preferred by these birds for nesting,” Pathak said. Earlier, rarely spotted birds including Forest Wagtail and Malabar Whistling Thrush were also spotted at Priyadarshini Garden. Honorary Wildlife Warden for Aurangabad Kishor Pathak said sighting of Brahminy Kite has once again underscored the rich biodiversity present at Priyadarshini Garden. “The memorial of late Shiv Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray is coming up at Priyadarshini Garden and the same should not harm the local ecology. The lake present inside the garden and other flora and fauna need to be conserved while setting up the memorial,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-brahminy-kite-spotted-for-1st-time-at-priyasarshini-garden/articleshow/84984976.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Delhi||Ensure street vendors get Covid shots: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Monday said it expects street vendors would get vaccinated proactively so that the third wave of Covid-19 could be avoided and the national capital was not faced with a surge as witnessed recently. The court also asked Delhi government to consider in a right perspective the issue of allowing more weekly markets to operate, pointing out that there is a strata of society that only purchases things from these markets since they cannot afford other shops. TimesViewDelhi high court is right in its observation. Street vendors must be vaccinated proactively. They interact with many people every day. Vaccination is imperative for their own safety and that of their customers.At present due to Covid-19 restrictions, Delhi government has allowed weekly markets to open but only with 50% of vendors and one market in each municipal zone. “It is expected that Delhi Disaster Management Authority will consider this aspect in its right perspective. It is also expected that street vendors will also take pro-active steps to get vaccinated so that we can avoid the third wave and the NCT of Delhi is not faced with a surge as faced recently,” Justice Rekha Palli said. The court, however, made it clear it is not asking Delhi government to allow all weekly markets to operate and said the authorities shall consider the issue and then take a decision. It also suggested the government can put conditions so that there is no crowding at these markets, while issuing notice to Delhi government on a petition by Saptahik Patri Bazar Association, which has challenged the authorities’ decision to open malls and markets, but not weekly markets. The plea said restrictions on other activities were relaxed on June 13, while “these vendors — who belong to the poorest of poor class — are suffering”. When the court said opening of these markets will lead to an increase in crowd, the petitioner’s counsel said if only one weekly market is allowed to be open in a municipal zone, there will be more crowd because there are people who buy goods only from these markets. On its part, Delhi government submitted that suddenly a spike has been seen in Covid-19 cases recently and while the daily average was 45-49 cases, 85 cases were recorded on Sunday. It said the authorities will consider the issue and inform the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensure-street-vendors-get-shots-hc/articleshow/84989350.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Cops and NGO give wings to the lockdown-hit||Nagpur: Overcoming the perils of Covid lockdown which had snatched their livelihood, eight women and two men from Bajeria locality on Monday started an online tiffin service based on community cloud kitchen concept. The service, under the banner of ‘Ahaar Foods’, was inaugurated at Ganeshpeth police station in the presence of DCP Lohit Matani and volunteers of NGO Angipankh, who were involved in training and guiding the group. “My tiffin service business had to be wrapped up during the Covid lockdown. It was difficult to manage family financially, especially with two growing-up children completing studies,” said Manju Bajpayee, whose husband is a priest. She was among the eight women and two men who were trained by volunteers of NGO Angipankh into the profit-making business models and modalities of a tiffin service and the concept of cloud kitchen along with online delivery system similar to food delivery service provider Zomato. Ganeshpeth police and NGO Agnipankh had joined hands to empower a bunch of lockdown-affected home-makers and some jobless men too whose livelihood was jeopardized during the pandemic. The joint initiative, through ‘Project Saksham’, not only resulted in the launch of an affordable cloud kitchen-based tiffin service, but also a car washing service. DCP Matani, who conceptualized the project, said empowering women, out-of-work men and youngsters with some skill development training and assistance in setting up livelihood ventures will ultimately help many from sensitive locality like Bajeria where economic struggles often pave way to crime. “These eight women would be managing the tiffin service, which can cater to customers with low budget but with quality food. Menfolk from the neighbourhood or families can participate in the delivery chains, similar to Zomato,” he said, adding senior PI Bharat Kshirsagar of Ganeshpeth police station came forward with logistics support. “We have also initiated a car washing service which will keep youngsters from the locality engaged in some productive and paying works. Each youngster can earn up to Rs100-150 per car wash assignment. These youngsters would remain involved in the pursuit of their livelihood and refrain from participating in illegal activities,” said the DCP. Agnipankh’s Yash Narnaware said his NGO had trained the women to understand the profitability factors and the manner in which the businesses had to be approached rather than doing them in traditional way. One of the beneficiaries, Abha Chandel, a widow with a son, rued about her tiffin service having failed in the past. “We have received skill development training in bakery products, laundry, beauty parlour and also sewing over a period of time,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-and-ngo-give-wings-to-the-lockdown-hit/articleshow/84987259.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kolkata||‘Gachher Iskul’ under neem tree spreads joy of learning among kids||Kolkata: While all schools have been shut due to the pandemic, some 50-odd children from a remote area of Murshidabad are attending ‘Gachher Iskul.’ Founded in March this year near a century-old neem tree that was saved by its teacher, the school is meant for preventing dropouts during the lockdown. Students in this green school have no access to online education. Besides studying in the evening, their aim is to plant 1,000 neem trees in the locality. Visva Bharati’s alumnus Angshuman Thakur had started work on environmental issues from 2019. “I have been inspired by Tagore and tried to reach out to a generation that would want to save the environment from childhood. That’s how Gacher Iskul was founded for the children who live in the Bagdabra forest area of Murshidabad. I teach there when I get time,” said Thakur, who works as a teacher of Farakka College. This open school was founded in March this year by Angshuman ThakurChildren, aged between five and 10 years, come there late in the afternoon. There is no classroom but the shade of a tree is good enough. Doli Singha, a teacher, said, “I love the tree like a human being. When I saw a neighbour chopping it off, I informed the police to prevent that.” Her effort had paid off. Singha divides the students into two groups. For beginners, she uses drawings to develop their interest. “So, instead of writing number one, I draw a candle. It’s a duck in place of number two. For the rest, I teach them how to dance, recite Bengali poems and sing Santhali language songs,” she said. A teacher from Thakur’s college pays Singha’s monthly salary. “Even social media users have donated to provide meals to the students,” Thakur said. Ten-year-old Oliva Tudu, whose father is a driver, comes to study at the school along with her brother. “I study in Pasupara Primary School. Apart from song and dance, we are taught everything that we have forgotten because our school has been shut for long. I enjoy coming here and play once the classes are over,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gachher-iskul-under-neem-tree-spreads-joy-of-learning-among-kids/articleshow/84987163.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Northern districts from Thrissur will be benefited with this, he said. In no districts there exists any shortage of seats for Plus One admissions. The government has done an analysis of the seats based on the admission of students in various streams from 2015 to 2020. In this analysis it was found that there was no need for any marginal increase in the seats, he said. It has been noticed that in every district the higher secondary seats are becoming vacant after the admission process. This has been the past experience. With the decision to increase 20% seats in the Malabar region, 61,230 seats will be increased in the higher secondary course in this region, said the minister. It has been decided to provide digital facilities to all students before the commencement of online education. The exact number of students lacking digital facilities to attend online classes have been compiled at the school level in each district. The district collectors were asked to compile the statistics of students in their respective region and report to the education department. A final state-level figure will be released soon, said the minister. Sivankutty said that online classes are progressing in the Google G Suite platform complying with all cyber laws. All safety measures have been taken for online classes through this platform. The government has made specific instructions that all details be uploaded on the platform, and the custodian of the data will be only the government. These data (study materials) cannot be used for any other purposes or misutilized. The government has entered into an agreement with Google for this, said the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/malabar-gets-20-raise-in-plus-i-seats/articleshow/84987181.cms||---

The complainant, who is BJP’s zonal president of yuva morcha in Sambhal, has accused police of inaction. He has also alleged that a fellow party worker was behind the abduction of his daughter. The family has been sitting on dharna outside the office of senior superintendent of police (SSP) since July 14, demanding action against the BJP worker. “We have been running from pillar to post for the last eight months. My daughter, who was living at her grandparent’s house in the Majhola area, went out and didn’t return home. She went missing in January this year. After that I had registered a complaint against the BJP man we suspect was behind my daughter’s abduction. Since he is also a BJP worker, no action has been taken in the case so far,” alleged the complainant. “It has been 19 days since we are staging dharna and demanding action in the case and we will continue the protest until my daughter is recovered,” the complainant told the media on Monday. Superintendent of police, Moradabad, Amit Kumar Anand said, “The 13-year-old girl, a resident of Sambhal, who was living in Kashiram Nagar in Majhola, Moradabad, has been missing for the last eight months.

---||Delhi||New frog species named after DU ex-VC||NEW DELHI: A tiny new species of frog from the Western Ghats has been named after a former vice-chancellor of Delhi University. Professor SD Biju, popularly known as Frogman of India, and Dr Sonali Garg, who had discovered a new species of frog recently, have named it Minervarya pentali as a tribute to professor Deepak Pental for his support and encouragement for setting up of the Systematics Lab at DU and for funding researches during his tenure. According to Biju, the new species was discovered from the globally recognised Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot that extends along the southwest coast of the Indian Peninsula. The discovery was made during a comprehensive study on a considerably large, common, yet a confusing group of Indian frogs — genus Minervarya (common name: Minervaryan frogs), carried out over a period of nearly ten years. The new species was identified based on multiple criteria, such as external morphology, DNA and calling pattern. The study has resolved the identity and taxonomic status of all known members of the genus from Peninsular India, in addition to clarifying the geographical ranges of species and providing numerous new distribution records based on morphologically and genetically identified samples from a vast region. The findings are published in a scientific article titled ‘DNA Barcoding and Systematic Review of Minervaryan Frogs (Dicroglossidae: Minervarya) of Peninsular India: Resolution of a taxonomic conundrum with description of a new species’ in the international journal Asian Herpetological Research. “It is a privilege to name a frog species after Professor Deepak Pental, the former VC of DU, in appreciation of his tremendous support and encouragement for setting up of the Systematics Lab at University of Delhi — where research leading to the discovery and description of nearly one-fourth of all known Indian amphibians has been carried out,” said Biju. Speaking to TOI, Pental said that “unfortunately research and development, which is the backbone of prosperity and progress of society, has taken a beating in India in recent times with just 0.7% of GDP going into R&D. What SD Biju has done is real research discovering amphibians which many thought have ceased to exist. The discoveries not only express his zeal towards environmental research, but he also has an eye for it.” On the discovery, co-author Sonali Garg said: “We discovered it from wayside vegetation at multiple localities in Kerala and Tamil Nadu while surveying amphibians during the monsoon season. This species is also among the smallest known Minervaryan frogs, which is probably one of the reasons it was overlooked until now.” This study and the authors were funded by University of Delhi; Department of Science and Technology, Government of India; Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India; Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund, USA; and Global Wildlife Conservation, USA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-frog-species-named-after-du-ex-vc/articleshow/84989412.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

The boxer, who has already bagged many medals, is now raring to go.Manpreet Kaur, Arshpreet’s mother, says her daughter won a bronze medal in boxing in the National Championship on July 30 in the 48-50kg weight category. She adds that her daughter is three-time gold medalist at state level and, on the basis of her performance at the championship, she has been selected for Fourth Junior Girls and Third Junior Boys Boxing Championship 2021 and she bagged a bronze at the championship on July 30, again in 48-50kg weight category. But unfortunately, the outbreak of Covid-19, made her pause in her stride towards excellence, as national championship was cancelled twice.Arshpreet says she has been training since she was nine years old. Arshpreet says she fell in love with boxing after seeing Late Ajmer Singh Sidhu and Baldev Singh Sidhu, proprietor Sher-E-Punjab Sports Academy in Chakar, in action. She adds that initially she was trained by Khushdeepak Kumar, a local coach from the academy. The academy, incidentally, is where Simranjit Kaur, who had gone to the Tokyo Olympics 2020, also took training from initially. Arshpreet says she went to Patiala for advance coaching. At present, she says she is training under Sunil Dutta in Patiala. “I am working very hard so I could win Olympic medals in future. My mission is to win the gold at the Olympic arena and make my country proud. I train hard every day and don’t miss my trainings.

---||Business||IT employees wooed with bonuses & bikes||BENGALURU: It’s raining jobs in Indian IT. But there aren’t enough qualified people. So resignations are soaring in the $195-billion industry. Everyone’s poaching from each other. Techies with a few years of experience are holding multiple job offers. They are being wooed with joining bonuses. Fintech firm BharatPe is offering BMW bikes to new joinees. There are others offering iPhones and flexi-working. Some companies are even paying Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 each to candidates to take their assessment tests, irrespective of whether the candidates eventually join these firms. Recruitment firms are minting money. But they are also at their wits end. They are working overtime, and candidate negotiations have become a nightmare. By the time they make an offer, the candidate has received another better one. And then they have to go back to their client to see if they could up their offer. Saravanan Balasundaram, founder and CEO of talent consultancy firm Han Digital, said they schedule more than 1,000 interviews a week, but in 40% of these cases, either the candidate does not show up, or internet connectivity issues result in the interview being cancelled or postponed. “Of the 600 interviews that happen, only about 75 join,” he said. Siva Prasad Nanduri, VP and business head at IT staffing firm TeamLease Digital, said the talent demand from IT firms was 5,000 in the quarter ended April, but this jumped to 20,000 in the quarter ended June. TCS, Infosys, HCL and Wipro together expect to hire 1 lakh people this fiscal year. Cognizant alone plans to hire 1 lakh experienced professionals and onboard 30,000 freshers this year, as also make 45,000 offers to campus recruits who would join the company next year. Global demand for digitisation, following the experiences of the pandemic, has resulted in a sharp pickup in business for IT firms. Anurag Gupta, CEO of IT staffing at First Meridian Business Services, said the first two months of the pandemic last year was chaotic, with many firms firing talent on the bench in anticipation of subdued demand. “But in the last three quarters, demand has increased substantially and customers of IT firms who had deferred their digital transformation agendas collapsed the timelines. Our clients who were working on leaner budgets are opening their wallets to fill vacancies,” he said. Vijay Sivaram, CEO of IT staffing in recruitment firm Quess, said organisations are seeing 30-50% of those to whom they make offers, not taking them up. “The 60-90-day notice period is also allowing them to shop for more offers. The more skilled they are, the more offers they have,” he said. DevOps, Kubernetes, cloud and analytics, Sivaram said, are in big demand. Gupta said there is such a dearth of people experienced in AI/ML that those with 5-7 years of experience are commanding salary packages of Rs 40-50 lakh. Kamal Karanth, co-founder of staffing firm Xpheno, said product companies have always enjoyed a premium amongst IT jobseekers and their onboarding ratio was 98-100% last year. But this ratio has dropped to the 80s in the last 3-4 months, indicating that employees are shopping for other offers. “IT services companies had an onboarding ratio of about 80% pre-Covid, and now that’s dropped to 45-50%,” he said. Karanth said companies are responding to the new realities by interviewing only candidates on notice periods – allowing less time for them to shop for other offers – and reducing the number of interview rounds to make offers faster. The average time from the first round of interview to releasing the offer is now down to an average of 8-10 days, he said. Balasundaram said about a fifth of those they hire are specialists, and they require exceptional approval from clients. The onboarding time frame is 45-60 days, including the interview rounds. That’s a lot of time for candidates to shop for offers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/it-employees-wooed-with-bonuses-bikes/articleshow/84992370.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

The high court bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni said, “Since there is no allegation in the petition to the effect that absolutely no action has been taken in pursuance of court order dated 2017, we are inclined to grant time to respondents to report extent of progress in next three months in regard to handing over of land marked as forest.” At the hearing, the high court remarked that NGO Vanashakti’s plea was “vague” and said, “We cannot go on the basis of such vague prayers.”  The high court said that original order directing transfer of mangroves to forest department was in a 2006 PIL filed by environmental group, BEAG, “which has made no grievance of order not being complied with”. The high court added, “on the contrary” Vansahkti, which was not a party then, has “threatened” contempt action in a fresh petition filed in 2021. The high court said, “We are of the view that petitioner has not done necessary research but being concerned, we have called for additional documents.” Cidco, through its counsel, said it has already transferred 1,400 hectares and is in process of complying with the order. The forest department affidavit said the department has been “diligently pursuing the issue of notifying and transferring possession of government-owned or public agency-owned mangrove land to the forest department.’’ In Mumbai city, 253 hectare is handed over and in the suburbs over 3,800 hectares while in Thane 3,262 hectare is handed over. The JNPT in its reply denied any non-compliance and said that a contempt notice issued by Vanashakti is not maintainable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-takes-up-mangrove-land-transfer-issue/articleshow/84989399.cms||Swati Deshpande

The girl’s family alleged that the accused stuffed cloth into the girl’s mouth and raped her. Police said the two accused were booked and a probe was ordered. The girl’s family told police that the incident came to light when a boy, a resident of the same village, spotted the youths forcing themselves onto the girl and informed them about the crime. The family alleged that when they reached the spot to rescue the girl, the youth, who were armed with pistols, threatened to shoot them and fled the scene. Sambhal additional superintendent of police (ASP) Alok Kumar Jaiswal said, “Based on the family’s complaint, an FIR has been registered against the accused and a probe has also been ordered. The girl’s medical examination is being conducted. Further legal action is underway.” Station house officer of Gunnaur police station said an FIR was registered against the two accused under section 376D (punishment for gang-rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and appropriate sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. One of the accused was arrested, added the SHO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/girl-14-gangraped-by-two-youths-in-sambhal/articleshow/84985091.cms||Maria Khan

She is partially mentally disturbed. In the meanwhile, the four persons arrested so far for their roles in the gang-rape, were produced before the court on Monday. The court sent them to police custody till August 5. All the four are autorickshaw drivers. Two autorickshaw drivers had taken her to the room of two railway coolies at Timki, where the four had raped her. Later, she was again raped by another two autorickshaw drivers in front of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH). During investigation, the cops had noticed a swelling on the girl’s hand. Upon questioning, she had revealed about the pin which she had inserted into herself. The teenager was rushed to IGGMCH, where X-ray confirmed the pin in her forearm, following which the surgery was performed to remove it. The case was handed over to ACP, Sitabuldi police station, Trupti Jadhav as investigation officer. Police said two railway coolies, who were also involved in the case, have most probably sneaked away to Rajasthan, which is their native place. Police are also trying to nab yet another autorickshaw driver in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rape-survivor-has-surgery-to-remove-pin-in-her-arm/articleshow/84987337.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kochi||Kerala: Special investigation team asks EC to probe ‘poll offences’ of BJP||THRISSUR: Special investigation team (SIT), team probing the highway heist case, has submitted a report before Election Commission (EC) requesting an enquiry into the ‘alleged violation of election laws by BJP’ in Kerala during recent assembly polls. According to SIT’s report, illegal money to the tune Rs 41.4 crore was brought to Kerala and distributed among state BJP leaders during the recent assembly election campaign. SIT sources said money was brought as per the directive of BJP leaders and it was disbursed on their order. SIT officers said they came to these conclusions based on the statements of witnesses like Dharmarajan, who claimed that he had sent the money that was looted, and corroborative evidence like call records. According to SIT sources, there must be a probe to find if these amounts were captured in poll expenditure data of BJP candidates. SIT officers pointed out that Dharmarajan had filed a claim petition at Irinjalakuda court demanding that the money recovered by the police should be handed over to him as it was his money. However, he delayed submission of supportive documents to prove his claim fearing that such a step would expose the involvement of BJP leaders in the transport and distribution of money, added an SIT officer. SIT sources said Dharmarajan, who admitted that he was an RSS man, had said that some money was distributed among local body members of BJP in Konni, where party state president K Surendran contested. The probe team requested EC to probe the charges of violation of election rules there. SIT officers said they will be probing this angle in the highway heist case too. SIT officers submitted reports to enforcement directorate (ED) and I-T department for probe. They said ED could be in a position to identify the source of the illegal money. SIT sources had received inputs that the money was mobilized from Karnataka. But, its efforts to pinpoint the source of money have not borne fruit. SIT tried to question some BJP leaders, including an MLC, in Karnataka, but they failed due to the non-cooperation of BJP leaders in Karnataka, sources said. “We will focus on recovering the remaining amount and election-related offences,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sit-asks-ec-to-probe-poll-offences-of-bjp/articleshow/84987363.cms||T Ramavarman

---||Nagpur||PWD cuts 25 more trees overnight near Bapu Kuti||Nagpur: The public works department’s (PWD) blatant lie was exposed on Monday when it felled another 25 huge trees sometime in the night, for the second consecutive night. On Saturday midnight the agency had felled 29 big trees but no compensatory saplings have been planted as promised. On July 21, executive engineer PN Boob told TOI, “We need to fell 140 trees on Sewagram-Wardha-Dattapur stretch. These trees will be felled only after planting 10 times the saplings in lieu of the felled ones.” Considering that 54 big trees have been felled by PWD on Saturday and Sunday night, it was supposed to plant 540 saplings, but not one has been planted. Boob reiterated, “We felled 45 trees and have done compensatory plantation on the roadside. I will send you images of the saplings planted.” However, till the filing of this report Boob had failed to send images of the planted saplings. Repeated attempts to call Boob proved futile as his cell phone was switched off. PWD superintending engineer Sushma Sakharwade said she will ask Boob to send images of planted saplings, but it was not done. “When it comes to compensatory plantations, the track record of PWD is dubious, and even if trees are planted, their survival is poor. On the Bapu Kuti road, maximum trees could have been saved by installing speed breakers, caution boards, reflectors etc. The PWD, local politicians, and contractors have no regard for green cover in the land of the Mahatma. What more can you expect,” said Anasuya Kale-Chhabrani, founder, Together We Can, a group of green NGOs. “There are at least 1,500 big trees in the 12km stretch between Dattapur and Sevagram. Of these trees, PWD planned to fell 200 trees. It felled 79 trees last year. In the last two days, 54 trees were felled. It is most likely that tree felling will continue further. The sarpanch told us that no NOC was taken from Nalwadi and Masala gram panchayats for felling these trees,” said ecologist Alok Bang. The trees are being chopped to widen Wardha-Sevagram-Samudrapur-Girad-Umred (SH-326) stretch up to Shedgaon, including Hamdapur junction to Wardha-Hinganghat (SH-328). Members of Vriksh Bachao Nagrik Samiti (VBNS) said, “The PWD has breached trust by not keeping its promise. During a joint survey on March 24, it agreed to trim branches, cut drain sections for girth widening, redesign the road to remove dividers in sections where the road has been narrowed due to unplanned execution, fill gaps around trees, cut old trees, and provide guards to planted trees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pwd-cuts-25-more-trees-overnight-near-bapu-kuti/articleshow/84987341.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai shops can now open till 10pm as Maharashtra eases norms for 25 districts||MUMBAI: With Covid cases reducing, the Maharashtra government eased curbs on Monday for the bulk of the state except 11 districts including Pune. In a boost for the retail sector, the BMC has allowed shops in Mumbai barring those inside malls to stay open on all days till 10 pm. Medical shops can remain open for 24 hours through the week. However, there is no major relief for hotels and restaurants in the city except that they can now be open till 4 pm on all days for dining in, including weekends. So far, they were allowed to raise their shutters only on weekdays. Movie halls and multiplexes have not been granted any concessions, nor have places of worship. However, the BMC has allowed indoor and outdoor sports barring the operation of swimming pools and other sporting activities involving close contact. It has also allowed film shootings in Mumbai in compliance with Covid norms and within prescribed timings. Earlier, a few members of the Maharashtra cabinet including deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and public health minister Rajesh Tope had indicated that government would ease curbs to a greater degree for restaurants, malls and multiplexes, but the final order held no such prospect. The hotel sector is upset with the decision. “We are being singled out and a vicious campaign is being run against us. We find no logic in not extending restaurant timings till 11pm at least,” said Shivanand Shetty, president of the Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association. Retailers were relieved. “We will ensure our staff is fully vaccinated and are hopeful that this decision in taken in Thane as well,” said Viren Shah from the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association. In its order, the state government relaxed curbs in 22 of the 36 districts including Nagpur, Aurangabad and Nasik while it allowed civic bodies to decide on lifting restrictions in three other districts: Mumbai city, Mumbai suburban and Thane. The relaxations for 22 districts include increased timings for shops, malls, gymnasiums and parlours. Both government and private offices have been allowed to function at full capacity. Restaurants have been allowed to function with 50% capacity till 4 pm on weekdays. However, cinema theatres, drama theatres and multiplexes (including those inside malls) have to remain closed. Places of worship too will continue to remain out of bounds. And restrictions will continue on birthday celebrations, political social and cultural events, elections, election campaigning, rallies and protest marches. BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal’s directive said Mumbai has a positivity rate of 1.76% and oxygen bed occupancy of 18.97%. This puts the city in the lowest range among districts classified on the basis of the two parameters. The decision on lifting restrictions in Thane district, which includes Navi Mumbai and Kalyan Dombivali, will be taken on Tuesday. The state has not relaxed restrictions in 11 districts reporting a relatively higher positivity rate. These include Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Pune, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Beed, Raigad and Palghar. The local disaster management authorities have been allowed to impose “effective restrictions” in Sindhudurg, Satara and Ahmednagar since the positivity rate is high and there is a greater emergence of fresh cases.

---||Delhi||Fund Amrapali projects, our word is security: SC to banks||NEW DELHI: Assuring banks and financial institutions that pumping in money into crisis-ridden Amrapali projects “would be secure”, the Supreme Court Monday said they should not insist on seeking mortgage or security as a pre-condition to release funds as the constructions are being done under its supervision. As several banks told the bench of Justices U U Lalit and Ajay Rastogi that security of their investment was their main concern, the court said they should not be apprehensive as everything was being done by a court-appointed receiver and decisions were being made after its approval. Senior advocate R Venkataramani, who as a court-appointed receiver is managing the affairs of the Amrapali Group and exploring all options to raise funds, told the bench that he and the NBCC had several rounds of meetings with several banks for project-funding but no progress could be made as the banks insisted on security. He added that it was difficult to provide security, and with that be case, it would not be possible to raise money needed to complete the constructions. He pleaded the court that a direction was needed that “banks and other funding agencies, who are in deliberations with the receiver/ NBCC, shall not insist on any collateral security in addition to the assets of Amrapali which can be duly offered as sufficient security, proportionate to the quantum of funds that may be released”. The counsels appearing for the banks told the bench that the financial institutions needed security as per the RBI’s guidelines. They also said that the banks could grant loan only up to 75% of the value of the security deposited. The court, however, said that all decisions regarding Amrapali projects were being taken by a court-appointed receiver and the promoters and directors of the company had no role in them. “When there is sanctity of court behind every decision then what more security would you need. We are willing to pass order that you will not insist for security,” the bench said. The court then asked the receiver to hold fresh consultations with banks. The receiver said SBI Capital, by next week, would release Rs 650 crore in tranches for six Amrapali housing projects. SBI Capital, which is managing SWAMIH (Special Window for Completion of Construction of Affordable and Mid-Income Housing Projects) Investment Fund created by the Centre, has agreed to provide money for Amrapali projects out of the fund. The bank, however, selected only six projects as it claimed that only those are viable and safe for investment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fund-projects-our-word-is-security-sc/articleshow/84989473.cms||---
---||Goa||Greens seek inclusion of sand mining in draft coastal plan||Margao: Goa River Sand Protectors’ Network has demanded that until all reports of the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) and the Goa State Biodiversity Board on Goa’s tidal rivers are submitted to the government, the ban on sand mining should continue to be in force and that the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) should contain a statement to that effect. In their written submission on the CZMP, the network pointed out there was “absolutely no reference to the issue of extraction of sand in Goa’s tidal rivers despite the fact that the activity is taking place in CRZ IV areas and falls squarely within the scope of the draft CZMP”. NIO has been commissioned by the Goa government to do a study of the status and impact of sand mining in all the rivers of Goa. At present, only one report has come out, which is a preliminary survey of the Chapora river. The network said that as per the report, “There is no replenishment taking place of the sand in the traditional areas and that, in fact, some of the mined areas are yet to be restored to their original status.” The biodiversity aspect of the report is now under preparation by Goa State Biodiversity Board. The network said that several fishing villages upstream of the river, like Amona, Volvoi and Akhada and St Estevam, are not shown in the CZMP as required by law “since residents of fishing villages are entitled to not just livelihoods, but also to right to raise dwellings, etc, in CRZ areas, which extend up to 100m on either side of these coastal rivers.” Stating that indiscriminate sand mining has altered the geomorphology of many rivers, the network in its submission said, “The present activity of sand mining has caused enormous damage to the tidal rivers and their ecology. In several places, islands have disappeared and river banks have collapsed and several more are in danger of doing so.” However, it expressed its disapproval over the absence of any reference to these developments in the CZMP. Further, the network pointed out to the issue of damage to the biodiversity of these areas from the impact of indiscriminate sand mining, and made a case for protection of traditional livelihoods dependent on clam collection. “The traditional fishing industry based on clam collection has almost been destroyed permanently by sand mining, but it is commonly known that proper protection provided to these areas will ensure reversal of some of these trends, which must be part of the CZMP proposals,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/greens-seek-inclusion-of-sand-mining-in-draft-coastal-plan/articleshow/84987703.cms||---

The suspect was later handed over to the police. “We have detained the suspect for questioning, but have not arrested him yet. We have fanned a police team for arresting his two absconding accomplices,” said senior inspector Balkrishna Kadam of the Hadapsar police on Monday. Tanaji Ghodke, the technician with a private hospital, told TOI, “I was on my way to a hotel on my bike to collect a food parcel when these three men, riding on a motorcycle, overtook me by taking a sharp turn without giving any signal and were driving in a zig-zag trajectory.” Ghodke said, “I honked because the trio were not allowing me to travel ahead. They got irked after I started honking and suddenly intercepted my vehicle. After I sought reasons for preventing me from moving ahead, the suspects grew furious. They abused, attacked me and robbed my gold chain and two rings. They were in the process of fleeing when I overpowered one of the suspects and raised an alarm from help.” “On sensing trouble, the two accomplices fled. In a bid to get help from public, I dragged the suspect to the main road and a created traffic jam. With the help of passers-by, we handed over the suspect to the Hadapsar police for taking action. My gold chain was recovered from the suspect,” he said. The police registered an FIR for robbery and wrongful restraint charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/trio-attack-rob-man-of-gold-chain-2-rings-one-held/articleshow/84989479.cms||---

The tribunal observed no action had been taken by any of the authorities so far in terms of registering criminal cases, arresting violators or blacklisting entities, stating that while polluting dairies in east Delhi had been sealed according to a report, no such impact had been seen in the drains. A bench headed by NGT chairperson justice Adarsh Kumar Goel asked authorities, which included additional chief Secretary (forest and environment), UP, secretary, urban development, UP, CEO of Noida Authority, district magistrate, Noida, and police commissioner of Noida to take stock of the situation immediately and take action against erring officers. “In view of the above grim situation, we direct to hold in-house meeting in coordination with departments concerned within 15 days, to take stock of the situation and plan remedial action. Action should include accountability of the erring officers, preventing discharge of pollution in the drain, coercive measures against violators - housing societies or others by registering criminal cases, initiating prosecution, assessment and recovery of compensation for the past violations, black listing of the entities concerned such as construction companies, in exercise of their statutory powers,” said the bench. The green body said polluting the canal was not only a criminal offence under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, but also under Chapter XIV of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/make-plan-to-curb-release-of-sewage-in-noida-canal-ngt/articleshow/84989635.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Panchnama shows nothing about deletion of chats: Raj Kundra’s lawyer||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday concluded hearing in Raj Kundra’s challenge to his arrest and remand in connection with a case of alleged “production and streaming of pornographic content” via apps, and reserved his plea for orders. His lawyer reiterated that the prosecution’s submission of the businessman deleting some chats on the day of the search to justify his arrest was an “afterthought.” Kundra was arrested on July 19 by Mumbai police and has been in magisterial custody in jail since July 27. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda, in his rebuttal before Justice Ajay Gadkari to public prosecutor Aruna Pai’s submissions, said the seizure panchanama after the search and remand plea did not show anything about deletion of chats which the state is stressing on now. “It does not change the position that there is no record of deletion (on July 19),” he said. Pai added more videos were found by police on two apps which were “obscene and bold films.” She said police had served Kundra and his co-accused Ryan Thorpe the Section 41A notice under CrPC (a provision to seek appearance of suspect before police station for an explanation when intention is not to arrest immediately when offence attracts up to 7 years’ imprisonment). She said while Thorpe accepted the notice, Kundra had refused, and police arrested him for non-cooperation and for deleting data. Ponda said police’s case is “falsified” as “apparently the mobile is taken charge of in the panchanama.” He said the seizure record will show his “mobile is in custody of the police.” He said from Kundra, two hard disks, one laptop and one mobile phone were taken charge of under the panchnama. “If this is so, then necessarily, the petitioner (Kundra) cannot delete data or WhatsApp groups or WhatsApp chats,” said Ponda, assisted by advocate Subhash Jadhav. The PP said deletion of chats was prior to serving of the notice.  Even Thorpe’s counsel Abhinav Chandrachud argued the second remand never mentioned any July 19 “deletion” but to a prior “February 2021” attempt. Thorpe also challenge his arrest and remand as illegal, and HC will now pronounce its order in both their petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/panchnama-shows-nothing-about-deletion-of-chats-in-mumbai-kundras-lawyer/articleshow/84991500.cms||---

Additional sessions judge PB Ghuge convicted Sheikh Arif, a resident of Shanti Nagar in Telipura locality, under sections 188, 381,420 of IPC, Section 3 punishable under Section 7 of Essential Commodities Act and Section 18(c) punishable under Section 27 of Drugs and Cosmetics Act. The 22-year-old has been behind the bars since April 24 when he was arrested by the Pachpaoli police, said special public prosecutor Jyoti Vajani, who strongly contended for awarding maximum punishment to all the accused like him “who took undue advantage of needy citizens”. The offences were lodged after Nagpur bench of Bombay high court took cognizance of media reports about alleged black-marketing of essential drugs by the hospital staff who sold it at exorbitant prices to relatives of patients when the drug was in short supply. The bench had appointed Shreerang Bhandarkar as amicus curiae. After HC’s prodding, the police swung into action and swooped down on the black-marketeers by arresting 32 persons. When the cases weren’t progressing, the HC again flayed the trial court judges for delaying the hearing and directed them to expedite the matters. On June 22, the HC ordered a “fact-finding” probe against former and current additional sessions judges hearing the cases. The principal district judge was asked to conduct an inquiry into trials of such cases, find out the reasons for delay, and submit the report to HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rem-black-marketeer-gets-5-years-in-jail-fined-rs35k/articleshow/84987416.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: 114 dengue positive in Chandrapur this year, 105 in July alone||CHANDRAPUR: Alarm bells are ringing in the district following massive spike in dengue cases. What is worrying the authorities is the fact that of the 114 dengue cases detected in the district this year, 105 have been reported in July alone. Official data available with TOI shows that dengue has spread its tentacles throughout the district as of the 105 cases, 59 were found under the jurisdiction of Chandrapur Municipal Corporation (CMC) and 46 in rural areas. Sources said a young woman identified as Priti Urkude from Ukharda village in Warora tehsil died of dengue in July. High intensity of dengue spurt can be assessed from the fact that the 114 cases were detected out of just 411 samples tested in the district. Dengue cases in rural areas include 11 from Warora tehsil, 9 Gondpipri, 8 Bhadravati, four each from Ballarpur, Chimur and Pombhurna, three in Korpana and one each from Nagbhid, Mul and Chandrapur tehsil. Remaining 59 cases were detected in Chandrapur city. Officials claimed that July to October are key months during which dengue spread is noticed the most and hence intense measures need to be initiated to keep it under check. While measures to curb the spread of dengue are being taken on war footing by both the CMC and malaria department, the situation seems to be little under control. In the light of this, Chandrapur MLA Kishor Jorgewar has voiced the demand for a special ward in the local GMCH to treat dengue patients. In a letter to the dean of GMCH, Jorgewar has claimed that treatment cost of dengue infection in private hospitals is quite high and out of reach of common people. As higher number of dengue patients are being admitted to the GMCH here, regular health services are getting affected. It is therefore necessary to set up a special ward for dengue patients to provide proper care to all, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/114-dengue-ve-in-chanda-this-year-105-in-july-alone/articleshow/84987450.cms||Mazhar Ali

Deshprabhu cited urgency in the matter stating that the petitioner has a flight booked to Kuwait on August 8. On why he delayed approaching the court, he said that earlier the format of the vaccination certificate did not mention the dates of both doses but after foreign countries insisted on this, the new certificates with both dates came into existence. He stated that he booked tickets in July when he learnt that Kuwait reopened its borders and downloaded his final certificate on July 26. The Panaji urban health centre told him that there is no such correction possible on their end and he tried to avail the services of the Co-Win website in vain, he submitted to the high court. The matter will come up again on August 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-notice-to-centre-over-vax-certificate-error/articleshow/84987436.cms||Lisa Monteiro

He was a student of international business studies at Tianjin University and had gone there in September 2019. Aman’s uncle Ramkishore Paswan met Gaya DM Abhishek Singh on Monday with a request to initiate steps to bring back his body. “Till July 23, Aman talked to the family members and friends over phone. He was in good health and did not have any physical or mental problem. But his phone had been unreachable since July 24. We contacted local guardians on July 26 to enquire about him. I received a call at 1:28am on July 30 from an unknown number that Aman was no more. After that we tried to contact the university, but in vain. So far, we have also not received any communication from Indian embassy regarding Aman’s death,” Ramkishore said. Aman was the only son in the family. His father Uday Paswan and uncles Ramkishore and Pankaj Paswan live in a joint family. Aman’s sister is a medical student at New Delhi. Ramkishore said: “The family will accept the government’s report regarding Aman’s death. But the government should ensure that in case of death of any student studying abroad, the body should be brought back home so that the family could perform the last rites.” According to a PTI report from Beijing, the cause of his death is under investigation, officials said. He was one of the few Indian students who remained in China through the coronavirus pandemic while most of the 23,000 Indian students, who left for home and were stuck in India and unable to return due to Beijing’s reluctance to lift visa restrictions. The Indian embassy officials said preparations were being made to send his body home. Currently, no flights are operational between India and China, the report said. Earlier on Friday, Bihar BJP president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal had tweeted about the incident and urged minister of state of external affairs Meenakshi Lekhi to intervene into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gaya-student-in-chinas-b-school-found-dead/articleshow/84985314.cms||---

---||Goa||State’s SC affidavit in 2011 contrary to Bhumiputra bill||Panaji: The provisions of the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill — which was passed by the state assembly on Friday and became a hot-button issue for many — is contrary to the affidavit filed by the state government in the Supreme Court in 2011, which said that it would clear encroachments on land belonging to the government, local authority or comunidade. But legal experts said no affidavit, no existing statute and no executive or judicial order can put “fetters on the power of Parliament or state legislature”. “The provisions of the Bhumiputra bill does not contravene the affidavit and even if it is made out that it contravenes, no affidavit can stand before the power of legislature. What is an affidavit after all? There can be no restrictions on the power to legislate,” legal commentator Prabhakar Timble told TOI. The affidavit was filed in the case of Jagpal Singh vs State of Punjab, which pertained to encroachment on government and panchayat land. The SC had issued directions to all state governments to prepare schemes for the eviction of illegal, unauthorised occupants of land belonging to gram sabhas, gram panchayats and such bodies, and that these lands must be restored to the gram sabha or gram panchayat for the common use of villagers. The top court further directed that the state government should “provide for speedy eviction of illegal occupants after giving a show cause notice and a brief hearing”. “The state has in place the appropriate enactments to remove encroachments from the lands belonging to the government or local authority or comunidade,” then chief secretary Sanjay Srivastava had said. He also said that any complaint received in respect of encroachment would be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the above enactments, and action would be taken to clear the encroachment and restore the land to the local authority or government. The Bhumiputra bill is set to allow the state to give the self-occupied dweller of a small housing unit ownership rights “so as to enable him to live with dignity and self-respect and exercise his right to life”. The state will give ownership to the government as well as private land, the bill said. Timble said the affidavit only affirms that the state has a legal mechanism in place to deal with encroachments on public land. He said it also affirmed that any complaint received of any encroachment will be dealt with as per provisions in the existing laws.  “We are a parliamentary democracy. The supremacy of the legislature and separation of powers between the three organs of the government are a part and parcel of the basic structure of the Constitution. Even existing statutes could fall and be razed by the legislature,” Timble said. As per the bill, after receipt of an application under Section 5, the Bhumiputra Adhikarini will publish a notice within 30 days, including to the owner of the land in case the land is not owned by the government. “Dwelling unit”, according to the bill, refers to a permanent structure having plinth area not exceeding 250 sqm, which has been constructed or has been in existence before April 1, 2019, and assessed for house tax by the local authority and has water and electricity connections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/states-sc-affidavit-in-2011-contrary-to-bhumiputra-bill/articleshow/84987453.cms||---

Crime branch SP Shobhit Saxena said that based on Sawant’s complaint, an FIR was registered at the cybercrime cell against an unidentified person for creating a fake Facebook account of the chief minister by using his name and photograph, and for using this profile to request people to transfer money into a Paytm account.

---||Kochi||KCBC to observe Black Day on Aug 10||Kochi: Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council (KCBC) has called for observing August 10, the 50th anniversary of implementing the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTP Act) in India as a ‘Day of Protection of Life’. The call was on the lines of Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India’s (CBCI) direction to observe the day as a Black Day across the Church in India. “The MTP Act was passed in 1971. The CBCI has called for observing the day as a Black Day and in Kerala Church we observe it as the day for Protection of Life. So, we are calling for observing the day appropriately with the cooperation of the Pro-Life committees,” said a letter sent to priests and bishops of the Catholic Church by Fr Paul Simenthy, secretary of the KCBC family commission. As part of the campaign, KCBC family commission has issued a list of activities to be followed in dioceses and parishes across Kerala against abortion. The activities suggested by KCBC includes holding webinars in every diocese on Pro-Life, day-long fasting for the cause, making flyers and posters that can develop a Pro-Life culture, etc. “There are policies and practices to support families that receive more children in every diocese. Formulate more such welfare projects with the cooperation of educational and medical establishments… There has been a tradition in many dioceses in which bishops attend the baptism of children born in large families (three or more). It would become a happier occasion if a gift from the family pro-life division is delivered to the family on the occassion,” said the letter. Earlier, when Pala diocese faced criticism on social media after it announced perks for families having more than four children, KCBC family commission had supported the diocese. Bishop Dr Paul Antony Mullassery, chairman of Pro-Life committee and KCBC family commission, had then said in a statement that it was evident that there was a lack of purity in the intentions behind unnecessary controversy over family welfare projects of Pala diocese.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kcbc-to-observe-black-day-on-aug-10/articleshow/84987512.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Unplanned areas lag in accessibility too: Study||New Delhi: Unplanned, low-income areas in Delhi have very limited access to affordable and efficient public transport services, while planned and richer areas are comparatively better connected, a new study released by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Tuesday revealed. The study titled ‘How accessible are low income settlements: The case of Delhi’ covered 16 planned and unplanned settlements across the capital. It found unplanned settlements to be not only devoid of basic infrastructure, but also only one-third of the unplanned settlements were found to have a bus stop within the prescribed standards. They were also found to be far away from metro stations. The study observed that in terms of locational advantages, planned settlements were found to be 2.8 times better placed than unplanned settlements, while planned areas, on average, were also found to have 1.6 times more road space and 1.4 times more open qualitative space. On the criteria of ‘interface between settlement and the city’, planned settlements were found to be around 1.3 times better connected. The settlements, which were studied, included unauthorised colonies that have been subsequently regularised such as Tughlaqabad Extension, Tigri Extension, Govindpuri, Kalkaji, Khanpur, Pooth Kalan and Khirki Extension; resettlement colonies such as Garhi and Zamrudpur in East of Kailash; and slum clusters like Jawaharlal Nehru Camp in Kalkaji. Villages that have become part of the urban system like Shahpur Jat and Tughlaqabad village were also included in the study. Among the planned settlements studied were East of Kailash, Kailash Colony, Greater Kailash and Chittaranjan Park. The study further observed that if all settlements of Delhi are not equally well connected with public transport services, while simultaneously implementing low-emission forms of transport such as walking or cycling, Delhi will remain a pollution trap in the region. As per estimates of the draft Delhi Master Plan 2041, the city’s population will be 27-30 million by 2041, and 50% of this increase will happen due to migration. By then, Delhi would generate 46.2 million motorised trips daily. “If such a massive load of daily motorised travel trips are not shifted to public transport to achieve the MPD 2041 target of modal split of 80:20 in favour of public and shared transport, Delhi will remain locked in pollution and carbon trap,” says CSE executive director Anumita Roychowdhury and one of the authors of the study. “The expectation of MPD 2041 that 50% of Delhi’s population will be within the influence zone of mass transit by 2041 and mixed-use development will encourage shift towards public transport, can be fulfilled only if neighbourhood-level design and infrastructure improve for safe and efficient access,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unplanned-areas-lag-in-accessibility-too-study/articleshow/85021494.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Kolkata||Last week’s downpour leaves roads battered||Kolkata: The downpour that lashed the city and large parts of Bengal last Thursday seems to have washed away the upper layers of roads here, exposing large crater-like potholes everywhere. The rain stopped on Friday, but motorists have been facing a difficult time ever since, trying to negotiate the battered roads. Among the stretches that are in particularly bad shape are R G Kar Road, Canal (East) and Canal (West) roads, Chittaranjan Avenue, M G Road, APC Roy Road, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road, Diamond Harbour Road, Motilal Gupta Road and NSC Bose Road in Tollygunge. The large potholes are proving to be especially risky for two-wheeler riders, while motorists, too, have to be careful that their vehicles don’t hit particularly bad patches. About a month ago, the KMC roads department had started repairing stretches that were in a poor state but the recent heavy spells of rain washed away the efforts. A KMC official conceded that patch repairs were not adequate to ensure longevity of the top layer of major roads, especially those paved with mastic asphalt. “Continuous rain causes widespread waterlogging. The accumulated water leads to major damage to road surfaces, paved with mastic asphalt. Patch repair won’t be effective in such cases. We need to take up a thorough repair of arterial roads, which have been damaged due to waterlogging,” a KMC roads department official said. Some stretches of Motilal Gupta Road, which connects Tollygunge tram depot with Behala Chowrasta, and NSC Bose Road have become a nightmare for bikers. Ramesh Shaw (25), a resident of Behala and engaged in food delivery, fractured his leg when he fell off his bike as he failing to bypass a large crater. He was in a hurry to deliver food to a Moore Avenur home on time. “While passing Motilal Gupta Roade during the day, we can spot the potholes from a distance. But at night, the stretch is not well lit and we miss the danger spots. I was in a rush and did not notice a gaping crater ahead. The bike skid and I landed on the road. I suffered a fracture. It’s high time the civic authorities took up a comprehensive repair of roads,” Shaw said. Similar accidents have been reported from NSC Bose Road, too. A KMC roads department official said the civic body couldn’t start repairing bow because of intermittent spells of rain. “We need to have at least a week’s dry spell to start the work and fill the craters. We will initiate the process once the monsoon is over,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/last-weeks-downpour-leaves-roads-battered/articleshow/84987520.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Pune||Vocational courses on the upswing in uncertain times||Pune: Skills universities, the state directorate of vocational education and the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) have reported a rise in the number of vocational courses at their institutions.Experts have attributed the rise to the pandemic as students prefer short-term courses considering the uncertain situation. The demand for certificate courses in machine learning, artificial intelligence, wellness, disaster management are among the courses that have the highest enrolments. Representatives said there is a 5% rise in the takers and a few candidates have decided to take a break after Std XII to pursue these skill courses to add to their academic knowledge before taking up degree courses once the situation normalised.At the Symbiosis Skills and Professional University, over 1,200 students are taking skill-based courses that are based on requirements at every sector and as per guidelines of the skill council. Pro-chancellor at the university, Swati Majumdar, said, “We have identified and designed nearly 2,500 skill courses which are basic level to high level and have on-board training partners for vocational training providers. There is a good demand for these courses from students as their chances of employment are very high. There are many students who have also subscribed to our courses simultaneously with their regular degree to get that advantage over others at the time of seeking jobs.”The university provides all students with best practices of vocational education and skill development system followed not just in India but also some other countries.Devansh Seth, a student of std XII, opted to drop out from a regular degree course and decided to take up drone engineering short-term course for the next one year. Seth said, “The conditions look uncertain due to the pandemic for admissions to normalise so I decided to take up this course which is my interest. I will learn something about it technically and theoretically and simultaneously prepare for the IIT entrance.”The Maharashtra State Board of Skill Development has a total of 1,269 institutes across the state with a total intake of 74,587 seats and over 290 courses. Director Anil Jadhao said, “Through the courses that we have designed and structured, we are looking at students getting self-employed when they move out of the institute.” The institutes affiliated to MSBSD impart six and one-year certificate courses and two-year diploma courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vocational-courses-on-the-upswing-in-uncertain-times/articleshow/84987470.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Pune||Maharashtra HSC result 2021 today at 4 pm; Board promises hassle-free experience||PUNE: The results of the Higher Secondary Certificate exam (HSC, Std XII) examination will be announced by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education for nearly 14 lakh students on Tuesday on seven websites at 4 pm. Students will be able to check their results online by entering their seat numbers. A statement issued by the state board on Monday said this time there will not be any issues with the links and the board was prepared to host lakhs of students. The results would be announced in nine divisions of the state including Pune, Mumbai, Amravati, Nagpur, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Nashik, Latur, and Konkan. This time, the written examinations could not be conducted due to the pandemic so the board derived a formula for marking students based on their performance in standards X, XI, and internal assessments of std XII. Secretary of the state board, Ashok Bhosale, said, “There are 5-6 links where students can check their results from.” The board this year will use the marks obtained in college-based exams of Std XII and Std XI, and the three best performing subjects of SSC final exams. For the practical component, the Std 12 marks will be awarded based on the board’s existing policy on practical exams. Students not satisfied with the marks allotted as per the board evaluation criteria can appear in the next couple of examinations for improvement in scores to be conducted by the board when the Covid situation normalises. For those wanting to fly out for undergraduate education, as also for many who took the Common Law Admission Test and will be put through counselling, the wait for the HSC results will mark the end of long suspense. College principals said meeting the University Grants Commission deadline to start colleges by October 1 may be difficult. “At least four weeks will go by in the admission process. Meeting the October 1 deadline may be tough,” said T A Shiware, chairman of the Association of Non-Government Colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hsc-results-today-at-4pm-board-promises-hassle-free-experience/articleshow/84994984.cms||---

MGP demanded that the government withdraw the bill. The people of Goa should reject this government and the person behind the bill should resign, MGP’s Ramkrishna Dhavalikar said. He said that the state government should purchase land from comunidades and give it to the people. Dhavalikar said that by using the name Bhumiputra Adhikarini for the bill, the government has insulted the people of Goa. He said that the opposition had demanded that the bill should be sent to a select committee and urged the government to call a special session to discuss and pass the bill. Dhavalikar said that chief minister Pramod Sawant doesn’t understand the meaning of bhumiputra. “The government wants to help bhumiputra of other states in Goa, when they have rights in their states,” the senior MGP functionary said. Dhavalikar said that someone will challenge the bill in court. He said that the way the government is functioning, it is dangerous for the people of the state. MGP also demanded that the state government should immediately take up construction of houses which were destroyed in the floods. Dhavalikar said that if the government does not construct houses immediately, then the people should not allow the government to construct their houses. “If MGP forms the government, we will construct the houses destroyed in floods,” he said.

---||Pune||Niche jobs in culinary arts, health economics||Pune: Universities and institutions are offering several unconventional courses from an undergraduate course in culinary arts to blended BSc courses that can help a student get direct admission for postgraduation in Australian universities to undergraduate courses specially designed for students pursuing competitive examinations. A master’s degree in environmental science and geoinformatics or population and health economics is also in this kitty. Experts say these courses are different from conventional degrees but they can give good career opportunities to the students. Considering the pandemic and the focus on health sector, Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics this year is starting a two-year MSc programme in population studies and health economics to understand the inter-relationship of the population with different social, economic, health and nutrition phenomena. “There is a huge demand for professionals who understand population demographics and economics in both government and private sectors. The pandemic has pushed this demand and now right from international bodies like WHO to policies such as Ayushman Bharat, there are ample opportunities for students specialising in this field,” Rajas Parchure, officiating director at GIPE, said. Blended programmes offer a mix Undergraduate programmes offered by Savitribai Phule Pune University also have takers. The blended BSc programme, which was first started in Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar is designed by the University of Melbourne, the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research and Savitribai Phule Pune University. Head of the department Sangeeta Bhagat said, “In the first two years, students learn all four subjects — physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics while in the last year, they specialise in life sciences. The course is well formulated and not only helps students gain an in-depth knowledge of the fundamentals of the core science branches but also helps them crack the entrance examinations for postgraduate studies in various universities.”  The blended BSc programmes offered by SPPU have an appropriate overlap of physics, chemistry, maths, biology, earth science and environment science. Global opportunities  await learners Atul Gokhale, director of Symbiosis School of Culinary Arts, said the course offers youngsters a chance to see the global opportunities available in the field of culinary arts from being a chef-restaurateur to being an entrepreneur to a career in the food processing industry. Pune attracts students preparing for competitive examinations for government jobs. Shailashree Haridas, associate director of School of Public Policy at MIT WPU, said the course provides a comprehensive programme where the student gets a BA in government and administration course at the completion of three years, but the syllabus is designed in such a way that the subjects contain only the relevant topics needed for UPSC exam preparation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/niche-jobs-in-culinary-arts-health-economics/articleshow/84987498.cms||Ardhra Nair

Puti Gaonkar, president, GMPF said that it is a big concern that the bill introduced in the recently-concluded assembly session for forming the corporation has shown no intent on revival and retention of the employment of Goa mining dependants in a sustainable manner.  “Without any commitment on protecting the interest of people who have suffered due to the mining stoppage, we believe the corporation will do nothing about the livelihoods of 3 lakh mining dependants who have been pushed to poverty,” GMPF stated.

---||Business||Manufacturing activity rebounds to a 3-month high: Survey||NEW DELHI: Manufacturing activity in the country bounced back to a three-month high in July on the back of rising new orders, exports, quantity of purchases and input stocks helped by the lifting of curbs across the country as Covid cases moderated and economic activity resumed, a survey showed on Monday. After slipping into contraction for the first time in 11 months during June, the IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) moved back above the critical 50-point mark in July. The headline figure was up from 48.1 in June to 55.3. The 50-point separates expansion from contraction. The survey also showed that employment in the sector grew for the first time in 16 months, signalling the return of confidence in the sector battered earlier by the impact of the shutdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The survey is compiled from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers in a panel of around 400 manufacturers across the country. “It’s encouraging to see the Indian manufacturing industry recover from the blip seen in June. Output rose at a robust pace, with over one-third of companies noting a monthly expansion in production, amid a rebound in new business and the easing of some local Covid restrictions. Should the pandemic continue to recede, we expect a 9.7% annual increase in industrial production for 2021,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. “The PMI also brought the positive news of job creation in the manufacturing sector. Although marginal, the rise in employment was the first since the onset of Covid. With firms’ cost burdens continuing to rise, however, and signs of spare capacity still evident, it’s too early to say that such a trend will be sustained in coming months,” said De Lima. The latest PMI numbers augur well for the manufacturing sector and will be crucial for helping overall economic recovery. Growth is forecast to be in the 8-10% range, while the government is confident that it will be close to its projection of 10.5% for FY22. Factory orders rose amid reports of improved demand and the easing of some local Covid restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/manufacturing-activity-rebounds-to-a-3-month-high-survey/articleshow/84992573.cms||---

The Class XII pass out is currently being trained, which will last till the second week of August, by the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) staff at the Anna sports complex here.K Manikandan, with speech and hearing impairment, hails from Nagalapuram village and completed schooling at the Khajamian higher secondary school in Trichy. In the national deaf championship held in Kozhikode in Kerala in December 2019, his performance caught the eye of the All India Sports Council of the Deaf. A national selection trial was conducted in New Delhi on July 22 in which Manikandan’s performance helped him represent the country. Manikandan has submitted the acceptance letter from his parents, both agriculture workers. “Through my lip movement, he is understanding my directions. At times, I show him YouTube videos to help him understand better. We are sure that he will emerge as a winner in his maiden international event,” said R Srinivasan, a coach with SDAT in Trichy. The district sports department said that district collector S Sivarasu helped Manikandan renew his passport which was about to lapse. The 17-year-old who was studying in a school near Thuraiyur three years ago had relocated to Trichy for getting special training. Khajamian school headmaster Kaleel Rahman and physical education teacher Sulthanul Ariffin said that the boy was supported for the past three years to concentrate both in education and sports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-boy-qualifies-for-world-deaf-athletic-event/articleshow/84989632.cms||---

Those saved from the jaws of death even touch their feet in gratitude. But on Sunday late night, the firemen were shocked at encountering a situation contradictory to what they usually witness. A man, whom they were rescuing in Kapodra, put forth a bizarre condition - that firemen should touch his feet if they want him to be rescued. The firemen were initially shocked at the man’s insistence, but later, realizing that he may be suffering from mental health issues, they patiently convinced him to climb down the ladder for his safety. The man identified as Atul Hinjwadia climbed the second floor of a commercial building at RB Complex compound in Kapodra around 11 pm. Eye-witnesses said that Hinjwadia climbed up using a drainage pipe and sat on the outdoor unit of the air-conditioner. On noticing him, locals tried convincing him to come down, but after a ruckus of around an hour, police and fire department were informed. “A food cart owner came to the fire station to inform us about the man. When we reached there, he was still perched on the air-conditioner and blabbering,” said station officer Vinod Rojwadia. Seeing the firemen, Hinjwadia tried climbing further up, but the staff first laid a jumping net on the ground floor and approached him through a ladder. “When the fire brigade staff reached the second floor, Hinjwadia told them in Gujarati that he will be quiet and come down only if they bow down and touch his feet. “It surprised our staffer first, but they tried talking him out,” Rojwadia said. One of the firefighters even held his feet to convince him, but that was also not enough. Hinjwadia then told the rescuers that the crowd gathered there would beat him. “We asked him to trust us and nobody will touch him. After 15-20 minutes of negotiations, he finally agreed to come down,” Rojwadia told TOI. He was later handed over to Kapodra police station where he was kept under detention before being released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/bow-down-touch-my-feet-man-on-the-edge-tells-firemen-before-rescue/articleshow/84985508.cms||---

The stretches identified for the Rs 2 crore project are Palpannai junction on the intersection of Trichy-Thanjavur and Trichy-Chennai NHs and TVS Tollgate junction on the intersection of the Trichy-Pudukottai and Trichy-Chennai NHs. As there was no free left at Palpannai for vehicles approaching the city from the Thanjavur side, cars and buses are seen piling up along with the vehicles heading to Varaganeri, Sanjeevi Nagar and Chennai NH. With adequate space available adjacent to the Thanjavur NH (G Corner end), the NHAI initiated work to add a free left. An electric transformer, which posed a hindrance was removed and the cables transmitted through underground. “We will shift the existing stormwater drain to the extreme left. Once completed, vehicles heading to Mannarpuram, Kallukuzhi, Subramaniapuram and Cantonment can use the free left on Thanjavur NH,” an NHAI official said.At TVS Tollgate, the existing stormwater drain is being shifted to the left end of the service road on Chennai-Trichy NH. Nearly 2m space will be freed to enable vehicles approach the Trichy airport, city police and PWD offices on Pudukkottai NH. “We will remodify the traffic island, signboards for Trichy International Airport will be erected,” the official added. The 1.5m wide stormwater drains in two locations for a length of 450m are being relocated by utilising the available NHAI land. The civil work is anticipated to complete by the end of August 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/nhai-initiates-work-on-two-major-stretches-in-trichy/articleshow/84989611.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Pune||‘Innovation in learning is new order’||The last academic year brought disruptions in the traditional way of teaching and learning and the focus suddenly shifted to what is being taught and how rather than when and where. Pandemic forced educators to move online. The transition was difficult for many educators and learners. E-learning prior to pandemic had emerged as a tool for teaching and growing with a slow pace of 15.4% worldwide and here was a situation where everyone had to shift to online with no time to think and develop capability. Embracing new ways of teaching for teachers and learners was not easy. It was much more than taking the classroom content and converting it into online class as the context of teaching changed. It entailed powerful learning possibilities and strategies. It suddenly opened up huge opportunity for educators. Those with foresight see this as a phenomenon that will be lasting even as we move towards classroom and face-to-face format. This has brought an opportunity for good faculty members to showcase their capability to teach through various social platforms and move beyond boundaries of their own colleges. It also entails the ability to be able to teach in the absence of students and with no eye contact, posing challenges to make interesting content and delivery to keep the students engaged. Thus, the best survives and the other get an access to knowing what’s not acceptable helping the quick transitioning of the community. On the other hand, the academic institutions see this as an opportunity to crowd source the content, curate the content and give the best to their students opening horizons for best in class to be available to many and the teacher to many institutions. This is also likely to bring in changes in policy framework confined to student-teacher ratio. Students have an opportunity to learn the same course from institution of his/her own choice and there is diversity in learning. Online learning is bringing the education out of the rote learning that was reproduction based . This is also the most opportune time to build inclusive and equitable education system through cellphone, television, radio and internet but not limiting it to these devices.

The injured fisherman has been identified as E Kalaiselvan. He was brought back to the coast by fellow crew members and admitted at the Nagapattinam Government Medical College Hospital. State fisheries department officials said Kalaiselvan and nine other fishermen set sail from Keechankuppam fishing hamlet on July 28 in a mechanised vessel belonging to N Gowthaman. While fishing around five nautical miles southeast off Kodiyakkarai coast, a fast interceptor vessel -- said to be that of the Sri Lankan navy -- chased them and opened fire. “There are two bullet marks on the boat. The broken pieces from the body part of the fishing vessel must have injured the fisherman,” an official with the fisheries department, Nagapattinam, said. The crew after being intimidated had rushed back to Keechankuppam fishing harbour at around 2am on Monday. The fishermen claimed that they were engaged in fishing well within the Indian waters.The coastal security group personnel of the state police were investigating the incident. Nagapattinam district collector Dr Arun Thamburaj visited the injured fishermen at the hospital and offered his support. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/fisherman-injured-in-mid-sea-firing/articleshow/84989621.cms||---

While the state received around 65 lakh vaccine doses in July, it has only been allocated 53,07,780 doses for August, with Covishield accounting for 46,39,640 and Covaxin 6,68,140. But the state needs over 80 lakh this month. Health department officials said that since the state has only been allocated 53 lakh for August against a requirement of 80 lakh, there will be a huge shortage. Officials said that they would request the Centre to increase the allocation as the third wave may emerge in the coming months and it was important to provide protection for people. Covid vaccination centres across the state have been witnessing long queues of beneficiaries. According to the Centre’s estimate, the state has 5.14 crore beneficiaries for vaccination. Out of these, over 2.5 crore have already received the first dose. So far, 77 lakh have received both the doses. The number of vaccines supplied by the Centre to the state is 2,95,38,620 till date and the state has procured 30,53,720 doses. On Monday, the state received 1,83,000 doses of Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/against-demand-for-80l-vax-doses-centre-allocates-53l-for-raj-in-aug/articleshow/84989660.cms||---

The team – that will function under the overall control and coordination of principal secretary (industries) K Ellangovan – includes principal secretary (industry) APM Mohammed Hanish (in charge of Ernakulam, Palakkad and Kozhikode), KSIDC MD MG Rajamanickam (Kottayam, Thrissur and Malappuram), director of industries and commerce S Harikishore (Thiruvananthapuram, Kannur, Kasaragod and Wayanad) and mining and geology director Imbasekhar (Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha and Idukki). “Industries is a promoting and facilitating department. The field reality and the feedback received through the industries minister’s meet-the-minister programme are being implemented by giving necessary instructions to the concerned in the field. Wherever gaps were located, necessary changes are being made and senior officials would supervise these necessary changes in concerned districts,” Ellangovan said. Kerala has been undertaking several measures to improve the state’s rank in the ease of doing business (EODB) rankings. Last time, when the ranks were published in 2019, Kerala stood at 28th spot among the list of states where launching and running a business was smooth and easy. As per the reply furnished by industries minister P Rajeeve in assembly on June 8, a higher rank in EODB rankings is a key factor in attracting more investors to Kerala. After its pathetic performance, state had launched a series of reforms monitored by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade. As on March 1, 15 states, including Kerala, have completed the district business reform action plan (DBRAP) as part of EODB. On the basis of completion of the reforms, the department of expenditure had granted the state permission to borrow Rs 2,261 crore as part of raising additional financial resources through open market borrowings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/five-ias-officers-to-ensure-reforms/articleshow/84987640.cms||KP Saikiran

Therefore, the government should, in my opinion, take an appropriate step after observing all aspects of the issue,” Nitish said. “I know whatever information about Pegasus that is there in the newspapers. But the entire matter — how phones are being tapped, heard by others — should be investigated properly and all facts brought before the people. If anyone indulges in the act of telephone-tapping with an intention to disturb someone, irritate someone, such a thing should not happen,” he added. On the stand-off in Parliament over the opposition's demand for a probe by a joint parliamentary committee, Nitish said it was a matter that should be sorted out within the precincts of the House. “The government has already given a reply on the issue in the House. If the government has given a reply, then what is the matter? We do not have the entire information on this. We are aware that there is a deadlock.” Nitish declined to spell out whether he would prefer a probe by a joint parliamentary committee or a Supreme Court judge, restricting himself to saying “it (an investigation) should happen”. His statement comes amid a barrage of attacks on the Narendra Modi government by the opposition over the Pegasus spyware being allegedly used to snoop on a long list of people, including a few from BJP. JD(U) is a partner of BJP both at the Centre and in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-backs-demand-for-probe-into-pegasus-scandal/articleshow/84985499.cms||Madan Kumar

SBS member Ganpat Gaonkar said that the bill will largely benefit migrants since it is mentioned that any person residing for 30 years at the particular place in Goa can claim for house ownership. He said that it will be injustice to the actual and genuine bhumiputras if migrants residing in Goa are considered bhumiputras. “The bill is definitely good in respect of giving house ownership to people, but it’s definition should be changed,” Gaonkar said. Gaonkar said that Sattari bhumiputras have demanded that the government to give absolute ownership for entire properties of the people and not just limited to house ownership,” Gaonkar said. He also said that the government should exclude arable land from the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, de-notify boundaries and transfer land rights to cultivators. Farmers have also demanded that the government should transfer all lands mentioned as ‘alvara’, 'Class II’ and under other categories to cultivators and dwellers, he said, and that the government should abolish the Mokasdari system and transfer the land to cultivators and dwellers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bhumiputra-bill-should-be-renamed/articleshow/84987579.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He also raised objections to the word ‘putra’ meaning son in the bill. “The chief minister and the revenue department will take a call on this bill.

Rotavac 5D is a new variant of Bharat Biotech’s first generation rotavirus vaccine Rotavac, which received WHO prequalification in 2018 with over 250 million doses of the paediatric supplied globally so far. The WHO prequalification will fast-track global access to Rotavac 5D enabling its procurement by UN agencies like UNICEF and PAHO and is a validation of the global quality and safety standards required for pediatric vaccines, Bharat Biotech said. The vaccine is used for prevention of rotavirus infection that is the leading cause of severe diarrhoea among children less than five years of age around the world, resulting in more than 2 lakh and 2 million hospitalisations globally. Rotavac 5D, which can be administered without a buffer, is the only rotavirus vaccine in the world to be delivered in a 0.5mL dose volume, the company claimed adding that “its low dose volume (0.5 mL) facilitates easy vaccine logistics, cold chain management and low biomedical waste disposal post-vaccination”. Terming the vaccine as the culmination of a 30-year effort to develop a novel rotavirus vaccine, Bharat Biotech joint managing director Suchitra Ella said both Rotavac and Rotavac 5D were conceived, innovated and executed in India in collaboration with Indian and global partners. “The vaccine is a major advancement in Rotavirus disease prevention and reasserts India’s leadership in developing and introducing rotavirus vaccines for the world,” she added. The first generation Rotavac was developed under a public-private partnership with department of biotech of government of India and 16 international partners, making it the largest ever social innovation project for public health, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bbs-rotavirus-vax-gets-who-pre-qualification/articleshow/84988648.cms||---

The plea comes following doubts over whether the government would continue the aid as classes have already resumed in online mode. The government had launched the financial package in April to help teachers as schools were closed due to the pandemic. “Since the last three months even though there was a delay in the amount being credited, rice was distributed on time. In July, we did not even get rice. So, not sure whether the state will continue providing financial aid,” said Shabir Ali, president, Telangana Private Teachers Forum. As per figures available with education department, as many as 2, 04,743 have been given aid and over 90% of them also received rice.

The soldier will have an option to fire both TAR and AK-47 bullets and explosive grenades to destroy enemy troops. OFT said the UBGL can be easily attached to the rifle in less than a minute in combat actions and counter-terrorist operations. Sanjay Dwivedi, IOFS, general manager, Ordnance Factory, Tiruchirappalli had launched the UBGL. “We are expecting the defence units using TAR and AK-47 to place a bulk order for UBGL, we are capable of mass production and the UBGL has successfully completed field trials,” an official source with OFT told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/oft-ready-to-produce-grenade-launcher/articleshow/84989692.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Covaxin effectively neutralises Delta+ variant: ICMR-NIV study||HYDERABAD: Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin is effective in neutralising the Delta Plus (AY.1) variant, a study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology, Pune, has found. The Delta Plus variant was first detected in India earlier this year and subsequently in 20 other countries. The study found that though there was a reduction in NAb titer (concentration of neutralising antibody) in the sera of the three groups that were studied, the concentration of antibodies was enough to effectively neutralise the Delta, Delta Plus and B.1.617.3 variants as compared to the B.1 variant. The study evaluated the IgG antibody titer (Immunoglobulin G concentration) and neutralizing potential of sera of Covid-19 naive individuals fully vaccinated with Covaxin, Covid-19 recovered cases with two doses of Covaxin and breakthrough cases post-immunization with Covaxin against the Delta, Delta Plus and B.1.617.3 as compared to the B.1 variant. The research paper titled `Comparable neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 Delta AY.1 and Delta in individuals sera vaccinated with BBV152’ has been uploaded on bioRxiv, which carries preprints of research papers before they are peer-reviewed. Covaxin’s final Phase III efficacy data had shown the vaccine is 65.2% effective against Delta variant. For the study, researchers drew sera from 86 individuals, including 42 persons who had never been infected with Covid but were immunised with two doses of Covaxin, 14 people who had recovered from Covid and were vaccinated with two doses of Covaxin and 30 persons who got infected after being immunised with two doses of Covaxin. “A minor reduction was observed in the neutralizing antibody titer in Covid-19 recovered cases full BBV152 vaccinated and post immunised infected cases compared to Covid-19 naive vaccinated individuals. However, with the observed high titers, the sera of individuals belonging to all the aforementioned groups they would still neutralize the Delta, Delta AY.1 and B.1.617.3 variants effectively,” the researchers said. “A reduction in neutralizing activity was observed with the Covid-19 naive individuals full vaccinated (1.3, 1.5, 1.9-fold), Covid-19 recovered cases with full BBV152 immunization (2.5, 3.5, 3.8-fold) and breakthrough cases post-immunization (1.9, 2.8, 3.5-fold) against Delta, Delta AY.1 and B.1.617.3, respectively, as compared to B.1 variant,” the paper added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-effectively-neutralises-delta-variant-icmr-niv-study/articleshow/84988520.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The large stocks are quickly sold to fish traders. However, there is plenty more to meet the needs of local markets as well as the large number of individuals who flock to the beach to buy directly at source. At the main beach in Benaulim, fish trader Hafiz Maulana told TOI that in the past four to five days, he bought as much as 30-40 tonnes of solar prawns from canoe owners. “The fishermen profited in every way as they could immediately sell their catch and earn instant cash,” he said, adding that even after buying most of the stock, there is still plenty of prawns available in the local market, village markets and makeshift spots occupied by fish vendors. Each canoe brings in 300kg to 500kg per trip from the sea, with some fishermen even making two sojourns as a huge quantity of solar prawns surfaced in the Arabian Sea during the past few days. Remy Fernandes, a fisherman and panchayat member, estimates that canoe owners from Benaulim, Varca and Colva must have netted more than 50 tonnes of solar prawns. However, some local activists have raised a red flag against prawns being loaded into insulated trucks, while complaining that the bandstand was reeking of foul smell. One traditional fisherman hit out at the activists. “This is the only time of the year we make some money, and our own villagers instead of supporting us are trying to stop it,” he said. Fernandes said that this activity has been going on for years, and that too only for 7-8 days annually. “Given the fact that the government has not provided refrigeration facilities, the fish traders are like saviours to us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fishermen-in-salcete-reap-bumper-catch-of-prawns/articleshow/84987636.cms||Nisser Dias

The city has seen a spike in positive cases and the health department is expecting the numbers to rise further over coming days. Some temple committees have urged the government to close temples where Bonalu celebrations took place for at least a few days and take up a thorough sanitisation drive covering all areas in the vicinity. The twin cities witnessed massive congregations over the past three weeks with nearly 500 shrines from Hyderabad and Secunderabad taking part in Bonalu celebrations. The state on its part had warned temple committees to follow Covid-19 protocols. While a few temples registered with the endowments department followed these protocols, many did not enforce them citing unprecedented crowds. “Our duty is to appeal to devotees to maintain social distancing and wear masks but we cannot insist every devotee to follow the Covid-19 SoP,” an endowments department official told TOI. It was observed that many who took part in elephant processions in Secunderabad and two other temples in Old City, completely ignored Covid-19 protocols. Asked about the sanitation operations, GHMC deputy commissioner for Falaknuma circle under Charminar zone, D Jagan said, “Sanitation staff is taking up operations on a regular basis. A day before congregations, entire temple premises is sanitised and similar operations are taken up next day too.” Another official also informed that sanitisation is being taken up regularly as per the GHMC commissioner’s orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bonalu-over-officials-now-wary-of-3rd-wave-of-covid-19/articleshow/84988824.cms||Sunil Mungara

This, as a result of a severe shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses. According to officials, there is currently a backlog of over 15 lakh second doses which has led to the current situation but they are hopeful that the shortage will be overcome in the next fortnight. People who are overdue for over 15 to 20 days have been lining up outside centres as early as 5 am despite the centres opening up at 9 am. Several temporary centres have been shut down by the authorities. “I had to wait for eight hours in a queue to get my vaccine. I came at 5 am and still found people ahead of me,” said Premalatha Copisetti who took her dose at the multi-purpose function hall in Marredpally which has been seeing situations of overcrowding. That paid vaccines are still easily available at private centres while free vaccines have run out in government centres has also irked many. “Registered on Cowin on 11th July, No Free Vaccines at any Govt centre in Hyderabad. Walked into 2 PHCs had to return after wasting time and money. Only Private Hospitals have it. Is Free Vaccine For All Just Another Slogan?” questioned Narendra Agrawal on Twitter. Another user with the handle @kallulenikabodi tweeted, “They have given covaxin in first phase in abundant and in second phase they stopped giving vaccines. Wherever you go in Hyderabad there is limited free vaccines and no centres available and 30 days are getting completed.” So far, 1.12 crore people have been administered vaccine doses in the state. Of them, nearly 34 lakh people have received both doses. In July, just over 22 lakh people were given second dose of Covishield while 12 lakh people are awaiting the second dose. Another three lakh people are awaiting Covaxin dose. On Monday, around 1.1 lakh doses were administered as per official statistics. “We are urging people not to panic and overcrowd places as the situation will ease out over the next few days,” said an official from the state health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/doses-short-endless-lines-at-vax-centres/articleshow/84988445.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: HSC results to be declared today at 4pm on board link||MUMBAI: The around 14 lakh HSC students will get their results at 4pm on Tuesday on the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education website. For those wanting to fly out for undergraduate education, as also for many who took the Common Law Admission Test and will be put through counselling, HSC results will mark the end of a long suspense. College principals said meeting the University Grants Commission deadline to start colleges by October 1 may be difficult. “At least four weeks will go by in the admission process. Meeting the October 1 deadline may be tough,” said T A Shiware, chairman of the Association of Non-Government Colleges. The HSC results will be declared on mahresult.nic.in, hscresult.mkcl.org and msbshse.co.in. Students unhappy with their scores can take one or two class improvement exams. Also, a complaint redressal officer has been appointed for each division for students who have any complaint on marks. The HSC results were expected to be out on July 31 but were delayed due to floods in Konkan and western Maharashtra last month. As a result, the process of compiling the marks got pushed. The HSC exams was slated to be held on June 3, but were later cancelled following the rise in Covid-19 cases across the state in the second wave. The exams were rescheduled twice between April and June. The government then decided to promote students based on a 30:30:40 formula, calculated by summing up the best of three subject scores of class 10, final exam marks of class 11 and the remaining based on college-level assessment in class 12, which can be either unit tests, first-semester exams or practice exams. For the practical component, marks have been awarded based on the state board’s existing policy. The same mode of assessment has been used to evaluate the performance of a candidate appearing for minimum competency vocational courses, bifocal vocational courses and courses aligned with the national skills qualification framework (NSQF).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hsc-results-to-be-declared-today-at-4pm-on-board-link/articleshow/84985538.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||India’s financial sector banks on IDRBT for security||With emerging technologies changing the way we bank, cyber security has emerged as a key area of concern. Prof D Janakiram, director of Hyderabad-based Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT) this year, speaks to Swati Rathor about the threats facing our banking systems and the work IDRBT is doing to beef up their security. How can banks strengthen security infrastructure?Banks have to be ahead of the hacker so, we are trying to create a change in the mindset of people managing these entities. For instance, many banks are innovating on AI/ML products by getting data from social media, where it is easy to manipulate data that leads to models being fed with wrong data. Hence, the whole system can be compromised. So, data integrity as well as security becomes a very critical part of the AI/ML system and that is an active research we are pursuing. The second thing we are trying to look at is how to reduce the impact of cyberattacks. For instance, if the digital transactions are on mobile platforms, one can use geo-fencing to reduce the chances of such attacks. Apart from this, cyber drills that we conduct regularly help banks spot vulnerabilities in their systems. We also have a threat intelligence platform that gathers information across banks and multiple sources and shares it with banks. Which technologies will impact the financial inclusion mandate in future?Technologies like 5G are likely to provide many opportunities as they will boost the number of internet users. When you add somebody to the financial system, that person would expect more facilities such as access to credit. Now, if you want to make credit accessible, one of the key things is the profile of the person, which means we collect data. Here the usage of the AI/ML models to be able to provide both, risk models as well as prediction models, will become necessary. What new research areas is IDRBT focusing on?We are focusing on next-generation digital financial infrastructure. The pandemic has made it imperative that we should have a next-generation video KYC platform. Currently there are many pain points for customers as every bank and financial services entity is trying to do its own video KYC. So, we are looking at a new platform, where, if the customer does a video KYC once, it will be available for other entities to verify. We would like to make this platform a part of the India Stack so that there is a quality enhancement in terms of the digital identity platforms. But what about new age skills in the banking sector?IDRBT is focusing on creating a cyber security skilled workforce because it is an extremely critical need. Besides, in the financial sector, skills pertaining to AI/ML and Cloud are also very important and we are working on that along with skilling on the 5G front.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/indias-financial-sector-banks-on-idrbt-to-neutralise-threats-beef-up-security/articleshow/84988940.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Hyderabad||Defections: Will BJP change tack in Telangana?||HYDERABAD: The reverse migration of leaders from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has forced saffron party bosses in thinking on reworking their strategy in Greater Hyderabad and Telangana. After prominent leaders like E Peddi Reddy, Mothkupalli Narsimhulu and Erra Shekhar’s exit from the BJP, the latest to join the bandwagon is former minister and four-term MLA Boda Janardhan, who is likely to join Congress soon. Party rivals are using different strategies to dent BJP. The ruling TRS has been trying to woo BJP leaders into its fold after suffering a jolt at the hands of the saffron party in GHMC election-2020. New TPCC president A Revanth Reddy is using his old connections with ex-TDP leaders who joined BJP to bring them into Congress fold. Revanth, who was earlier with TDP before joining Congress, had worked with many TDP leaders who have joined BJP. Revanth is on good terms even with BJP leaders as TDP-BJP had contested several elections as an alliance in GHMC and in the state. What has sent alarm bells is that several second- and third-rung BJP leaders from Greater Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy districts are reportedly in touch with Revanth and his new team. The worrying factor for BJP more than anything else is that those planning to leave the party now are looking at the Congress, its main rival at the national level. Also, BJP has a strong presence in GHMC area and its suburbs and was some time ago being projected as a major political force after its performance in Dubbak and GHMC-polls. However, its failure to retain Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahbubnagar graduate MLC seat, and poor performance in Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam graduate MLC constituency as well as Nagarjuna Sagar by-poll has raised questions about its growth in the state capital as well as in the interiors of the state. Speaking to TOI, Boda Janardhan said there are several leaders from Adilabad, Hanamkonda, Karimnagar, Nizamabad and Greater Hyderabad who are not interested in staying in BJP. “We joined BJP on different occasions to serve the people. But it has neither utilised our services nor there is a scope of growth as the party seems to be more interested in promotion of Hindutva ideology,” Janardhan said. “There are many leaders who joined BJP from other parties and are unhappy now. Many of them may quit.” A senior BJP leader rubbished the allegations of those leaving the party. All these people who came from other parties joined BJP with full knowledge about the party’s Hindutva ideology. “They had come for political opportunity and could be leaving for political opportunities,” the leader said. BJP state chief official spokesperson K Krishna Saagar Rao, said: “BJP doesn’t worry about people who leave the party. We are only worried about serving people and serving them well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/defections-will-bjp-change-tack/articleshow/84989710.cms||Roushan Ali

The tank, which has not been cleaned in decades, is filled with weeds affecting its water storage capacity.HR&CE sources said that the tank belongs to Ujjaini Makali Amman temple, a sub-temple of Samayapuram Arulmigu Mariamman temple, and is situated about a kilometre from the main temple. The tank, spread on 12,000 square feet, has not been maintained properly, owing to which temple rituals were not held in the tank. After a recent inspection, HR&CE proposed to revive the tank while Samayapuram temple sanctioned Rs 40.5 lakh from its funds towards desilting the tank and establishing retaining walls. The tank will be dredged up to a depth of 3m to increase water storage while the bunds will be strengthened with stones. “We have planned to complete the work in about five months,” an HR&CE official said.Preliminary construction work has commenced for the revival plan. The rainwater accumulated in the tank is being removed to desilt the tank bed. Further, there are proposals to establish stone halls within the tank to conduct float festivals separately for the Ujjaini Makali Amman temple, HR&CE added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rs-40-5l-allotted-for-desilting-temple-tank-in-samayapuram-work-begins/articleshow/84989695.cms||Deepak Karthik

It is learnt that a four-member team of the ultras visited Perinjermala tribal colony near Makkiyad under Thondernad police station limits on Sunday night. Thondernad police said that the team comprised two men and two women, who visited two houses in the colony around 8 pm and they distributed pamphlets among the residents. They also chanted slogans before leaving the area. They spent nearly 30 minutes with the people of the colony. The Maoists pasted posters in the name of Banasura Sagar Dalam of the CPI (Maoists) in the nearby electric posts calling for the public to observe the Martyr’s Week from July 28 to August 3. Also, the posters were highly critical of the government. Thondernad inspector of police said that the Maoists gang had two men and two men and that they were armed.

---||Pune||Huge rush behind Pune airport chaos: Officials||PUNE: On Sunday, the city airport handled a total of 15,129 passengers — the highest since the facility reopened after the lockdown last year, posing a major challenge to the authorities in crowd management. “This was the highest single day count since the lockdown in a 12-hour operation window,” an airport official said. “Due to unprecedented passenger load on Sunday, Pune Airport handled more than 15,000 passengers against a normal daily passenger count of 7,500-9,000. In addition, the security checks are more stringent in view of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) security alert, which caused congestion. While every effort is made to ensure social distancing, the limited capacity of the terminal building posed a challenge. We have sensitised the teams concerned and hope to have better crowd control in future,” the airport official added. During pre-Covid times, when the airport was operational 24 hours, the facility used to handle more than 25,000 passengers daily and the total flight movements were around 150. On Sunday, the airport’s scheduled flight movements were 108 — the highest in one-and-a- half years. However, the increased flights led to crowding, throwing social distancing norms to the wind. There were 96 scheduled flight movements on August 2. “With the Independence Day approaching, all establishments, including airports, are on high alert and security checks are more stringent. There are already more checks in place due to the pandemic. As per the normal standard operating procedure, the additional checks will remain in force till August 22. Hence, passengers are requested to report a bit earlier for their flights than the usual,” another airport official said. Domestic flights resumed on May 25 last year, but with restrictions on travel and regulations imposed by different state governments, passenger traffic at the Pune airport has not been even close to what it was during the pre-Covid times. The Pune airport has been operational only from 8am to 8pm since October last year due to runway re-carpeting work, impacting the number of flights and passenger traffic.Many flyers, however, didn’t buy the explanation given by the airport officials about high passenger load. “I am sure that the airport officials know what they are doing. The closure of the airport from 8pm to 8am has been there since October last year. The authorities should have used the lull period last year to plan, which does not seem to have happened,” Mayur Godse, a frequent flyer, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/officials-attribute-sunday-chaos-at-airport-to-high-passenger-load/articleshow/84989726.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Business||At $35.2 billion, exports hit record high in July||NEW DELHI: India’s monthly exports hit a high of $35.2 billion in July as higher oil prices and improved demand for gems and jewellery and textiles helped boost shipments from the country. But the trade deficit widened to $11.2 billion in July, the highest since April, as imports shot up to $46.4 billion, which is the third highest monthly value. Imports surged on account of higher gold and crude oil shipments into the country. Preliminary data released by the commerce department on Monday showed that exports in July were a shade higher than the $34.5 billion in March. Before that, the highest monthly exports were registered in March 2019. Nonoil exports were, however, lower than their value in March 2021, although engineering goods, drugs and pharmaceuticals were among the top performing sectors in terms of growth rate. Overall exports were 48% higher than July 2020, and 34% more than July 2019. “It is also a sign that global trade is recovering fast… the global demand during this period has also remained buoyant as the order booking positions of the exporters have still been impressive,” said A Sakthivel, president of industry lobby group FIEO. Economists are worried over the large value of gold coming into the country. “With the phased reopening of the economy, gold imports surged in July 2021. Gold imports have already crossed $12 billion in the first four months of this fiscal, and appear set to surpass last year’s level of $34.6 billion, with a pick-up likely in the festive period,” ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/at-35-2-billion-exports-hit-record-high-in-july/articleshow/84992704.cms||---

Borivli was followed by 5,414 new vehicles registered at Tardeo RTO in the island city in July.The statistics further showed the maximum number of electric vehicles were registered at Andheri RTO in the western suburbs, with 104 new electric cars and bikes hitting the roads last month. The maximum CNG cars and public transport vehicles were registered at Wadala RTO (524 vehicles) which covers the eastern suburbs.“This has happened in a month when the city was unlocked and there was demand for new vehicles,” said a transport official, adding the registration process was also expedited as there is a new online portal for dealers to register vehicles at their level, pay taxes and ensure speedy deliveries.Transport experts said the majority of buyers preferred personal vehicles to avoid public transport during a pandemic, and as a “good form of social distancing”. There was availability of easy loan EMIs to purchase new vehicles. More than 60% of the vehicles sold in July were two-wheelers.A V Shenoy of Mumbai Mobility Forum said, “I agree that bikes are a convenience and sales are high. But many riders need to be disciplined and there should be stringent enforcement against those not wearing helmets, riding triple-seat, speeding and cutting lanes. Also, there should be a push for e-vehicles.”Transport expert Ashok Datar said while revival of the economy was welcome, the growth of the vehicle population was alarming. “It is high time we promote more AC buses to replace private cars and bikes on the road. A single bus can carry passengers equivalent to nine cars,” he suggested. The city now has over 40 lakh vehicles, with nearly 12 lakh cars and a 24 lakh two-wheeler population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-own-vehicles-help-citizens-avoid-crowds-during-covid/articleshow/84987755.cms||Somit Sen

---||Kolkata||Presidency asks UG applicants to ‘report online’ to weed out ‘non-serious’ candidates||Kolkata: Many colleges and universities have introduced certain clauses in their undergraduate admission procedure to help them identify candidates genuinely interested in studying subjects they have applied for, weed out applicants blocking seats unnecessarily and cancel applications of those who might have submitted incorrect information about their results. Students seeking admission to any of the undergraduate courses at Presidency University will have to “report online” before the publication of the first provisional merit list for admission. There, applicants will have to upload their photos, signatures and all necessary documents in prescribed format. “This time it has been introduced at the beginning of the admission process so that a situation, where seats are blocked by uninterested candidates, can be avoided. The category-wise provisional merit lists will be published by the university after verifying all the documents and assessing that the candidates are genuinely interested in pursuing the subject,” said an official at the university. Students whose names appear on the online reporting list will be provided a link. Lady Brabourne College has also kept a provision for a “wish list” for candidates to register their willingness for admission in a particular subject. The wish list will be activated after the revised comprehensive list is published. Students whose name appear on the provisional list will be able to register for the wish list for a subject of their choice. The college said it would share more details once all the applications were submitted. Many other institutes have implemented similar provisions, which they had introduced later last year, when colleges and universities struggled to fill seats even after several attempts. The admission deadline had to be pushed back multiple times. Last year, the online reporting was introduced almost eight weeks after admissions started. The admission fiasco had prompted several institutes to put up notices, saying if a candidate did not appear for online reporting his or her name would not be considered for admission any more. All these various measures are being taken by colleges and universities as Class XII board examinations were cancelled this year due to the pandemic and the final scores were calculated based on formulae adopted by different boards and councils. With the government ruling out entrance tests or online interviews of applicants and directing that admissions have to be only on final results, the institutes have decided on different “screening” steps so that seats are not unnecessarily blocked and deserving candidates get to study their preferred subjects at desired institutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/presidency-asks-ug-applicants-to-report-online-to-weed-out-non-serious-candidates/articleshow/84987726.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The judges took note of the fact that a GO was passed in 2015 for alienating a portion of the waterbody in favour of TN Industrial Investment Corporation Limited (TIIC) for construction of their Sivakasi branch office.The judges observed that solid waste management rules framed by the ministry of environment mandates such micro compost centres to be established throughout the country. Since this is not only a statutory requirement, but requirement for the protection of the environment, the court would not be justified in interdicting such welfare measures. Undoubtedly, the step taken by the government in alienation of a waterbody in favour of TIIC is a clear breach of the public trust reposed on the government. If the TIIC has not yet put up the construction, then it is time for the government to rethink and reverse its earlier decision.Since the micro compost centre has been established by spending money, the judges said that they are not inclined to disturb it. The judges directed the Sivakasi municipality to ensure that a compound wall is constructed around the centre so that no part of any leachate from the garbage gets drained into the waterbody. The judges also directed the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board officials to conduct periodical inspection to ensure that no pollution is caused to the waterbody from the MCC.The judges further directed the authorities to ensure that no encroachments are made on the waterbody in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/govt-move-to-alienate-waterbody-breach-of-public-trust-says-hc/articleshow/84989755.cms||Kaushik Kannan

I will discuss the issue of my resignation with my party president and leadership,” Raja Singh said. He said: “If KCR announces the packages by giving Rs 10 lakh to each Dalit family in my constituency and takes up developmental works, I would resign in the presence of legislative assembly speaker or in the presence of the CM himself.” The BJP MLA said even after the CM’s packages, people will still repose faith in him and re-elect him in the bypolls. He said people in various assembly constituencies have started demanding their respective ministers and MLAs to resign so that the CM will announce packages. Congress MLA from Munugode Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy recently came up with the same proposal and offered to resign as a legislator if the CM gives Rs 10 lakh to each Dalit family in his assembly constituency on the lines of Huzurabad. The CM had already announced a package of Rs 10 lakh to each Dalit family in Huzurabad which is going for a by-election soon. Apart from Dalit Bandhu pilot project, the government began distribution of sheep and took up Rs 650 crore worth civic and developmental works in Huzurabad. In Nagarjuna Sagar where bypolls were held in April, the CM had announced Rs 2,000 crore worth lift schemes for irrigation projects and granted Rs 150 crore for developmental works in the constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/raja-singh-will-quit-if-cm-grants-sops-to-goshamahal/articleshow/84989751.cms||Koride Mahesh

The university will also honour Solar Industries chairman Satyanarayan Nuval, a reputed industrialist from Vidarbha, with the ‘lifetime achievement award’. Due to Covid-induced restrictions, the celebrations would be online from 9.30am. Rajya Sabha member Rakesh Sinha will be the chief guest. Vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari will preside over the function to be graced by pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe. Last year, the foundation day function could not be held due to the lockdown-enforced curbs to stop the spread of the virus, even though the names of meritorious students and employees were announced. Last year, the lifetime achievement award was conferred on well-known artist Chandrakant Channe, said NU media coordinator Rajendra Pathak. The university will also felicitate Management Council member Vishnu Changde, senate member Manmohan Bajpayee and NU director of students’ welfare Abhay Mudgal. The trio was part of the committee constituted to help students suffering due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Their panel came out with innovative schemes like providing insurance cover to students in case of death of their legal guardian and reduction in examination and other fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-to-bestow-lifetime-achievement-award-on-solar-explosives-chief/articleshow/84984181.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

A Narayanan, 65, from Manalmedu village in Thirupuvanam, has about 300 native coconut palms on his farm which have good yield as each tree, which is about 25 to 35-year-old, bears about 40 to 50 coconuts every 45 days. Last year, he had seen a few nests of the weaver birds hanging on some of his trees. “At first I did not give it much thought, but then a handful of nests became many, and it was as though the birds preferred my farm to the others,” he said. Narayanan has forsaken the coconuts on the 10 trees since then so that as the birds that have built over 100 nests on them can thrive.“The coconuts sell for a good price in the market, but now I have started to look out for the nests on the trees before picking the coconuts,” he said, adding that the birds are smart. “They don’t build the nests on the palms at the tip of the coconut palm leaves, but on the stronger inner leaves, which stay on the plant for more than six months,” he said.P Raja, Narayanan’s nephew, said that when a nest falls off, the birds start building new nests immediately. “There are coconut husks, mud and long reeds in these nests which have chambers.”People have started coming to the farm with their children to show them the nests. “Mornings and evenings in my farm have become joyful with the chirping of these birds. The fact that they are nesting on my land is a matter of pride to me,” said Narayanan, adding he does not mind losing some money by leaving hundreds of coconuts unpicked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/farmer-leaves-trees-undisturbed-to-protect-bird-nests/articleshow/84989764.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala’s rainfall deficiency may continue in August too||KOCHI: The southwest monsoon is likely to be normal to below normal for Kerala for the month of August, according to the long-range forecast released by the IMD on Monday. The weather department said that all southern states in the Peninsular region got excess rain in July except Kerala which had around 20% less in July. Southwest monsoon will be weak in the coming few days. The overall deficiency for Kerala from June 1 till date is 29%. Speaking to media, IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said that the monsoon pattern is showing that there is fall in light and widespread rainfall days and increase in the excess rainfall spells. This is neutralizing the deficiency in the month. Many districts including Alappuzha, Kannur, Kasaragod, Kollam, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur and Wayanad had more than 30-39% deficiency in June 1 to Aug 2. For the next few days, there is no specific warning for fishermen against venturing into Kerala coastal waters. But there is a high swell alert from INCOIS which said that high swell waves in the range of 2.3-2.6m are forecast till 23:30 hours of Aug 3 along Kerala coast between Vizhijam and Kasaragod. Current speeds vary from 53-77 cm/sec. The IMD in its extended rainfall forecast had said that at present, the southwest monsoon is active over major parts of the Arabian Sea and northern parts of Bay of Bengal. Strong surface winds of the order of 15-25 knots are prevailing over the north Indian ocean. However, most of the numerical models indicate a gradual reduction in the north-south pressure gradient over the north Indian ocean from August 8. This could imply a likely weakening of the monsoon winds at sea level over both the coasts from next week. Private weather agency Skymet Weather said that the southwest monsoon 2021 has registered a healthy normal rainfall in the first half of the season. However, visible shortfall at midway of season is witnessed in Kerala, Gujarat and northeast India. Kerala and northeast region are the rainiest pockets and therefore can absorb a deficiency of about 10-15% without impacting the environmental balance. But a shortfall of 20% or more leaves perceivable markers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/states-rainfall-deficiency-may-continue-in-august-too/articleshow/84987782.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Speaking at a function organised by Goan Seafarers Association of India (GSAI) to distribute Covid kits to the seafarers of Canacona taluka, Naik said that the scheme which is formulated by the NRI commission should be made permanent and not restricted to only six months as stated in the policy document. He further said the seafarers contribute to the Goan economy in a big way and hence it is government's duty to compensate them in their old age. Chairperson of Canacona Municipal Council Simon Rebello called upon the seafarers to unite and put forth their demands before the government. He further said that the authorities will be compelled to act on their demands if the community of seafarers unitedly fight for it.

The single bench may not be justified in going beyond the scope of the prayer sought for and issuing direction, especially when the petition was not a public interest litigation and the case was not heard by the division bench. The judges observed that the single bench took upon itself the responsibility of framing guidelines in order to ensure that the survey department in the state functions with utmost devotion to work and integrity. The judges said that the single bench issued several directions to the government including a specific direction to issue a circular regarding transfer of surveyors. The commissioner of survey and settlement also issued a circular pursuant to the order. The judges observed that a GO was passed in 1994 by the government dealing with the transfers of surveyors. The order passed by the single bench regarding the circular to deal with the transfer of surveyors could not have been issued as it is en-route to the administrative affairs of the government.Hence, judges allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the single bench and the circular issued pursuant to its order. The judges also directed the commissioner of survey and settlement to issue a circular stating that the transfers shall be governed by the GO passed in 1994, till the government takes any new fresh decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-sets-aside-single-benchs-order-on-transfer-of-surveyors/articleshow/84989784.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Currently, the joints of the flyover are being repaired due to which the underpass has been shut. Only one lane — from Ghaziabad to Delhi — is operational. Delhi Traffic Police has closed the underpass with cement boulders, while cones and barricades have been placed to regulate traffic. Traffic personnel have been deployed on the flyover to facilitate smooth movement of vehicles. The Public Works Department began work on Monday on the joints on the upper part of the flyover and drilling work has also commenced. It would take around 10 days to carry out the repair work. Suman Goyal, additional commissioner of police, traffic, said, “The underpass was closed from Monday and traffic cops are on the ground to monitor the situation. We are also alerting about the traffic situation through our social media handle.” Diversions for commuters and motorists exist at the underpass near Mother Dairy, Pandav Nagar and Hasanpur. People coming from Laxmi Nagar and going from Mother Dairy towards Kalyanpuri and Trilokpuri can take the left turn onto the service road of NH-24. They can then take the U-turn from the next underpass and reach their destination. Similarly, people coming from Kalyanpuri and Trilokpuri and going towards Laxmi Nagar and Ghazipur can take the left turn on the service road of NH-24 from the Mother Dairy underpass up to Akshardham, NHAI office and go to their destinations. Commuters have been facing trouble due to the diversion as one side of the flyover is already blocked by the farmers protesting at the Ghazipur border. This has been adding to the chaos on the route, especially for those commuting from the NCR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/repair-on-nh-24-chaos-at-underpass-near-mother-dairy/articleshow/85021807.cms||---

Much to the frustration of senior cops, the TRS government is not known for timely transfer of officers, sometimes even after promoting an official multiple times. Currently, there are four DG-rank officers in Telangana cadre, including head of the police force M Mahendar Reddy, director-general of prisons and correctional services Rajiv Trivedi, Bureau of Police Research & Development additional director-general Santosh Mehra and DG, ACB, J Purnachandra Rao. A DG-rank officer of 1978 batch, M Gopi Krishna, who was commissioner, printing stationery and stores purchase, retired in July. ACB DG Purnachandra Rao and DG, prisons, Rajiv Trivedi will be retiring end of August and September respectively. DG of ACB, Purnachandra Rao also holds full additional charge (FAC) of vigilance and enforcement department and Gopi Krishna was holding FAC of DG Special Protection Force. With important posts becoming vacant, officers of 1989 and 1990 batch, awaiting promotion, were hopeful the government will promote them soon. In neighboring Andhra Pradesh, 1989 batch officers were promoted to DG rank in 2019, but their batchmate in Telangana — Umesh Sharraf —is still an additional DG. The 1990 batch officers — Anjani Kumar, Ravi Gupta and Govind Singh — are next in line for promotion. As DGP M Mahendar Reddy has about one-and-half years service left, there is stiff competition for ACB chief’s post, which will fall vacant soon. A few city commissioners are reportedly lobbying for it. Several officers, who have been promoted long ago, like additional CP Shikha Goel, Rachakonda CP Mahesh Bhagwat, Cyberabad CP VC Sajjanar, Hyderabad joint CPs AR Srinivas, M Ramesh and P Viswa Prasad are still working in their current posts.

---||Kochi||Supreme Court rejects pleas seeking bail for defrocked priest Robin Vadakkumchery||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday firmly rejected a joint plea by a rape survivor and the convict, defrocked Catholic priest Robin Vadakkumchery, for grant of interim bail to him to allow them to get married and give legitimacy to the child born out of the priest’s sexual assault on the woman when she was a minor. Sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment by the Thalassery Pocso court in February 2019, in what is infamously known as the ‘Kottiyoor rape case’, a 52-year-old Vadakkumchery through counsel Amit George argued before a bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari that he had a fundamental right to marry and the court cannot refuse him that right. The rape survivor, who was repeatedly sexually assaulted by him when she was just 16 years old and gave birth to a boy in February 2017, too requested the bench through senior advocate Kiran Suri that grant of interim bail to Vadakkumchery would enable them to get married and give legitimacy to the child, who needs a name of his father for admission to school. Keeping in view the consistent ruling of the SC that the proposal to marry the rape survivor after getting convicted for rape warranted no leniency, the bench told Vadakkumchery that the conviction still stands against him. “Whatever relief you want you must appeal to the Kerala high court which is in session of your appeal against conviction,” the bench said. “As far as the present appeals…, we will not entertain them,” the bench said. The inglorious modus operandi and pressure tactics brought on by the former Catholic priest was evident from the fact that immediately after the minor girl gave birth to a child, the woman’s own father claimed that he had raped his daughter and impregnated her. Only later, he had broken down and confessed that the real father of the illegitimate child was Vadakkumchery, which was established beyond doubt through a DNA test. In February, the HC had dismissed Vadakkumchery’s petition seeking bail to marry the survivor. After considering his contention that it was consensual sex and that he had renounced his priesthood to marry the survivor, Justice Sunil Thomas had said the trial court’s finding that the survivor was a minor at the time of the alleged rape is still in force. The SC on Monday said there was no ground for interfering with the well-reasoned order of the HC refusing bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sc-rejects-pleas-seeking-bail-for-defrocked-priest/articleshow/84987828.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The market was overcrowded and many were found not wearing masks when district collector S Aneesh Sekhar conducted a surprise visit following complaints of lockdown violations.Sekhar said the decision was taken considering the welfare of the public to curtail spread of the virus. However, to ensure that traders, shopkeepers and consumers are not affected by the closure, the collector permitted temporary functioning of the market from a portion of the omnibus stand at Mattuthavani. Only wholesale will be permitted from the temporary site. The collector also banned retail sale of vegetable and fruits from the wholesale vegetable market and fruit market in Mattuthavani and the wholesale vegetable market in Paravai.Officials said the move was meant to prevent crowding, which could lead to spread of Covid-19. These markets would be open only for wholesale but they would also be shut down if wearing masks and maintaining social distance are not adhered to. Earlier in the day, the collector during an inspection in the corporation limits slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 each on two hotels on the North Masi Street and Vilakuthoon and Rs 5,000 each on a leading jewellery outlet on the West Masi Street and Rs 2,000 each on two jewellery outlets in Netaji Nagar for violation of Covid-19 norms.The district administration has also warned traders in the busy commercial areas in the city that their shops will be closed and sealed if they allowed customers without masks or if they violated Covid-19 norms. They will also be booked under the Disaster Management and Epidemic Diseases Act. This is in view of heavy crowds anticipated at textile outlets and commercial establishments in the Veli Streets, Masi Streets, Chithirai Streets, Goripalayam, Arasaradi, Kalavasal Bypass Road and Kamarajar Road from Madurai and neighbouring districts for the festival season. Meanwhile, devotees will not be permitted to 22 important temples in Madurai district from Monday to Sunday (August 2 to 8). Temple staff will be permitted to perform regular pujas during this period.

The suspect, Dadasaheb Thombre, had allegedly sought the bribe to remove the grocer’s name from the list of suspects in the case registered with the Baramati taluka police in rural Pune. “Thombre had summoned the grocer for questioning in connection with the case and demanded a Rs1.80 lakh bribe to delete his name,” additional superintendent of police (ACB) Shrihari Patil stated in a release on Monday. Patil said Thombre agreed for a reduced sum of Rs1.10 lakh and told the grocer to bring the cash to his office. After the grocer tipped off the ACB, a police team verified the information, laid a trap, and caught the havaldar red-handed around 10.30pm. ACB sleuths conducted searches at the suspect’s residence in Baramati but found nothing incriminating.

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a PIL filed by PUCL general secretary Jaya Vindhyala seeking stern action against police personnel responsible for the custodial death and also pay a compensation of Rs 5 crore to the kin of Mariamma. Advocate general BS Prasad informed that a judicial probe by Alair judicial first class magistrate was underway as per HC orders. “The magistrate got a re-postmortem conducted and a report is awaited from authorities,” he said. The state had dismissed from service the errant sub-inspector and two constables responsible for the death of Mariamma, the AG said. The state also paid a compensation of Rs 15 lakh to the kin of the deceased and a government job would be provided to her son, he added. Stating these belated measures will not bring back the life of his mother, the bench asked the state to take illegal confinements of people seriously. “This is very essential in a country like ours,” the HC said. The HC went through the counters of police and wondered what purpose would it serve to rectify the dysfunctional CCTVs now. They were reportedly not functioning during when Mariamma and her son were detained. The HC directed police to file a fresh counter informing the result of the re-postmortem and progress in investigation by September 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/custodial-death-hc-draws-attention-to-illegal-detentions/articleshow/84989829.cms||---

The existing pipeline supplying water to residents was laid around 40 years ago and people had to depend on PWD tankers for water as and when taps ran dry. Local ward councillor Sudesh Bhosle has taken up the initiative to supplement the water supply to the tenements of the New Vaddem colony, especially those residing next to Shree Rashtroli Jai Santoshi Mata Temple. Bhosle said that minister for transport and panchayat Mauvin Godinho has proposed to strengthen water supply to the entire New Vaddem area wherever people are facing acute shortage of water by tapping the water lines and replacing old water pipelines. “The work of tapping water lines and replacing old pipelines has begun in the Housing Board colony in New Vaddem. The commissioning of JICA-funded pipelines would help to resolve the water woes permanently in New Vaddem and it’s surrounding areas,” said Bhosle. He also said that he has requested Godinho to look into the condition of the overhead water tank located at last stop in New Vaddem as concrete patches of the tanks are falling down posing a risk to people residing close by. Bhosle also said that a proposal of beautification of the ground at the Vaddem Nagar Government High School with a walking track and illumination has been discussed with Godinho which will also serve as a public recreation center.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/water-supply-boost-for-new-vaddem-locals/articleshow/84987886.cms||---

It is not known as to why the municipality has not taken any action. If the petty shops are selling eatables, it will lead to spread of disease and the area appears to be very unhygienic. Hence, the judges directed the municipality officials to immediately conduct an inspection of the area and if any temporary shops or stalls are put up, the same shall be removed forthwith.The judges further observed that it is needless to state that the municipal authorities should inspect the entire road and remove all encroachments. “This will also apply to other roads and streets in the municipal limits and authorities need not to wait for any direction to be issued by this court,” observed the judges. The judges observed that if action is not being initiated, then the court can also presume that there is some other agenda for not taking action. The municipality should not come adverse notice of this court in any of such matters, observed the judges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/take-steps-to-clear-illegal-structures-madras-hc/articleshow/84989840.cms||---

The deceased has been identified as P Madankumar, 22, a painter from Stalin Colony in Kovilpatti, who went missing from his house on July 29 and was found murdered – with his head severed -- at Manthithoopu the next morning. After inquiries, the Kovilpatti West police narrowed down on the teenager who hailed from another village. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the duo were friends and worked together as painters. Police said that the victim, as well as the accused, liked the same girl. The 16-year-old girl, a school dropout after Class VIII, was texting both of them but was closer to Madankumar. “The teenager considered Madankumar a threat to his love and decided to murder him. The boy had set a trap to murder Madankumar before inviting him for a drink on July 29. He hid a machete in bushes at Manthithoopu,” superintendent of police S Jayakumar said. The friends arrived on separate two-wheelers and started drinking. The boy waited for Madankumar to get drunk. He beheaded Madankumar from behind while the latter was looking at his mobile phone. He threw the machete into a nearby pond. Police took the accused to the tank and retrieved the machete on Monday. The teenager was taken to a home for children in conflict with the law. Earlier, SP Jayakumar visited the spot and a special team was formed to nab the accused. The body was sent to the Kovilpatti government hospital for postmortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/teenager-beheads-friend-over-triangular-love/articleshow/84989823.cms||---

They claim that a similar facility has already started in many states.“In every colony, there are around 5-10 residents who are either bedridden, ailing and fragile, or fall in the special needs category. They are not in a position to step out of their house to go to an authorised centre for vaccination. In fact, these are the people who are more vulnerable and at higher risk as compared to others. If these people are not vaccinated, the loop stays incomplete,” stated a joint letter signed by around 60 representatives from various RWAs. It was sent to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Monday.Residents stated that after the government’s order to hold camps for people with no concrete address proof, such as beggars, sadhus and migrated workers, district administrations had held several such camps that benefited many people.“In south district, the DM had appointed a nodal officer for coordinating and holding camps for those without IDs. Some arrangements should be made for these people also. We are ready to extend all support. Similar facilities have already started in places like Mumbai,” said Ruby Makhija, secretary of Navjiwan Vihar RWA.Some RWAs in Delhi are organising paid or free vaccination camps in their areas with permission from district administrations. But they are not allowed to visit any house for administering jabs.Hardeep Bhalla, president of Western Avenue Residents’ Welfare Association, Sainik Farm, said that they had organised rounds of vaccination camps for its residents and workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/arrange-vax-for-disabled-bedridden-rwas-urge-lg/articleshow/84987852.cms||Vibha Sharma

It took at least three hours for the officials to douse the fire.The fire department officials also later ensured the area was cooled down to avoid restarting of fire. Officials said that the cause of the fire was unknown till further investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/fire-breaks-out-at-plastic-godown-in-madurai-no-injuries-reported/articleshow/84989883.cms||---

Earlier, police had received a statement from a friend of Rakhil that he had gone along with him to Bihar. Police said that no one has been taken into custody and that the friend of Rakhil was fully cooperating with the probe. Police refused to confirm whether this youth would be taken to Bihar along with the team as part of the probe. “We would be investigating the place where he stayed in Bihar and his connections there. Call records would be examined to find out his contacts there. Information collected from his friends would also be verified by the team sent to Bihar,” said an officer with the rural police. On Sunday, minister M V Govindan had said that police have received evidence relating to the perpetrator’s travel to Bihar. He had also said that Rakhil had gone to Bihar along with a friend. The shocking incident happened on Friday afternoon when 32-year-old Rakhil, a Kannur native, barged into the house where the victim, Manasa was staying. He had allegedly shot her before taking his own life. Police are also awaiting the autopsy report of the deceased. Police suspect that the man got the idea about purchasing the gun from Bihar after coming to know about its availability there from a guest worker. Police are also investigating whether Rakhil selling his car had any connection with the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/five-sleuths-to-go-to-bihar-to-find-source-of-pistol/articleshow/84987860.cms||---

---||Delhi||Covid can trigger dormant heart disease to surface in patients||NEW DELHI: Covid-19 can trigger sudden onset of an underlying heart condition, cardiologists from GB Pant Hospital have warned. In a case report published in European Heart Journal, the doctors described how a 57-year-old man with no history of cardiac illness was suddenly rushed to the hospital’s emergency block with dangerously high heart rate. “He had received electric shocks twice in a peripheral hospital to stabilise the heart rhythm. We had to administer it again in the emergency ward as the heart rate peaked while he was being wheeled in for tests,” said Dr Jama Yusuf, director and professor of cardiology at GB Pant. Later, tests confirmed that the patient was Covid-positive. Dr Yusuf said tests also revealed raised systemic inflammatory markers and cardiac Troponin-T levels that suggest injury to the heart. Both the markers increased progressively for four weeks during which the 57-year-old remained Covid-positive. They started to decrease and return to the baseline by the sixth week of illness when the patient became Covid-negative. A team of doctors, led by the head of the cardiology department Dr Saibal Mukhopadhyay, implanted a single-chamber ICD to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death. ICD is a small battery-powered device that can deliver electric shocks via one or more wires connected to the patient’s heart to fix abnormal rhythm. Though the 57-year-old did not have any history of cardiac illness before, the doctors found out from family members that two of his siblings had died due to sudden cardiac event at ages 55 and 59 years, respectively. “It’s possible that the patient also carried the same genetic disorder that caused sudden cardiac death in his siblings. It was lying dormant, completely unknown to the man or his family members, but Covid-19 infection unmasked it by precipitating the heart condition,” the cardiologist explained. The doctor added that the patient was lucky to have reached a super-specialty hospital in time for diagnosis and disease management. “The message for the public from this case study is that Covid-19 doesn’t affect the lungs alone. It can cause an array of heart-related complications too. Therefore, it’s important to watch out for warning signs, take timely action and rush the patient to a hospital to save their life,” Dr Yusuf said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-can-trigger-dormant-heart-disease-to-surface-in-patients/articleshow/84987871.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Delhi||More enforcement needed to curb virus spread in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Over 6,000 challans are being issued every day by the administration in all 11 districts against people not following Covid-appropriate behaviour, including social distancing and not wearing masks properly. However, they are not meeting the daily target of 11,000 challans. This can threaten the progress made by people and the government in containing the novel coronavirus, which caused havoc over three months ago. In the last two days of July, 149 enforcement teams together issued 12,277 challans, a number that has been almost consistent since reopening of the economy was permitted. The daily Covid-19 cases appear to be slowly increasing. On Sunday, the capital reported the highest positivity rate of 0.12% (85 new cases) in the last 24 days. In some parts of the country, the number of cases is increasing faster, so Delhiites must remain alert and take all necessary precautions. “The teams are working hard and trying to ensure that all violators are challaned. They are deployed in markets and other crowded places to make sure that enforcement remains at a high level,” said a revenue department official. The official added that monsoon had affected the overall enforcement action. “On rainy days, crowds in markets and public places are low, which results in fewer challans being issued,” said the official. North district has deployed the highest number of enforcement teams. These 34 teams issued 973 challans on July 31. The lowest number of 309 challans was issued in South West district, which has only 10 teams. Shahdara district has 12 enforcement teams and they issued 950 challans. Enforcement has two components — issuing of challans and creating awareness among people about following Covid-appropriate behaviour, like wearing masks properly and not spitting in public. While the district teams are creating awareness, the authorities have also engaged residents’ welfare associations and market associations for the purpose. Though the districts largely vary in terms of population, population density, concentration of markets and commercial hubs, more manpower can be deployed for enforcement so that a larger number of people follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Delhi has permitted almost all economic activities, which has led to crowds in markets. In such a situation, laxity in enforcement can lead to spread of the viral infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-enforcement-needed-to-curb-virus-spread/articleshow/84987893.cms||AlokKNMishra

The judge also issued form-1 notices in the contempt case to Khairatabad zonal commissioner of GHMC P Pravinya and assistant city planner Raj Kumar and directed them to be present before the court on August 31 and also for all the further hearings in the matter. Notices were also issued to west zone deputy commissioner of police AR Srinivas, Malakpet ACP M Sudarshan and Banjara Hills station house officer P Sivachandra in the contempt case filed by B Prakash, Venkata Krishna and four other property owners. After perusing the record, the judge sought answers from them as to why they allowed an iron sheet wall and fence to be demolished despite orders from the court that allowed the owners to take such measures to protect a plot of 11,000 square yards in survey number 129/56.  Petitioners’ counsel informed the court that the high court had earlier allowed them to level the plot and also to fence it to protect it from encroachments. An appeal preferred by the state government over this piece of land was heard by the Supreme Court which also issued a status quo order, asking both the state government and the petitioners to keep the status of the land as it is. “But, the actions of the GHMC in demolishing and police in allowing such illegal official action goes against the orders of the high court and the apex court,” the petitioners said. The high court had earlier declared Venkata Krishna as the owner of the plot after a prolonged legal battle and third parties were now resorting to illegally disturb the rightful owners of the plot, the petitioners’ counsel said. “We have assured the court that we will not raise any structures in the land without permission and then only we were given the permission by the high court to level the land and protect it with a fence,” the counsel said. The judge then directed the zonal commissioner and assistant city planner to appear before the court and explain why they should not be punished for violating the orders of the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-issues-notices-to-ghmc-chief-hyd-cp-in-contempt-case/articleshow/84989929.cms||---

The other two managed to escape with the stolen cash. The two men were handed over to the police. A court on Monday remanded the duo — Aniket Kondiba Dudhgonde (19) and Hrishikesh Kishor Pawar (22) — in police custody till August 6. “We have launched a search for the two men on the run,” a Chakan police officer said, adding, “We have obtained details of those two men, who are casual workers.” The incident occurred around 2am on Sunday. The ATM is operated by a prominent development finance bank. Police said bank officials were assessing the cash missing and that they were waiting for a report on the stolen amount. In the same FIR, the police have also charged the bank and its officials of negligence as they failed to appoint security guards and take other security measures, despite prior notices and requests made by the police. “Dudhgonde and Pawar hail from Parbhani and Jalgaon, respectively. They share rented accommodation with the other two suspects in Talegaon Dhamdere. Dudhgonde worked as an attendant at a private company while Pawar was employed as a commercial vehicle driver. The four men wanted to make a quick buck and decided to rob the ATM,” assistant inspector Sarang Chavan of the Chakan police said. The ATM is in an industrial and residential area, with some establishments — eateries and small units —operating in the vicinity. Police said the suspects reached the ATM kiosk with their faces covered and armed with sharp weapons and equipment to break open the cash dispenser. Once they entered the kiosk, they first covered the lens of the CCTV cameras with black tape and cut the power cables. So, the cameras were able to record nothing beyond their entry, police said. Sagar Bhangare, a local resident, arrived at the ATM to make a withdrawal when he saw the four suspects break open the cash dispenser, police said. He tried to stop them, but the four men rained blows on him and started running away in different directions. The resultant commotion drew the attention of others in the vicinity, who rushed to the spot and managed to apprehend Dudhgonde and Pawar. The other two made their escape. “At that very moment, a police patrol team arrived at the spot and took custody of the duo,” assistant inspector Chavan said. “The exact amount of the cash stolen from the ATM is being ascertained. The bank is tallying the cash deposits and withdrawals from the machine. We will include the amount of the cash in the FIR after receiving the report from the bank,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/four-men-steal-cash-from-atm-near-chakan-residents-nab-two-of-them/articleshow/84989937.cms||---

Without access to smartphones, the children had not been able to learn their topics online.“In Subramaniapuram, the issue of the increasing number of dropouts have become a concern as parents, most of them sanitation workers, are unable to help or pay attention to their children’s studies properly, especially during the pandemic. We came together to help the children learn by holding tuition classes in the evening,” said M Kaleeswaran, a student at the Government Law College, Ramanathapuram whose parents are sanitation workers. The classes are being conducted for the past three months between 6 pm and 8 pm daily, except for Sundays and when the second lockdown was imposed. For students of Class I to V, basics such as reading and writing are being taught so that they don’t lose touch. For Class VI to X students, the focus is on subjects such as math and science. “We are hoping to bring in Class XI and XII students soon. If these children become dropouts, they are likely to become sanitation workers,” said Kaleeswaran. Among the 10 who are involved in teaching, some are college students, while others are working. “The children’s parents have also been supportive. They even came to us saying that the children are not at all studying at home and are now able to learn something by attending the classes,” said Kaleeswaran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/to-end-dropout-crisis-youths-take-tuition-classes-for-sanitation-workers-children/articleshow/84989934.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

She was 80. To the young generation, Kalyani was one of the key voices behind the hit song ‘Kadhale Kadhale’ in the 2018 Tamil film ‘96’ –– which she sang at the age of 77. To young artistes, she was a mentor, advising them on their careers as well as hosting jugalbandhis at her home to encourage them. To her young granddaughters Saraswati and Lakshmi Menon, she was the epitome of strength. “We grew up with stories of how she defied the norms of the time,” says Saraswati. “When her husband died, she refused to pay heed to those who told her widows had to stay home or dress a certain way. She would dress the way she wanted, wear a bindi, and go out and sing. It was a struggle at the time, but she never caved in. She did what she loved,” she says. “Last Tuesday, two days before her stroke, she was correcting some technicalities in a song I had learned in my Hindustani lesson,” says her son Karunakar Menon, financial advisor, and chief accounts officer for Southern Railway. Kalyani began her career as a classical singer in the 1970s, and then established a parallel career as a playback singer. She made her playback singing debut in ‘Abala’, a Malayalam film released in 1973. She shot to fame by singing in the movie, ‘Dweep’ directed by Malayalam director Ramu Kariat. Since then she was a regular presence in South Indian movies, including Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam. Kalyani’s famous songs with noted singer K J Yesudas in Malayalam include ‘Rithubheda Kalpana Charutha Nalkiya’ of 1983 movie ‘Mangalam Nerunnu’ and ‘Pavanarachezhuthunnu Kolangalennum’ of Mohanlal-starrer ‘Vietnam Colony’ released in the year 1992. Born in Ernakulam, Kalyani started singing at the age of five in the Navaratri Sangeeth Utsav organised in the famous TDM hall there. Over the decades, she has sung in several Malayalam and Tamil films including the famous ‘Nee varuvai ena’ in the Tamil film ‘Sujatha’ (1980). She worked extensively with composer AR Rahman in the late 1990s and early 2000s – she sang for his album Vande Matharam (1997) and Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010). In 2000, Kalyani appeared in a cameo in the film Kandukondein Kandukondein, directed by her son Rajiv Menon. In 2010, she was the recipient of the Tamil Nadu government’s Kalaimamani Award and the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy for her contribution to devotional music. In fact, she and her son both received their Kalaimamani awards together on the same stage in 2010. In December 2020, Kalyani had recorded for a yet-to-be-released Malayalam film song. The singer is survived by her sons Rajiv and Karunakar Menon. The last rites and cremation would take place in the city’s Besant Nagar on Tuesday afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/singer-kalyani-menon-dies-at-80/articleshow/84995903.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No ground for default bail to Sudha Bharadwaj, says NIA||MUMBAI: Opposing the default bail plea by 2018 Elgar Parishad case accused Sudha Bharadwaj, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday supported the contention of the state government that the special NIA Act comes into play only when the agency takes over probe. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the NIA said the agency took over probe into the Pune case from the ATS in January 2020, and hence the order of the Pune sessions court in granting extension of custody for filing of chargesheet was “valid”. This is also because the case is at a “pre trial” stage, and under the provisions of the Act, a special trial court would be exclusively required during trial. “Till the matter is transferred to the special court, the sessions court retains jurisdiction conferred in the Act on the special court,” was his submission. Bharadwaj had petitioned the HC to seek for default bail on the ground that the judge was not designated a special judge under the NIA as was necessary since the special anti-terror law was invoked against her and other co-accused, at the relevant time. Her counsel Yug Chaudhry will continue with his rebuttal on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-ground-for-default-bail-to-bharadwaj-says-nia/articleshow/84987917.cms||Swati Deshpande

Under the scheme, the kids and adults would be provided with a monthly allowance, free education, ration and guardianship of their property till they attain the age of 21. TOI sources in the department disclosed that the state has identified 2,347 beneficiaries of the scheme, out of which 1,062 children have been receiving Rs 3,000 in the first phase, starting July 2021. "This is probably one such scheme where we would not want the number of beneficiaries to increase. As a responsible government, we would try to give out best possible emotional, academic, social and financial support to these children," Dhami said, adding Uttarakhand is the first state to introduce this scheme for the adults too. Apart from taking care of their education, Dhami said the state government would also reserve 5% of government jobs for them under the scheme. Data accessed by TOI show that as of August 1, out of the 2,347 beneficiaries, 1,557 lost their loved ones to Covid-19, while 790 lost their family members to other ailments. Out of the 1,557 beneficiaries, 66 children lost both of their parents to Covid-19, whereas 1,489 lost an earning member of the family in the past 16 months. Also, out of the 790 children who lost their loved ones to other illnesses, 83 kids lost both of their parents, while 707 children lost an earning member of the family. The district administrations of all the 13 districts have been alerted to keep the children who lost family members to other illnesses on high priority. "We would extend this support to all the girls and boys of Uttarakhand who will lose their parents to any kind of illness up to March 2022. This is the least that we can do for these young children in their distressful times," said Rekha Arya, Uttarakhand’s minister of women and child welfare department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-dhami-launches-scheme-to-support-kids-who-lost-parents-to-covid-19-other-illnesses/articleshow/84985813.cms||Shivani Azad

While the new evaluation system has favoured some students, for others, the results have been disappointing as their scores were below their expectations. Though a supplementary exam to improve their scores is allowed, a majority are unwilling to take it up.For CBSE students, performance in Class XII, X and IX were considered as components. “A section of CBSE toppers were disappointed as they felt that they could have scored better if they had written the board exams. The problem is that their scores would be compared directly with state board students though the evaluation for CBSE is different,” said Sujatha Guptan, director of academics, Queen Mira School.K Seethalakshmi, a CBSE Class XII student said that with CBSE students were unable to get many centums, it greatly affects cutoffs for toppers. “Competition for seats is tough nowadays. Though we have been given a chance to sit a supplementary exam, why would we go for it?,” she said.At the same time, for state board students, 50% weightage was given to scores in Class X and 20% to Class XI scores. “This time, state board students have better chances of getting engineering seats as many have scored high marks due to their performance in Class X. The evaluation for state board was fair for students as Class X board exam is a standardized exam and Class XI scores have been given only 20% weightage,” said Jayendran Mani, correspondent, Sri Jayendra Group of Educational Institutions. State board Class XII student V Sri Deiva Prasanna said that most students are happy with their marks. “However, the Class XI component disappointed us a little since we don’t pay as much attention to it compared to Class X or XII,” the student added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/evaluation-criteria-gives-edge-to-state-board-students/articleshow/84989966.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

With students from state board and CBSE rushing in, a tough competition is expected for seats as colleges prepare to release the first merit lists this week and begin counselling.“Already, we have a 10% increase in the number of applications received. We received more than 32,000 applications this year, whereas last year we received around 30,000 applications. Especially for the commerce course alone, we got more than 3,800 applications. We are looking to release the first rank list by Thursday,” said Dr Davamani M Christober, principal,The American College. In some of the other city colleges as well, despite a slight dip in number of applications compared to last year so far, colleges are expecting more applicants in the coming days. This time, the application process is only online across all arts and science colleges.“We have received 21,000 applications so far since we opened applications on July 16. This is a bit less as last year we received more than 31,000 applications. However, we are still expecting more applications since CBSE results are still pending for some schools. Further, as per usual, the demand for regular courses is high in our institution,” said Dr D Pandiaraja, principal, Thiagarajar College of Arts and Science. Commerce, computer science, Maths and Physics were among the much sought after courses at the college.At Lady Doak College also, there was a slight dip in applications compared to the last year but it is still on the higher side. “Last year, we received around 12,000-13,000 applications but this time we received around 8,000 applications so far. But, the number is still big as we have only 1,200 seats for first years. Further, more students may apply in the next few days. We have also been trying to minimize duplication of applications among students who are applying this academic year,” said Dr Christianna Singh, principal of the college. She added that the online counselling based on the first merit list is set to start from Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tough-competition-for-college-seats-in-madurai-1st-merit-list-this-week/articleshow/84989943.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma said the cabinet’s decision or government’s order is not under challenge as the petition was filed on July 29 but the government order was released on July 31. The bench has now given the petitioner two days to attach the government order in the petition. The PIL argued that the state government’s decision to reopen schools is "ill-thought" as many of them had been turned into quarantine centres. Also, there are no vaccines available for children at the moment, the petition added. The plea also cited Covid case projections by scientists, according to which children will be the most affected by the third wave of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/plea-in-hc-against-reopening-schools/articleshow/84983340.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Dehradun||Schools reopen with strict Covid norms after 7 months||DEHRADUN: Schools for Classes IX to XII reopened in Uttarakhand on Monday after a gap of more than seven months in the wake of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. On day one, almost all government schools were reopened, however, most of the private schools remained closed, anticipating a low turnout. According to the state government guidelines, the schools ran classes from 9 am to 1 pm. All the students were thermally scanned before being given entry to schools. Besides, the morning assembly routine was cancelled to avoid a gathering of students. A TOI spot visit to several government schools in the Dehradun district revealed that Covid-19 norms like mandatory wearing of masks, sanitisation, and social distancing were strictly followed. Mukul Kumar Sati, chief education officer, Dehradun, told TOI that the government schools in the district recorded a student turnout of 20%. “I inspected several government schools on the first day of reopening. The teachers conducted offline classes and also recorded the session which was sent to the students who were not present. We have asked the schools to keep a tripod to record the offline classes in a better manner. The teachers are also conducting online classes in the evening,” said Sati. Meanwhile, children looked happy as they returned to their respective schools after a long break. “I was getting bored at home and was eager to attend physical classes. Even though many of my classmates are yet to come back, I was happy to come to back school,” said Ankita Tiwari, a Class X student from Government Intermediate College, Kishanpur. The state government, in its order concerning the reopening of schools, has prohibited extra-curricular activities to prevent the possibility of the transmission of the virus. The order adds that schools with strong student strength should function in two shifts. The state government order also mandates all students to submit written permission from parents/guardians within three days of joining the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/schools-reopen-with-strict-covid-norms-after-7-months/articleshow/84983348.cms||Mohammad Anab

This year all the Class X and XII board examinations were cancelled and different formulas were adopted to evaluate students. Out of the eight lakh twenty-odd students, around 18,000 were held back by the West Bengal Council of Higher Education. Even the number of those scoring between 90% and above also dipped by almost two-thirds this year.  “The students have been awarded pass marks on humanitarian grounds after reviewing their marks,” said Mahua Das, WBCHE president. On Monday, she announced that the pass percentage in HS this year is now 100 percent. “There might be a handful of students who didn’t fill up the form properly or didn’t take the tests and practicals who might have been held back. But apart from that almost 100 percent students have passed,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-order-takes-hs-success-rate-to-100/articleshow/84987915.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Chennai||Finish sexual harassment trial against DGP by December, says Tamil Nadu court||CHENNAI: At least six IPS officers, ranging from superintendents of police to a director-general of police-rank officer, are in trouble, as a sexual harassment case initiated by a woman IPS officer against the DGP has reached the trial stage. While the DGP and an SP are facing criminal proceedings, four other SP-rank officers are to face departmental proceedings, for having attempted to dissuade the victim-woman IPS officer from pursuing the case against the DGP (Names of all offending officers have been withheld in deference to a Madras HC ruling to that effect). On Monday, Justice N Anand Venkatesh directed a Villupuram trial court hearing the sexual harassment case to complete the trial on or before December 20.  The direction came after the state government informed the court that sanction had been granted to initiate prosecution against the DGP for sexually harassing the woman officer and an SP for trying to stop her from making a complaint against the DGP. The chargesheet was filed before the Villupuram chief judicial magistrate court on July 29. This apart, the DGP (CB-CID) has recommended to the home secretary to initiate departmental action against the two accused and four other IPS officers for trying to persuade the victim against filing the complaint. “The effectiveness of the criminal justice system largely depends upon the completion of the proceedings at the earliest and a certainty of either punishment or acquittal, as the case may be, of the accused persons,” Justice N Anand Venkatesh said. The court took suo motu note of reports of alleged sexual harassment faced by the woman IPS officer at the hands of a special DGP, and ruled that it would monitor the investigation. On Monday, the investigating officer, who was also present during the virtual hearing, informed the court that no substantial material was available to implicate any other officer in the offence. Recording the submissions, the court expressed its appreciation for the investigating officer for completing the investigation and filing the final report amidst the pandemic. Earlier, when the plea came up for hearing, the CB-CID and the state filed separate status reports informing the court that they had examined 122 witnesses and collected 72 documents before filing the final report. The final report has been filed against the special DGP for offences under Sections 354 (use of criminal force against woman), 354A(2) (sexual harassment), 341 (wrongful restraint), 506(1) (criminal intimidation) read with 109 (abetment) IPC and Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Woman Act, 1998, they said. The SP was charged for offences punishable under Sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 506(1) (criminal intimidation) of IPC, the CB-CID said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/finish-sexual-harassment-trial-against-dgp-by-dec/articleshow/84987933.cms||---
---||Goa||Aguada jail not for weddings: Goa minister||CALANGUTE: Ports minister Michael Lobo has said that he will oppose attempts to turn the renovated Fort Aguada jail complex into an ‘entertainment zone’. Talking to media, he said that he has learnt of some proposals to give the former central jail premises to private entities who want to convert it into a ‘wedding’ venue. “It’s a historic place. I will not allow its commercialisation. It should not be given to some hotel. I’m against anybody trying to open an entertainment zone in the jail,” he said. Lobo pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed an interest in inaugurating the Aguada jail which has been renovated at a cost of Rs 25 crore through the central government’s ‘Swadesh Darshan’ scheme. “It was late chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s idea to have a museum at the jail dedicated to the freedom struggle and he had initiated the process for renovating the jail for that. Aguada jail is a historic monument. A lot of freedom fighters had been jailed there during Portuguese colonial rule,” he said. “Even freedom fighters from British India were brought and jailed there because of a treaty with the Portuguese. A lot of Goans who were fighting for freedom from Portuguese rule had also been jailed here,” said Lobo, who is also the Calangute MLA. He said the jail premises were renovated with a plan to turn it into a museum dedicated to the freedom movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aguada-jail-not-for-weddings-lobo/articleshow/84988004.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Rock & ice avalanche, not glacial lake outburst, caused U'khand flood, confirms NDMA||Dehradun: The Chamoli disaster, in which a flash flood claimed over 200 lives on February 7, was caused by a rock and ice avalanche and not a glacial lake outburst as was initially believed, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has confirmed. “No geomorphological evidence of glacial lake outburst flood or sub-glacial lake flood were found,” the interim report, submitted to the Uttarakhand government in June, said. “The event started as (a) glacier ice and rock avalanche.” The NDMA will share a detailed report with the government later. TOI had earlier reported that an international team of scientists and an intergovernmental body had both concluded the same. The joint study team — with experts from NDMA, Border Roads Organisation, Geological Survey of India, India Meteorological Department, Central Water Commission, IIT-Roorkee and Kashmir University, among others — visited affected areas between March 26 and 31. On the basis of field visits, helicopter recces and analysis of remote sensing data, it reconstructed how a series of events in the course of an hour caused devastation in Chamoli on February 7. It concluded that around 10.08am that day, the rock avalanche came hurtling down the Raunthi peak, melting ice and forming clouds of dust. This “large mass” of rock and glacier was about 29 million cubic metre in volume. The “triggering factor” was snow melt water which had accumulated within joints, got frozen and then thawed, opening up fissures. “Observed increase in precipitation and land surface temperature since 2008, which peaked in 2016, may also have contributed to increase in snow/ice melt,” the report added. From the place where the mass crashed, after travelling about 2.9km, debris started flowing at 10.6 m per second (over 38 km per hour). This created an unstable landslide dam near the crash site. In about 10 minutes, an artificial lake was formed by the debris, blocking the Rishiganga river. Soon, the water started overflowing. As the rock avalanche continued — it would for 50 minutes — the debris flow reached the Tapovan-Vishnugad barrage around 10.36am and the Vishnugad-Pipalkoti barrage at 11.19am. “The huge volume of slush flow passing through the Raunthi Valley, Rishiganga and Dhauliganga rivers with a shooting velocity resulted in complete devastation of the Rishiganga power plant and caused loss of human lives,” Piyush Rautela, geologist and executive director of the Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre, said. So far, 204 are believed dead, of whom bodies of only 77 have been found. There was more to the impact — the river bed rose by 2-12m in affected areas, the approach road and BRO bridge at Raini village, and five other suspension bridges were washed away, and service roads on either side of the Dhauliganga were damaged. “Local people have also flagged the concern over blasting, environmental degradation, illegal mining and non-compliance of environmental regulations,” the report said. The NDMA recommended that locals be engaged in maintaining a vigil, a plan be in place to evacuate construction workers and that states “ensure strict adherence to safety guidelines during dam construction phase”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rock-ice-avalanche-not-glacial-lake-outburst-caused-ukhand-flood-confirms-ndma/articleshow/84983376.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Kochi||Father of IS widow Sonia Sebastian seeks her extradition from Afghanistan||NEW DELHI: V J Sebastian Francis of Kasaragod has moved the Supreme Court seeking extradition of his daughter, along with his grandchild, who was detained in Afghanistan after she left India to join terrorist organization, IS. He apprehends that after the exit of the US forces from Afghan soil, foreign terrorist fighters could be hanged. The plea said necessary action should be taken by authorities concerned to extradite his daughter Sonia Sebastian alias Ayisha and his seven-year-old granddaughter. The plea said: “Internationally a lenient approach has been taken against the women foreign terrorist fighters like 1st detainee (Ayisha), this is owing to the stand taken by the countries that women only played ancillary roles and therefore could not pose any significant threat to national security.” The plea said the issue is urgent as much substantial political and administrative changes are likely in Afghanistan with the exit of the US troops. The plea contended that the Centre not facilitating extradition of the detainees is illegal and unconstitutional and violates fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. Stringent anti-terror law UAPA was registered against Ayisha, after she left India and the Interpol had also issued a Red Corner notice against her in March 2017. The plea said after reaching Afghanistan, Ayisha’s husband was killed in the war. “The 1st and the 2nd detainee who accompanied A1 (the husband) and was actively not involved in the fight there after his death had to surrender to the Afghan forces on November 15, 2019, along with some other women...” The petitioner claimed that his daughter repents the decision to join the IS and she wanted to return to India and face fair trial here. Ayisha had made this statement during an interview with Stratnews Global, which was uploaded as a documentary titled ‘Khorasan Files: The journey of Indian Islamic State Widows’ on YouTube on March 15, 2020. The mother of another IS recruit, Nimisha Fathima, had earlier approached the Kerala HC seeking her repatriation from Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/father-of-is-widow-seeks-her-extradition-from-af/articleshow/84987965.cms||---

The improvement ranged from zero areas with good air quality in January-March 2020 to 30 areas having good air quality in April- June 2021. A total of 91 locations were tested for air quality ranging from good, satisfactory, moderate, poor, very poor and severe within the city. Interestingly, this also hints at how the human mobility has resulted in newer Covid-19 strains say experts. “Human mobility from October 2020 to March 2021 is highest in Hyderabad since the beginning of pandemic,” said Dr Kiran Madala, incharge head of department of critical care at Nizamabad Medical College. Track the pollution level in your city“This trend is almost same in most cities of India. High mobility between October 2020 to March 2021 in India responsible for the birth of Delta variant in India. We should not repeat this at any cost to prevent future waves.” Meanwhile, even as an overall improvement was seen in air quality, the sharpest improvement was seen during the lockdown and also an immediate decline was seen in the quarter following the lockdown period.  While the national lockdown was imposed in March 2020, Hyderabad had no areas having good air quality (0-50 air quality index value), 63 areas fell within the satisfactory range (51-100) and 28 areas fell in the moderate range (101-200). During April to June 2020 this improved to 27 areas reporting good quality, 58 satisfactory and six moderate, which further improved in July-September (period of gradual lifting of lockdown) to 81 good quality areas, 11 satisfactory and zero with moderate air quality. Cut to the latest quarter, and the number of areas having good air quality have gone down from 81 to 30 now and 18 areas are now in the moderate category. This information was revealed in a reply given by minister of state for ministry of environment, forest and climate change, Ashwini Kumar Choubey in Rajya Sabha. “In the year 2020, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) carried out assessment of impact of nationwide lockdown on air quality in various metropolitan cities, and water quality at major river stretches of the country. It has been reported that Covid-19 related lockdown resulted in temporary improvement of air and water quality in many cities and rivers due to closure of industries, reduction in number of vehicles plying, lack of construction activities and absence of human activities such as throwing of garbage, bathing, and washing of clothes,” read the reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/air-quality-saw-marked-improvement-in-city-during-lockdown/articleshow/84989997.cms||Amrita Didyala

Invitation should be sent to stakeholders so that they can attend the meetings for grievance redressal. Grievances received from people should be registered as resolutions and they should be kept for public view. Copies of the resolutions should be given to people. To ensure participation of the minimum number of gram sabha members to pass resolutions tabled during the meetings, people should be sensitised. Arrangements should be made to videograph the meetings. People should be allowed to take videos and photos,” he said.Kamal later went around the city, inaugurating party offices and hoisting MNM flags. He met party functionaries and also distributed Covid relief.The MNM chief had unsuccessfully contested from the Coimbatore south constituency in the assembly poll in April.

Local politicians complained that the flyover was opened in a hurry. “We are restricting heavy vehicles on the GMLR flyover for now as there is a fear of electrocution if they come in contact with the high-tension wire,” said a BMC official, adding that it may take up to two months to complete the work. TimesViewThe government seemed to be in a hurry to inaugurate the Rs 580-crore flyover. It is perplexing why the BMC, which built the flyover, did not shift the high-tension wire in advance. If heavy vehicles are not allowed on it, the congestion on the road below will worsen. The BMC must immediately order the contractor to complete this work as soon as possible.But BJP MP Manoj Kotak said that the BMC should have ensured this was done before the inauguration. “The flyover was built to ease heavy vehicle traffic movement, which will now continue to clog the road below it,” he said. “Besides nowhere on the structure has the BMC mentioned the name as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj flyover despite a proposal in this regard being cleared in the civic works committee meeting.” He added that while he is aware that the name is yet to be approved by the BMC’s general body, it could have been done on Friday or Saturday. The flyover is expected to bring relief to traffic on Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road, which is used by motorists heading towards Navi Mumbai, Lonavala and further to Pune. All vehicles coming from Eastern Express Highway and Santacruz-Chembur Link Road can use the GMLR flyover, which is also expected to ease heavy vehicle traffic since the bridge is a crucial connector to highways leading towards the Konkan and Bengaluru. Former Govandi corporator and now MLA Rais Shaikh of Samajwadi Party (SP) said: “For most part of Monday, only the Vashi-bound carriageway was open for traffic as the stage set up for the inauguration was yet to be removed.” Both carriageways were fully operational after 4pm. Govandi corporator Rukhsana Siddique of SP pointed out that the foot over-bridge works under GMLR flyover are still incomplete, which could be risky as heavy vehicles are still moving on the road below. But locals have welcomed the GMLR flyover. Rajrajeshwari Nagarajan, who lives near the flyover, said: “Even if it has been opened for only light motor vehicles, it will help reduce the traffic load on the stretch. The area will get further decongested after heavy vehicles are also allowed to ply on it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/heavy-vehicles-told-to-stay-off-newly-opened-gmlr-flyover-in-mumbai/articleshow/84991661.cms||Richa Pinto

The national transporter has surpassed its earlier best performance records in freight loading for consecutive 11 months since September. The railways said it has achieved the highest ever incremental freight loading of 112.7 million tonnes (MT), which is 17.5 MT more than what it achieved in July 2020, an increase of 18.4%. The railways has set FY20 as the parameter to assess its performance, considering that the first two quarters of FY21 were hit due to Covid. The ministry has set a target of 1,407 MTs for freight loadingduring the current fiscal. Sources said the new railway minister is likely to revise the target and a slew of measures will be rolled out in the next two months to get more freight on rail. A spokesperson at the ministry said the increase in freight loading in July was due to growth in the loading of coal (23.5%), cement (26.7%), iron ore (14%) and foodgrain (7.9%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/railways-sees-highest-freight-loading-ever/articleshow/84992732.cms||---

And in the process add to its sustainable portfolio. IIT Madras Research Park, designed on the models of Bay Area is a confluence of industry and academia. The facility, which consumes 25MWH to 40MWH of power, was set up nearly 10 years ago across 1.2 million square feet and is fully fired by grid power, almost entirely from coal power plants. Each unit costs Rs11/KWH at commercial tariff rates including demand charges, and it rises when there is power shortage when diesel generators supplement power supply. "We are working on a model to become fully renewable. We will then showcase it to other 40,000 commercial buildings in the country to make the shift. Nothing will happen in India if an idea is not economically viable, we will show the economic viability," said professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala, president of IIT Madras Research Park. "For this, we are looking at very small nuclear power plants, hydrogen storage, ocean waves to supplement solar and wind power that we plan to set up," he said. "If we don’t do something now, as a nation, we can get into trouble on greenhouse gas emissions." The formula is simple: The rooftop of the facility will supply roughly 10% to 15% of energy needs, costing just Rs3 per KWH. Next, use third party captive wind and solar power plants and wheel (generate it elsewhere and consume it at another place) for use at the facility. This will make 90% of the supply from wind and sun. Help for battery storage types for generated power will be taken from the Center for Battery Engineering for Electric Vehicles (a special research centre in IIT Madras for R&D on e-vehicles). Large capacity chilled water storage will be created which will be used for airconditioning. "Nearly 40% of all power is consumed by HVAC (air conditioners) and chilled water is 90% efficient and cheaper than battery storage," said Anson Sando, manager, energy programmes at the IIT Madras Research Park. The entire project will be completed in two years. Discussions have begun with the Department of Atomic Energy in Kalpakkam on the nuclear power plant. Research work is also underway for hydrogen and biomass usage to supplement solar and wind parks. Once the plan is executed, the energy cost will drop to Rs8 a KWH from the present Rs11 per KWH, making the facility a model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/how-iit-m-research-park-plans-to-move-away-from-grid-power/articleshow/84987956.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

Justice Kanade’s swearing will take place on Wednesday. As Maharashtra was without a full-time Lokayukta for alm-ost a year, RTI activist Anil Galgali wrote to Koshyari last week urging him to direct the state government to appoint one. The previous Lokayukta, (retd) Justice M L Tahaliyani had completed his tenure in August 2020. “The Lokayukta acts like a watchdog and plays a key role in fighting against corruption and bringing transparency. It’s been almost a year since there is no Lokayukta and this shows that the government is not keen on encouraging transparency. The Lokayukta post is important to keep a check on the government and has become a recourse for the common man between 2015 and 2020,” Galgali had said. The Lokayukta is an anti-corruption ombudsman. Citizens can make complaints of corruption against any government official or elected representative directly to the Lokayukta, who is tasked with speedy redressal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-retd-justice-kanade-appointed-lokayukta/articleshow/84988029.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Wiping out its Minto Bridge shame, PWD turns to six waterlogging spots||NEW DELHI: After sensors, alarm systems and additional drains turned the notorious Minto Bridge this season into an example of success in dealing with waterlogging, the Public Works Department has initiated short-term and long-term action plans for six other similarly affected locations at Pul Prahladpur, Ring Road at Indraprastha Estate, Zakhira underpass, Loni Road, Jahangirpuri Delhi Metro station road near Azadpur and the Karala-Kanjhawala road. Currently, these sites are being monitored 24x7 through live feed and three divers plus life belts have been placed at some for emergencies. A PWD official confirmed that a study of these locations had been carried out to determine a permanent solution, though short-term measures have been employed, including boosting the pumping capacity, live CCTV footage, alarm system and round-the-clock monitoring. Dilraj Kaur, PWD secretary, said, “After ensuring that Minto Bridge wasn’t flooded like it has been every rainy season for 50 years due to the area’s topography, we will replicate similar interventions at six major critical spots. We will address the fundamental problems through long-term interventions.” At the perpetually inundated Pul Prahladpur underpass, for instance, the pumping capacity has been doubled from 450HP to 900HP. “This bowl-shaped underpass receives the runoff from the unauthorised colonies located in a 5-km radius. An additional sump well and new drains will be developed to permanently solve the problem here. Three side retention walls were built 10 days ago to channel the water during light-moderate rains,” official claimed. At Indraprastha Estate, opposite the WHO office, PWD has deployed four tractor-mounted pumps and five diesel pumps for temporary relief. A sump well with a capacity of 1.5 lakh litres and pumps with adequate discharge capacity will be constructed before the 2022 monsoon, according to the action plan. The space under the Zakhira flyover in west Delhi with its twin problems of heavy runoff from railway tracks and garbage from the neighbouring JJ colony also figures on the list of locations to be tackled. The PWD official revealed that the permanent solution will require the removal of the slum cluster and the rerouting and construction of stormwater drains from Anand Parbat industrial area upto the railway track. “Work here will require the involvement of Northern Railway and North Delhi Municipal Corporation,” the official said. A new pipeline is to be laid at the Loni Road roundabout and the drain system remodelled while providing a sump well on Karala-Kanjhawala road. Officials blamed July’s record rainfall for the frequent waterlogging this year. “Delhi's drainage system is built to cater to 50mm of rain, but July alone recorded two-thirds of the normal annual rainfall. There were complaints of waterlogging, but we resolved most of them in less than an hour,” the official stated. The PWD control room data said of the complaints, 308 were addressed in less than half an hour, 135 in 30 minutes to an hour, 118 in 1-2 hours and 192 took more than two hours. An official also explained that when the Yamuna’s level rises to above 205 metres, as was the case last weekend, the gates of the larger drains are closed to prevent backflow and this can increase the time taken by the PWD drains connected with the river to drain away the rainwater.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wiping-out-its-minto-bridge-shame-pwd-turns-to-six-waterlogging-spots/articleshow/84988048.cms||Paras Singh

CPM sources said Porathissery South local committee has removed KK Sujesh Kannatt from the primary membership of the party. Sujesh, formerly a branch secretary of CPM, had first raised different dimensions of the bank fraud, initially with local party leaders. Later, he filed complaints before the chief minister and prime minister on the fraud. Sujesh had also launched a ‘one-man agitation’ in front of the bank against the fraud. CPM had earlier expelled TR Sunilkumar who was the secretary of the bank, MK Biju (the manager) and CK Jilse (the accountant) from the party. They are facing charges that they were directly involved in the fraud. The party took action against the bank president and directors and some leaders of the Irinjalakuda area committee. Meanwhile, the district Congress committee launched a dharna in front of the collectorate to protest against the alleged delay in arresting the accused in the bank fraud case. DCC president MP Vincent alleged that the arrest of the accused was being delayed to hide the involvement of CPM leaders. DCC vice-president Joseph Tajet, who presided over the programme, said Congress will continue its agitation until the probe team arrests the accused. At the same time, CB team probing the case recovered several incriminating documents from the bank. Sources in the probe team said the documents indicate numerous violations like sanctioning of multiple loans based on one collateral security. The anticipatory bail applications filed by four of the six accused are likely to come up for hearing on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-expels-party-leader-who-exposed-fraud/articleshow/84988056.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Delhi||Capping of salary hike for Delhi MLAs irks AAP govt||NEW DELHI: The Delhi cabinet is likely to take up a proposal to hike the salary and allowances of the members of the Delhi assembly on Tuesday. Delhi government sources said the Union ministry of home affairs has restricted the proposed increase in salary of MLAs to Rs 30,000 and allowances to Rs 60,000, adding up to Rs 90,000 per month. The Delhi MLAs are currently getting only Rs 54,000 per month (salary Rs 12,000 and allowances Rs 42,000). According to the sources, the Delhi government had proposed Rs 2.10 lakh for the MLAs per month, including salary and other allowances. However, with the home ministry not agreeing to this, Delhi MLAs will continue to receive a very meagre salary compared to their counterparts in other states. Delhi has a high cost of living. “The MLAs of states ruled by BJP and Congress earn around one-and-a-half to double of what the Delhi MLAs earn,” said the sources, claiming that the proposal for a hike was pending with the MHA for the past five years. They said the salary (besides allowances) of Delhi’s MLAs has not increased in the past 10 years. It had been hiked to Rs 54,000 in November 2011 and has not been revised since then though inflation has increased dramatically. This had prompted the Aam Aadmi Party government to start the process of salary revision. It proposed a salary hike and a bill was passed in the Delhi assembly in December 2015 seeking Rs 2.10 lakh as salary and allowances for the MLAs. The LG returned the file to the government because it did not have the LG’s required prior approval. The government then moved a fresh proposal, seeking the LG's approval for a salary hike. The LG forwarded the proposal to the MHA which has responded by capping the total amount at Rs 90,000, according to these sources. An official said that the salary hike proposal has to go through a long route. “If the proposal gets the cabinet’s approval, it will be sent to the LG. It will need the approval of the LG before it is presented in the assembly as a financial bill. The salary hike will be implemented only after the assembly passes the financial bill and the LG approves it,” said a source. A comparison with other states shows how poorly paid the Delhi MLAs are. Those in Uttarakhand get Rs 2.04 lakh; in Telangana Rs 2.5 lakh; in Karnataka Rs 1.65 lakh; in Andhra Pradesh Rs 1.75 lakh; in Goa Rs 1.99 lakh and in Bihar Rs 1.35 lakh. The salary and allowances of the MLAs of Delhi have been capped by the MHA at Rs 90,000 per month (salary Rs 30,000; constituency allowance Rs 25,000; secretarial allowance Rs 15,000; telephone allowance Rs 10,000; and conveyance allowance Rs 10,000). Many states provide many other perks and allowances to their MLAs, which the Delhi government doesn’t provide. These are for house rent, office rent, staff expenses, office equipment, vehicle and driver etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/capping-of-salary-hike-fordelhi-mlas-irks-aap-govt/articleshow/84988033.cms||AlokKNMishra

Bharatiya Kamgar Sena (BKS) secretary Sanjay Kadam said the party had fought to name the airport after Shivaji Maharaj. “We will not object if it states Chhatrapati Shivaji airport is operated by Adani, instead of the board stating Adani Airport,” he said. Sena MP and BKS president Arvind Sawant said, “It was a spontaneous reaction. Boards with Adani Airport written on them are an insult to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Marathi manoos.” NCP’s minister for minority affairs Nawab Malik said the Adani group should not hurt the sentiments of people. “Though the Adani group has bought the shares and ownership of the airport from GVK, it does not mean they have a right to change the name of the airport,” he said. In a statement, Adani Airports Holding Ltd (AAHL) said, “In light of the incidents over Adani Airports branding at the Mumbai International Airport, we firmly assure that Adani Airports Holding Ltd (AAHL) has merely replaced the previous branding with Adani Airports and that no change has been made to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport’s branding or positioning at the terminal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/adani-airport-signage-damaged-by-sena-workers-in-mumbai/articleshow/84991663.cms||---
---||Chennai||This local body election in Tamil Nadu, PMK could be at a crossroads||Local body elections for rural posts are here, but the election in just nine districts may appear insignificant politically for a state like Tamil Nadu, especially when it comes within a few months after the assembly election that saw the DMK bag a decisive victory. One reason for considering the upcoming local body polls relatively inconsequential is because about 60% of the posts that are up for elections are not party-based. Party symbols are not allotted, and candidates do not contest as party representatives. The other reason is that historically people tend to vote in favour of the ruling party candidates for the remaining 40% of the posts. But simmering tension and palpable strains between allies have raised the question of whether there could be some political realignment. While the AIADMK and BJP leaders have affirmed that their alliance would continue, there are undercurrents between the AIADMK and ally PMK. PMK president G K Mani met chief minister M K Stalin recently to thank him for issuing a government order for implementing the 10% vanniyar reservation. PMK founder S Ramadoss on his part telephoned Stalin to thank him for the move. On Monday, while the AIADMK boycotted the centenary celebrations of the Tamil Nadu legislature and unveiling of the portrait of former chief minister M Karunanidhi, presided over President Ram Nath Kovind, its allies the BJP, the PMK and the TMC took part. For the PMK, it seems pragmatic to lean towards the ruling DMK, which is on a victory run, and strengthen its presence in the northern districts. The local body elections could be a litmus test for the PMK to prove it was indeed a strong player in northern Tamil Nadu. In the assembly election, the PMK suffered a drubbing in the northern districts where the party was traditionally considered to have a strong base. PMK leaders insist that the party was a constituent of the AIADMK alliance and that the question of shifting alliance does not arise. "Our leaders will take a call on alliances during the time of the local body election," said party leader K Balu. On the other hand, the DMK wants to prove its upper hand once again, after tasting victory in 43 of the 53 assembly segments in the eight northern districts. Despite the success, the DMK continues to woo vanniyars by issuing the government order on 10.5% quota, in an apparent bid to consolidate its presence in northern Tamil Nadu. Moreover, a substantial victory in the upcoming civic polls could also be an endorsement of sorts of its governance so far. But the reaching out to vanniyars may not convert itself into an alliance with the PMK, say DMK leaders. "We won 50% of the seats in the rural body elections held in 2019 when we were an opposition party. The people of these districts backed us in the assembly polls. Ever since we formed the government our popularity has grown. Now we will sweep 100% of the seats in the nine districts," said DMK spokesman Constantine Ravindran. He said, strategically, there was no need for an alliance with the PMK or the DMDK in the upcoming rural local body elections. "I don’t think there will be any political realignment in this local body elections," he said. But for the gestures of the PMK towards the DMK, sparking speculation that it might gravitate towards the ruling party, other major players have ruled out a shift in political alliances. The AIADMK is also keen to retain the PMK for the fact that the party helped its candidates win Salem, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri.  "As of now, PMK is with us. Neither have they stated otherwise, nor have we said that alliances are going to change. With regard to the elections, we are prepared to face the ballot box," said former minister D Jayakumar. Political analyst Tharasu Shyam said PMK might come handy for DMK in Salem, Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts in further elections rather than in northern districts in the upcoming local body polls. “The DMK has proved its mettle in the northern districts. Besides, the ruling party will have an advantage in the local body polls. But if at all there are any realignments, it could only be for future elections and the local body elections could be a precursor for it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/this-local-body-election-in-tn-pmk-could-be-at-a-crossroads/articleshow/84988024.cms||Mayilvaganan
---||Chandigarh||Punjab to open more areas for industrial activity||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday gave approval for Change of Land Use (CLU) for certain categories of industries to further boost industrial activity in the state.  The CLU will be applicable to green and orange industries at a distance of 100 metres and 250 metres, respectively, from ‘lal lakir’ or nearby ‘abadi’ (minimum 50 pucca houses) on minimum 6 ‘karam’ (30-33 feet) approach road, under the policy of permitting industrial activity in agricultural zone of master plans. The chief minister also asked the town and country planning department to review the red category industry, directing it to earmark separate zones for such industry in all the master plans. He accorded special permission for expansion of medical oxygen manufacturing plant in Mohali and also asked the department to extend liberal support to all such plants in the state to boost manufacturing of medical oxygen. Chairing the 42nd meeting of the Punjab Regional and Town Planning and Development Board through video conferencing, the chief minister, who is also its chairman, said all green, red and orange industrial units must conform to the prescribed norms of Punjab Pollution Control Board with zero discharge, or must have consent of potential users for use of treated water. Amarinder also gave his nod to allow industries in mixed land use zones along highways at a distance of 4 kms from corporation limits of Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar, 3 kms from other corporation towns and Class-A towns and 2 kms from other towns. The decision would go a long way in providing maximum area across the state to promote industrial activity. The chief minister also okayed the board’s proposal for industrial parks in sectors 101 and 103 to be developed by both private developers as well as Gmada in SAS Nagar (Mohali) to ensure holistic development of these sectors, with focus on futuristic planning. He permitted the board to allow residential colonies in 50 acres in New Chandigarh, thereby reducing the minimum area requirement from 100 to 50 acres without disturbing the density norms. This amendment would be instrumental in ensuring proper utilisation of left out pockets to provide housing facilities in the upcoming New Chandigarh. Sources said the chief minister also discussed the proposal for the campus of a private university in Mohali. However, the meeting created quite a buzz in the political circles, especially among the Congress leaders who have been anticipating changes in the council of ministers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-to-open-more-areas-for-industrial-activity/articleshow/84988095.cms||---

---||Goa||Conduct safety audit of Safa Masjid: Sudin to Union culture min||Ponda: Days after incessant rain brought down a wall of the historic Safa Masjid’s water tank, former deputy chief minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar has sought a safety audit of the tank as well as the entire structure of the mosque, which lies in his constituency of Madkai. In an email addressed to Union culture minister G Kishan Reddy and the secretary of the ministry of culture — the parent body of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) — Dhavalikar said the historic monument was constructed in the 16th century, and there could be an impact of the tank wall collapse as it is abutting a side of the main mosque structure. Work to repair the collapsed wall has currently been taken up by the ASI. Dhavalikar has stated that the collapse of the wall has created fear in the minds of visitors, as the structure is of national importance and tourists visit it to experience the “rich culture of historic India”. Thus, the government should take utmost care of the monument, he demanded. Soon after the wall collapse, the masjid committee had alleged that the movement of heavy vehicles from the national highway stretch in the vicinity had created cracks in the wall, which resulted in the collapse of the wall. The masjid committee also said that the mosque tank wall had developed some cracks and the ASI had filled the cracks recently. Despite this, the wall collapsed, they said. Deputy CM and minister for archaeology Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar and Ponda guardian minister Govind Gaude also visited the site and inspected the ongoing work. Kavlekar and Gaude have assured the committee that utmost care would be taken to protect the wall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/conduct-safety-audit-of-safa-masjid-sudin-to-union-culture-min/articleshow/84988118.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi govt doesn’t owe even a single rupee to corpns, says Bharadwaj||New Delhi: Delhi government does not owe even a single rupee to the municipal corporations, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said on Monday. He claimed that the municipal corporations have to return about Rs 6,500 crore to the government.A question was raised in Delhi assembly on whether the government owes any money to the municipal corporations. “In the House, urban development minister Satyendar Jain informed everyone that the Delhi government does not have to pay even a single rupee to the corporations. Moreover, the corporations owe the Delhi government about Rs 6,500 crore. And the north corporation has to return Rs 2,407 crore to the government that they had borrowed in the form of a loan. The interest on this loan, too, has not been paid for many years,” Bharadwaj said in a press conference.The AAP MLA said that the corporations did not pay salaries of their employees for months so that they could force Delhi government to give them more money. “Every 2-3 months, the corporations use this same tactic and it has been going on for 10 years. They waste their money because of the rampant corruption in the corporations. And the only way they have to force the Delhi government into giving them money is by withholding the salaries of their employees for 3-6 months and troubling them. The employees end up giving dharnas and hartals after which the corporations ask the government for more money,” Bharadwaj stated.“The MCD has decided to give Rs 50 lakh to their own councillors while they withhold the salaries of employees.”Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Bharadwaj was misleading people with lies. “Delhi government has to pay pending dues of around Rs 13,000 crore as per the unimplemented recommendations of 3rd & 4th DFCs,” said Kapoor. He claimed that the Kejriwal government had now and then deducted interest on loans from municipal funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-doesnt-owe-even-a-single-rupee-to-corpns-says-bharadwaj/articleshow/84988052.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao slams Andhra Pradesh’s ‘dadagiri’ on Krishna water issues||HYDERABAD: Even as he charged the Centre with being ‘anti-Telangana,’ chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao trained his guns on neighbouring Andhra Pradesh for resorting to what he called its ‘dadagiri’ on Krishna water issues. He said there was a possibility of Telangana facing water (Krishna river) problems in future thanks to the Centre’s stand and AP’s alleged illegal projects. Addressing a public meeting at Halia in Nalgonda district on Monday, the CM said his government would link Godavari and Krishna rivers soon to meet the water requirements of the state, especially the catchment areas of the Krishna. The CM’s remarks came at a time when the Centre took over 107 major and medium irrigation projects on both the rivers and both Telangana and AP were involved in a bitter war over Krishna water sharing, irrigation projects and hydroelectric power generation. KCR said a survey was taken up to link Palair reservoir in Khammam district to Peddadevulapally in Nalgonda. “If this is completed, entire Nagarjuna Sagar ayacut will be irrigated,” he said. Repeating that the new Dalit Bandhu scheme is a unique programme in the country, KCR said the government was ready to spend Rs 1 lakh crore on its implementation. “Of 16 lakh Dalit families in the state, 12 lakh families will be eligible for Dalit Bandhu. The government will provide Rs 10 lakh to each family. Initially, the scheme will be implemented for 100 families in each assembly constituency this current financial year.” He said the government had set apart Rs 1,000 crore for the scheme in the budget and will sanction Rs 200 crore more. “The scheme will be extended to the entire state in the next two years,” the CM said. The CM said Telangana is on top in various fields — be it paddy production, providing 24x7 power for farm sector, per capita power consumption. “Congress leader K Jana Reddy said he would campaign for TRS in the elections if the government provides 24x7 power for agriculture sector on the floor of the assembly a few years ago. But, he did not keep his promise and contested in Nagarjuna Sagar by-elections,” KCR said. The CM visited Nagarjuna Sagar constituency to keep his promise he made during the April bypolls. Though he was supposed to visit the constituency soon after the election results, in which the ruling TRS won, the CM could not come immediately as he was infected with Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-slams-aps-dadagiri-on-krishna-water-issues/articleshow/84988090.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Chandigarh||Medical services hit in Punjab as govt doctors strike work over allowance||CHANDIGARH: Medical services were disrupted in Punjab after the government doctors abstained from their duties across the state demanding roll back of the decision of delinking non-practicing allowance (NPA) from their basic pay. Outpatient departments (OPDs) remained closed, while all the elective surgeries were postponed in all the government-run hospitals. Protest marches and dharnas were organised at all districts, sub-division hospitals and community health centres. However, emergency and Covid-related services remained unaffected. On the call of the Joint Government Doctors Coordination Committee (JGDCC), the state’s health and veterinary doctors laid siege to the district offices too. The doctors have intensified the strike after health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu had announced to resolve their issues by July 30. Brahm Mahindra, chairman of the government’s sub-committee, had also promised a solution to the issue by July 19. In a joint statement, PCMS Association president Dr Gagandeep Singh and Veterinary Association president Dr Sarabjit Singh Randhawa, said the call was given for complete closure of OPDs and not letting offices of district-level health and animal husbandry departments function. The government doctors have been protesting from June 25 against the recommendations of the sixth pay commission accepted by the Punjab government, in which apart from other allowances, the NPA being given to doctors has been reduced and also delinked from basic pay. NPA will be also not considered for pension purposes. The government wanted to destroy the public healthcare system by defunding it and then rendering it defunct, they alleged.. “It is a well thought out plan of first making the public health care system defunct and then handing it over to the corporates. Our struggle is to save the public healthcare system,” claimed PCMSA senior vice-president Dr Gagandeep Shergill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/medical-services-hit-in-punjab-as-govt-doctors-strike-work-over-allowance/articleshow/84988164.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hold full board meeting, T govt urges GRMB||Hyderabad: A day before the Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) is scheduled to hold a coordination committee meeting on Tuesday with both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on taking over the irrigation projects, the Telangana government on Monday urged GRMB chairman J Chandrashekhar Iyer to convene the meeting after conducting a full board meeting. The committee has been constituted with irrigation officials from both the states and representatives of the ministry of Jal Shakti and GRMB to discuss on various irrigation projects, staffing, forces and funds following the gazette notification issued by the Centre last month defining the jurisdictions of GRMB and KRMB. In his letter to GRMB on Monday, Telangana irrigation department engineer-in-chief C Muralidhar said the matter related to notification of jurisdiction of projects in Godavari basin. It was an issue that will have serious consequences on the states, he said and added, “It needs to be discussed in detail at a full board meeting.” “Without having an opinion and guidance of the full board meeting, it is not possible to discuss any issue and decide directly in the coordination committee meeting on the operationalisation of various clauses of the gazette,” Muralidhar said. Ministry of water resources joint secretary Sanjay Awasthi wrote a letter to the GRMB chairman on July 28 to take a pro-active step and ensure that the terms of the gazette notification were implemented in letter and spirit within the timelines prescribed by the Centre. He said a detailed plan of action should be prepared along with details and asked it to send it to the ministry. Based on the ministry’s letter, the GRMB sent a missive to Telangana a couple of days ago that the coordination committee was being convened on implementation of the gazette notification. It also asked the state government to come with details on various matters pertaining to projects in the Godavari basin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hold-full-board-meeting-t-govt-urges-grmb/articleshow/84988157.cms||Koride Mahesh

The suggestion to the state and Centre was made by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni who heard a PIL by National Association for the Blind. Its advocate, Uday Warunjikar, said visually challenged students face network issues in rural areas and stand to lose an academic year. “There are 900 special schools in Maharashtra, including 200 schools for the blind. For the blind, there is no education at all,’’ Warunjikar added. The state’s advocate, Reena Salunkhe, said online classes are held for challenged students in rural areas through online applications and home visits. “But when I visit Nagpur or Aurangabad (HC benches), I do not get a mobile network. As CJ, if I do not get a network, do you expect the rural population to get a network?” CJ Datta asked. The judges questioned why the National Council of Educational Research and Training does not think of a full-fledged education channel on Doordarshan. “Otherwise we have hundreds of channels…many of movies and other entertainment. Why not an education channel? Not only for the disabled, but also those who have suffered (during the pandemic),” said Justice Kulkarni. The judges said reliance must not be placed only on mobile network and added that television and radio are satellite operated. “Every house has a TV in rural areas,” said Justice Kulkarni. The judges said Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have their own channels and soon judicial proceedings will be live. In the order, the judges noted their suggestion that the “state and Centre together explore imparting education through Akashvani and Doordarshan and...have a dedicated channel not only for the disabled but also those without disability, particularly during the pandemic.” The state will respond on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-bats-for-dedicated-education-tv-channel-for-students-amid-pandemic/articleshow/84988238.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Hyderabad||Andhra Pradesh second highest in snakebite deaths in India||HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh logged the highest number of snakebite deaths in the country after Odisha in 2019, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. Telangana is among the states with lowest number of snakebite deaths. A total of 3,163 deaths and 1.6 lakh snakebite cases were reported in the country in 2019. According to the health ministry, 467 deaths related to snakebites were reported in AP. Odisha topped the charts with 1,872 deaths and West Bengal logged 239 deaths. AP saw a steep rise in the deaths as it reported 117 deaths in 2018 and 85 in 2017. The ministry issued directions to all the states to include anti-snake venom serum in essential drugs and states were told to procure the drugs locally for use to the needy. Avinash Viswanathan of Friends of Snakes Society said snakebite envenomation is a neglected tropical disease that claims lives of over one lakh individuals every year across the world. According to a recent research, it is estimated that 58,000 deaths occur in India each year due to snakebites. “Victims’ ignorance in dealing with snakebites and clinical mismanagement of envenomations are primary causes for morbidity and mortality,” he said. He said there is a correlation between agrarian communities and high frequency of snake encounters and bites. “As per the data of snakebite deaths between 2008 and 2014, most of snakebites and deaths were reported from East Godavari, Kurnool and erstwhile Mahbubnagar in Telangana where cultivation is taken up in a big way. The data, collected from AP Forensic Science Laboratory, also revealed that most bites were recorded between the months of June and October. Most incidents of bites occurred on legs (68%) and hands (21%). “In our region, spectacled cobra is the most common venomous species. Currently, snakebites deaths are grossly under-reported. Victims often get treated at private hospitals and the data of snakebites treated is seldom communicated to the medical and health authorities,” Avinash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ap-2nd-highest-in-snakebite-deaths-in-india/articleshow/84988203.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Scores of members of the All Bengal Amitabh Bachchan Fans’ Association commemorated the day by celebrating the day with a group of transgenders and sex workers at Sonagachhi in north Kolkata, where they distributed sanitizers and masks and organised a lunch for 300 guests. On July 26 in 1982, Bachchhan had suffered his famous near-fatal injury during the filming of ‘Coolie’ in Bengaluru when due to a mistimed jump during a fight scene with co-star Puneet Issar, he hit the corner of a table instead of landing on it. He underwent a surgery at Bengaluru’s St Philomena’s Hospital before being flown to Mumbai and was admitted to Breach Candy Hospital. With the emergency splenectomy, Bachchan fought for his life and slipped into a coma. Fans across the nation thronged to shrines offering to sacrifice limbs in exchange for their favourite hero’s recovery. Jaya Bachchan walked barefoot from Breach Candy to Siddhi Vinayak Temple to pray. However, with no sign of recovery, doctors on August 2 had allegedly injected adrenaline into Bachchan’s body when his toes moved and the megastar was “reborn”. The actor remained in hospital for many months before he resumed shooting ‘Coolie’, which released on November 14, 1983, and became an instant hit. “This is a special day for fans across the world. Like other years, we sent him a text message wishing him and also sent photographs and details of our activity. He has replied to us and has asked us to carry on the good work,” said Sanjay Patodiya, the state secretary of the association. Remembering the day and responding to thousands of wishes pouring on his social media handles, the 78-year-old actor wrote on Twitter in Hindi – “Vyatigat abhaar aur dhanyavaad de na paaunga.. aapka ashirvad aur sneh bas yun hi bana rahe.. (can’t give personal thanks, may your blessings and love be like this forever).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fans-distribute-masks-sanitizers-to-celebrate-shahenshahs-39th-rebirth/articleshow/84985983.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

SGPC president Jagir Kaur on Monday said that Sidhu had recently visited Gurdwara Sri Fatehgarh Sahib where a ‘patit’ (apostate) Congress party member violated the code of conduct by giving him siropa. “It is a violation of Sikh maryada and Navjot Sidhu should take care of it while going to gurdwaras for paying obeisance,” she said. Even the police administration had harassed the sangat (devotees) by stopping them during Sidhu’s visit, she added. Claiming that Sidhu has been repeatedly violating the maryada, she said, “Earlier, Navjot Singh Sidhu did a show of strength while paying obeisance at the Golden Temple. He should arrive at a gurdwara as a devotee, rather than as (PCC) president and forbid his party workers from doing acts that are against the gurmat (teachings of Sikh gurus).”. Kaur has also taken stern notice of the alleged insult of one of Sikh ‘kakars’ (kirpan), “by some affiliates of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS)”. “RSS has no right to insult the holy kakars of Sikhs and commit acts to provoke their (Sikh) sentiments. Those people in Kurukshetra, who had their hair cut, tried to provoke the Sikhs by putting ‘gatras’ (belt used to carry kirpan) and kirpans on their bodies,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/sgpc-advises-sidhu-to-stick-to-maryada/articleshow/84988227.cms||---

The Maoist, Madvi Ungaal, was killed in exchange of fire after a police combing party came upon 10 Maoists in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district on Sunday. Kothagudem police had then shared his photo with all police stations in the nearby districts, including in Chhattisgarh. On Monday, the body was identified by Ungaal’s family members in Chhattisgarh who later arrived in Kothagudem and took the body. Police said that there were no cases against Ungaal in Telangana, but multiple cases were registered against him in Chhattisgarh. Ungaal, who has been part of 1st battalion led by Hidma, has been allegedly involved in several major encounters and ambushes, including the one in April in which 22 securitymen were killed. Officials said that Ungaal’s family claimed that he had been associated with the Maoist party for the last six years. Hidma is wanted for several major ambushes, including the one in April this year, the 2013 massacre that almost wiped out the state Congress leadership in Chhattisgarh and the 2010 Dantewada strike that killed 76 CRPF personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/slain-maoist-identified-as-hidmas-cousin/articleshow/84988223.cms||---

---||Vadodara||MSU fellow inspires inclusive edu||Vadodara: Mechanisms developed by a postdoctoral fellow of M S University will pave way for making education more inclusive. Dr Hemendra Mistry, who works as an ICSSR postdoctoral fellow at MSU’s Faculty of Education and Psychology, has been awarded two copyrights from the government of India for his research on teachers’ training in inclusive education in India. Currently, the competency and attitude of teachers towards inclusive education in the country is mapped keeping in mind the narrow meaning of inclusive education — that of children with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND). But competency and attitude of future teachers towards children of other disadvantaged groups like those belonging to minority groups, culturally and socially backward communities like tribes residing in remote areas, marginalized, street and poor children or from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) community, isn’t mapped. Mistry, who completed all his studies with hearing impairment, has developed two robust scales — Perceived Competencies for Inclusive Education Scale (P-CIES) and Teachers Attitudes Towards Inclusive Education Scale (TATIES). “Unlike other scales which are focused on narrow meaning of inclusive education i.e. children with SEND, P-CIES and TATIES considers the broader meaning and covers all disadvantaged groups including SEND,” said Mistry, who designed the scales under the mentorship of faculty dean professor R C Patel. The scales which were tested on 317 prospective teachers were found highly reliable and valid in measuring the competencies and attitudes of teachers. “The research results will contribute towards implementing National Education Policy 2020,” said Mistry, a recipient of UGC postdoctoral fellowship in 2015-16. Currently, he is working for his second postdoctoral research. “The current syllabus focuses more on disability and neglecting other disadvantaged sections. Also, it is more theoretical and does not provide practical exposure to pre-service teachers. Even after BEd, they (teachers) hesitate to join diverse classrooms,” said Mistry. “The scales will help in identifying the gaps between current skill levels of teachers and their training needs. The teachers training can focus on those areas and provide in-service training to teachers,” said Mistry. The research scholar was one of the seven candidates of education subject in the country to bag the UGC-Dr S Radhakrishnan postdoctoral fellowship in humanities and social sciences. Earlier, he had completed postdoctoral research on ‘construction and standardization of inclusive education teaching aptitude test’ under the mentorship of professor S C Panigrahi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-fellow-inspires-inclusive-edu/articleshow/84986018.cms||Prashant Rupera

On Monday, Thackeray visited several flood-affected areas in Sangli. More than 2 lakh residents of villages, towns and cities along flooded Krishna river in this district had to be evacuated. During his visit, the CM noticed people gathering in large numbers without following the social distancing and other Covid safety norms. “Before the floods, six districts were seeing a spike in Covid cases. Just when we were trying to understand the cause for the spike, the floods struck. I saw huge crowds in the places I visited today (Monday). I fear the Covid cases may increase again. Therefore, I have asked the district collectors to increase the number of medical teams as well as tests in the flood-affected areas.” When asked about the traders threatening to keep shops open defying Covid restrictions, Thackeray said he did not care about such threats. “I worry for the people. We have a limited capacity for oxygen generation. The Centre has asked the states to prepare for the third wave. We have to get the oxygen from other states and if those states too witness a rise in cases, it will become difficult for us to manage everything. We are also not giving permission to passengers to board Mumbai’s local trains for now,” said Thackeray. Thackeray has also appealed to the industrialists to ensure “bio-bubbles” for the workers to keep them safe. He added that private offices should allow employees to attend work in a staggered manner or work from home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/cm-calls-for-more-covid-tests-in-areas-hit-by-floods/articleshow/84983773.cms||---
---||Dehradun||India’s R count more than 1, Covid spread fastest in Mizoram & Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: The spread of Covid-19 could be speeding up in parts of India. The R number, or reproduction number, which indicates how many people a single individual with Covid-19 can infect, has gone up to 1.02, according to data from a University of Michigan Covid tracker. But eight states and a Union Territory have R values higher than the national average. Mizoram has the highest, at 1.52, followed by Uttarakhand (1.28), Meghalaya (1.25), Kerala (1.22), Sikkim (1.22), Himachal Pradesh (1.21), Delhi (1.04), Manipur (1.04) and Pondicherry (1.03). An R number greater than 1 means the chances of infections spreading will keep rising. “R value is an indicator of virus prevalence and spread. So, if Uttarakhand has an R value of 1.28, it means 100 infected people in Uttarakhand can spread the virus to 128,” said Dr Himanshu Agrawal, epidemiologist with the Uttarakhand health and family welfare department. This is reflected in Covid case numbers. The six states where cases are on an upward swing are among the eight that have R values greater than 1 — Mizoram, with a weekly case growth of 78.8%, Uttarakhand (49.6%), Meghalaya (42.9%), Kerala (31.3%), Sikkim (23.1%) and Himachal Pradesh (20.6%). India’s R value was estimated to be 1.37 between March 9 and April 21, when the second wave hit. From May 11 to July 23, after the second wave peak, it had been below 1. For two days after that, it was above 1 (1.02 on July 24 and 1.01 on July 25). It dipped to 0.95 the following day and was 0.99 on July 27. It has been on an upward trend since and stood at 1.11 by July 31, latest data show. “It is a cause of concern … (The R value) has gradually started going up, starting from 0.96 all the way to 1. This means that the chance of infecting others has gradually gone up … You will see an increase in the number of cases,” AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria had told a national news channel on Saturday. The University of Michigan model anticipates that. According to their projections, India’s cases could rise from the nearly 3.17 crore now to anywhere between 3.23 crore and 3.9 crore by the end of August — which means the country would add as many cases in a month as it did in the past 80 days. The same goes for Uttarakhand — the projections show cases could go from 3.4 lakh to 3.5-4 lakh by August-end. “The emergence of new variants of concern and lower antibody response against these variants is possibly why infectivity rates are going up,” said Dr Madhur Verma, epidemiologist at AIIMS-Bathinda. “There is a decline in maintenance of Covid-appropriate behaviour and more unvaccinated people are getting exposed. This will keep happening until a majority is either exposed to the virus or gets vaccinated.” Early action is what experts advocate. Dr Deepjyoti Kalita, senior microbiologist at AIIMS-Rishikesh, said, “A surge can be easily stopped by following Covid guidelines and getting vaccinated."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/indias-r-count-more-than-1-covid-spread-fastest-in-mizoram-ukhand/articleshow/84983764.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Rajkot||Salt exports down 70% due to China curbs||RAJKOT: The killer Covid-19 pandemic, rising freight charges and a slew of restrictions on Indian crew and cargo imposed by China has resulted in a massive decrease of salt exports from India. China is the biggest importer of Indian salt with nearly 50 lakh tonnes being shipped there annually. However, this has reduced to just 15 lakh tonnes in the period from June 2020 to June 2021 compared to 50 lakh tonnes in the comparative period the year ago, according to data shared by Indian Salt Manufacturers Association (ISMA). This period marks the end of the salt season. This is the second consecutive year that exports to China have fallen. Last year, the export was down because of worldwide lockdowns and the US-China trade war. According to exporters, several ports in China don’t allow ships with Indian seafarers while some others have strict rules. Indian seafarers or crew members, who had been in India in 21 days before entering port area, need to undergo to NAT test and cargo operation can start only after all crew members test negative. There are some ports which demand special application before a vessel coming from India enters their area and once the application is approved, the ship would be taken to a special berthing area. If any of the crew members have Covid-like symptoms including coughing or fever, the vessel’s entry is rejected. Last week, All India Seafarers and General Workers Union wrote to the central government alleging that China has clamped an unofficial ban on Indian sailors from entering its waters. Moreover, salt is the cheapest commodity but the freight charges have also skyrocketed. Shamji Kangad, vice-president of ISMA, said “The freight charges have increased from around $12 per ton to nearly $25 per ton worldwide. But,for the shipment to China, the same charges have tripled because of restrictions on Indian crew members. The turnaround time of ships has also increased at Chinese ports because of these restrictions. China is the world’s biggest producer of salt but it imports huge quantities from India in order to re-export it to the US and European countries where it is used for industrial purposes as well as de-icing. They prefer importing from China due to logistics convenience. Bharat Raval, president of ISMA, added, “Qatar, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia, Bhutan are major importers of salt from India apart from China. Covid and freight rate both are main reasons for drastic fall in exports.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/salt-exports-down-70-due-to-china-curbs/articleshow/84983770.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Some of the malls have even witnessed footfall and sales of pre-pandemic level. According to Sushil Mohta, the eastern region chairman of Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI), footfall and sales soared this weekend largely due to the end-of-season sale and Friendship Day. “This Sunday was the best since the restrictions were lifted at most of the malls,” he said. South City Mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree agreed with Mohta. “There are some restrictions now and but still, this weekend was the best so far. We had around 40,000 footfall on Sunday and on Saturday, it was 32,000. There were over 4,000 cars in the parking lot on Sunday and 3,500 on Saturday. We hope the next weekend would be better,” he said. Acropolis Mall GM K Vijayan said: “It will be even better when the multiplex reopens on August 13.” According to him, the footfall stood at 15,000 on Sunday. “For us, the growth in footfall this weekend was 30%-40%. Acropolis had witnessed over 50,000 footfall this weekend. In our mall, 100% of the staffers are vaccinated,” he added. Acropolis has a capacity of 75,000 at a time. According to him, there was waiting in restaurants and food court on both Saturday and Sunday. Quest Mall vice-president Sanjiv Mehra pointed out that the footfall was gradually getting better. “But it has not yet touched the pre-Covid level. But the numbers are encouraging,” he added. Ambuja Neotia Group director Ramesh Pandey claimed the weekend footfall was even better than 2019. “The last weekend was exceptionally good for both our malls. The footfall in City Centre I has surpassed that of 2019 while at City Centre II, it is on par with 2019 figure. Also, the exam results are out so families are going out to celebrate,” he said.

India Meteorological Department had earlier issued an ‘orange’ alert for Monday and predicted heavy rain at isolated places, but heavy rain was not recorded at any stations till 5.30pm. However, met officials said rain was predicted on Monday night. Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station, recorded ‘trace’ rainfall from 8.30am to 5.30pm on Monday, while Palam recorded moderate rain during the period. Very light to light rain was witnessed at some other stations. Ridge and Ayanagar recorded 4.4mm rainfall each, Pitampura and SPS Mayur Vihar 2.5mm rainfall each and Lodhi road reported 0.2mm rainfall between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab Cong chief patronising sand, liquor mafia, says SAD||Mohali: Former minister and SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia on Monday asked newly appointed Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Navjot Singh Sidhu to explain why he was patronising sand and liquor mafia in the state, instead of holding them responsible for open loot of the state exchequer. “The mafia and those who patronised them, including Madan Lal Jalalpur, Hardyal Kamboj and Gurkirat Singh Kotli are Sidhu’s biggest supporters now. The mafia has even taken on the responsibility of running the Pradesh Congress office in Chandigarh and this is why we now see Sidhu expressing gratitude to the leaders of mafia from Congress stages,” he alleged. Majithia was speaking to media while welcoming the return of independent councilor Nirmal Kaur Dhillon and former Student Organisation of India leader Simran Singh Dhillon into the party fold in Mohali. Asked about the Congress government’s announcement on loan waivers worth Rs 590 crore under the farm debt waiver scheme for labourers and landless farmers, he said it was already turning out to be a hoax. Even before any waiver could take place, the government had come out with pre-conditions which would make a majority of the supposed 2.85 lakh beneficiaries ineligible for the waiver, he said. Describing AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal as a “circus ka khiladi”, the SAD leader said he had exposed himself by adopting double standards on each and every sensitive issue concerning Punjab and its people. The AAP chief had earlier shed crocodile tears on the issue of Satluj Yamuna Link canal in Punjab and then gone and filed an affidavit in court demanding that Punjab water be made available to Delhi and Haryana. “Similarly, Kejriwal has also demanded that criminal cases be registered against Punjab farmers who burn stubble besides initiating a case in the apex court to demand the closure of four thermal plants of Punjab,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-cong-chief-patronising-sand-liquor-mafia-says-sad/articleshow/84988290.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Goa||Parole in Goa gets tougher as new prison rules tighten conditions||PANAJI: With the new prison rules clearly defining eligibility for furlough for different categories of prisoners, securing a temporary release from jail will not be as easy as it used to be before. Discouraging back-to back paroles, the new rules mandate that there should be a gap of six months between the first and second parole and that the term of each should not exceed 30 days. There should also be a three-month gap between parole and the last availed furlough. The superintendent of prisons has been designated as the competent authority to grant emergency parole/custody parole to convicts under police protection while the trial court will be the authority to sanction parole applications of undertrials. Only in exceptional circumstances will parole be extended up to a period of 15 days with the approval of the government, but only once in a block of three years. In no case should parole be extended further, the rules state. They also stipulate that emergency parole for a period extending up to 48 hours be granted due to the death of a family member, marriage of a family member, serious illness of a family member, or any other emergency circumstances with the approval of the inspector general of prisons (IGP). Over the past few years, Colvale Central Jail has seen several prisoners abusing parole and furlough facilities by remaining out of the prison for 90-plus days each year. A former official who was posted at Colvale Central jail last year said it was clear that prisoners took full advantage of the system due to loopholes. “Some considered it their fundamental right while applying for parole. With the new rules taking effect, there is so much clarity on who should be granted parole or furlough,” the official said. One of the conditions that will need to be considered while approving an application for parole or furlough will be the conduct of the prisoner concerned. An inmate who has been awarded major punishment for any prison offence should have been uniformly good for two years preceding the date of his application. The conduct of a prisoner who has been awarded minor punishment or no punishment for any prison offence should have to be uniformly good for one year before the date of his application. Also, the convict should not have violated any terms and conditions of the parole or furlough granted previously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parole-gets-tougher-as-new-prison-rules-tighten-conditions/articleshow/84988313.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Lucknow||UP Police’s Muharram order objectionable, say Shia clerics||LUCKNOW: General secretary of Majlis-e-Ulama-e-Hind, Maulana Kalbe Jawad, on Monday demanded that state government must take action against UP director general of police (DGP) for inciting Shia-Sunni and Hindu-Muslim sentiments by using objectionable words in an internal order sent out to district police chiefs about the security during Muharram. During a press conference on Monday, Jawad objected to the “internal police communication document” that went viral on social media on Sunday.’ Police however say that it was a internal communication meant for briefing district police officials about the security during Muharram and the part of it which is being called objectionable was about anti-social elements. However, raising several questions on the intent of the DGP and police, the cleric appealed to Muharram committees and Anjumans across the state, Sunni and Hindu Azadars (those who commemorate Muharram) to boycott all of the police and administration meetings held before the month’s beginning. “The DGP should apologise and withdraw the circular first before we take part in any of the future meetings to be held by them,” he said. Jawad asked whether officials were trying to create a chaotic condition across the state during Muharram between Shia-Sunni and Hindu-Muslims, by drafting a document with objectionable language against Muharram and the Shia community. “It is unforgivable that the police has said that cases of sexual harassment take place during Muharram. That cow slaughter is performed. That anti-Sunni rituals and activities are performed by writing objectionable words on animals and walls. Are they trying to create disruption between the three communities? Sentiments have started to rile up already and if any untoward incident takes place now, the DGP will be responsible for it,” said Jawad. He also said that he will take the matter up with office bearers in the state and central government All India Shia Personal Law Board (AISPLB) also condemned the document along with other clerics and appealed to Azadars across the state to give a memorandum against the DGP on August 8 to their district magistrate concerned. Board secretary and spokesperson Maulana Yasoob Abbas of AISPLB said, “We will soon meet CM Yogi to know who is behind this document. What is the reality behind this document which appears to be like a charge-sheet against Shias. We will give a memorandum at noon on August 8 against the DGP in different districts. The document is trying to create a rift among all of us.” However, ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said: “A detailed order of dos and don'ts was issued on July 31 for all the officers on the field, for Muharram. This is a departmental internal order based on the events that have happened earlier as was the ground realities. He further said that nothing had been mentioned against any community or religion. It's only been mentioned that anti-social elements may try to disrupt harmony so they must be strictly monitored. Strict action must be taken against them. “Such orders are issued before every festival,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/polices-muharram-order-objectionable-shia-clerics/articleshow/84990279.cms||---

The case was registered against the prison guards under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) bench after the Uttarakhand high court ordered a CBI probe into the custodial death case and asked the state government to consider the transfer of the Nainital SSP and Haldwani circle officer while stating “whether ties of brotherhood led police to find no evidence of beating by prison guards”. The HC had also directed the transfer of four prison guards — Devendra Prasad Yadav Kirti Nainwal, Devendra Yadav, and Harish Rawat — at the Haldwani sub-district jail. The victim, Pravesh Kumar, was sent to prison on March 5 after his wife made a complaint that he had allegedly assaulted their minor daughter in an inebriated state. Following his death, his wife alleged that Kumar was beaten up by prison guards. She sought an FIR into the custodial death but no action was taken. Thereafter, she filed a plea in the high court which took cognisance of the case and ordered the CBI to probe the matter. The court had observed that the autopsy report showed as many as 10 injuries on Kumar’s body and yet the statement of the doctor who performed the procedure was not recorded by police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/haldwani-custodial-death-cbi-files-murder-case-against-four-prison-guards/articleshow/84983840.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Fighting corona, fireman slipped into a coma||AHMEDABAD: In the first wave of Covid-19 cases, when infections began to increase in the walled city, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation had decided to sanitize the area.  Kalpesh Patel, 50, a fireman with the Navrangpura fire station, was part of the sanitization operation. He fell sick soon after and has been bedridden since April 30 last year. TimesViewThe Union home ministry in 2012 laid out rules that mandate that fire-fighters be equipped with protective gear and devices before they venture to douse the fire or deal with chemicals. Equally important is the welfare of firefighters after they get injured or hurt while averting dangers. Medical insurance, leave without pay, post-trauma care is basic. Now that Gujarat has a directorate of fire services, a policy towards the welfare of firefighters should be a reality whether they are permanent or contracted.The administrative wing of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation moved a proposal to consider Patel on leave since April 30. “At present, all his earned leave and sick leave have been exhausted and he is now on leave without pay. Considering that he fell sick while on duty, the administrative wing requested the standing committee to approve disability leave till he re-joins work,” said a senior AMC officer. The proposal forwarded to the standing committee said that he was overexposed to sodium hypochlorite which was used for the sanitization operation, and was admitted to hospital on April 30, 2020. He has been bedridden since then and is fighting for survival.” According to fellow firemen, after the sanitization operation in the walled city, they returned and Patel suddenly complained of giddiness and fell unconscious. He was taken to hospital where he was admitted to the ICU as he slipped into a coma. “The doctors said the reason for him going into a coma may be that he was constantly exposed to sodium hypochlorite,” said his fellow fireman. Patel was in a coma for 40 days and revived and even got on to his feet, when he suffered a paralytic attack. He then suffered damage to his femur bone. Since April 30, he has been bedridden and is still not back on his feet. For the last couple of months, Patel has got his speech back though he can barely speak three or four words together. He has now been able to recognize his wife and son. He was recently carried to his father’s funeral. AMC officials said that according to his medical report, Kalpesh will still six to eight months to return to full fitness. A BJP office-bearer in AMC said that for such employees only the standing committee and AMC general board can sanction leave. Such decisions are taken only on humanitarian grounds as there is no concrete policy for staffers who fall ill in the line of duty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fighting-corona-fireman-slipped-into-a-coma/articleshow/84990339.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Forecasting rainfall for the month ahead for August, India Meteorological Department said that Delhi could receive ‘normal’ rainfall, which will be 95% to 105% of the long-period average. The forecast also shows parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh could receive ‘above normal’ rainfall, while Gurgaon and areas south of Delhi could receive ‘below normal’ rain in August. IMD stated that conditions in northern India were ideal for ‘above normal’ rainfall in the first half of August, with a forecast map for the first two weeks showing large parts of Delhi-NCR receiving more rain than what is generally seen at this time of the year. However, the second half of the month is expected to see a reduction in rainfall activity, with the month largely ending with ‘normal’ rainfall. “We can expect normal rainfall for Delhi in August. It will be 95% to 105% of the long-period average and the monthly rainfall for the country as a whole is also expected to be normal,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head of the regional met department. Director-general of meteorology Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, while releasing the monthly forecast on Monday, said the latter half of July saw a number of low-pressure areas forming in northern India, leading to more rainfall than what is generally seen at this time of the area. “South India will receive above normal rainfall in August, while central India, parts of northwest India, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, as well as parts of the northeast, will receive below normal rainfall. The remaining parts of Delhi are likely to receive normal rain,” Mohapatra added. The national capital recorded 507.1mm of rainfall at Safdarjung, its base station, which is 2.4 times the normal mark of 210.6mm. The normal mark for August is 247.7mm. IMD data showed that last year, Delhi had received 237mm of rainfall in August. Meanwhile, the capital has already crossed its annual average rainfall mark, with five months left. Till Sunday morning, Safdarjung had recorded 780.7mm, which is higher than the annual average mark for the year of 779mm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wet-august-on-the-cards-first-two-weeks-to-get-above-normal-rainfall-reduce-later/articleshow/84988373.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The girl, Sakshi Dabhekar, from Raigad lost a leg while saving her neighbour’s 2-month-old boy as a wall was about to collapse amid torrential rain. On July 22, Sakshi noticed that the wall of the house was collapsing and Uphale’s two-month-old grandson was sleeping nearby at his home in Kevnale village of Poladpur taluka. She lunged towards the baby to save him. While the baby got out of harm’s way, her left leg got caught under the rubble for hours till she was rescued. The boy is from the Uphale family who lives in the neighbourhood. After being treated at a local hospital, she was referred to MGM Hospital in Vashi and finally to KEM Hospital in Parel last week, where doctors had to amputate the leg. to stop the spread of infection. Sakshi, a ninth standard student of Deole High School in Poladpur, has been a rank-holder at school. An avid athlete, she has won various awards in kho-kho, kabaddi and running competitions at the taluka-level. Sakshi told TOI on Monday that she would like to play at the state and national level once she gets back on her feet again. KEM dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said the amputation was inevitable as her leg was fully crushed. “She can be fitted with an advanced artificial leg that will let her walk, run and jump. It will take months to a year, but it’s possible,” he said. On Monday, mayor Kishori Pednekar, health committee head Rajul Patel and a corporator helped her with financial aid. Her uncle said they hope to raise funds to fit her with the prosthetic leg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-teen-loses-leg-while-saving-2-month-old-from-crashing-wall/articleshow/84988333.cms||Sanjay Hadkar

All these people, masons by profession, were travelling to Howrah station to catch a train to Tamil Nadu. The pick-up van was speeding when the driver — Aktarul Mondal — lost control over the wheel and rammed into a lamp post. Most of the victims were unconscious when locals rescued them and took them to Joynagar Gramin Hospital. Baruipur police superintendent Vaibhav Tiwari reached the spot and supervised their shifting to hospitals. Those injured were referred to Baruipur state general hospital and then to Calcutta National Medical College in Kolkata. Eight people, including three from the same family, succumbed to injuries. Six of them were discharged after preliminary treatment. “We had hired the vehicle to reach Howrah station well in advance so that we could catch the train without any hassle. The driver was driving at a very high speed. We alerted him that we were not in a hurry and he could take it easy. But he kept driving at the same speed. What happened in split seconds left us all in trauma. We can’t believe that eight of my friends are no more,” said Badal Mondal, one of the survivors. SP Tiwari said: “The vehicle was moving at a very high speed. The driver lost control and hit a lamppost and then rammed into a tree. The driver’s fault is apparent. He is also battling for life. We can interrogate him only after he recuperates.” Local MLA Ganesh Mondal said: “We met the family members. The victims were the bread-earners of these needy families.

It was precursor to MICA’s marketing fest MICANVAS.“There are three possibilities for any company – there would be a ‘new normal,’ there would be a rise in sales as there’s so much pent-up demand, and people may lower their consumption,” he said about possible impact of Covid-19. He termed the pandemic, climate change, wealth gap, technological changes and polarization as five forces that would impact economy of the future.Kotler said that the companies would have to find the fine balance between digital and traditional advertising – as either in isolation might not work any more. Talking on future of brands, he said that brands need to tell a strong story. “Brand activism is simply not just about your product, but it should also reflect values of your company,” he said. “Branding may get stronger with consumers making more informed choices.”He also emphasized on strengthening online presence and imbibing new technologies in the field of marketing to the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/marketing-gurus-post-pandemic-world-insights/articleshow/84990332.cms||---

---||Nagpur||No easing of curbs leaves hospitality sector furious||Nagpur: The new unlock order from the Maharashtra government have further infuriated hospitality and entertainment sectors, with no relaxations coming their way. The latest order permits all other shops to function till 8pm on weekdays and till 3pm on Saturday. On Sunday, only essential services shops will remain open. There has been no extension in timings for restaurants that can remain open with 50% seating capacity for dine-in only till 4pm, while parcels and takeaways are allowed even after the restricted hours. The latest order is like a death blow, said Tejinder Singh Renu, president of Nagpur Residential Hotels Association (NRHA). “Instead of ‘break-the-chain, the government should call it ‘break-the-back’ of hospitality industry. On the basis of which data are they claiming that the virus spreads through food and thus restaurants can’t be allowed to operate beyond a certain point for dine-in,” he said. Vinod Kanakdande, secretary of Nagpur Halls and Lawns Association, said that how can the government be so “callous”. “I am convinced this government has decided to finish off the hospitality industry. It is absolutely shocking that no timing extension nor capacity expansion was allowed for us even though we have been virtually without an income for last one year. Now, the only way to wake up this government is to agitate on the streets,” said Kanakdande. Expressing disappointment over the order, Sanjay Surana, a movie exhibitor who operates in different cities across Maharashtra, said that the government has not given them any financial help. “Our operations have been shut completely and the least we expected was some relief in property tax or fixed electricity charges, but it seems the government does not care about us,” he said.On the other hand, Dipen Agrawal, president of ‘Sarkar Jagao Vanijya Bachao’ campaign under which 23 trade bodies have come together, said that the decision to allow shops to remain open till 8pm will help a number of businesses. At the same time, he said the government must also take a decision on helping the most-affected businesses like the hotels, restaurants and marriage halls.According to Agrawal, a meeting has been planned to discuss the further course of action. He demanded that if the restrictions are to be continued, the government should come up with a relief package for the affected sectors.He further said that even as the GST collection has grown despite Covid, this can be due to increasing prices of the commodities. “An amnesty scheme is also underway. Collections through it are also increasing the overall kitty,” said Agrawal.Expressing solidarity with the hospitality sector, Ashwin Mehadia, president of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce, said, “Can the government guarantee that there would be no Covid if the shops are closed for a given period? Else, it should come up with a relief package for the affected businesses.” BC Bhartia, president of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), feels the easing of restrictions will help the lower-level businesses a lot. “This was much-needed. There is a need to come over the psychological impact of Covid apart from creating awareness on safety protocols. Shopping should not be considered as a luxury activity these days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-easing-of-curbs-leaves-hospitality-sector-furious/articleshow/84986150.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

In medical parlance, it was a rare case of fetus-in-fetu where one of the twins in the uterus is malformed and parasitic in nature and grows in another twin’s body. Dr Rakesh Joshi, professor and head of the pediatric surgery department at Civil Hospital, said that Vidhi (name changed) is daughter of a jewellery shop owner. “The couple had got worried due to the swelling of her stomach. The CT scan revealed presence of the foetus. They went to hospitals and Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh but without success,” he said. The Asarwa Civil Hospital team with Vidhi and her parentsOn July 22, the surgery was carried out by a team led by Dr Joshi, Dr Jaishree Ramji, Dr Trupti Shah and Dr Kiran Patel. The fetus was pressing her right kidney and renal vessels – thus if the foetus was not removed, it could have compressed other internal organs, said experts. The foetus had formative brain and vertebral column, they added. “Fetus-in-fetu is a rare congenital abnormality having a prevalence of about one in 5 lakh live births. Across the world, there might be about 200 cases reported in literature. For us, it is the third such cases in over two decades,” said Dr Joshi. “The surgery poses a great challenge as the mass is in relation to vital structures which requires meticulous dissection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fetus-removed-from-18-month-old-girl/articleshow/84990459.cms||---

It is targeting the city’s textile industry for goods transport business for which facilities will be developed at these smaller railway stations. The announcement was made by GVL Satya Kumar, divisional railway manager, WR on Monday. Kumar was in the city to inspect the development work at the city’s railway station. It was his first visit to Surat railway station since Surat MP Darshana Jardosh became union minister of state for railways. “We have handled around 70,000 tonne of textile goods from the city. However, railways are getting around 5% of total goods transported,” said Kumar. “We are working on increasing our business in transporting textile goods from Surat. Railways will improve freight facilities at smaller railway stations like Gangadhara, Udhna, Bardoli and Chalthan for that purpose,” Kumar added. Railway authorities are planning to get the goods delivered at these stations where textile production clusters are currently located. This will also reduce movement of transport vehicles within the city limits, explained railway officials. “Railway transport has always been a beneficial option in terms of cost, but we have to depend upon road transport for delivery at destinations. Railway can take goods up to a railway station, mostly a city, but there is no facility for transporting the material from railway station in a city to nearby town,” said Manoj Agarwal, president, Federation Of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA). In a recent meeting with railway officials, FOSTTA discussed these transportation issues and requested the railway to provide last mile connectivity. Meanwhile, to curb the smuggling of liquor in trains the railways will strengthen is CCTV network in and around the Surat railway station. Currently, the railway station has a network of 40 CCTV cameras. Railway officials said that 86 more CCTV cameras will be added by the end of August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/smaller-stations-around-surat-to-get-freight-network-drm/articleshow/84983955.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

India had decimated Belgium 2-1 to lift the 2016 Hockey Junior World Cup, making Harjeet Singh’s team only the second after the 2001 squad, led by Gagan Ajit Singh, to clinch the coveted title. Five years on, as many as eight players of the 2016 squad are once again set to take on Belgium, this time in the semi-finals of the Tokyo Olympics, on Tuesday. These eight players – Harmanpreet Singh, Varun Kumar, Sumit Walmiki, Nilakanta Sharma, Mandeep Singh, Gurjant Singh, Simranjeet Singh, Krishan Pathak – are all pumped up to repeat the decimation of Belgium to enter the finals. Of these, Gurjant Singh and Simranjeet Singh had struck one goal each in the 2016 encounter to lead India to historic win. Besides these eight players, hockey enthusiasts from Uttar Pradesh are also pinning their hopes on Varanasi lad Lalit Kumar Upadhyay, an experienced player who is expected to sharpen Indian attack. India has reached the last four stages for the first time in 49 years since 1972. The 1980 event, where India won gold, was played in a round robin format, with the top two teams playing the final. The men’s semi-final match comes a day after Indian women’s hockey team scripted history on Monday by storming into the Olympic Games semi-finals for the first time, stunning three-time champions Australia. Lauding both the men’s and women’s teams for reaching the semi-finals, former international hockey player and UP sports director RP Singh said: “Playing semi-finals in Olympics is no mean achievement and our teams have been playing exceptionally well. Our players’ spirits are high and they will surely win accolades for India and set new milestones.” “Hockey is close to every Indian’s heart and our victory will inspire young players.

Nagpal also said that weapon system and sensor system manufacturers are looking for local MSMEs who can integrate the systems on the warships that GSL is building. Nagpal, who was speaking at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) conference on ‘New Emerging Opportunities for MSMEs in Shipbuilding & Defence, said that participation of MSMEs in shipbuilding contracts will strengthen India’s private shipbuilding industry. “A significant work of the yard is sub-contracted and we engage a large number of MSMEs for all shipbuilding, refit and general engineering services. GSL has identified items and components required in shipbuilding, specially for the private and MSME sector,” said Nagpal. Nagpal also said that GSL is looking for MSMEs who can take up fabrication, structural work, basic engineering, electrical spares and outfitting of ships, particularly integration of complex systems supplied by various OEMs. “We have been making several offshore patrol vessels to date and now since we are shifting to high-end weapon intensive platforms, we have actually found that these original equipment manufacturers, which are associated with various weapons, sensors, they need a lot of local MSMEs to participate in their programmes for integration,” said Nagpal. Industries minister Vishwajit Rane, who also spoke at the conference, said that it is important for MSMEs to tap the opportunities in the shipbuilding sector. “In the area of defence there is so much of scope and potential that is being brought out by the government of India. The access to these opportunities were never there before,” said Rane. Nagpal said that GSL has registered all the members of Konkan Maritime Cluster as vendors so that components of warships can be sub-contracted to local firms. “Since they (Konkan Maritime Cluster) would have large number of equipment which are being installed in the cluster itself, it will be a huge support to GSL in terms of addressing a lot of issues that the yard is presently facing,” said Nagpal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gsl-looks-at-msmes-to-help-build-warships/articleshow/84988443.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kochi Municipal Corporation moots schemes to effectively utilize plan fund||KOCHI: Kochi corporation authorities are exploring the possibilities of using plan fund in more productive manner. They are mooting various proposals, including the one to take vacant plots in the city on lease and set up various projects like solar energy panels in such land. This will help the corporation garner revenue as well as avoid problems stemming out of holdings in the city remaining vacant. Most of the vacant plots in the city have turned into waste dumping yards thereby posing the threat of spreading communicable diseases. Such plots are being used by antisocial elements as well. “Many of the projects being implemented using plan fund don’t suit the requirements of the city. That’s why we decided to explore more innovative and beneficial projects for the city,” said corporation development standing committee chairman P R Reneesh. “There is a project under the people’s planning programme for providing table and chair for the fishermen to set up a study room for their kids. But the need of the hour is a laptop. Many of the students lack cell phones or laptops. This make their online studies difficult,” Reneesh said. “So, there should be changes in the guidelines set by the government,” he said. Setting up of solar panels is one of the ambitious project the corporation is mooting. “We have just exploring the possibilities. We have to clear a lot of hurdles before we can implement the project,” Reneesh said. The corporation authorities are planning to present these ideas before the state government and planning council for getting their nods. “Setting up of solar projects on vacant plots will create a green energy revolution in the city,” said councillor Henry Austin, a member of the corporation development standing committee. “We should get the holdings on long-term lease. Then only, we will be able to set up solar projects,” Austin said. Another proposal mooted by the corporation is to give grow bags to apartment dwellers. “They can grow vegetables using the water and manure generated from waste treatment plants. Vacant plots can also be used for vegetable farming with the cooperation of land owners,” Reneesh said. Shortage of manpower coupled with high wages is the main hurdle before the land owners in clearing the bushes and undergrowth in their holdings. “We can use Ayyankali Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme for overcoming such difficulties.

Since April 30, Covid vaccination of the younger populationwas stopped mainly due to a shortage of vaccines and the increase in the number of the elderly citizens with their second doses due. The district administration had given priority to people above 60 years of age with comorbidities. Around 70% of the senior citizens have been fully vaccinated. They were given the priority to bring down the Covid mortality rate, which was the highest among them. By April 30, only 1,200 beneficiaries between 18 and 44 years were vaccinated. They have been subsequently vaccinated for their second dose after completion of 84 days. The district health administration has identified 14 centres in the rural areas and the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is going to open five vaccination centres for vaccinating those between 18 and 44 years. Amol Mane, KMC’s vaccination officer said, “We have adequate doses available. The beneficiaries have to register to get their first jab. Only 200 beneficiaries will be allowed to get the vaccine at each centre.” The district administration is planning to launch an online portal to register the vaccination schedule. The slot can be fixed as per the availability of vaccine doses at the particular centre. Recently, the district received 1 lakh doses and in the next week, the administration is expected to get one lakh more doses.  Meanwhile, 12 lakh beneficiaries out of the total 31 lakh have been given the first dose till Monday, while 6.36 lakh beneficiaries have been fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-vax-drive-for-18-44-group-to-resume/articleshow/84983971.cms||---
---||Mumbai||One-month-old operated on to remove twin from tummy in Mumbai||MUMBAI: City doctors have successfully operated on a baby boy who was born with his ‘twin’ inside his abdomen — a rare condition called ‘fetus-in-fetu’. It is estimated to occur in one of 5 lakh live births.  Doctors suspected something unusual when they picked up, what they thought to be a cyst, in the baby’s abdomen during a routine ultrasound of the mother in the fifth month of pregnancy. Two months later, when the mother visited for a follow-up scan in the seventh month of pregnancy, it was clear that the mass was not a cyst. The scan found bones and viscera, suggestive of body parts of a foetus that was inside the abdomen of the healthy fetus.  The couple in their thirties, who did not wish to be identified, said they were advised to carry on with the pregnancy by the doctors at the suburban maternity hospital they were consulting. “We were anxious, but the doctors told us that any intervention has to be done only after the baby is born,” the father told TOI. He said that the pregnancy was continued to term, and the baby was born without any complications. The couple consulted multiple doctors who recommended removal of the ‘dead twin’ from inside the healthy baby.  They approached Narayana Health’s SRCC Children’s Hospital in Mahalaxmi after the baby was a month old. Doctors found the dead twin in an amniotic sac in the upper part of the newborn’s tummy, displacing vital structures.  “A challenge in such cases is to remove the baby with the amniotic sac intact,” said Dr Sarita Bhagwat, senior paediatric surgeon who led the operation. The healthy baby was recently discharged from the hospital after recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/1-mth-old-operated-on-to-remove-twin-from-tummy-in-mumbai/articleshow/84990509.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Ind MLA Meena says fort flag issue will continue, Kirori says it won’t last||Jaipur: Independent MLA Gangapur Ramkesh Meena on Monday called the hoisting of the white flag at Amagarh fort by Rajya Sabha member Kirori Lal Meena as a long struggle to carve out a separate identity for tribals in the country. Ramkesh had removed the saffron flag from the fort on July 22 sparking a major controversy in the region. He demanded that his community will demand a separate religious code ‘Sanatani Dharm’, which will have their core beliefs of worshipping ‘nature.’ Ramkesh clarified that it was a long-pending demand and not an issue. He blamed the RSS for enforcing their beliefs on everyone. “They have included several communities under the umbrella of Hinduism. RSS will never be succeeding in its motive of slapping Hindu codes, beliefs and rituals. Our demand of a separate tribal code is being accelerated by us,” said Ramkesh. Reacting to the Ramkesh’s stand of taking the issue ahead, Kirori Lal reiterated his statement that “Meena community is Hindu by religion and will remain Hindu forever. Our rituals and ceremony right from birth to death are from the Hindu faith. This (non-Hindu) is a non-issue and would not last.”The BJP may not have taken objection of hoisting the white flag, but pro-Hindu groups have taken a strong stand against Kirori Lal’s hoisting of the white flag instead of a saffron one on the fort. Narendra Purohit, national secretary, Vishwa Hindu Mahasangh, said the white flag may belong to the Meena community, it doesn’t represent Hindu society. “Temples don’t belong to any particular community whether it was built by Meena community rulers or anyone else. Society is not bigger than religion. I strongly object to the move and this was not accepted from a stalwart leader like Kirori Lal Meena,” said Purohit.The body demanded action against Kirori Lal and asked the central government to take action against those who were diving society even if they were elected representatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ind-mla-meena-says-fort-flag-issue-will-continue-kirori-says-it-wont-last/articleshow/84988450.cms||---
---||Delhi||PM requested to ban addictive online games||New Delhi: Pointing to the negative impacts of addictive online games on children, an additional district judge has sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s interference in banning them in the country. ADJ Naresh Kumar Laka has written to the PM requesting him to ban two online games — Free Fire and PUBG India — on the lines of the government’s earlier decision to disallow PUBG Mobile. “The citizens of the country appreciated your action in banning the notorious game PUBG Mobile which caused devastating adverse effect on the development of children. But recently two similar games, namely, Free Fire (Garena Free Fire — Rampage) and PUBG India (Battle Grounds Mobile India), are also causing adverse impact on the children like the previous PUBG,” the ADJ said in his letter to the PM. Laka said children nowadays spend long hours in playing such games, which disturbs their normal life and affects their family and social behaviour. He suggested a law be framed to restrict exposure of children to online games.

During the last three months, the ‘Great Sea Vembanad’ was involved in two berthing incidents during which the ropes broke and one end of the ship started drifting away from the harbour. Once fully let loose, there is chance of boats harboured at Munambam being destroyed in the event. “Following a case filed by the State Bank of India, the debt recovery tribunal has directed the bank to auction the ship,” said advocate commissioner Abu Mathew, who is entrusted with the job of selling the ship. “With the pandemic on, the sale wouldn’t happen easily as prospective buyers couldn’t travel down to inspect the ship. Hence, we are yet to advertise it,” he said. As Great Sea Shipping is in liquidation, the firm was unable to pay the salary of the sailors and once the sale happens, the first claim to be settled will be theirs, Mathew added. An assistant sub-inspector with the Munambam police station said that the ship was kept in a precarious situation. “Ten days ago, the rope that secured the rear of the vessel [stern] came undone from the cement block of the berth where it was attached. As we informed, officials concerned came and secured the ship safely,” he said. Managing director and CEO of Great Sea Shipping N J Thomas said that the firm set up by six Middle East returnees using their own funds, loans from friends and bank had to face troubles right from the beginning. Great Sea Vembanad’s maiden voyage from Kochi to Kollam carrying nine 40ft containers gave them a lesson on why it was wise not to invest in Kerala. “When the ship reached Kollam, there was no infrastructure as ought to be in a port. The small crane provided was small and couldn’t handle the containers. Camping at Kollam and using two cranes, we managed to unload these containers, but taking the first two containers by road, it took altogether five days,” Thomas said. Later, at a meeting of stakeholders of Kollam port convened by the minister, Thomas had said that “We came with a lot of enthusiasm, but we regret the day we took the decision to invest our hard-earned retirement money and start the ship”. Thomas said coastal shipping would take off in Kerala only if the government and officials take drastic steps to make things happen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/states-pioneering-coastal-shipping-project-ends/articleshow/84986220.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Pune||Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol for more ease, politicos join chorus||PUNE: City mayor Murlidhar Mohol and BJP have approached the state government with a demand that the PMC and PCMC areas and the rural belt of the district be considered as separate administrative units and more relaxations provided in the two municipal areas. Leaders of all political parties said the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits should also get the benefit of increased relaxations offered by the state government. Pune was not among the 25 districts, for which the state government on Monday announced further ease of the Covid curbs.  Mayor Mohol said his party, the BJP, has approached the MVA government to meet the demands of the people of Pune city and Pimpri Chinchwad. “The citizens of Pune city and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas have done their best to control the spread of the virus. Mumbai is getting more relaxations. Then why not Pune?” he said. Mohol said the delay in introducing relaxations in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits was causing problems to people across the strata of society. “They are suffering economically. Further relaxations should be introduced at the earliest,” he said. NCP city unit chief Prashant Jagtap said, “The (weekly) positivity rate in Pune city and Pimpri Chinchwad has remained below 5% for almost a month. The government should consider this and provide more relief for the citizens. It should also ensure extension in business timings.” Prashant Girbane, director-general of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA), said, “It is high time that we further opened up Pune’s economy. The worst affected are the contact-based services and employees in the informal sector. The manufacturing sector is stuck at sub-par levels and awaiting the aggregate demand to pick up for the rise in production and employee deployment.” Fatehchand Ranka, president of the Federation of Traders Association Pune (FTAP), said, “We want the timings to be changed to 11am-8pm on weekdays or from 11am to 7pm on all seven days of the week to allow some recovery of business, especially with the festive season coming up.” Sachin Nivangune, president of the Pune District Retailers’ Association, said, “We have written a letter to the civic authorities and they have pledged to extend the shop timings in the next two-three days.” Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Hoteliers and Restaurants Association, said, “Our members will participate in the demonstration. Since most shops used to close at 9pm (before the pandemic), the 7pm deadline demand works for them in the current situation. But we want the restaurant timings to be extended to 10.30pm, so that we can open for dine-in services.” (With inputs from Neha Madaan, Shiladitya Pandit, Sandip Dighe & Anjali Jhangiani)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mayor-for-more-ease-politicos-join-chorus/articleshow/84988448.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Aligarh to soon get a flatted factory with non-polluting units||Lucknow: Aligarh will soon get a flatted factory, a multi-storeyed building in which multiple non-polluting units can operate. The project will be set up in 1.34 hectare land at a cost of Rs 90 crore. The factory will be immensely helpful for the MSME industrialists in the district as they will be provided with all facilities at one place, said additional chief secretary (MSME) Navneet Sehgal on Sunday. Sehgal said the proposed factory will have three towers, of which block A will have five floors, block B will have seven floors and block C will have two floors. The factory will be equipped with facilities like a wide road, drainage system, water and power supply. A multi-storey residential building will be constructed for the workers employed in the factory. A common treatment plant, meeting hall, cafeteria material lift and parking for trucks will also be provided. Around half of the campus area will be kept open for greenery. “Keeping in mind the needs of industrialists, four districts are being taken up in the first phase, Lucknow, Kanpur, Ghaziabad and Agra. In Agra, the factory is coming up in Foundry Nagar, Dada Nagar in Kanpur and Scooter India Ancillary Estate in Nadarganj in Lucknow,” said Sehgal “Aligarh is an important business centre, famous for its lock industry. A flatted factory will give its industrialists a space where all facilities will be available at one place. Buyers will find it easy to approach sellers and this will help improve trade in the district,” he added. In June 2020, the UP State Industrial Development Authority had adopted a policy to allow flatted factories. The concept allows more activity in a limited space. As per the policy, minimum land requirement of 5 acres has been set for development of such a factory which cannot be developed in a residential area or mixed land use area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aligarh-to-soon-get-a-flatted-factory-with-non-polluting-units/articleshow/84990412.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Social forestry boss exposes misdeeds in his own dept||Nagpur: In an unprecedented move, the conservator of forest and joint director of social forestry department (SFD), Nagpur Circle, has himself turned whistleblower exposing various irregularities going on under his jurisdiction in pre-plantation operation (PPO) works in five districts of Vidarbha.Letters in possession of TOI shows that in June, SFD joint director SD Wadhai had conducted inspection of PPO works at various sites in Gondia, Wardha, Nagpur, Bhandara and Chandrapur districts and found various irregularities.Based on the inspection report by Wadhai, chief conservator of forests (CCF) P Kalyan Kumar, Nagpur, has ordered an inquiry into various irregularities. The CCF has set up 13 committees with each panel being headed by an assistant conservator of forests (ACF) and one RFO as its member from the territorial department.These committees will inquire into how much money has been spent on cleaning works before taking up roadside plantations and the height of saplings planted this monsoon among other issues. The committees have been asked to submit a fair report by August 31.Talking to TOI, Wadhai confirmed that various irregularities were found during his visits. “After cleaning of sites has been added as one of the components to the plantation work in 2015, the RFOs have been submitting exaggerated estimates. A mind boggling Rs1.35 crore has been spent by the SFD divisions on cleaning works. A single person is being shown to be doing cleaning work, digging of pits and other activities.”Citing an example of Arvi range in Wardha division, Wadhai said during an inspection of PPO works on June 15 between Sirpur-Takalkheda and Dhanodi bus stop-Warud Bagaji, cleaning works were not done and money was paid preparing fake vouchers. “I had asked the DFO to take disciplinary action against RFO concerned,” he said.Documents show during inspection of Ramtek on June 21, Wadhai found that pits were dug ahead of inspection and these were not as per the prescribed size. Secondly, cleaning works were not taken up. It was found that between Charbhata and Ajangaon, saplings were planted by scooping without digging pits. In a 1.5km area, old plantations were showed as new. Between Revral and Charbha, the pits were of small size and no cleaning works were undertaken.“When I ordered disciplinary action against all the erring RFOs, they ganged up against me and are mounting pressure through forest union leaders and demanding my transfer. They have also threatened to go on mass leave,” said Wadhai.A retired PCCF said, “Wadhai is fully competent to take action against erring RFOs. Then why jumbo committees were set up? Such cases of misappropriation are not new and the forest department’s own evaluation reports seeking action against officials are gathering dust. The present case will also be buried with six months to go for Wadhai’s retirement.”“What Wadhai has exposed is just the tip of the iceberg as in the past, the forest department’s own evaluation reports on three-year and 10-year plantations have shown consistent failure. This is happening because PPO works are not taken up seriously,” a retired PCCF told TOI.In 2018, the state had ordered an inquiry into a scam related to the purchase of tree guards in SFD without following the e-tendering process.WHAT HAPPENEDJune 8, 2021: SFD joint director SD Wadhai finds large-scale irregularities in pre-plantation operation (PPO) works like digging of pits and site cleaning works in all the divisions under Nagpur circleJune 15: Several violations of roadside PPO works were found in the Arvi range under Wardha during the inspection tourJune 21: Similar irregularities were found in Ramtek area under Nagpur division by Wadhai, who recommended disciplinary action against forest staffJuly 22: Nagpur CCF P Kalyan Kumar sets up 13 separate two-member committees to probe irregularities.

The officials claimed that the resolution passed by the house is yet to get the approval of the state government. Moreover, the resolution did not mention clearly what type of material was under ban. Most eatables and other things come in one-time use plastic packaging. In November 2019, in order to reduce single-use plastic products, the civic body had proposed 70 plastic-free zones in city. These plastic free-zones included MC’s own buildings, a few public parks, hospitals, industrial units, schools and institutes. In these plastic-free zones, no plastic product was to be utilised and in 100 meters radius of this plastic-free zone too, plastic products were to be avoided. The directions to establish plastic-free zones were issued by Punjab Municipal Infrastructure Development Corporation (PMIDC), keeping in view the 550th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev. At MC zonal offices too the use of one time-plastic products was banned completely Requesting anonymity, one of the officials claimed that resolution to ban one-time plastic was prepared by the operation and maintenance cell and they only mentioned one-time plastic use, but did not define exactly what all would come under it, for even water, cold drink bottles, wrappers and all other things fall under one-time use and if they have to ban those things, then they will have to give alternative to the public and manufacturers as well. He said they cannot act unless the authorities decide when to go ahead with ban. When contacted, secretary of MC, J S Sekhon said, “The resolution is pending at government level and we are waiting for the same. Once the resolution will be cleared we will go accordingly. Meanwhile, we have started the drive against plastic carry bags, which are already banned.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/without-clear-instruction-state-mc-in-dilemma-over-what-to-ban-under-single-use-plastic/articleshow/84988553.cms||---

His appointment comes after the earlier director DR Bhagat retired from the post on July 31. Savaikar is the fourth appointee to the post of director of education within a year. Bhagat and his predecessor as the director of education, Santosh Amonkar, both spent only a few months in office as they were appointed as directors very close to their retirement. Before Amonkar’s appointment, IAS officer Vandana Rao held the post. But she was transferred out following a controversial circular, which asked aided school managements to pay teachers’ salaries from their own funds as there would be delay in aid from the state. Prior to his appointment, Savaikar was the joint secretary to chief minister Pramod Sawant and earlier served as under secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bhushan-savaikar-is-new-education-director/articleshow/84988561.cms||---

Under the general scheme, only two children of a family will be eligible for getting Rs 2,500 per month till a specified time. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had recently launched the Bal Seva Yojana for children who lost their parents to Covid. The scheme approved on Monday will benefit children below the age of 18 years who lost their parents or guardians as well as those between 18 and 23 years who lost both or one parent or guardian and are currently enrolled in a college, university or technical institute for a graduate degree or have cleared NEET, JEE, CLAT etc. The scheme will also benefit children whose mothers are divorced or abandoned, or whose parents or earning parent is in prison, besides children rescued from child labour, begging or prostitution. The financial assistance will be provided till a child attains the age of 18 years or, in case of those studying in undergraduate level, till they complete their course or attain the age of 23 years, whichever is earlier. The cabinet also approved the proposal of giving Rs 5 lakh to families of homeguards in case of death while in duty, and Rs 2.5 lakh in case of loss of limb or eye. This scheme will be implemented from December 6, 2020, and hence it was decided to end the social security insurance scheme and provision to grant aid to those not covered by the insurance scheme. The cabinet also decided to convene the next session of state legislature from August 17. The legislature’s budget session, convened on February 18, had ended on March 4 and the state government is constitutionally bound to hold the next session before September 4 since a session has to be held within six months of the last one. The Cabinet also cleared the draft of the UP Repeal Ordinance-2021. There are 312 laws which have been found redundant and obsolete. The decision to repeal these laws has been taken to reduce regulatory compliance burden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-cabinet-approves-rs-2500monthly-aid-to-bereaved-kids/articleshow/84990446.cms||---

The Saurashtra High School Trust, established 121 years ago, will run the Sanskrit school. The school started the admission process for ‘prathma’ standard after receiving the permission from commissioner of schools. Students who have cleared class 8 examinations of any medium are eligible to enroll for ‘prathma’. “The exams of this school will be conducted by the Gujarat board. Through the new education policy the government has given emphasis to Sanskrit and it has led to the creation of new employment opportunities for students learning the ancient language,” Nidat Barot, the trust’s managing trustee, said. The students have to take three papers of Sanskrit while the rest of the curriculum is the same as that in any other medium school. After class 10 the students can either continue with Sanskrit or opt for regular education. Gujarat also has a Sanskrit University in Somnath. Students can opt for it if they want to pursue higher studies in the language. According to the school trustees, there are many employment avenues that a Sanskrit scholar can explore including that of a translator or language expert in the government sector. Also, Sanskrit graduates get jobs in temples not only in India but also abroad. According to the Sanskrit varsity in Somnath, it’s the most computer friendly language. The scientific literature in Sanskrit is vast and covers diverse subjects like mathematics, gemmology and zoology among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkots-1st-sanskrit-school-gets-govt-nod/articleshow/84984001.cms||---

Out of the 731 samples that tested positive for different variants, 655 were found to be Delta, Alpha (52), Kappa (14), B.1 (10) and one Delta + variant. Since, Delta had dominated other variants, the health department has started taking preparations keeping in mind the Delta variant. “In the second wave, the need for oxygen had gone up as the Delta variant was affecting the lungs and patients were finding it difficult to breathe. In the first wave, we did not face such a situation. In the second wave, the condition of the patients deteriorated much rapidly. Keeping in mind the requirement for oxygen in the second wave, we have done all the preparations for the third wave,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (health). Districts such as Jaipur, Alwar, Udaipur, Bikaner, Jodhpur and Sikar, which remained the worst affected due to the second wave, had the highest number Delta variant cases. Out of 655 samples that tested positive for the Delta variant, 305 was in Jaipur, Alwar (107), Udaipur (58), Bikaner (34), Jodhpur (30) and Sikar (29). The rest of the 92 samples belonged to 27 other districts. Officials said the medicines, which were required in the second wave such as remdesivir and steroids, have also been made available along with eight key tests that were most commonly used in treatment of Covid patients in the second wave. During the second wave, a lot of patients had developed thromboembolism, cytokine storm, septicemia, myocarditis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and inflammation, which deteriorated their condition and in some cases even led to death. For diagnosing such conditions, doctors had used tests such as D-dimer, interleukin 6 (IL6), procalcitonin, troponin I and troponin T, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LD or LDH) and c-reactive protein(CRP). Now, as the health department is preparing for the third wave, it is making all the eight tests available in rural areas as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-prepares-for-3rd-wave-keeping-delta-variant-in-mind/articleshow/84988502.cms||---

The rest of the 92 samples belonged to 27 other districts. Officials said the medicines, which were required in the second wave such as remdesivir and steroids, have also been made available along with eight key tests that were most commonly used in treatment of Covid patients in the second wave. During the second wave, a lot of patients had developed thromboembolism, cytokine storm, septicemia, myocarditis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and inflammation, which deteriorated their condition and in some cases even led to death. For diagnosing such conditions, doctors had used tests such as D-dimer, interleukin 6 (IL6), procalcitonin, troponin I and troponin T, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LD or LDH) and c-reactive protein(CRP). Now, as the health department is preparing for the third wave, it is making all the eight tests available in rural areas as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/state-prepares-for-3rd-wave-keeping-delta-variant-in-mind/articleshow/85002055.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Inquiry starts into 4.5 lakh tonne coal ‘theft’ from mine||Chandrapur: The district administration has started an inquiry into allegations regarding theft of 4.50 lakh tonne coal from Baranj open cast mine of Karantaka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL) during 2018-19. Mining department is collecting old stock records at the time of the mine’s closure in March 2015 and details of earlier police investigations. On July 19, guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar had ordered the inquiry after receiving several complaints regarding theft by the coal mafia.KPCL had carried out mining in Baranj I-IV, Kiloni and Manora coal blocks in Bhadrawati tehsil from September 2008 to March 31, 2015. The mine was shut down following de-allocation of coal blocks as per orders of Supreme Court in March 2015. There was reportedly 4.51 lakh metric tonne coal in the stock yard of Baranj mine when it was closed. The entire stock went missing within a span of few months in 2018-19. District mining officer Suresh Naitam claimed that as per the records available with them, there was 94,790 MT coal in the stock yard at the time of mine’s closure. “Records of total coal production, dispatch and stock in the mine from its commissioning to closure on March 31, will be sought from coal controller office. This data will be compared with figures already available with our department,” Naitam told TOI. Earlier, the mining department had conducted inquiry based on complaints about pilferage filed by the then Union minister of state, Hansraj Ahir and MLA Nana Shamkule on July 2019. The inquiry officer had concluded that around 94,000 MT of coal left in the stock yard was burned in summer heat and equivalent amount of ash and scattered remains of coal was left in the stock yard. At that time, KPCL officials had filed a police complaint about coal theft but no investigation details are available with the mining department. Naitam claimed that they will unearth the earlier inquiry report, details of police investigations and gather the old record of stock. “We will take all these details to collector, who will then decide the further course of inquiry,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/inquiry-starts-into-4-5-lakh-tonne-coal-theft-from-mine/articleshow/84986296.cms||Mazhar Ali

Out of the 731 samples that tested positive for different variants, 655 were found to be Delta, Alpha (52), Kappa (14), B.1 (10) and one Delta + variant. Since, Delta had dominated other variants, the health department has started taking preparations keeping in mind the Delta variant. “In the second wave, the need for oxygen had gone up as the Delta variant was affecting the lungs and patients were finding it difficult to breathe. In the first wave, we did not face such a situation. In the second wave, the condition of the patients deteriorated much rapidly. Keeping in mind the requirement for oxygen in the second wave, we have done all the preparations for the third wave,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (health).

The department has invited applications from those willing to provide land for constructing the flat complex to rehabilitate those who have opted for the project. The plan is to acquire around 50 cents within Chellanam panchayat for the construction of the flat. The land must not violate any coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms and interested land owners must submit applications along with the requisite land documents before the fisheries deputy director before August 13. Interested people can contact 04842394476 for details. The project has been conceived to provide safe housing for all fisher families residing in areas within 50 metres of the tidal area, vulnerable to sea erosion. However, most of the residents are yet to support the project and many have opposed the project alleging that the terms and conditions for opting the project were similar to a ‘forced eviction’ of fishermen from their lands. Meanwhile, a group of residents under the banner of Chellanan Janakiya Vedi staged a ‘sleep protest’ in front of the office of fisheries deputy director on Monday against the government ineffectiveness in resolving the sea erosion issue. The protest was inaugurated by Jackson Pollayil, president of Kerala Swathantra Matsyathozhilali Federation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-moves-ahead-with-rehab-project/articleshow/84986295.cms||---

More than 31,000 farmers of the state benefited from this scheme, which ended on July 31. Agriculture minister Lalchand Kataria said that this scheme was started from June 1 through TAFE company to provide relief to small and marginal farmers with less than 2.5 acres of land in the state.Free service was provided by the company through its renters till July 31 to 31, 326 eligible farmers as per demand. During this period, 88,092 hours of work was done on 54,782 acres of land with tractor and agricultural equipment. Kataria said that Jaipur district topped with 3,680 farmers taking the benefit. Last year also, due to the efforts of agriculture department, similar service was provided.Meanwhile, sowing of the Kharif crops has picked up momentum after good rains in the state in the last one week. The government had set a target of sowing about 1.63 crore hectares of land in the current Kharif season. According to the data available with the agriculture department 1.22 crore hectares of cultivation had taken place till July 31 which is about 75% of the targeted cultivation. This is only marginally less than the previous year’s figures of 1.26 crore hectares of land during the same period last year.The department hopes that with the monsoon covering the state, sowing will pick up momentum and it would be able to achieve the target.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/31k-farmers-benefit-from-free-rental-scheme-for-agri-implements/articleshow/84988527.cms||---
---||Thane||Thane: Mamta Kulkarni’s plea to defreeze accounts rejected||THANE: The special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) court here has rejected the application of former Bollywood actress Mamta Kulkarni to defreeze her bank accounts and FDs as well as de-seal two flats in Andheri. The accounts were frozen and properties sealed in a Rs2,000-crore drugs case. Additional sessions judge Rajesh S Gupta, who is also a special NDPS judge, passed the order last week. In her plea, Kulkarni through her lawyer submitted that she was an Indian citizen and had been framed in the case. She said she was the sole breadwinner of her family and she had to bear the expenses of one of her sisters who was suffering from a mental health issue. She further submitted that since her six bank accounts and three FDs were frozen, she was unable to meet the medical expenses. She sought that her flats in Andheri be de-sealed too as her sister needed to be kept in an orderly and neat set-up. The prosecutor pointed out that the accused had played an active role in the crime and she had been chargesheeted in the case. Besides, she had been on the run and was in Kenya ever since the case was registered on April 12, 2016. The prosecution further submitted that all attempts to bring home the accused had been exhausted. Despite several notices issued by the court, the accused never turned up before the investigating agency or the court, hence her bank accounts were frozen and the flats owned by the accused sealed. The prosecution pointed out that if the application was allowed, the accused would never appear before the law agencies. After hearing both sides, the judge, while rejecting the plea, said, “…accused has not turned up before the court nor appeared before investigating agency, hence, in the said facts and circumstances, I do not find any substance to de¬freeze the bank accounts and de-¬seal the flats as prayed. It is made clear observations made herein are for the limited purpose of deciding the present application, it shall not have effect on merits of the case.” TOI was the first to report on the case. On April 14, 2016, the crime branch had seized over 20 tonnes of ephedrine and 2.5 tonnes of acetic anhydride from a pharmaceutical factory—Avon Life Sciences— in Solapur and other locations in Thane and Ahmedabad. Investigations led sleuths to the involvement of Kulkarni, her husband Vicky Goswami and a Kenyan-based drug mafia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-mamta-kulkarnis-plea-to-defreeze-a/cs-rejected/articleshow/84991743.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Fever surveillance crucial to spot early surge in corona infections, say experts||PUNE: Focusing on regular fever and syndromic surveillance, involving private and public hospitals, was the way forward to pick up early signs of a surge in Covid-19 cases, experts said. “Fever or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance is key to keep a tab on early signs of the spread of communicable diseases such as Covid-19,” senior public health expert Subhash Salunke, advisor to the Maharashtra government on communicable diseases like Covid-19, said. At present, fever surveillance was being carried out in a haphazard way and there was no uniformity, the experts said. There was a need to focus more on the surveillance by involving a sizeable number of private clinics and hospitals across the state, Salunke said. Syndromic SARI surveillance would give early warning signals for Covid-19 as well as other endemic diseases, which were perhaps more common now, but were likely to go undetected. “With the onset of monsoon, we are likely to see cases of dengue, chikungunya, typhoid fever, malaria, among others,” said senior clinical epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee.  “Any unusual rise in fever or flu-like symptoms can allow public health authorities to investigate, control and eliminate the disease in the particular area,” Banerjee said. The experts said the methods for surveillance should be simple so that reporting by lay volunteers was possible and could be encouraged. Sentinel surveillance is a higher-level of surveillance. In this, both public and private hospitals can act as sentinels that can detect an unusual rise or fall symptoms such as fever, bodyache, cough, diarrhoea and others, Banerjee said. Fever cases, medically termed as acute febrile illness, have multiple causative factors. “Covid-19 is one of them. As there is a pandemic, it should be ruled out first. The rapid antigen test will serve as a good screening tool and will lead to picking up cases at early stages,” said physician Aniket Joshi, member of the Association of Physicians of India. Basic tests for acute febrile illness such as complete blood count, when done early, can give a clue of the type of viral illness.“As these diseases are notifiable, civic authorities will get accurate early warning clues about the surge in viral illnesses,” Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fever-surveillance-crucial-to-spot-early-surge-in-corona-infections-say-experts/articleshow/84988547.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Delhi||Delhi Metro closes gap in longest, shortest lines||NEW DELHI: Just days away on Friday, the opening of two small stretches — the 290-metre ‘missing link’ at Trilokpuri and the 891-metre Najafgarh-Dhansa Bus Stand station section — will finally complete Delhi Metro's longest and shortest corridors, the Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar Pink Line and the Dwarka-Najafgarh Grey Line. The 58.4-km, arc-like Pink Line has been operating as two separate corridors due to the gap in the tracks between Mayur Vihar I and Trilokpuri created by land unavailability, with one section going from Majlis Park to Mayur Vihar Pocket I and reversing there, while trains coming from Shiv Vihar make a U-turn at Trilokpuri station. At 3pm on Friday, when it will be opened for public use by Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the Pink Line will become the longest operational line of Delhi Metro’s network. The corridor will overtake the 56.6-km Blue Line (Dwarka Sector 21-Noida Electronic City) in length. The Blue Line, however, has a separate 8.7-km segment connecting Yamuna Bank with Vaishali. When extended from Majlis Park to Maujpur in Phase IV, the Pink Line will become India’s longest corridor with an approximate length of 70km, also becoming in the process the country’s only metro ‘ring corridor’. A Delhi Metro Rail Corporation official said that at present, 30 trains run on the Majlis Park-Mayur Vihar I section and 13 trains on the Trilokpuri-Shiv Vihar segment, including standby. “After the integration of the missing link, these 43 trains will all run in the corridor. Detailed operation plans are being chalked out,” said a DMRC official. When fully operational, the corridor will connect north, west and south Delhi with eastern areas of Delhi. With Covid guidelines permitting only seated passengers at the moment, it isn’t possible to gauge the impact the opening of this section will have on ridership. DMRC said that with the corridor connected end to end, passengers will save time and money. For instance, those travelling from Gurgaon to Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake area or beyond will save 20 minutes because there will be only one interchange at Delhi Haat-INA instead of the two at present. Similarly, those travelling from Faridabad and south Delhi will also save 20 minutes while those coming from or going to Noida will have a 25-minute shorter journey. DMRC has also calculated a Rs 20 reduction in fare for the passenger when traveling to and from 38 sections, including locations like Lajpat Nagar, Noida City Centre, Botanical Garden, Mohan Estate to Trilokpuri or vice-versa. Similarly, there will a decrease in fare of Rs 10 in 524 sections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-closes-gap-in-longest-shortest-lines/articleshow/84988678.cms||Sidharatha Roy

With oxygen demand returning to normal levels, there is a surplus capacity now.The government recently issued an order that the concentrators can be used by even silicosis patients. They can take the machines to their homes by depositing a refundable Rs 5,000.Silicosis affects lungs and oxygen is a regular requirement for moderate to serious patients. Earlier, the patients used to spend Rs 1,000 per day for oxygen. Now they can take the concentrators to their homes free of cost from the district hospitals.“Silicosis impacts the lungs. That’s why we have specifically mentioned in the order that besides Covid patients, people suffering from silicosis also can use the concentrators which will be available at PHCs and CHCs. Patients can also tap oxygen banks in districts,” said Sidharth Mahajan, secretary, medical and health department.Silicosis is a poor man’s disease and a patient often struggles to pay for oxygen.“It will be a big relief for the labourers. They risk their lives to earn livelihoods. They cannot pay for oxygen regularly. We had been demanding for oxygen banks since 2017 and finally it has come,” Rana Sengupta of Mine Labour Protection Campaign (MLPC), which has been working for silicosis affected people.However, Sengupta said the government needs to look at creating a mechanism for medical rehabilitation of silicosis patients. “ASHA workers need to be trained and should be drafted into rehabilitation programme of the patients,” he added.Exposure to mining dust is a major cause for silicosis and it is not curable. Through medications and rehabilitation the patients’ lives can be prolonged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/a-silver-lining-for-silicosis-patients-in-2nd-wave-oxygen-crisis/articleshow/84988560.cms||---

Patil told TOI that there are some villages in the two talukas, which have a high infection rate when compared to the other parts of the rural district. He will instruct the officials of the police stations concerned to take preventive measures to stop the spread of Covid.After proper planning with the health department of Nashik Zilla Parishad, the measure will be put in place to control the infection rateHe said both Sinnar and Niphad are big market places of the district, from where vegetables are transported to other parts of the state and the country on a large scale. As a result, the flow of people in these talukas was constant. In addition to this, Sinnar has a large industrial area and people from across the district come here for work. All these have kept the Covid infection rate higher in these talukas.Hence, Patil has decided to conduct a review of villages, where the positivity rate is more, in order to come out with an action plan.Meanwhile, the Sinnar police and the health department has also decided to institutionally quarantine Covid patients in Sinnar taluka.Police inspector Santosh Mutkule of the Sinnar police station said though they are ensuring implementation of the Covid-related restrictions, including the weekend restrictions, they have now decided to work with the health department for institutional quarantine of Covid patients. The institutional quarantine of the patients will help prevent in further spread of the infection, which at times is not possible as home quarantined patients do not fully follow the Covid norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/sp-to-hold-covid-review-meeting-of-some-villages-in-niphad-sinnar/articleshow/84984087.cms||Santosh Sonawane

In order to ensure that medical colleges, district hospitals, primary health centres and other healthcare centres are fully equipped with resources like oxygen cylinders and medicines, the state health department teams are visiting the districts to check the preparedness in these institutions. In case any lack is found, these teams are updating the district collectors and is also taking requisite steps in case hospitals need anything from the department. The teams are visiting every district to check preparedness in the hospitals, medical colleges and other health institutions. “They are visiting the hospitals, medical colleges, primary health centres and other institutions to see the kind of infrastructure a particular district has for Covid management. After coming across anything lacking, they are updating about it to the district collector concerned and are also giving feedback to the health department in case any order is needed to be issued for strengthening the resources in the districts,” Sidharth Mahajan, secretary, medical and health told TOI on Friday.He added that these teams are working as a bridge between the department and administration to see that all the health institutions are well-equipped prior to the third wave. “Things like oxygen generation plants, life-saving medicines and injections and other resources would be added to the kitty of the districts prior to August 15,” Mahajan added.

---||Goa||Goa: Covid survivor gets kidney transplant||PANAJI: A Covid-19 survivor, who recently underwent a kidney transplant through laparoscopic nephrectomy, has resumed his job in the railways. The transplant was performed at Manipal Hospitals, Dona Paula, after the patient was diagnosed with diabetic kidney disease. Nephrologist Amol Mahaldar said that while the patient’s wife had consented to donate one of her kidneys, the transplant had to be deferred after the patient contracted Covid-19. He was managed with dialysis and constant monitoring while in home isolation. “We could perform the laparoscopic procedure only after he had recovered from Covid-19. The recipient went home 10 days after the surgery and has completed five months. He has even received vaccination against Covid-19 and has resumed work at the Konkan Railway Corporation,” Mahaldar said. International experts say laparoscopic nephrectomy donors require significantly shorter hospitalisation, experience less pain and are able to return to their normal routines sooner. They require lesser assistance during recuperation as against those who undergo open nephrectomy. Dr Deepak Dubey, chairperson of urology services across the Manipal Group, said Goan patients suffering from end-stage renal disease can avail of state-of-the-art facilities for renal transplants. “Laparoscopic harvesting of kidneys will save the donor from much pain and discomfort compared to the open operation. As it is, they are doing a noble act of donating their organ to a loved one. The process should therefore be conducted least painfully,” Dubey said. The surgical team comprised urologist Dr Madhav Sanzgiri, laparoscopic surgeon Dr Jagannath Kulkarni and cardiovascular surgeon Dr Rakesh Deshmane. Transplant anesthesia was managed by Dr Divya Mahaldar, Dr Savita Sanzgiri and Dr Yogesh Gawde along with Dr Dalia Bhandare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-survivor-gets-kidney-transplant/articleshow/84988641.cms||---

The girl was being harassed since June after which the girl’s mother lodged an FIR on July 17. However, cops are yet to trace the harasser who is still sending objectionable messages on personal numbers. In her complaint, the girl’s mother said her daughter was a member of a study group created by teachers for online classes. She said the number used by the harasser appeared to be of foreign origin. “My daughter is under stress and has lost focus on her studies. I complained to the school administration but it yielded no result,” the girl’s mother said in her complaint. The complainant said the caller had been threatening to kill her daughter and other family members. She said her daughter was a meritorious student and was honored by the district magistrate for her participation in social work in the past. “She is in a state of trauma and is afraid to go out of the house even for studies. We also sought help from the Women Power Line 1090 but to no avail. If children pursuing online classes will be harassed in such a manner, the very objective of the exercise will get defeated,” she said. ACP, Aliganj, Akhilesh Singh said ACP (cyber cell) Vivek Ranjan had been assigned the task to crack the case. “The girl and her family have also been provided security,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/intruder-sends-lewd-texts-to-class-8-girl-on-study-group/articleshow/84990570.cms||---

---||Kochi||Junior bicycle mayor sets an example||Thiruvananthapuram: After securing full marks in the higher secondary examination, Aparna Prabhakar, who is the state’s first junior bicycle mayor, is on cloud nine. Her victory is an inspiration to many students out there who detach themselves from extra-curricular activities, fearing that it would hamper their studies. Even when Aparna proved her mettle in various co-curricular activities, she never compromised on her studies. Though she had taken science stream for Plus Two, she has no plans to become a doctor, rather she wishes to enter the civil service. Even during the pandemic time and amidst her online classes, Aparna ensured that her interests are not sacrificed. She was one of the organizers of ‘Cycle Kaloltsavam’, a programme held online for the lovers of cycling. “At times, I was a little anxious whether she would completely digress from studies. But during the revision classes, I was happy with the response from her side. And after the model exam, I confirmed that she will secure 1,200 marks. We have been always proud of her feats,” said Chithra, Aparna’s class teacher. “She is more into co-curricular activities. But during exam time she works hard and makes sure that she is through with the entire text. So, this success is something we had anticipated much before,” says her father Prabha Ajanur. Aparna, a student of Government Higher Secondary School, Cotton Hill, was the leader of NSS in the school, and one of the RJs of ‘Cotton Hill Pink FM’. A great orator, Aparna took to cycling after attending one of the workshops by Green Army International of the city corporation. In 2020, when she was appointed the junior bicycle mayor of the city, Aparna became the first in the state and second in the country to hold that position. She has hosted many programmes on the KITE Victers channel. Her programme ‘Vidhyalayathileku in Victers channel has grabbed the attention of many, and in connection with ‘Pareekshayum Oru Padanam’, a programme broadcasted prior to the public exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/junior-bicycle-mayor-sets-an-example/articleshow/84986409.cms||---
---||Delhi||Stadium brawl: Sushil Kumar, 12 others charged with murder||NEW DELHI: Two-time Olympic medal winner Sushil Kumar has been named as the kingpin in the May 4 murder of wrestler Sagar Dhankad in the chargesheet filed by Delhi Police on Monday. Apart from Kumar, 12 others have also been chargesheeted. Of 20 accused, 15 have been arrested and five absconded. The main evidence against the Olympic wrestler is a one-minute video clip recovered from the mobile phone of co-accused Prince Dalal. It shows Kumar beating Dhankad with a heavy stick. The chargesheet, which runs into 170 pages, has listed 155 police witnesses. Kumar, charge with murder and kidnapping, has also been booked for robbery, having allegedly pointed his licensed pistol at a man at the murder site to relieve him of his mobile phone in order to prevent the video from falling into police hands. On May 4, Dhankad and four of his friends were allegedly thrashed and abducted from their residence in Model Town. The four friends, Jai Bhagwan alias Sonu (37), Bhagat Singh alias Bhagtu (28), Ravinder alias Bhinda (25) and Amit Kumar (27), are listed as witnesses in the chargesheet. It was Bhinda who had called the police control room to inform the cops about the incident. An ego clash was behind the crime, the chargesheet says. A police source said, “Initially, it was only a spat over Sushil Kumar’s house not being vacated by the victim and his friends who had rented it. Later, however, it turned into a turf battle for the control of Chhatrasal Stadium. The Olympian was miffed by talk at the stadium that he was frightened of Sagar and Jai Bhagwan. Kumar also believed that the duo was keeping an eye on him while some young wrestlers who were also friends with Dhankad were tracking his movements. Since Bhagwan has a criminal background, Kumar was worried that he could be targeted and, therefore, hatched a plan to intimidate his rivals. The reason the video was made was to send a message to the wrestling fraternity that no one should consider himself to be above Sushil Kumar.” Police investigation established that the victims were beaten for 30-40 minutes with staves, baseball bats and hockey sticks. Some of the assailants also waved firearms to threaten the victims. The gate of the stadium was locked from inside and the security guards were asked to leave their posts. The cause of Dhankad’s death, according to the post-mortem report, was “cerebral damage resulting from blunt force/object impact”. Five vehicles were seized from Kumar and his associates and a double-barrel gun was also recovered from one of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stadium-brawl-sushil-kumar-12-others-charged-with-murder/articleshow/84988745.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Is 8.5cr carcass plant the latest ‘white elephant’ that MC is nurturing?||Ludhiana: After long planning and wait, the carcass plant at Noorpur bet was constructed under smart city mission. But now, sources said the civic officials may not be able to operate the plant due to the resentment of the villagers, who had already stopped the inauguration of this plant. The villagers were invited to discuss the issue with experts, but nobody turned up for the meeting. Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, however, claimed that they will try to resolve the issue with the help of administration. The carcass plant was constructed to curb pollution in the Satluj by eliminating illegal hadda rodi on the banks. The municipal corporation (MC) had kept inauguration of carcass plant on July 13 and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu was supposed to inaugurate it, but when mayor Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal went there before inauguration ceremony, the villagers expressed their anger at the project, as they claimed when plant will be functional, dead animals will spread foul smell in the area. They claimed it will cause inconvenience to the villagers who live in the nearby villages. The officials tried to convince them by saying advance techniques will be used in the process, but protestors did not budge from there. Consequently, the authorities had to cancel the inauguration that day. When contacted, mayor Sandhu said, “We have fixed a meeting with those villagers but they did not come. The matter is sensitive so we cannot take any rash decision. We will involve the administration in this process and then some solution will be given.” According to MC officials, there is capacity to dispose off at least 150 dead animals (50 large and 100 small animals) at this plant. At first 20 animals were supposed to be taken here for skinning. The cost of this project is Rs 8.5 crore. The project has been hanging fire since 2013. Initially, due to lack of funds, officials could not move ahead with the project. It was taken up under smart city mission after National Green Tribunal (NGT) raised objection against illegal hadda rodi near the Satluj. The NGT had also imposed penalty on skinners, who were doing the skinning of animals at the banks of river. If the authorities could not make this plant operational, it would prove to be a big failure for the civic body. Already, the indoor stadium at Pakhowal Road and the modern slaughter house have failed to garner expected response and are proving to be a wastage of public funds. The carcass plant will be another addition to that list, if things are not settled soon with villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/is-8-5cr-carcass-plant-the-latest-white-elephant-that-mc-is-nurturing/articleshow/84988674.cms||---

A majority of the schools will have only offline classes, but some have also opted for a combination of the offline and the online mode. “Offline classes will be conducted on alternate days,” B Chandrashekhar, the president of the Private Unaided English Medium Schools Association, said. Chandrashekhar, who is also the chairman of the leading DBMS chain of educational institutions, said owing to insufficient staff strength, several schools were not preferring physical classes for senior students. “Government guidelines say that attendance in physical classes is not compulsory. Hence it is not obligatory on the part of parents to send their wards to the school,” Chandrashekhar said. He added that online classes for sudents till Class VII will be conducted as usual. “Necessary Covid-19 protocols will be put in place at the campuses ahead of the resumption of normal classes,” he added. Chandrashekhar said due to the limited capacity of the classrooms in several schools, it was not feasible to conduct physical classes of all the sections of Classes IX-XII at the same time. “Maximum 25 students could be accommodated in one room going by physical distancing norms,” he said. The principal of St Mary’s English School, Fr P Raj, said his school will hold online classes for students whose parents have declined to give them consent for attending physical classes. Schools like St Mary’s English School and J H Tarapore School, among others, have said that they have no problem if the administration used their school building for the vaccination drive as they have adequate infrastructure to hold classes. A father of a Class XII student of Vidya Bharati Chinmaya School, Telco, said he was not keen on sending his son for physical classes. “I am not prepared to send my child to school till there is a possibility of the third wave,” G K Ojha, a Govindpur resident, said.

The chief minister’s office on Sunday evening issued an order in this regard to the Jharcraft managing director. The order asked the managing director to initiate disciplinary and punitive action against the officials, who were found guilty of financial misconduct by the CAG and the anti-corruption bureau (ACB). “In the matter of irregularities in purchase of blankets by Jharcraft, the CM has given his consent for obtaining a final status report from the ACB and initiate disciplinary and punitive action,” the order reads. The blanket scam took place in 2017-18 when the then Raghubar Das government had decided to buy 10 lakh blankets from Jharcraft, a state-owned unit under the industries department, for distribution among the poor during winter. In 2016-17, Jharcraft had provided two lakh blankets to the labour department. In the course of its audit, the CAG found irregularities in the claims of Jharcraft and had recommended a vigilance inquiry. The state government under Hemant Soren handed over the investigation to ACB in January 2020. While placing the order with Jharcraft, the then government had said blankets meant for distribution would be woven by weavers’ committees and sakhi mandals, thus eliminating the necessary tender process. Obtaining the work order, Jharcraft, entered into an agreement with Panipat (Haryana) companies for the procurement of woollen yarn to be woven by local artisans. The blankets were supposed to be sent back to Panipat for a final retouch. Jharcraft had claimed to have purchased 19.93 lakh kg of woollen yarn, which was brought to Jharkhand by 144 trucks. It also claimed that the trucks made 320 round trips to ferry the yarn and getting the blankets retouched. The state government had paid Rs 14 crore to Jharcraft for the purpose. However, when the CAG cross-checked the details of trucks from toll plazas, it found that at least 318 trips were false and that around 18.81 lakh kg wool yarn was never brought to Jharkhand. The audit body also said the claim of three lakh blankets being woven by one sakhi mandal in one day was also unrealistic. After the CAG report, the then BJP government had directed Jharcraft to conduct an internal inquiry, based on which it submitted a detailed report on February 23, 2018. In the said report, officials of the National Handloom Development Corporation (NHD), those supplying yarn, transporters, the then deputy general manager Jharcraft, Nasim Akhtar, chief finance officer of Jharcraft Ashok Thakur, and chief executive officer, Jharkcraft, Renu Gopinath Pannikar were charged with irregularities and show caused. Soon after, committees were formed at district levels to investigate the matter but nothing concrete came out. After coming to power, the Soren government handed over the matter to ACB for a thorough investigation and has now allowed Jharcraft to take action against the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-grants-prosecution-sanction-in-18-blanket-scam/articleshow/84986300.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||OBC groups gear up for stir after Cong rakes up issue||Ranchi: A day after the Congress, a constituent of the ruling alliance here, demanded an increase in OBC reservation in the state from 14 to 27%, different OBC groups are gearing up to launch a campaign raising the same demand. Jharkhand OBC Arakshan Manch, a conglomeration of different outfits, has decided to hold a state-level conclave in Ranchi on August 22 to press their demand. But as a prelude to the event, the outfit will start outreach programmes from Tuesday onwards and submit a memorandum to different political parties and ministers in order to intensify the campaign. Talking to TOI after an emergent meeting on Monday, president of the outfit Kailash Yadav said that they have decided to send a delegation with a memorandum to meet two cabinet ministers of the state government on Tuesday. “In the morning, we will submit the memorandum to Alamgir Alam (rural development) and in the afternoon, we have got time to meet Rameshwar Oraon (finance). Thereafter, in a phased manner, we will reach out to the CM, leaders of JMM and all such parties who often spoke of OBC reservation during the elections. But of all, onus of increasing the reservation of OBCs to 27% lies with the Congress, JMM and RJD as they had promised to do so soon after coming to power,” he said. Yadav, however, criticized BJP, even though Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced reservation for the OBCs in medical and dental courses acouple of days ago. “In 2002, OBC reservation was slashed to 14% during Babulal Marandi’s rule owing to the faulty domicile policy. Since then, we are fighting for our existence, despite being about 70% of the total population of the state,” he said, adding that they are also demanding caste-based census in order to ascertain the actual numbers of OBCs. Asked about the 50% cap on reservation, he said, “The Hemant Soren-led government came to power with the promise to give 27% reservation to OBCs. It is up to him to keep his promise or else he must be ready to face protests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/obc-groups-gear-up-for-stir-after-cong-rakes-up-issue/articleshow/84986412.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Chief minister Hemant Soren also congratulated the team through a tweet. Before the match, Nikki’s elder sister, who is Ranchi, rang up her father Soma Pradhan and mother Jitan Devi to inform them about her sister’s big moment in Tokyo. Talking to TOI over the phone, Soma said, “I was not aware of match timing until some reporters rang me up seeking locations to my house to meet us. Later, my elder sister also informed me. Only then, we sat down to watch the game. We are so proud to see my Nikki making history right before our eyes and I remembered how she used to play with tree branches as I could not afford hockey sticks. To support her, I enrolled her at the Bariatu girls hockey centre in Ranchi and from there she didn’t look back.” He further said, “I am confident that Nikki will bring home a medal after watching the match. I am also sure that the men’s hockey team will also make our country proud. Both the teams played exceptionally well under pressure.” Nikki’s mother said he was tense throughout the match. “Nikki and other players fell on the ground several times. I was worried that they would be grievously hurt. But that’s the nature of the game,” Jitan said. Over 60km away in Simdega, the entire district got into a celebratory mood soon after the match ended. Budding and aspiring players, including the local people, rallied across different streets beating drums and ‘nagadas’. In Badkichapar, where the parents of Salima live, their house was so crowded with neighbours since morning to watch the match. Salima’s parents — Suleksan and Subhani Tete— said seeing their daughter play at the Olympics for the first time was a proud moment. “We now hope that the team returns with a medal,” said Sulekskan, adding that the entire team played well after losing initially. Unlike the parents of Nikki, who is representing India at the Olympics for the second time, Suleksan said, “We have been watching the matches regularly. But we had to hire a generator set as there was no power because of the heavy rain.” Manoj Konbegi, the president of Hockey Simdega, told TOI, “While Salima’s village suffered a blackout since yesterday (Sunday) due to the rain, her parents arranged generator to ensure that they don’t miss the game.” Simdega is considered the hockey cradle of Jharkhand and has produced several national and international hockey players. Her parents said she was passionate about the game since her childhood like other tribal girls. The celebratory rally included Salima’s first coach Pratima and Konbegi apart from several other people. Former Indian women senior team captain, Sumrai Tete, also from Simdega, said she has her fingers crossed, like billion others in the country, for a medal. “I am sure both men and women team will achieve a podium finish this Olympics.” Watch Watch: How two Jharkhand villages celebrated when Indian women's hockey team reached the semifinals||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/nikki-salima-villages-erupt-in-joy-as-team-scripts-oly-history/articleshow/84996906.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Ranchi||Rims docs carry out rare prosthetic op, reconstruct tibia||Ranchi: For 23-year-old Manjusha walking without experiencing pain in her leg seemed like a distant dream because for more than 10 years she was suffering from a bone tumour on her right tibia and for the last three months, she was almost bed-ridden from the pain. But on Friday, she was all smiles and back on her feet following a surgery at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), Ranchi where the doctors removed the tumour by performing a total knee mega prosthetic replacement operation. Initially, the Latehar resident had consulted a few private clinics in the district but it was all in vain. On June 26, she came to the state-run hospital where the doctors from the orthopaedics department, along with a few oncologists, decided to conduct the rare surgery in which a part of tibia was removed and the removed part of the bone was reconstructed with an external implant. The head of orthopaedics department, Dr L B Manjhi who led the team which performed the surgery, said: “It is a feat for our department as this is the first time that we have done a reconstruction surgery of tibia using an implant after removing a decade-old tumour.” Dr Saubhik Das, who is the assistant professor at the orthopaedics department, said: “The patient was experiencing pain while walking. After an initial diagnosis, we discovered a local aggressive tumour, which is also called as pathological fracture of tibia near knee joint on her right leg.” But the doctors had to wait for the implant as it is costly and it was procured with the help of Latehar MLA Baijnath Ram, who provided the patient with Rs 1.5 lakh. Manjusha said: “I had never imagined that I will be walking again without pain and I am indebted to the doctors who made it possible. I am also thankful to our local MLA who readily accepted my family’s request and provided us the money.” Manjusha is currently pursuing MA from Kartik Oraon College in Gumla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rims-docs-carry-out-rare-prosthetic-op-reconstruct-tibia/articleshow/84986410.cms||Gaurav Pandey
