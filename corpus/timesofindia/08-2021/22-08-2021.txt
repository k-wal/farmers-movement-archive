---||Kolkata||#DurgaPuja2021: Neeraj Chopra to dominate lighting||With less than two months to go for Durga Puja, preparations for idols, pandals and lights are on in full swing. While the pandemic and Sushant Singh Rajput dominated Puja themes last year, this time the focus will be on the recently concluded Tokyo Olympics, especially the man who won a gold medal for India – Neeraj Chopra (picture below). “Tokyo Olympics will be a major theme for the puja at Sreebhumi this year. In terms of lighting, we are showing a javelin throw, which is a tribute to Neeraj Chopra. Apart from that, the lighting will have a lot of gymnastics too,” said Babu Pal, a veteran light artist from Chandannagar. The light designs are being sketched now and they will start making it next month onwards. “Apart from lights depicting topics of current affairs like COVID fighters, masks, sanitisers and social distancing, there will be something on fire brigades and helicopters too. Lights at other Pujas will mostly be on the ‘no mask, no entry’ policy and other usual designs like animal faces,” he added. Sujit Bose from the Sreebhumi Puja committee said that apart from lights themed on Olympics, there are many other surprises in store for pandal hoppers. “The pandal will be modelled on Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, the idol will be a traditional one with gold ornaments. Other than javelin throw, we will include other sports from the Tokyo Olympics too. So many sportspersons made us proud this time, and we will celebrate their success with these lights,” he said. Olympics beats CovidNot just Sreebhumi, the Bidyalankar Puja Committee in Chandannagar has also decided to put the spotlight on the javelin thrower. Ashim Kumar Dey, a light artist from Chandannagar, is working on it. “Last year the focus was on all things COVID plus Sushant Singh Rajput. But this year the Tokyo Olympics will be the highlight,” he said, adding light designs on the Olympics logo are also being prepared. Meanwhile, Baruipur Chanditala Puja Committee is focusing on various activities by the Indian defence forces. Kashinath Das, another light artist from Chandannagar, informed the Sarbariea Durga Puja Committee in south 24 Parganas is getting lights themed on javelin throw too. “There will be a big cut-out of Neeraj Chopra with the Olympics logo and a message saying – ‘you made our country proud’. Other puja committees are keeping it simple. They still want lights on COVID awareness as the pandemic is not over yet,” said Das. Tapan Ghosh, a light artist from Chandannagar, has started getting queries for Olympics lighting. “Members from Chorbagan Sarbojonin in Girish Park and Jodhpur Park Durga Puja have approached me to make Tokyo Olympics the central theme of their lighting. Javelin throw will be there for sure, but I am still thinking of what more can be added to it,” said Ghosh. A low-key pujaHowever, most Pujas in the city will continue to keep it a low-key affair after the pandemic hit their budgets and in turn, grandeur last year. Debasish Kumar from Tridhara Akal Bodhon said, “There will be no splendour in terms of lighting, idol and pandal. We will only perform the puja rituals with minimal fanfare.” Similarly, Ekdalia Evergreen Club will organise a simple Puja. “Our jharbati inside the pandal is our USP. So, we will follow that. Apart from that, our idol will be a traditional one and the pandal will be simple,” said Goutam Mukherjee from the puja committee. However, a few pujas are experimenting with the idols despite low budgets. Swarup Biswas from Suruchi Sangha said, “We have a limited budget this time and 50% of it will be used for social services in and around Kolkata. Nevertheless, like previous years, this year too we are looking at an innovative idol of Ma Durga, but the pandal and lighting will be simpler.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/durgapuja2021-neeraj-chopra-to-dominate-lighting/articleshow/85522002.cms||Ruman Ganguly

The project, set up under the Flexibilisation Scheme notified by the Centre in 2018, will not only help power around 7,000 households but will also prevent 46,000 tonnes of CO2 emission annually. Set up at an investment of Rs 110 crore, it has 1,10,000 solar photovoltaic panels floating on 75 acres with a 165-acre reservoir. The installation has a unique anchoring design with the solar PV panels sitting atop floaters tied with the help of marine ropes to the edges of the reservoir. NTPC officials say it is considered to be a rare engineering feat due to the challenges faced during the design and implementation of the anchoring and mooring system. Project will save waterThe project was executed by BHEL on an EPC basis in three phases. While the first phase saw 5MW being commissioned in March 2021, another 5MW was added and the 10MW project became commercially operational in end of June 2021.The remaining 15MW was commissioned on Saturday, marking the successful completion of the 25MW floating project that takes NTPC’s total commercial capacity to 65,850 MW and installed capacity to 66,900 MW. The unique project is also expected to help save around 1,364 million litres of water per annum by preventing evaporation of water from the reservoir, which would be enough to meet the annual water requirements of around 6,700 households. The 2,000 MW coal-fired Simhadri power station was the first power project to implement an open sea intake from the Bay of Bengal when it was commissioned two decades ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ntpc-commissions-indias-largest-floating-solar-power-project-at-vizag/articleshow/85521511.cms||---

The vigilance and security wing of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) had lodged the complaint with the police on the existence of fake TTD websites that have been cheating gullible devotees. The vigilance wing also complained to the police about touts coming with fake recommendation letters to get accommodation and darshan. Following the complaint, the Tirumala police swung into action and arrested 16 touts on the charge of forging recommendation letters of VVIPs to obtain darshan tickets. According to TTD’s chief vigilance and security officer (CVSO) Gopinath Jatti, the vigilance wing of the temple body has prepared a list of middlemen, who have been frequently resorting to various fraudulent means to make a quick buck. They are also involved in black marketing of the most sought-after darshan tickets. “While some of the middlemen forge letters of elected representatives, some travel operators and fake websites generate fake darshan tickets,” the CVSO said. The TTD urged the devotees not to fall prey to middlemen or try to book darshan tickets on fake websites.  TTD’s official website is www.tirupatibalaji.gov.in. TTD finds 27 fake websitesAccording to TTD sources, touts regularly resort to fake recommendation letters of VIPs as most of the politicians do not come forward to lodge complaints with the police. Many VIPs prefer not to lodge complaints even after the police bring cases of fake letters to their notice, sources said. A senior police official said as no VIP comes forward to lodge a formal complaint, the police would investigage such cases suo moto and arrest the touts. “This is a major roadblock in the investigation,” he said. TTD set up a cyber security and social media monitoring cell, which keeps a constant watch on fake websites and touts selling darshan tickets online. TTD has updated its software with search engine optimization. This brings the TTDwebsite to the top of the search results. As many as 27 fake websites have been identified and action would be taken against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/tirumala-police-arrest-16-touts-for-fake-darshan-letters/articleshow/85521482.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

After they proceeded onwards, they were said to be still trying to enter the airport on Saturday evening due to the chaotic conditions there. Swirling and sometimes violent crowds, as well as sporadic firing, have made it difficult for people to enter the airport, especially the technical area. US forces are in control of the airport and managing the global evacuation process currently under way. One IAF aircraft which landed in Kabul picked up 85 Indians who had managed to get inside the airport between Friday and Saturday. They were airlifted to Dushanbe in Tajikistan from where they will be brought back by civilian flights. Meanwhile, a C-17 aircraft is also parked in Dushanbe waiting for enough passengers to be picked up from Kabul. Earlier on Saturday, reports emerged that the Taliban may have abducted Indians which created some apprehensions in New Delhi. It turned out that they were taken to a nearby police station and documents were verified. A spokesperson for the Taliban denied reports that they had abducted Indians after several news outlets began tweeting. However, sources said Afghan nationals - even Hindus and Sikhs - were finding it more difficult to board evacuation flights to India. Some 200 Sikhs and Hindus are sheltering at a gurudwara in Kabul, and are said to be safe. The Indian government is trying to help with the evacuation process by first registering Indians who are in Afghanistan and willing to return to India, then helping them to get to the airport. The difficulties are outside the airport. Crowds are surging and making it difficult to enter the airport, particularly from where flights are taking off. After the first couple of days when Afghans overran the tarmac, US troops have kept a strict eye on things, making it possible for other countries to evacuate their own nationals out of Kabul. The government has said they are currently focused on getting Indian nationals out of Afghanistan. The C-130J aircraft that reached Dushanbe took off from the Hindon airbase near Delhi late on Friday night with some Indian officials to coordinate with the US and other military forces controlling the Kabul airport, which continues to be swamped by thousands of people desperate to flee Afghanistan. "The Indian officials will now be stationed at Kabul airport to liaise with the different authorities there. The C-130J then picked up over 80 Indians who had managed to enter the airport before its gates were closed on Friday evening due to the huge crowds and deteriorating situation there," said a source. The C-130J and another C-17 Globemaster-III of the IAF are stationed at Tajikistan, which shares a 1,400-km border with Afghanistan, and will be "launched" for Kabul as and when Indian nationals manage to enter the airport and time slots are available. Read AlsoWhy Afghanistan's economic distress may be Taliban’s biggest challengeThe Taliban might have siezed Afghanistan but a hefty task lies ahead of them -- managing a fragile and dependent economy and gaining access to the country's money."It's not possible to park the IAF aircraft at the Kabul airport due to the huge rush of planes landing and taking off from there. Additional IAF aircraft are also on standby in India," said the source. With the Taliban setting up checkpoints all along the way and utter bedlam prevailing at the Kabul airport, leading to the closure of the gates and restricted entry, it has become extremely difficult for people to actually board planes. Read AlsoWho is Haibatullah Akhundzada, the shadowy head of the Taliban?Everyone is talking about Abdul Ghani Baradar, the political leader of the Taliban, released by the US just a few years ago. But behind him is the religious head of the Taliban, the man most likely to be calling the shots in a government that will be run on strict Islamic tenetsTwo C-17 aircraft of the IAF had earlier brought back around 200 people, including the entire staff of the Indian embassy at Kabul, to India on August 16 and 17. The C-17 aircraft had flown from the Hindon airbase, taken a circuitous route through Iranian airspace to avoid Pakistan and touched down at the Ayni airbase in Tajikistan for "parking" before coordinating with the US forces to land at the chaotic Kabul airport and then finally taking off for India.

"Talks for an interim government have been going on between the insurgents and Afghan politicians led by former president Hamid Karzai and former foreign minister and Afghanistan chief executive Abdullah Abdullah since the fall of Kabul after lightning advances by Taliban fighters a few days ago. The negotiations are going on right now," Ahmadullah Waseq, deputy of the Taliban's cultural affairs committee, was quoted as saying. In Kabul, Taliban sources said, Baradar would meet jihadi leaders and other politicians ahead of meeting Karzai and Abdullah. Baradar is the only surviving Taliban leader to have been personally appointed deputy by the slain Taliban chief Mullah Omar. According to Taliban sources, an announcement about the new government would be made after August 31 following the expiry of the deadline for a pullout of American troops from Afghanistan. Without a functional government in Afghanistan for a week, uncertainty prevails in Kabul. Desperate people are trying to flee the country while many remain trapped in their homes hoping for a miracle. The scene at Kabul airport is chaotic and there are growing fears of a return to the repressive 1996-2001 regime of the Taliban. Banks and government departments have been shut for seven days in a row and people in Kabul and in other cities are facing a shortage of funds and food. Baradar had arrived in Kandahar from Qatar last week. Within hours of his return, the Taliban announced its rule would be "different" this time. He had been appointed head of the Taliban's political office in Doha after his release from a Karachi prison in 2018. Last year, he had struck a peace agreement with the Trump administration, paving the way for a US troop pullout from Afghanistan. The Taliban's supreme leader, Maulvi Haibatullah Akhunzada, is believed to be hiding in Pakistan and only releases occasional statements. Baradar's arrival in Kabul came as Western countries raced to evacuate diplomats from Kabul amid chaotic scenes at the airport. In its advisory on its website, the US embassy in Afghanistan warned on Saturday of "potential security threats outside the gates" of the airport. Barardar's entry into Kabul was preceded by meetings of other senior Taliban leaders, including Khalil Haqqani and his nephew Anas Haqqani, with Afghan politicians. Khalil, with a $5 million US bounty on his head, was pictured among crowds in the Afghan capital on Friday, flanked by armed men dressed in military uniforms. He had also addressed worshippers and led Friday prayers in Kabul while holding a gun. Earlier this week, Abdullah Abdullah had posted photos of Karzai and himself meeting Haqqani and his Taliban delegation. Khalil Haqqani is the brother of Jalaluddin Haqqani, founder of the Haqqani network and the uncle of the Taliban's deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani. The Haqqani network has been credited with some of the most violent attacks against US, Nato and Afghan forces in recent years. Pro-Taliban social media feeds showed that Khalil Haqqani had also met Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a warlord and influential figure in Afghan politics leading the Hizb-e-Islami party. Hekmatyar has been known as the "Butcher of Kabul" for his brutal massacres and destruction in Kabul during civil war of the early 1990s. The Taliban claim they are seeking to form an "inclusive, Islamic" government despite reports of atrocities carried out across the country. In recent days, former government officials spoke of hiding from the militants as gunmen went from door to door. While the Taliban have broadly announced the parameters of their new government, it is unclear what kind of system they are going to introduce in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-co-founder-abdul-ghani-baradar-in-kabul-to-hammer-out-govt/articleshow/85525833.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Bumbling through a White House press conference on Friday, Biden claimed that the US mission in Afghanistan was essentially over since Osama bin Laden had been killed and al-Qaida was "gone" from the country, but Pentagon officials said soon after that al-Qaida, as well as Islamic State, remain a presence in Afghanistan. Administration officials later finessed the president's remarks saying he meant al-Qaida had been degraded to the point where it no longer presented a threat to the homeland, but critics pilloried the president for a verbal overreach to justify the hasty US withdrawal. Biden also suggested that Americans stranded in Afghanistan could get to the Kabul airport for evacuation without much difficulty and Taliban were being cooperative, but ground reports spoke of a hurdles on this front with sporadic attacks on Americans trying to reach the airport. Panic rose on Saturday, as gates to the Kabul airport were closed off and the US embassy warned US citizens to stay away from the airport, citing "potential security threats outside the gates". US officials said the most serious current threat is that Afghanistan's Islamic State branch would attempt an attack that would both hurt the Americans and damage the Taliban's sense of control. But it was unclear how capable IS, which has battled the Taliban, is of such an attack, the officials said. The alert instructed Americans still marooned in Kabul not to travel to the airport "unless you receive individual instructions from a US representative to do so".

"We made clear to the Taliban that any attack, any attack on our forces or disruption of our operations at the airport will be met with a swift and forceful response. We're also keeping a close watch on any potential terrorist threat," he said.

---||World||Official Taliban sites go offline, though reasons unknown so far||Taliban websites that delivered the victorious insurgents' official messages to Afghans and the world at large in five languages went offline abruptly on Friday, indicating an effort to try to squelch them. It is not immediately clear, though, why the sites in the Pashto, Urdu, Arabic, English and Dari languages went offline. They had been shielded by Cloudflare, a US-based content delivery network and denial-of-service protection provider. Cloudflare has not responded to requests for comment. The Cloudflare shield prevents public from knowing who hosts the sites. Also Friday, WhatsApp removed a number of Taliban groups, according to Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks online extremism. The websites' disappearance may just be temporary as the Taliban secures new hosting arrangements. But the reported removal of the WhatsApp groups followed the banning of Taliban accounts by Facebook, the service's parent company, on Tuesday after the US-backed Afghan government fell to the Taliban. WhatsApp spokesperson Danielle Meister did not confirm the removal but referred to a statement the firm issued this week saying it was "obligated to adhere to US sanctions laws. This includes banning accounts of the Taliban." Katz said she hoped the removal of Taliban sites is just a first step to diminishing its online presence. "Today's Taliban is immensely media savvy and its online infrastructure "mobilises" al-Qaida and other extremist factions," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/official-taliban-sites-go-offline-though-reasons-unknown-so-far/articleshow/85526287.cms||---

This is the first 'fatwa' issued by the Taliban after its swift takeover of Afghanistan last week. On Tuesday, Zabihullah Mujahid, Taliban spokesman in his first-ever public appearance to address those concerns at a news conference, promised the Taliban would honour women's rights within the norms of Islamic law, in an effort to portray a more moderate stance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-ban-co-education-in-herat-report/articleshow/85526345.cms||---

Defence minister General Bismillah Mohammadi, who has vowed to resist the Taliban, said in a tweet that the districts of Deh Saleh, Bano and Pul-Hesar in the province of Baghlan to the north of Panjshir had been taken. It was not immediately clear what forces were involved but the incident adds to scattered indications of opposition to the Taliban. TV station Tolo News quoted a police commander who said Bano district in Baghlan was under the control of local militia forces and said there had been heavy casualties. The Taliban have not commented on the incident. Afghan vice-president Amrullah Saleh, who says he is the country's rightful president after Ashraf Ghani's escape, and Ahmad Massoud, son of former anti-Soviet Mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, have vowed to resist the Taliban from Panjshir, which repelled both Soviet forces and the Taliban in the 1980s and 1990s.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/anti-taliban-forces-say-theyve-taken-3-districts-in-afghanistans-north/articleshow/85526378.cms||---

Suddenly, the mass of outstretched hands produced a baby, no more than a few months old, and held the child up for the soldiers to see. As if handling a piece of luggage, a Marine plucked the infant by a single arm, passing the child behind him before turning back to the crowd. The scene is harrowing to watch, fuelling anger at a haphazard evacuation process. By Friday, the US military was eager to share that the infant had been safely reunited with a family member. "The baby seen in the video was taken to a medical treatment facility on site and cared for by medical professionals," Major James Stenger, a spokesman for the Marines, wrote in an email. "I can confirm the baby was reunited with their father and is safe at the airport." Stenger did not provide additional details, including how many kids had been taken to similar facilities in recent days. But he sent a series of photos showing Marines playing with children at military checkpoints. The quick resolution to a heart-wrenching photo belied a chaotic and rapidly unfolding scene in which multiple children were placed into the care of US troops in last-ditch bid to get them to freedom.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/baby-passed-over-airport-wall-reunited-with-kin/articleshow/85526410.cms||---
---||World||Afghanistan faces economic shock as sanctions replace aid||As the Taliban attempt the precarious shift from insurgent movement to functioning government, Afghanistan is facing the heightened risk of a financial collapse after being propped up for the past two decades by foreign aid that now accounts for nearly half its legal economy. The fate of the Afghan economy will be determined by decisions that the Biden administration and other countries must make on whether to recognize the Taliban as a legitimate government. In the meantime, the United States and the international community are already shutting the flow of money, leaving Afghanistan in the stranglehold of sanctions that were designed to cut the Taliban off from the global financial system. Analysts say the looming shock threatens to amplify a humanitarian crisis in a country that has already endured years of war. Signs of strain were evident this week as the value of Afghanistan's currency, the afghani, plunged to record lows; and the nation's most recent central bank governor, Ajmal Ahmady, warned that inflation would likely send food prices soaring. The United States, which has poured about $1 trillion into Afghanistan over 20 years, moved to block the Taliban's access to Afghanistan's $9.4 billion in international reserves. And the International Monetary Fund suspended plans to distribute more than $400 million in emergency reserves to the country. "In the short term, it's potentially catastrophic," said Justin Sandefur, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. "You're looking at the possibility of the currency collapsing and a financial crisis that could inflict real pain on normal people." Afghanistan's economy was facing severe challenges, and international support was starting to wane, even before the Taliban takeover. The drawdown over the last year of U.S. forces and government contractors that contributed to Afghanistan's tax base sapped revenue when the country, like much of the world, was coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The Congressional Research Service noted this year that 90% of Afghanistan's population lived on less than $2 a day and warned that the loss of U.S. support would weaken one of the world's smallest economies. In late 2020, foreign donors meeting in Geneva pledged $12 billion in aid to Afghanistan over the next four years, a 20% decline from the previous four years. Some of the aid agencies based new conditions for the money on human rights advances and progress with peace talks between the government and the Taliban.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghanistan-faces-economic-shock-as-sanctions-replace-aid/articleshow/85526426.cms||---
---||World||Up security: China to Pakistan after attack on nationals||ISLAMABAD: China on Saturday asked Pakistan to take effective measures and overhaul the security mechanism to forestall attacks on its nationals working on various infrastructure projects after a suicide bomber attacked a convoy of Chinese nationals in the restive Balochistan province, in the second such attack in over a month. The Chinese embassy in Islamabad strongly condemned Friday's attack on the convoy of Chinese nationals comprising four Chinese vehicles with integral security details of Pakistan army and police contingent. In the attack, two kids were killed while one Chinese national was among several others who sustained injuries. The embassy said that it launched the emergency plan immediately, "demanding Pakistan to properly treat the wounded, conduct a thorough investigation on the attack, and severely punish the perpetrators".

---||World||Up security: China to Pakistan after attack on nationals||ISLAMABAD: China on Saturday asked Pakistan to take effective measures and overhaul the security mechanism to forestall attacks on its nationals working on various infrastructure projects after a suicide bomber attacked a convoy of Chinese nationals in the restive Balochistan province, in the second such attack in over a month. The Chinese embassy in Islamabad strongly condemned Friday's attack on the convoy of Chinese nationals comprising four Chinese vehicles with integral security details of Pakistan army and police contingent. In the attack, two kids were killed while one Chinese national was among several others who sustained injuries. The embassy said that it launched the emergency plan immediately, "demanding Pakistan to properly treat the wounded, conduct a thorough investigation on the attack, and severely punish the perpetrators". "At the same time, relevant departments at all levels in Pakistan must take effective measures to implement strengthened security measures and upgraded security cooperation mechanisms to ensure that similar incidents will not happen again," it said.

Regulators were working to finish the process by Friday but were still working through a substantial amount of paperwork and talks with the firm. The people familiar with the planning cautioned that the approval might slide beyond Monday if some components of the review need more time. An FDA spokeswoman did not comment. The agency had earlier set an unofficial deadline for approval of September 6. The approval is expected to pave the way for a series of vaccination requirements by public and private organisations who were awaiting final regulatory action before implementing mandates. Officials are also hoping that an approved shot will draw interest from people who have been hesitant to take one, a phenomenon suggested by recent polling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-food-and-drug-administration-to-give-pfizer-vaccine-full-approval-next-week/articleshow/85526577.cms||---

The Madras high court has come out with a formula that pegs monetary compensation to the state at Rs 5,600 crore. Till 1962, Tamil Nadu had 41 Lok Sabha members. The number got reduced to 39 ahead of the 1967 general polls because the state had successfully controlled its population growth by then. Juxtaposing this supposed anomaly with the dramatic no-confidence motion in 1999 that resulted in the toppling of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government by one vote, the division bench said Tamil Nadu should be compensated either monetarily or through additional representation in Rajya Sabha. "When one MP vote itself was capable of toppling a government, it is very shocking that Tamil Nadu lost two MPs because of successful implementation of birth control in the state," the bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice B Pugalendhi said. "Notionally, the contribution of an MP in five years could be taken as Rs 200 crore, though it cannot be determined monetarily. Therefore, for every election since 1967, Tamil Nadu has to be compensated Rs 400 crore for reduction of two MP seats, which amounts to Rs 5600 crore," the bench said. Asking the Union government why TN's Lok Sabha representation couldn't be restored to 41 from the next general elections, the bench also suo motu impleaded 10 top political parties, including DMK and main opposition AIA-DMK, besides Congress and BJP, to offer their responses. The court was hearing a PIL seeking de-reservation of Tenkasi parliamentary constituency, which has rema-ined a reserved constituency for more than half a century now. "Those states which failed to implement the birth-control programmes benefited with more political representatives in the Parliament while, states, especially Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, which successfully implemented birth-control programmes, stood to lose two seats in Parliament," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/for-tamil-nadu-loss-of-2-lok-sabha-seats-in-60s-hc-moots-5600cr-in-damages/articleshow/85526680.cms||Srikkanth D

The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the trans man before the HC's Madurai bench seeking to set the woman at liberty. The court observed that when it inquired with the petitioner and the woman, both stated that they had been in a relationship for more than three years. Taking into consideration that the woman was a major and willing to go with the petitioner of her own volition, the court set her at liberty and permitted her to go along with the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/madras-hc-allows-trans-man-to-reunite-with-woman-in-dads-custody/articleshow/85526966.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||India||Air India Express ousts 'Sir' from cockpit, brings in 'Captain'||MUMBAI: In a bid to rejig the power gradient in the cockpit, Air India Express has instructed its first officers to address the pilot-in-command not as 'Sir', but by their first name or simply as "Captain''. The operations circular issued on Friday referred to the October 2018 Trichy accident in which an Air India Express aircraft had a tail strike, then hit a ground-based navigation aid and finally took down the upper portion of the airport boundary wall before it took off for Dubai. The eventful take-off left the aircraft with a fissured underbelly. According to the final investigation report released last month by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, the trigger was a sudden and unexpected reclining of commander's seat during the take off roll. As the seat reclined, the commander inadvertently pulled back the thrust lever, reducing the power on the engines. Both the pilots did not register the fall in thrust and take corrective action, said the report, deeming it a breakdown of crew co-ordination - essentially, communication failure between the pilots. "It is proposed that in order to improve cockpit resource management (communication process in multi-crew cockpit) and reduce trans-cockpit-authority-gradient, a more informal cockpit environment is required. This may be a generational and culture shift and may take time to reap results," said the Air India Express circular which issued the instruction that PICs be either called by their first name or "Captain". Capt Amit Singh, an airsafety expert said: "In Indian culture, calling a senior by the first name doesn't go down well generally, especially in organisations like Air India Express. A 55-year old ex-IAF commander, would not like a 25-year old co-pilot to address him by his first name. That's a huge leap. But calling the PIC 'Capt' would work. The whole organisation culture has to change. You can't ask co-pilots to not use 'Sir' in the cockpit and expect them to use it in office environment."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/air-india-express-ousts-sir-from-cockpit-brings-in-captain/articleshow/85527035.cms||---

Rawat, who is heading the state election campaign committee for 2022, said, "They (BJP) have reduced Hindus to a mere vote bank. I am not going to allow this. We are followers of Sanatan Dharm, which preaches harmony and peace among people and religions. BJP, however, is more inclined towards creating differences among people in the name of religion and caste." Rawat, back from his successful mediation in the messy tuff battle in Punjab between Capt Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu, said, "Before beginning any auspicious work, Lord Ganesh is remembered and worshipped which is why we have selected this slogan. 'Shri Ganesh' is a reference to a new beginning and Lord Ganesh is known as Vighnaharta (the destroyer of all obstacles)." Earlier, Rawat had said that if voted to power, Congress would restart welfare policies launched during his previous tenure. "We have decided to give a subsidy amount of Rs 200 on LPG cylinders to women and double the pension for widows. Our focus will be to create job opportunities and strengthen the state's infrastructure," he said. The party has announced a 'parivartan yatra' from September 3, which will be conducted in four phases starting from Khatima, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami's home turf.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-seeks-help-of-ganesh-to-counter-bjps-hindutva/articleshow/85527218.cms||Kautilya Singh

IGP Kashmir Vijay Kumar identified slain Wakeel Ahmad Shah from Tral as the mastermind of multiple attacks on security forces and civilians whom Pakistan-backed Jaish suspected to be police informers. After killing Tral municipal committee chairperson Pandita in Pulwama last June, he led the brazen strike in which special police officer Fayaz Ahmad, his wife and daughter were shot dead at their Hariparigam home, the IGP said. Shah is also known to have had a hand in the killing of Tral residents Shabir Ahmad Bhat, Mohd Ayoub Ahanger and Shakeela Begum. The operation in which the Jaish terrorist and two unidentified accomplices were killed was launched on Friday after the Army’s 42 Rashtriya Rifles received intelligence inputs about the outfit’s presence in the upper reaches of the forest area in Tral’s Nagaberan Dhoka. A J&K police team joined the Army in the cordon-and-search exercise. “Today (Saturday) morning, there was a gunfight with three terrorists, all of whom were killed,” said Victor Force commanding officer Maj Gen Rashim Bali, who was with the IGP at the joint press conference in Awantipora. “The trio had been active in south Kashmir for a long time,” Maj Gen Bali said. Two AK-47 rifles, an SLR, a grenade launcher and some magazines were found on the slain ultras. IGP Kumar said security forces were going all out to not only track terrorists active in the Valley but also thwart possible infiltration attempts from across the India-Pakistan border, including by Taliban elements. He said the killers of Apni Party functionary Ghulam Rasool Lone would either be arrested or eliminated soon. On how security forces planned to tackle the situation in the event of the Taliban making inroads into Kashmir, Kumar said the police had activated human and technical intelligence to detect any such infiltration attempt. “If at all any such thing happens, I, as a police officer, assure the people that J&K police, the Army and other security forces will deal with the challenge professionally,” he said. The terrorists killed in Bandipora recently had apparently infiltrated the Valley earlier this year. “After carrying out terror attacks on civilians and political functionaries, the perpetrators are usually holed up in the woods. We will not just track terrorists in the hinterland but in the forests, too,” the IGP said. Asked about the resurgence of political killings in J&K, Kumar said it wasn’t for the first time that terrorists were targeting politicians. “Netas have been under attack since 1989. We can’t provide security to all, but those vulnerable and facing threats must approach us and we will provide them security cover,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-netas-killer-among-jaish-trio-slain-in-pulwama-encounter/articleshow/85527247.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Mehbooba Mufti demands restoration of Jammu &Kashmir’s special status||SRINAGAR: Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday demanded restoration of special status of J&K for “peace in the subcontinent”. She was addressing a public rally in the southern district of Kulgam. Mehbooba said for everlasting peace in Kashmir, Government of India must restore the special status of J&K, which they snatched illegally on August 5, 2019, by nullifying Article 370 and scrapping Article 35A. She also demanded that the Centre must resolve the Kashmir issue through dialogue. Meanwhile, People’s Conference (PC) chairman Sajad Lone lashed out at regional party heads for evading demand for restoration of Article 370 during a virtual all-party meet of 19 opposition parties on Friday, which was chaired by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. PC was not part of the all-party meet. Sajad asserted that the silence of the 19 parties on Articles 370 and 35A is tantamount to an “endorsement of abrogation” of the same. “The meeting of 19 opposition parties by selectively parroting the demand for statehood (of J&K) and criminal silence on Articles 370 & 35A has endorsed the revocation of special status of J&K. In a statement issued after the meeting, there was no mention of repealing the decisions taken by the BJP government on August 5th 2019 (sic),” Sajad said in a statement. He maintained that the opposition has buried the people’s demand for bringing back Articles 370 and 35A, and the domicile rights of J&K. “Two senior leaders Farooq Abdullah of NC and Mehbooba Mufti attended the meeting. They failed to convince the opposition parties to put restoration of Articles 370 and 35A, and domicile rights on their agenda. Why did these senior leaders attend the meeting when they could not persuade the opposition parties about the demands put forward in the Gupkar Declaration,” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mehbooba-mufti-demands-restoration-of-jammu-kashmirs-special-status/articleshow/85527267.cms||M Saleem Pandit

On Friday, the regulator put on hold the processing of papers relating to the company’s listing plans. On its website, it was marked “Issuance of observations kept in abeyance,” but did not mention any reason for the same. The company, which owns popular FMCG brand Fortune, had filed its offer document with Sebi on August 3 and is planning to raise Rs 4,500 crore. Usually, the regulator takes such a step when a group company is under investigation by the regulator or it receives any letter from any other regulator. A couple of months ago, Sebi told the Lok Sabha that it was investigating investments by some Mauritius-based foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) into six Adani group entities. Last month Sebi had also put on hold processing of two other IPOs: One by Aditya Birla Mutual Fund and the other by GoAir. In both the cases Sebi was investigating group companies of these two entities. Since then, the IPO document of the fund house has been cleared while that of the airline is still on hold. “We have not received any formal communication from Sebi with respect to the IPO observations being kept in abeyance,” a spokesperson for the group said. Relating to the investigations about the FPIs with investments in Adani group, it said that the group had “no connection with the FPIs, either directly or indirectly.” “FPIs are investors like other investors/shareholders in Adani group and act independently having no relationship with Adani group.” The spokesperson said that the group had been fully comliant with Sebi regulations and in future also will continue to cooperate with the regulator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-message-from-sebi-on-wilmar-ipo-adani-group/articleshow/85522847.cms||---

Responding to a media query on the problem of waterlogging in urban areas at Mohiuddinnagar (Samastipur), the CM said there was a huge problem of waterlogging in certain parts of the state capital in 2019. “After that I called a meeting of senior officials and prepared a rule for all urban areas.

Such a rainfall forecast is for the next three days. Fortunately, the water carrying capacity of the Ganga in its upper reaches has increased, as the water level was 3.09 metres below the danger level at Buxar, as well as 72cm below the red mark at Digha and just 5cm above the danger mark at Gandhi Ghat at Patna. Also, the water level fell further on Saturday at Hathidah, Munger, Bhagalpur, Kahalgaon and even at Farakka. Barring Munger, the Ganga was flowing 71cm above the danger level at Hathidah, 59cm at Bhagalpur and 1.32 metres at Kahalgaon. All along the downstream, there was a falling trend and the level will fall further substantially on Sunday, the Central Water Commission bulletin said. However, the campus of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University and its various colleges had waist-deep water, while the flood situation in northern and southern Bhagalpur districts, as well as in the lower reaches of Katihar district had not yet relented. Already, after touching a low of 1.27 cusecs early this week, the water discharge through the Birpur barrage across the Kosi was around 1.81 lakh cusecs on Saturday. The water discharge through the Barah Kshetra barrage in Nepal, around 100km north of Birpur, was 1.40 lakh cusecs in the morning, which increased to 1.52 lakh cusecs in the afternoon, the water resources department (WRD) bulletin said. Water from seven tributaries of the Kosi in Nepal collect at Barah Kshetra. It takes around 72 hours for the water from Barahkshetra to reach the Birpur barrage. A similar trend was visible with regard to Gandak river, as the water discharge through its Valmiki Nagar barrage increased from 1.44 lakh cusecs in the morning to 1.58 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. Among other rivers, Burhi Gandak was flowing above the danger level at most of the places along its downstream and its water level showed a rising trend, while Bagmati was flowing below the danger level at most places, except Benibad and Hayaghat. The Kamla was still flowing above the danger level at Jhanjharpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rain-forecast-revives-flood-fears-in-north-bihar/articleshow/85522171.cms||Abhay Singh

According to Swiss Re’s Sigma report on World Insurance, insurance contribution to GDP has risen to 4.2% in FY21 from 3.76% in FY20. Insurance penetration (premium as a percentage of GDP) for both life and non-life insurance has seen an increase during the pandemic. While life penetration has increased from 2.8% to 3.2%, the non-life play has increased to 1% from 0.94% last year. In non-life, India’s ranking has improved by one place despite premium shrinking in dollar terms. This is because Brazil, which was in 13th place, slipped sharply as its business shrunk 20% in dollar terms. According to the survey, many respondents feel underinsured, despite most owning medical and life insurance. Between 30% and 40% of the respondents purchased additional life and health insurance during the crisis, and 25-50% still intend to buy new policies. “The intent was higher in emerging Asia (56%), particularly India, Vietnam and China (70%) versus advanced Asia (average: 20%),” Swiss Re said. The improved prospects for insurance are also reflected in the performance of non-life during the first quarter. Non-life insurers have registered a 14% growth in gross premium during the first quarter as demand for health insurance increased during the deadly second wave of Covid. Non-life companies registered premium collections wroth Rs 44,434 crore in the first quarter of FY22 as compared to Rs 39,054 crore in FY21. The trend has continued in July after the second wave subsided. According to a report by ICICI Securities, health insurance premiums at the industry level in July ’21 grew by a strong 43% year on year and 25% month on month. Fire insurance premium too staged robust 20% year-on-year while motor grew 9% over last year in July. The increase in insurance penetration bodes well for the government’s disinvestment programme. India ranks 10th in life insurance and 14th in non-life. Despite the insurance market being small relative to GDP, it is seen as having huge potential. In life insurance, the potential is measured in terms of the insurable population. Industry experts say that while developing countries lag in insurance penetration, the non-life market grows disproportionately faster once GDP per capita crosses $2,000. The government is looking to divest stake in LIC and another public sector non-life insurance company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insurance-as-of-gdp-spikes/articleshow/85523015.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

At the same time, the university has decided to accommodate as many students as possible in two other major faculties – arts and science. The decision was taken during Saturday’s syndicate meeting. The university has already received several representations demanding that it should accommodate more students due to mass promotion of class 12 students. “In faculty of commerce, against capacity of 8,000 students, our readiness is to accommodate 11,000 plus students. Based on current fee-based registrations, we have received 10,500 plus applications, which we will be able to accommodate,” said officiating registrar Dr K M Chudasama. While the increase in total seats in first year Bachelor of Commerce translates to roughly 25%, the same will not be the case in arts and science. Faculty of arts isn’t witnessing major rush of applicants, the officials said. “For science, the decision will be taken looking at the availability of infrastructure, the teaching strength and the final number of applications that we receive. We will accommodate maximum number of students,” he said. Even as the university is stretching its intake capacity in general programmes like Bachelor of Commerce, Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science, there will be no change in number of seats available in professional and technical courses where admissions are conducted on the basis of entrance examinations. Earlier in the day, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) submitted a memorandum to syndicate members, resorted to sloganeering and staged dharna protest demanding that 25% seats should be increased in each faculty to accommodate all the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-loosens-seat-belt-to-fit-in-more-students/articleshow/85521705.cms||---

---||Business||‘Markets, not promoters, to bring capital to insurers’||Mumbai: The Indian insurance industry is moving from being a promoter-driven to a market-led one with the capital markets becoming a dominant source of funding, a finance ministry official said. The listing of LIC would result in listed entities accounting for 60% of the insurance business. Speaking at an online event of the Institute of Actuaries of India, Amit Agarwal, additional secretary in the finance ministry said: “We have for the first time an opportunity to attract and leverage large amounts of risk capital, in a traditionally capital-scarce economy for enabling faster growth in the risk intensive insurance sector. Agarwal said that in the two decades after opening up the industry has matured with 69 insurers as against eight in 2,000 and a majority have achieved break-even. Noting that there were over 3,000 insurance products in the market as a result of competition, Agarwal said that such a wide array of offerings is not best suited for meeting the basic insurance needs of the masses who need products that are easy to understand and simple in terms of clean procedures. He called upon actuaries to come up with meaningful ways of assessing risk to develop simplified products at affordable prices suitable for the masses. “Such simplification necessarily entails venturing out of the comfort zone of known data. The necessary allowance for risk on account of poor data may be offset to some extent by economies of scale and leveraging lower costs and access to digital channels and bancassurance,” said Agarwal. In his inaugural address Subhendu Kumar Bal, president, IAI said that the institute would be conducting an actuarial Olympiad to encourage youngsters to take up the profession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/markets-not-promoters-to-bring-capital-to-insurers/articleshow/85523094.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||There is no controversy in RJD: Jagadanand Singh||After the infighting in the party for the last several days between Lalu Prasad’s son Tej Pratap and him, state RJD president Jagadanand Singh said all is well. In an exclusive interview with TOI’s Sheezan Nezami, he blamed the opposition for creating an issue out of nothing. Excerpts: The fight between Tej Pratap and you has become the most talked about issue in the political corridors. How long it will continue?There has never had any fight in RJD. It is being guided by a strong president (Lalu Prasad), who has strongly fought against communal hatred. His words and decisions are final. No one can challenge him. There is no controversy in the party. This has been made an issue by those who want to divert the attention of people from important public issues. Even NDA leaders are advising RJD to get the family issue sorted out first. What will you say?These are the people who do not want the public issues to be discussed. They are suppressing the facts related to Covid-19 deaths. Instead of focusing on preparations for the third wave of Covid and helping people affected by the floods, they are discussing baseless issues. As far as my rivals are concerned, I have been fighting against rioters and extremists throughout my life. Will they praise my party or me? Out of 365 days, if I do not come to office for ten days, that becomes an issue for them. Tej Pratap has been giving statements against you and others in the party. Don’t you think action should be taken against him?One should question only when there is an issue. But at present there is no issue at all. When everything has been sorted out, why make it complex. There is no issue. Tej Pratap has accused you of dividing the party for personal benefits and alleged that you are eyeing the post of party’s national president?I consider myself a party worker. In my entire life, I have had no desire (for high stature in politics). Give me any work and I will do it with dedication. I can even clean the toilet, I won’t mind. A person can be considered big or of high stature when he can do even small work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/there-is-no-controversy-in-rjd-jagadanand/articleshow/85522080.cms||---
---||Madurai||Traffic snarls back in Madurai city||MADURAI: Snarl-ups have become a daily affair at many junctions in Madurai during peak hours as vehicles are back on roads post lockdown. With education institutions poised to reopen, this is expected to get worse. Recently, heavy traffic on the NMR Subburaman Bridge at Villapuram caused a corporation vehicle transporting dumper bins to lose control and break the side walls of the bridge. “Madurai corporation has said that dumper bins are being cleared between 9pm and 5am in many parts of the city. But removal of bins during peak hours always causes traffic problems,” says M Chandran of Villapuram. During peak hours from 8am to 10am, the situation is very bad, and the corporation should ensure that the bins in this region are cleaned during night, he said. Melamadai junction witnesses traffic congestion almost throughout the day. The road, already a narrow stretch, has become narrower after the installation of the median. On the two-kilometre stretch from Melamadai to PC Perungayam junction, only one vehicle can move on the road at many places, where encroachments have not been removed. “At times one has to wait nearly 10 minutes to cross the road at the junction. Some motorists go to the other side of the median and barricades to bring traffic in the opposite direction to a standstill,” said K Ganeshan of Anna Nagar. Even ambulances have a nightmare finding way in these circumstances. Around 20 of them get stuck every day in the traffic jam, said Anbu, a driver. “When education institutions start functioning, it will be chaotic. The medians were constructed during the first lockdown when there was less traffic on the stretch,” said A Asokan of Tahsildar Nagar. “The Melamadai-PC Perungayam Road has more than 100 buses and vans travelling during peak hours in the morning and evening,” said D Raghavan. Installing medians without widening the roads and encroachments are the major problems causing snarl-ups on the stretch, said residents. Teppakulam junction is another spot which witnesses frequent traffic jams. Here, roads are narrow, some are under renovation, and vehicles are parked on the road sides making it difficult for big vehicles to move. Work on the Kuruvikkaran Salai Bridge has to be completed to see whether the problem eases to some extent, said K Joseph, a resident of Chinthamani. Another hotspot is Periyar junction, which is witnessing jams through the day, and it remains to be seen what would be the situation when the new bus bay is completed. The problem is not going to end soon, say commuters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/traffic-snarls-back-in-madurai-city/articleshow/85524667.cms||Padmini Sivarajah
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Korukonda Sainik School opens its doors to girls||KORUKONDA (VIZIANAGARAM): The Sainik School at Korukonda is all set to break new ground by admitting girl cadets for the first time since its inception in 1962. After the Sainik School at Chhingchhip in Mizoram started the induction of girls on a pilot basis three years ago, the initiative has been now extended to all 33 Sainik Schools across the country. As part of its ‘welcome’ to the first batch of girl cadets, the school is allocating a separate hostel block and recruiting a female matron, physical training (PT) instructor, nursing assistant and an ‘ayah’. To start with, 10 seats would be allocated to girl students out of a total intake of 80 students in class VI. The admission process is already on. Korukonda Sainik School principal Colonel Arun Kulkarni welcomed the move. “Our major objective is to prepare the cadets to become future officers. This initiative would consequently enable the girls to aspire for a career in the armed forces. This is the best step we could have taken to open more avenues for girls in defence services. All basic amenities and infrastructure such as an independent hostel and adequate female staff would be provided to girls on the campus. We are also planning to create a separate sick bay for girl cadets in the future,” Col Kulkarni told STOI. Speaking about the typical day of a cadet on campus, he said the day starts at 6 am with physical training. “Our aim is to produce confident students and future leaders who can face any situation. Besides academic excellence, the students will participate in various co-curricular and extra-curricular activities to prepare them for life’s challenges,” he explained. Korukonda Sainik School is regarded as one of the best institutions of its kind in this part of the country. “The school receives about 11,000 applications for 80 seats, which is one of the highest numbers in the domain of Sainik Schools. Not just academics, our cadets excel in sports too. Our school team represented Andhra Pradesh in the Subroto Cup football tournament in New Delhi after winning the U-17 state championship. The school was south zone champion in the 2019 zonal competitions,” added Col Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/korukonda-sainik-school-opens-its-doors-to-girls/articleshow/85522018.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Tej, who considers himself as Krishna of the party, has given the name Arjun to his younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. Sources said Tej had been warned by his family members and asked to remain in his limit as Lalu was very angry with the way he had been defaming the party and insulting seniors. “Lalu ji is very angry. He has even stopped receiving Tej’s phone calls. Even Tej’s sisters have warned him. He has been told that Lalu ji may take strict action against him and even throw him out of the party. Tej has also been asked not to create nuisance before the media,” said a senior RJD leader. Earlier in the day, Tej had criticised Tejashwi for leaving for Delhi at a time when people of Bihar are fighting floods. “Tej is guided by the people who are least concerned about the party and the opposition is also trying to provoke him,” said an RJD leader. Before leaving for Delhi on Friday night, even Tejashwi had criticised Tej. “He is my elder brother is another matter, but our parents have taught us to be disciplined and respect our elders,” Tejashwi had said. Sources said even Tej had planned to leave for Delhi via road to be present with his sisters on Rakshabandhan on Sunday. However, Tej told a section of media on Saturday that his bodyguards, who were supposed to go to Delhi with him, have switched off their cellphones on the instruction of Tejashwi’s political adviser Sanjay Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tej-pratap-takes-a-u-turn-after-criticising-tejashwi/articleshow/85522613.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The Congress legislator assured the residents on Saturday that the waterlogging issue will be resolved within six months as construction of drains and roads were in progress. “Funds have been released for the purpose,” he told reporters. Chaudhary further said, “We hope to complete the ongoing work in the next six months and the city will get rid of the waterlogging problem forever. Rainwater will not accumulate from next monsoon.” However, taking a swipe at the MLA, Sharma said he would reward him (read Chaudhary) if the waterlogging problem was resolved within the stipulated period. He blamed the municipal corporation, other officials and some residents for the sorry state of affairs. Sharma said a detailed project at an estimated cost of Rs183 crore was prepared during his tenure as urban development and housing minister to drain out rainwater from the city. However, it could not be completed due to the officials’ apathy, he claimed. Several localities of the district headquarters town were still under knee-deep water. The residents apprehend an outbreak of epidemic as rainwater has remained accumulated for over a month. On Saturday, a group of residents put up a road blockade and disrupted vehicular traffic near Kalibari Road and Chaturbhujsthan Road to protest against waterlogging in the nearby colonies. One Rahul Kumar said, “An epidemic outbreak cannot be ruled out. It has been more than a month since rainwater entered the houses after the drains got choked. People are now falling victim to water-borne diseases.” A doctor posted at the Sadar hospital admitted that complaints of skin diseases have increased in the town. He advised the municipal corporation authorities to immediately start fogging in the waterlogged localities. Municipal commissioner Vivek Ranjan Maitrey said efforts were on to drain out water from the affected colonies. “Excess rain and ongoing work disrupted the work in some localities,” he said. Former mayor Vivek Kumar alleged that the waterlogging issue is raised every year during monsoon. “But the issue is thrown into dustbin once the monsoon season ends,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/several-muzaffarpur-localities-remain-waterlogged-for-over-a-month/articleshow/85520770.cms||Ramashankar

Police suspect two possibilities: one, they were murdered and bodies placed below the haystack and set ablaze, or the head of the family poisoned the three others before burning them and taking his life.The deceased were Chinnarasu alias Murugesan, 52, a farmer who owned a few acres of land close to his house, his wife Valarmathi, 45, and their children Sivaranjini, 21, and Karthikeyan, 18. Sivaranjini was a BCom graduate while her brother was pursuing BCom in a private college in Palani. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the family attended a function at a relative’s place and returned on Friday night.In the early hours of Saturday, Murugesan’s cousin who lives close by saw fire emerging from a haystack at Murugesan’s place and rushed to alert him. Since nobody answered, he alerted the fire and rescue services. Police and other villagers who reached the place noticed the legs of a man outside the haystack with his torso below the pile.“While a pile of dry groundnut plants were burnt, we put off the flames from the top of the bundles of corn leaves. We were told by the police that there were three bodies below and on putting out the fire, we found a fourth one too,” said Palani station fire officer S Kamalakannan. IG south zone T S Anbu, DIG Dindigul range B Vijayakumari and Dindigul district SP V R Srinivasan visited the scene. While the bodies of Valarmathi and Sivaranjini were fully burnt, Karthikeyan’s body had lesser burns and Murugesan’s even lesser. Fingerprint and forensic experts and dog squad were pressed into service while special teams were formed to crack the case.The bodies were sent to Dindigul MCH for post-mortem and handed over to the relatives. The SP told reporters that no valuables were missing. There were drops of blood in the house, suspected to be nasal bleeding of one of the victims due to poisoning. A senior police officer told TOI that it seems to be a case of murder by Murugesan by poisoning the three others as there were no external injuries but for the burns.Inquiries revealed that Murugesan suffered from sleeplessness and depression over the last two years and was also under medication. Viscera samples of the deceased have been sent for chemical test to ascertain if they were poisoned. Not ruling out other possibilities of murder, police said that a case of suspicious death was registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/four-of-family-found-charred-to-death-under-burning-haystack/articleshow/85524638.cms||---

Talking to reporters after inspection of a hatchery at Muzaffarpur, the minister said the death of each cow or buffalo would fetch its owner Rs 30,000 as compensation. However, each family can get benefits for not more than three livestock. The minister assured those engaged in cattle farming that there would be no dearth of fodder for their domestic animals at the flood relief camps run by the government. “The government is serious not only about the safety of the people, but also their cattle,” he said. The minister said the provision of compensation for the fishermen has also been made by the government in view of floods. “Despite preparations, floods have affected a huge population,” he added.

Temple priests decorated the sanctum sanctorum and adorned the main and festive idols in silk robes. The festivities started on Friday night with Udaka Shanti. Priests washed the temple premises with water. On Saturday morning, Vedic scholars under the leadership of Sthana Acharya Shiva Prasada Sharma, performed Snapana Abhishekam at 3 am.

---||Business||Caution ahead: Markets may descend peaks||Mumbai: Leading indices have been scaling fresh highs on a regular basis. This is luring hordes of new investors to enter the stock market, expecting to make some quick gains. Behind the euphoria, however, there are chances that this feel-good-situation may not last long and inexperienced investors may have to face tough times. Seasoned financial planners are advising clients to slowly shift their equity portfolio, at least a part of it, towards debt. “Inexperienced retail investors always want to extract everything from the markets, which finally becomes their undoing — timing the market by trying to get in at the bottom and get out at the very top — can rarely happen, except by fluke,” said Sanjeev Govila, founder, Hum Fauji Initiatives, a financial planning & advisory services that caters to people from the armed forces. Leave something on the table, is Govila’s advice to clients. For example, in the current over-exuberant times, lay down a reasonable limit for yourself and start paring your equity exposure unmindful of where anybody else expects the markets to go. “If you try to take everything off the table, you will perforce have to take the big downside also with you which will come swiftly and unexpectedly.” Govila wants investors to move their funds into less volatile fixed income assets rather than stay invested in equities and incur losses in case the market enters into some strong corrective phase. There are some reasons for financial advisers and market veterans to expect a correction during this ongoing bull rally. For one, the US central bank has been pumping in money into the global economy since the time the current pandemic started. Most of the major central banks around the world are also following the same path, trying to support their country’s struggling economy back on track through fund infusion. But lately there are increasing signs that the rate of inflation is rising, which is forcing central banks to slow down fund infusions. “How long can they (the central banks) support the market? There should be some end to the liquidity infusion process,” Govila said. Experienced investors, taking the mutual fund route, however, could relax a bit. According to financial planners, those who are invested in equity mutual funds through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route, they need not take money out of the market now, unless they need money for some reason. According to them, SIPs help investors to average out the cost of acquisition of mutual funds units. So if the market falls and the net asset value of the fund the investor is invested in also falls, the investor stands to gain more units of the same fund for the same amount of monthly SIP. This way, over the long run, the average cost of each MF unit for the investor would come down. When the market rises again, the investor would stand to gain faster. However, investors need to be patient and should not lose their nerve even if the market slides, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/caution-ahead-markets-may-descend-peaks/articleshow/85522780.cms||Partha Sinha

The cop had alleged that the accused were drunk and hit him with a glass when he tried to stop their fight. Acquitting Andheri residents Manohar Parab (44), Nelson Jose (44) and Sahil Saphle (34), the court said, “...The prosecution has not produced anything on record to show that on the relevant date at 1.15 am, the informant was discharging his duty at the given place.” It is the prosecution’s case that Rupesh Darekar, a police constable, was on patrol duty early on June 23, 2012 at Khar. With a colleague, Darekar came near a bar and found the trio fighting and two beat marshals trying to intervene . It was submitted that Darekar and his colleague stopped to help the marshals. It was alleged that the accused abused them and had a scuffle with them. Darekar alleged that Parab took a glass from a nearby stall and hit him on the head. He sustained an injury near the left eyebrow. The accused were arrested and taken to Khar police station. Darekar and other cops were among six witnesses. He iterated the version in the FIR. The court, however, questioned why no independent witnesses were examined by the prosecution despite bystanders being at the spot. “... the beat marshals present on the spot and with whom the accused were having dispute are also not examined by the prosecution,” the judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-drunk-men-who-hit-cop-let-off-as-he-was-not-in-uniform-in-mumbai/articleshow/85526083.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Those arrested have been identified as Deepak Jha of Shivala Mor, Arun Sharma of Badi Khagaul Devi, Vishal Kumar alias Alok Raj of Mukhdumpur in Shahpur and Pankaj Kumar of Adampur in Danapur. They are in their late 20s. Police also recovered two countrymade pistols, four live cartridges and three bikes used in the crime from their possession. Gupta was sitting inside his shop named Maa Vindhyawasini Jewellers when six criminals came on three bikes and shot him dead on August 10. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma told the mediapersons on Saturday that the criminals had planned to loot jewellery from the shop but they found the iron locker shut after which they shot the owner dead while hurrying for loot. The SSP said at least two more accused, who hail from Bihta, were yet to be arrested in the case.

---||Patna||For these senior citizens, age is just a number||PATNA: Age is just a number for these senior citizens as they are working in a manner that motivates and inspires the younger generation. Even in their late 70s and 80s, they are making significant contributions to society in their own way. Shiv Vansh Pandey, 89, continues to read and write vigorously. His last book was published about six months ago. He attends the social, cultural and literary meetings regularly. Pandey serves as the principal secretary of Bihar Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and president of the cultural forum of Bihar Vidyapeeth. Besides, he has also been closely associated with several other organisations, including Bihar Sanskrit Sanjeevan Samaj and Rajendra Sahitya Parishad. Talking about age, he said “The notion of age should be accepted in all its ugliness and glory. With age, we earn our wrinkles and get grey hairs. Our wisdom shines and smile becomes profound.” Pandey asserts that he would not die before his death. “I am an asset and not a burden to society,” he quipped. Ramavatar Tiwary, 88, covers a distance of about 30km everyday selling ice creams in Patna. As he has been selling the ice cream of a particular brand for the last 65 years, the company has recently provided him with an e-rickshaw for moving from one corner to the other. Tiwary, popularly called ‘Bhagat Singh’ owing to his look-alike makeup, is very popular among the youth, particularly among the students of Patna University. Hence, most VVIPs of the city, including chief minister Nitish Kumar, cine actors Shatrughan Sinha and Shekhar Suman, and top bureaucrats are quite familiar with him and often call him by his first name. When asked about the secret of his hectic work at this ripe age, he said, “I never worry even in adverse circumstances. I have utmost faith in hard work and sincerity and this keeps me alive,” he said. Dr Uday Krishna Jha, the 84-year-old orthopaedic surgeon, retired from the physical medicine and rehabilitation department of PMCH in 1995, but continues the work of medical consultancy, visits different hospitals and health centres from time to time and offers medical advice to all those who come to his residence seeking help. Dr Jha, who walks a lot every day, keeps himself physically fit and never uses any stick or other support during his walks. As the central zone president of the Indian Orthopaedic Association, he attends various medical conferences organised in different parts of the country regularly. “Growing older need not slow you down. You will remain young as long as you feel so and engage yourself in activities of your liking,” he said. Work is worship for 84-year-old retired bureaucrat I C Kumar, who always keeps himself busy in social activities. After retirement from government service, he served as the vice-chancellor of Veer Kunwar Singh University for more than three years. He has been serving as the president of Bihar Pensioner Samaj since 1996 and fighting for the cause of retired personnel of the state. When asked about his engagements, Kumar said, “Service to others is the motto of my life. I have helped establish a number of educational institutions in rural areas by donating land and money and taking interest in their functioning. Besides, I have also written about a dozen books on different topics after my retirement and the last one was published just a few months back.” It is never too late to start something afresh, said 77-year-old retired Patna University history teacher N K P Sinha, who learnt swimming at the age of 65. Later, at the age of 70, he also won the state-level swimming championship. Sinha is fond of travelling to different places of tourist interest by road in a self-driven car. Just three years ago, he along with his wife drove from Patna to Kanyakumari and back. He has covered a distance of more than 2 lakh kms by road to different places all alone. “Driving is my passion and I do not want to travel by rail,” he said and added: “Taking on new challenges and learning new things is not only fun, but rewarding, too, for an individual.” A 79-year-old retired teacher of the erstwhile Bihar College of Engineering (now NIT, Patna), Santosh Kumar has written two books on river engineering and environmental engineering during the period of the pandemic as he had no other major assignments. He is still engaging classes of MSc students of PU environmental science department and coaches nearly 20 students of high school level, mostly from poor families, free of cost at his residence every day. “I have been inspired by my father, who passed his MA examination at the age of 98,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/for-these-senior-citizens-age-is-just-a-number/articleshow/85522851.cms||B K Mishra

With cases coming down drastically, officials admitted there has been a dip in the number of those coming for vaccination, but the drive is still progressing at a brisk rate.In Madurai district, currently around 5,000-8,000 people are getting the jab every day on average and more than 10 lakh people have been vaccinated overall. “We are trying to formulate a new strategy to have more people get the Covid-19 vaccine. Health officials have been instructed to keep administering and finish the stocks of vaccine. Staff have been asked to be lenient regarding registration and administer the vaccine to as many people as possible above 18 years of age,” said a senior health official.In Dindigul district, which is seeing fresh cases in single digits, officials said that together in Dindigul and Palani health unit districts, around 14,000 are being vaccinated a day on average. “We are trying to co-ordinate and rope in support of various village panchayat union leaders and achieve 100% vaccination in villages one by one,” said a health official from Dindigul.In Kanyakumari, which is seeing the highest number of fresh cases, officials said that Covid-18 vaccination has so far not seen any serious decline. “The pace may have dropped a little but the overall number of those coming to take the jab has been the same. Considering that the adult population in the district is about 14 lakh, we have so far vaccinated about 7 lakh, almost 50%,” said a health official from Kanyakumari. In Ramanathapuram, which is witnessing hardly any new Covid-19 cases, officials say the response for the vaccination has not been up to the mark and only about 3,000 are being vaccinated daily on average. Officials added that efforts are on to improve the vaccination numbers soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/staff-told-to-be-lenient-on-regn/articleshow/85524695.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

During the programme, a girl expressed her difficulty in accessing toilets. “She was distressed about the condition of the toilets, which were not disabled friendly, and that she is cramped and on many occasions she had to crawl onto it,” he said.Hence, the authorities were asked to identify people with physical disabilities, with priority given to women, for installing accessible toilets at their homes. Launched a month ago, seven such toilets have been constructed spending Rs 30,000 to Rs 35,000 each in different parts of the district.R Mareeswari of Palavanatham panchayat is one of the first beneficiaries. She says that she was never happier in her life. The old toilet at her house was an Indian toilet, which was small, cramped and she had to crawl on to it. “Now, the toilet, which is spacious, has a ramp and I can take my wheelchair on to it,” she said.The toilets are being constructed mostly through CSR funds, and if individuals have an ample space for the toilets, which have a western closet, hand railings, ramps and hand showers, it can be done immediately. “We will have more than 40 toilets in the next one week ready, and efforts are also being taken to get funds for the scheme through the Swachh Bharath Mission,” said the collector.Most of the people who are suffering are from the BPL category. So far, 22 beneficiaries have been identified from the ten Samathuvapurams in the district. These Sampathuvapurams also have the required space for constructing these houses.For a 12-year-old disabled boy of a Sampathuvapurams in Mulliseval panchayat, going to the call of nature is a challenge. “The mother had tears of gratitude when we completed the toilet, which now he can access on his own,” said project officer, DRDA, Thilagavathy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/virudhunagar-dist-tries-out-building-toilets-for-disabled-at-their-home/articleshow/85524683.cms||---

The clash started at around 2.30am on Saturday and cops have so far arrested 17 of the 26 accused who have been booked for rioting and other relevant sections of the IPC. Apart from the staff of Pradhyuman Nagar police station and crime branch, senior police officials too rushed to the spot at around 3am to control the situation. Later, a heavy police force was deployed in the area. According to the officials of Pradhyuman Nagar police station, an eve teasing incident of Friday afternoon was at the root of the clash. Police sources said that Mushtak Ali Mori and Irfan Shahmdar had allegedly teased Navaz Sheikh’s sister in his presence. Sheikh and his friends first had an argument with Mushtak and Irfan following which the two were beaten up. To seek revenge, Mushtak and Irfan led a mob to Sheikh’s house around 2.30am on Saturday. Soon, Sheikh’s was joined by his friends and the two groups resorted to stone pelting. The groups attacked each other with sticks, swords and metal pipes. They also ransacked several vehicles parked in the area.

The average ridership has touched approximately 16,000, which was expected to be around 50,000 by the corporation. An official said, “Jaipur Metro makes 178 rounds daily. According to average, 90 commuters travel in the Metro per train.” Hoping that the newly constructed underground corridor (Chandpole to Badi Chaupar) will increase ridership, the Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) on September 23 last year had opened the entire stretch (Mansarovar to Badi Chaupar) for the first time. An official source said, “To experience the feel of underground corridor in Jaipur, commuters took a ride in Jaipur Metro initially. However, the corporation is witnessing continuous dip in ridership after the first month.” When the project was conceived, the JMRC had claimed that ridership will reach 1 lakh in 2020 and 1.25 lakh after the underground (Chandpole to Badi Chaupar) corridor is opened. But so far, it has failed to achieve the desired results. An official said, “The Metro is facing operational losses of approximately Rs 40 crore per annum. A policy has to be devised to promote the green mode of transport.” After the JMRC was adversely affected during Covid, it had demanded to increase the share of the Rajasthan Transport Infrastructure Development Fund (RTIDF) from the state government. At present, JMRC receives 15% share from RTIDF. The corporation has requested to increase the funds up to 25%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/just-16k-commuters-ride-metro-daily/articleshow/85524704.cms||---

The shop from where the liquor was purchased has been sealed after villagers alleged the deaths were a result of poisoning. The deceased have been identified as Harveer Singh, Harender Singh and Mukesh Singh. Rakesh Singh, brother of one of the deceased Mukesh Singh, said, "Illicit liquor is being sold in the village and my brother died after consuming it. We need strong action in this regard." Yashpal Singh Yadav, another villager claimed the three had not purchased the liquor from any authorised shop, but from private individuals. He said, "All three deaths have occurred due to consumption of illicit liquor made in the village itself. They had purchased not from any recognised shop. We want the police to strictly act on liquor mafia and stop the manufacturing and sale of spurious liquor." Police, however, said the liquor was purchased from authorised shop. Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Singh said, "There is a government recognised liquor shop in the village from where six locals had purchased a particular brand a day before Independence Day. Three of them drank continuously on August 15 and a day later two of them died. The third one was admitted to a hospital in Delhi in serious condition and he, too, died there on August 20. Others also drank, but they are okay, till now. We have sealed the shop and so far did not find anything fishy. We are also looking for the snacks they had consumed and trying to ascertain if the combination had turned toxic." To prevent any untoward incident, police have started making appeals to the villagers using public address systems installed at places of worship to not purchase liquor from unauthorised places and liquor mafia, and to immediately inform them if anyone falls ill. Though the FIR was filed against unidentified persons under IPC section 304 [culpable homicide] after the death of two villagers, no arrests were made since police felt the three died of "excessive consumption". Jagveer Singh, a relative of Harender Singh who died a day after Independence Day, said, "Harender's health deteriorated on Monday evening after consuming the liquor. He was rushed to a hospital in Gulawati, but he died." It was Jagveer who had filed the FIR. "The postmortem was conducted and we have preserved the viscera of Harender. It has been sent to the forensic lab," the SSP added. This comes eight months after villagers in Jeetgarhi started falling ill in the first week of January. By January 8, six persons had died and another 15 were hospitalised. Consumption of spurious liquor was claimed to be the reason. A local liquor mafia Kuldeep was said to be the kingpin behind the hooch tragedy and he, along with five of his accomplices, were arrested in subsequent police crackdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/liquor-shop-sealed-in-bshahr-as-3-deaths-in-4-days-hints-at-poisoning/articleshow/85521079.cms||Sandeep Rai

According to assistantsub inspector Jagdish Prasad, the incident took place on Thursday afternoon and the accused was arrested on Saturday. The police have identified the thief as one Ashish Kumar. “We had received a complaint from the rider, Kamlesh Meena, that he had picked one customer from Narayan Singh Circle. Near Sheopur Road, the accused told Kamlesh to stop near a juice centre where he borrowed Kamlesh’s phone to get an online transaction in order to pay for the ride,” Prasad said, adding that as soon as Kamlesh handed over the phone, the accused fled. The police said that the accused is a drug addict and wanted to sell the mobile phone in order to buy smack. Kamlesh in his FIR to the police alleged that the accused roamed around on his bike aimlessly, first asking him to go to Gaushala Road, then to B2 bypass and from there to Sheopur Road. Kamlesh rode around for three to four hours. Exasperated, he asked the accused to let him go as he had other rides to take. After several hours, the accused asked Kamlesh to stop near a juice centre. The accused later told Kamlesh that he did not have cash but he would borrow money through online transactions from his brother. He then requested Kamlesh to lend his phone for a while. As soon as Kamlesh gave his phone, the accused quickly fled from the area. The police used technical surveillance and arrested the accused on Saturday. An official said that they were examining the accused’s criminal past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/youth-books-bike-taxi-flees-with-riders-mobile-held/articleshow/85524734.cms||---
---||India||Chicken soup for furry friends: Demand soars for fresh pet food||The chipped walls of Dhara Jain's Andheri home speak of the time six-month-old Lola would bite off more than she could chew. Months into her adoption in March this year, the rescued Indie dog had made Jain spritz chew-stopping spray on electronic cables, sofas, walls and other corners that her baby canine teeth favoured. But the nibbling didn't end until Jain attended an online course on pet parenting that made her suspect that Lola's habit may not have to do with teething so much as a calcium deficiency. So, Jain - a busy production designer and nervous pet mum who used to feed her pet boiled carrots and packaged dry food by turns - opted for a fresh-pet-food delivery service that offered three customised, nutritious meals a day at around Rs 15,000 per month. Today, except for the odd delivery package carton, Lola's fangs don't destroy much else. "Even her skin and coat have improved without any supplements or products," says Jain. Heightened consciousness of pet nutrition coupled with the spurt in lockdown pet adoptions by busy WFH employees has meant good business for fresh pet food delivery services that offer everything from homemade chicken soup to "24-hour bone broth" customised according to the pet's size and breed. Clients largely tend to be organic-produce-favouring, health-conscious millennial pet parents driven by scepticism about the nutritional content of packaged dry foods and vegetarians who are aware of their pet's animal protein requirements but are unable to provide these at home. Rehaan Qureshi, who runs a three-year-old pet tiffin service that also offers baked protein snacks among the options on its daily menu, has been getting double the number of enquiries per day than in pre-Covid times while Rashee Kuchroo, owner of a 10-year-old Delhi-based fresh pet food delivery firm that switched from offering freeze-dried to ready-to-eat pet meals during the lockdown, has seen a 20% rise in demand per month in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and smaller cities "where the availability of meats is low". "The pandemic has forced people to spend more time with their dogs," says Kuchroo. "And they have learnt that a good quality diet can prevent a host of health issues," says Kuchroo. Lack of government regulation on feed-grade meat adds to the wariness. "Nobody is quite sure about the kind of meat used in packaged foods," says Nayan Shah whose eight-month-old fresh pet food delivery service in Mumbai already boasts over 70 clients across the city. While the firm has run into the odd vegetarian clients who chafe at the idea of frozen meats, "many clients have noticed an improvement in the digestive health and skin of the pets," says Shah, whose company customises meals as per the weight and breed of the dog. To make the move from dry food to wet food easy for pets, Shah says they even offers a "transition period" of 10 days where the pet is progressively introduced to their brand of food. To be sure, "even a preservative-free diet of only chicken and rice or only milk and roti can be as dangerous as relying solely on packaged foods," says Kuchroo. Vets advise finding a happy medium. "Many pet parents feel pets are like their children and don't want to feed the pets food that they will not eat," says veterinarian Dr Amrita Deb, who typically suggests feeding pets an equal measure of fresh and dry food per day. Packaged food isn't all bad, feels Deb, pointing out that many imported dry food brands in the market tend to meet the World Small Animal Veterinary Association's pet food dietary guidelines. "If pet owners are opting for fresh food, it's essential to make sure they have a certified nutritionist," says Deb. Dr Dhananjay Pandit, the only veterinarian in the city who is also a certified pet nutritionist, warns about the recent rise of "quack nutritionists". "Some of them advocate a complete raw-food diet while some others advise going grain-free," says Pandit, who once treated a dog who had developed kidney ailments because the owner was told that carbs were the villain. "So the pet was fed 80% meat. Pet food is about nutrients the dogs get in appropriate amounts as per their activity, size and ailments while grain-free diets are for pets who have a gluten allergy," says Pandit. Meanwhile, Jain is positive she's got this science somewhat right. Though Lola is the culprit behind the missing nose of the Kathakali dancer on her sofa cushion, Jain says the act didn't stem from a deficiency. "That was only to mess with me."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chicken-soup-for-furry-friends-demand-soars-for-fresh-pet-food/articleshow/85527269.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

Their property tax for the next fiscal has reduced by adjusting the rebate amount. On August 6, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had implemented the 5% rebate, which is the first-of-its-kind in the history of the civic body, from July 1 with retrospective effect. Data with the NMC’s property tax department under deputy commissioner (revenue) Milind Meshram shows that 52,420 people paid tax of Rs 14.63 crore for the current fiscal between July 1 and August 17. Thus, the rebate works out to Rs61.46 lakh. The 5% rebate is applicable on NMC’s general tax and other components and not on components of the state government. In the normal course too, rebate is given for early payment only on general tax. Considering financial setback to majority of people due to Covid-19 pandemic, Radhakrishnan had come up with the rebate system to encourage early payment and give benefit to prompt taxpayers. Meshram told TOI that the taxpayers who will pay tax of current fiscal till December 31 will automatically get benefit instantly. “We have reduced tax by 5% in the system itself,” he said. Taxpayers will not get rebate on arrears. They will get rebate on paying tax of current fiscal. Majority of 9,248 of total 52,420 beneficiaries are from Hanuman Nagar zone, followed by 8,389 from Nehru Nagar Zone, 6,753 from Laxmi Nagar Zone, 6,051 from Lakadganj zone, 5,584 from Ashi Nagar Zone, 4,066 from Dharampeth Zone, 4,312 from Mangalwari Zone, 2,723 from Satranjipura zone, 2,673 from Gandhibagh zone and 2,621 from Dhantoli zone. Earlier, the NMC had implemented rebate of 10% for tax payment between April 1 and June 30. Around 51,000 taxpayers benefitted from the scheme. They had paid the tax even before receiving demand notes from NMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/52k-who-paid-property-tax-since-july-1-get-5-rebate/articleshow/85518919.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Jaipur||Jewellers in Rajasthan threaten to stage stir over hallmarking rules||JAIPUR: Infuriated by the new hallmarking rules, especially related to HUID or Hallmarking Unique ID, Sarafa traders (jewellers) in the state have decided to go on a token strike on August 23, as part of the nation-wide call given by the National Task Force on hallmarking. The new mandatory hallmarking norms are impractical, and will not only hit the traders but will also create inconvenience for the buyers as well, they said. Kailash Mittal, president of Jaipur Sarafa Traders Committee, said that the process of generating HUID is cumbersome and for the most of 50,000 the traders in Rajasthan, it would be challenging to put data of every piece online. “The volume of existing and new manufactured pieces is too large to be handled by the 46 hallmakring centres in Rajasthan. With many being located in the rural areas, it is difficult to upload them on website of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Without hallmaking, we cannot even display the pieces. We want hallmarking which would ensure purity to the buyers but not the HUID,” said Mittal. Nawal Agrawal, patron of the committee, said that in case of quality or quantity discrepancy, the jewellers are responsible as per the norms. “The hallmarking centre will have no responsibility as per the current norms, while jewellers are at the risk of getting their registrations cancelled. They will also be subjected to the penal provisions, search and seizure. That’s why the government should rethink on the necessity of the HUID,” added Agarwal. Other members of the association said that the HUID is taking almost 5-10 days to hallmark the products. “Despite the demand, the jewellers will not be able to service their customers in time.” They said hallmarking should be checked at the time of retailing or selling. “Storage, display and transit should be removed from the BIS Act and Regulation,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jewellers-threaten-to-stage-stir-over-hallmarking-rules/articleshow/85524768.cms||---

However, only the principal secretary to the government (higher education department), D Karthikeyan as convener, and associate professor, department of Computer Science A Meshach Ponraj, a senior faculty, were finalised.

From Inorbit in Malad to R City Mall in Ghatkopar, many began operations from Friday to ensure that the public connect stayed, especially considering that malls have been shut for many months. Mall operators said they are trying to operate with fully-vaccinated staff and also with those who are aged above 60. On August 15, malls in the city opened up and said they were following BMC chief I S Chahal’s verbal directions that staff will be allowed to work if they had taken one vaccine dose. But with a state government notification on August 16 stating that all employees, including managers and housekeeping staff of malls must complete 14 days after both doses, they decided to shut down again. Gurvineet Singh, CEO of Viviana Mall, said the state directive meant that they need to operate with skeletal staff. “Retail stores in malls are operating with few staff. This is affecting customer experience. We are trying to get security and other staff who are 60-plus but that’s not enough. At malls, most visitors are aged 18-45, and asking for complete vaccination for them before entering means the footfall is very low. We fear it may soon become unviable for us to operate in such a scenario,” said Singh. Some malls are trying to get support staff from other cities who are fully vaccinated. Kandivli’s Growel’s 1O1 mall also reopened on Friday. Sachin Dhanawade, COO, retail & real estate, Grauer & Weil (India) Ltd, which operates Growel’s, said they were arranging for fully vaccinated temporary manpower. “We are also arranging for second dose for the staff when they are eligible. Malls here are collaboratively seeking a meeting with government authorities to resolve the issue and help us safeguard livelihoods that depend on the mall’s ecosystem,” he said. Rajneesh Mahajan. CEO, Inorbit Malls India Pvt Ltd and director of Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI), which represents major malls in the city, said they have started with around half a dozen brands opening shops. “With the government rule we may be able to operate with staff in full strength only by September-end. While the system is not financially viable to run business, to ensure customer connect, we are trying to partially operate,” he said. A spokesperson for Ghatkopar’s R City Mall said they resumed from August 20 and will comment on business after assessing numbers in few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaimany-malls-reopening-partially-now-with-fully-vaccinated-staff-aged-60/articleshow/85524791.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Delhi||For credit scheme, DU entrance must for other varsity students||NEW DELHI: While implementing the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) scheme announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the 2022-23 academic session, Delhi University will conduct entrance tests for students from other universities seeking lateral entry but its own students will be given direct entry.  ABC allows students to collect 50% of their programme credit from a university other than the one he or she is enrolled in. DU will present this format at the Academic Council meeting on August 23. Delhi University Teachers’ Association is opposed to it as it means redefining and changing the university system into an open schooling one. Under ABC, now a gazetted regulation, students can collect credits and accumulate them for a period of seven years. They have the flexibility of garnering 50% of their credits from institutions in the ABC pool and from online, such as SWAYAM and using them later even if they decide to take a break from studies. The minutes of the meeting of DU's high powered committee for deliberation on implementation of NEP, states, “It was recommended that multiple entry and exit schemes and ABC should be implemented in the university keeping in view the maintenance of standard of education by emphasising the core courses in the university and allowing the credits to be earned from other universities with respect to other courses.” On the lateral entry/re-entry the committee added, “For students of other universities registered under ABC system, the lateral entry of eligible students will be allowed after an entrance test. The seats for lateral entry may be worked out on the basis of academic and infrastructural facilities available keeping in view the relevant norms, such as student-teacher ratio, teaching non-teaching staff ratio laboratory, library teaching-learning tools etc.” However, many teachers felt this was going to destroy the health of higher education institutions and lead to meaningfulness of a degree. Abha Dev Habib, physics teacher at Miranda House, contented, “The Swayam regulation, ABC and blended learning regulations have to be seen together. These mean that almost 70% of teaching-learning will go online. Under ABC, a student of a state university may want to study one paper from DU, and it will be in online mode. With online courses, there will no longer be a concept of teacher-student ratio, like in IGNOU which caters to 44 lakh students.” Rajesh Jha, political science teacher at Rajdhani College, described ABC as “putting the cart before the horse”. “ABC has been coercively imposed on the universities under NEP 2020 to boost privatisation and contractualisation,” alleged Jha. “This will adversely affect the quality of education in public-funded universities where half the students come from the reserved categories, including the economically disadvantaged groups.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-credit-scheme-du-entrance-must-for-other-varsity-students/articleshow/85526441.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Rajkot||Rajkot: Infant dies as Covid infects 50% lungs||RAJKOT: A five-month-old baby boy, who had tested positive for Covid-19 few days back, died at the Rajkot civil hospital on Saturday morning. The death of the infant has again raised the spectre of children being worst hit in case the third wave of the coronavirus arrives. An inquiry has been initiated as to how the child got infected when no one in their family or neighbourhood was infected. Doctors at the Rajkot civil hospital said that the child’s mother had tested positive four months ago and had fully recovered within a few days of getting infected. Doctors are not clear how the baby got infected. The child was in Dhoraji when he was first admitted to a private hospital there a week ago with fever and cough. As the child's condition deteriorated he was shifted to a private hospital in Rajkot a couple of days back. Here his condition worsened as his oxygen level dipped drastically. The child was put on ventilator and tested for Covid-19. As the test result turned out to be positive, the child family members shifted him to KT Children Hospital on Thursday, which is part of Rajkot civil hospital. Radheshyam Trivedi, medical superintendent of Rajkot civil hospital, said that the Covid-19 virus had badly infected the child’s lungs. “The child was on ventilator support when he was shifted to our hospital. His lungs were badly infected and we tried our best to save him,” Trivedi said. The child survived for 32 hours after he was brought to the civil hospital. The pediatrician who was treating the infant initially informed that the baby was suffering from anaemia and his haemoglobin level had dipped to 5. The child’s immunity was weakened because of his anaemic condition, the pediatrician informed. Almost 50% of his lungs were infected because of Covid, he added. At present, there are five patients undergoing Covid treatment at the Rajkot civil hospital with none of them being a pediatric patient. According to Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) total 42,807 people have tested positive for coronavirus since March 2020 in Rajkot city among whom 458 succumbed to the virus. There are currently 16 active cases in the city. The medical fraternity is divided over the issue of the third wave of the coronavirus hitting children the most. Those who think that will be the case, give the high percentage vaccination among the adult population as one of the reasons. The other reason given is that most of those who had tested positive in the second wave are less susceptible to get infected again. In the second wave, almost 62.50% cases were reported in the 21-50 years age group. The Covid positives from the 1-20 years age group made up for 11.60% of the total cases reported during the second wave. This figure includes the 3.05% cases that were reported in the 1-10 years age group. To meet emergencies, the Gujarat government is setting up a control room and a dashboard exclusively for children to help parents navigate the pandemic — right from the availability of beds, Covid medicines and oxygen cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/infant-dies-as-ncov-infects-50-lungs/articleshow/85521185.cms||---

Yet, she preferred to bear the pain and avoided seeking clinical intervention assuming it to be generalized weakness. In a few days, when she developed weakness in her legs and had difficulty getting up, passing urine and stool, the family took her to a physician who advised immediate MRI scan. The investigation revealed she had a tumor in the lower back. The cyst compressed her spinal nerves leading to immobility beside other neurological complications. Spine surgeon Dr Nikhil Malewar said it was sudden onset and the patient neglected the condition assuming it to be routine pain for over two weeks. Dr Malewar said a timely surgery helped her recover and walk again. “Her weight was a big hurdle in carrying out the surgery. A patient weighing105kg is not routine. There is always risk to patient’s life and early recovery may not be expected post the surgery. Yet, the quick decision making from family and clinical point of view ensured she regained her strength,” he said. Dr Malewar added that once weakness sets in lower limbs not many are able to recover fast and in some cases, it can lead to permanent disablitiy as well. “The cyst was between lower back (L4 & L5). It was removed and the bones were fixed with screw, cages and rods. A day after surgery she could walk with support and within a couple of weeks she was able to walk without support and regained control over her bladder and bowel,” he said. Dr Malewar said it is also important to perform surgery in emergency once the patient is showing signs of neurological weakness He added that the condition is called paraplegia — when the patient’s body below waist has no movement. Dr Malewar advised that if the patient has any back pain with weakness, they must see a doctor immediately. “Back pain is common which is mostly muscular. But if it persists for three to four weeks and you are not able to walk then you must see a specialist,” he said. A relative said the patient has completely recovered now and can perform routine task as before.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/paraplegic-woman-walks-again-after-spine-surgery/articleshow/85522811.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Some inmates also said that it was their last wish as they are already in last leg of their life,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Dinesh Kumar Puri. Although the NGO had arranged a bus for inmates to Varanasi. But, due to old age ailments most of them were unable to walk on foot. Notably, vehicular movement is not allowed between Maidagin and Godowlia while big vehicles like bus cant reach even Maidagin crossing. Puri then formed a team under ACP Dashaswamedh Awadhesh Pandey, traffic inspector Dharmendra and TSI Pitambar Singh and finalised a place near Sampurnanand Sanskrit University campus and arranged 10 e-rickshaws on payment basis. The cops properly briefed the e-rickshaw drivers to take senior citizens up to gate-4 Chhattadwar point of KVT. For those facing difficulty in moving few steps the cops arranged wheelchairs at Chhattadwar, said Puri adding, after this group of veterans reached Chhattadwar the security personnel facilitated them to the temple garbha griha to offer prayers. The glow on their wrinkled faces after darshan was remarkable. The group of 50 elderly including 23 women were showering blessings on cops. From Chhattadwar this group was taken back to Chowkaghat to board their buses. And, before boarding the bus each of them were given banana, water bottles, buttermilk packets and biscuits by the cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/yeoman-service-police-help-50-old-age-home-inmates-visit-kvt/articleshow/85525161.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||‘Drug-resistant E coli grew by 109% in 2 years’||AHMEDABAD: This is the hard truth and possibly a dangerous one too. During the Covid-19 pandemic, our increased consumption of antibiotics followed by its excretion into our civic systems, has also accelerated formation of drug resistant bacteria in our ambient water bodies — lakes, sewage systems and even the Sabarmati river. And what worries scientists is human interaction with them at the riverfront, slums along lakes and even waste water farming downstream. Simply put, between two years — 2018 and 2020 — the presence of drug-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) or gut bacteria on two locations on Sabarmati river increased from 22% to 46%. In the two lakes that were sampled for the same period the presence of drug-resistant bacteria increased from 13% to 43% , while in one of the sewage treatment plants, the drug- resistant bacteria increased from 10% to 26%. It was for the first time that such a study, led by IIT-Gn’s discipline of earth science and environmental scientists, from eight prestigious national and international institutes showed how drug-resistance among excreted human gut bacteria like E coli increased between 2018 and 2020. Each E coli isolate was tested for susceptibility to six antibiotics — kanamycin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole. The sampled locations included two locations on Sabarmati river at Nehru Bridge and Sardar Bridge, Kankaria and Chandola lakes and two sewage treatment plants at Chandkheda and Vasna. “There is an urgent need to have a policy and mechanism in place to ensure controlled antibiotic prescriptions followed by safe disposal of antibiotics and medicines from individual homes,” said professor and cluster head, School of Engineering, UPES, Dehradun, Manish Kumar.

---||Allahabad||AU hostel inmates not clearing hostel dues stopped from appearing in exams||Prayagraj: The authorities of Allahabad University have forbidden those students from appearing in the upcoming exams who haven’t paid dues for staying back at the hostel at the time when the hostels were officially closed and non-functional due to the pandemic. The university administration has prepared a list of such inmates and asked them to deposit their fine failing which they would be forbidden from appearing in the exams. The notification from the controller of examination (CoE) stated, “Several lists of students from the hostel authorities and the dean of student welfare (DSW) have been received in the office of CoE. The names of students who have not paid hostel dues are included in the lists. The students are required to pay their hostel dues and procure a certificate of the same from the hostel authorities and submit it to the DSW office. It will then be forwarded to the CoE office.” The notification also mentioned that the students who fail to do so would not be allowed to appear in the forthcoming examinations. “The results or degrees of such students would not be issued as per the registrar’s notification dated August 5. Hence, it is advisable that students must pay their dues as soon as possible,” said AU PRO Jaya Kumar. Earlier, in January this year, AU authorities had decided to allow inmates, who have forcibly occupied their rooms when the hostels were yet reopen formally, to stay in the allotted rooms after paying a penalty of Rs 5,000 per month. However, despite giving several warnings to the inmates, the university administration failed to realise the fine from such students. Meanwhile, the student leaders who are part of the ongoing agitation on campus over the issue of reinstating the students’ union at AU, said that the students living in hostels have been asked to deposit dues for the period when the entire country was under lockdown. “In such an emergency, the inmates stayed wherever they got shelter. The imposition of a fine on the inmates shows the mental bankruptcy of the university administration,” said Ajay Yadav Samrat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-hostel-inmates-not-clearing-hostel-dues-stopped-from-appearing-in-exams/articleshow/85525323.cms||---
---||Kanpur||People of UP have decidedto oust BJP in polls: Akhilesh||Kanpur: Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday made a direct attack on the BJP government on the issue of inflation, unemployment and development. “The upcoming assembly elections would be the biggest election in the country as the people of the state have made up their mind to dethrone the Bharatiya Janata Party. It (BJP) has not done any work as per its manifesto. The law and order situation in the state has collapsed. Till the time of elections, the government will only focus on how to target the opposition party leaders with mala fide intention,” said Yadav. The former chief minister, who came to Saifai, his native place in Etawah on Raksha Bandhan, said this while addressing media persons. “The biggest announcement was to double the income of farmers. Today, the public is asking BJP government that the price of which crop was doubled. The government however is skipping queries of the people,” said Yadav. “Inflation has hit the farmers in a big way. Cane farmers have not yet received their arrears,” he added. “Everyone has seen the defeat of BJP in West Bengal elections. The people there had taught Bharatiya Janata Party a lesson. Everyone has seen the way BJP has worked in bad faith in Bihar and Bengal elections,” he said. Taking a lesson from this, the workers need to be prepared in every way for the 2022 assembly elections, he said. On talk of alliance with PSP leader Shivpal Singh Yadav, Akhilesh said, “SP has opened the way for the small parties who want to defeat the BJP. Together we will defeat BJP.” On the question of BSP leader Satish Chandra Mishra organizing a Brahmin conference in Etawah, he said it is a good thing. The former CM said that the hooliganism of BJP workers is at its peak in Etawah. “A police officer was publicly beaten up during the block elections. On Saturday, a deputy jailor was attacked in Etawah jail premises. No one is safe in the state. Incidents are happening with women too. This condition is not of Etawah alone but of entire Uttar Pradesh,” he said. He said that the SP is working according to its strategy and will form the government in the state with absolute majority by winning the upcoming 2022 assembly elections. Yadav later gifted laptops to the top three students of the college named after his grandmother Murti Devi. The students who received laptops from SP president were class 12 meritorious student Shweta Shakya, class 10 students Soumya and student Prashant Pal. Former Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap Singh and other senior leaders were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/people-of-up-have-decidedto-oust-bjp-in-polls-akhilesh/articleshow/85525197.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Siddharth appeared before RGIA police on Saturday and was questioned about how he was in possession of a 5.56 mm bullet. The recovered bullet was 5.56 mm whereas his licensed gun has a 0.32 mm bullet. “A 5.56 mm bullet can be used only in a long weapon, which is used only by the Army, police and government security agencies. It will not be officially issued to any civilian while granting a weapon licence,” an investigator told STOI. “We had some doubts and hence we called Siddharth by issuing a notice. He needs to further clarify other doubts which we have. He will appear before the investigation officer in the coming days,” assistant commissioner of police (Shamshabad division) V Bhaskar told STOI. Based on his explanation, police will take a call on Siddharth’s arrest. It is learnt that Siddharth feigned ignorance on the bullet in the bag. He is also learnt to have expressed shock as to how the bullet made its way into his bag. “Why will I carry a bullet in my bag and take it to the airport to board a flight,” Siddharth reportedly told the investigators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bullet-mystery-paritalas-son-to-be-quizzed-again/articleshow/85522834.cms||---

Shaheed Khan, who is suspected to have acquired properties illegally worth over Rs 10 crore, has been sent to seven-day police custody. The seized drugs were meant to be distributed in Delhi, Mumbai, Haryana, Punjab and Uttarakhand, police claimed. Khan was arrested with his 24-year-old relative Saif Khan alias Raju on August 18 in Padhera village under Fatehgunj police limits. Seven others managed to flee. Police sought 14 days remand, but were granted seven days custody by the special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court on Saturday. The 52-year-old is a close relative of absconding drug lord Taimur Khan alias Bhola who has links with a global drug racket and carries a reward of Rs 1.25 lakh on his head. Khan also opened a 'zero balance' Jan Dhan account in Bareilly. Police have freezed Rs 65 lakh stashed in banks. He is believed to own a battery manufacturing unit, multiple brick kilns and over 100 acres of farm land. He has married twice and owns two luxurious houses with several vehicles. Additional SP (Rural) Rajkumar Agarwal who is leading the operation told TOI, “This is the largest drug recovery in Bareilly, so far. We are now searching the properties and have asked the banks to freeze Shaheed and his relatives' accounts. All his properties will be seized and the Gangster Act will be slapped against the accused.” “Shaheed Khan and the gang have direct links with notorious drug smuggler Taimur who hails from Behra village in Bareilly. Taimur is wanted by Delhi and UP Police. Shaheed misused his position as village head and destroyed the lives of other youngsters. Today, over 100 young people caught as drug carriers are languishing in jails across the country," a senior cop said. Additional district government counsel Santosh Srivastava told TOI, “The remand custody in this case was important to ensure the arrest of remaining accused and further recovery.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-village-head-held-with-drugs-worth-rs-20-crore/articleshow/85521216.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mother of teen mishap victim to get Rs 14 lakh as relief||MUMBAI: A 35-year-old mother who told the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) that her 14-year-old son, who was killed after a speeding car ran him over when he was riding his bicycle in their colony, was her only son as she had undergone a family planning surgery, has been awarded a compensation of around Rs 14 lakh (with interest). Among the compensation heads, Rs 30,000 was specifically awarded towards the loss of love, affection and companionship of the deceased child. “Filial consortium is the right of parents to compensation in the case of an accidental death of a child. Therefore, in case where the parents have lost their minor child or unmarried son or daughter, they are entitled to be awarded loss of consortium under the head of filial consortium,” the tribunal said while relying on a Supreme Court ruling. The teenager’s parents submitted a claim before the tribunal in February 2015 against the car owner M/s Bearings Pvt Ltd and insurer, The New India Assurance Co Ltd. They sought compensation of Rs 10 lakh. The tribunal also considered Rs 87,000 as an annual notional income of the child studying in Class 8 at the time of his death in 2015. The compensation will be paid by the car owner and his insurance company. The parents said the accident took place on July 11, 2015. At 7.30 pm, the boy was riding a bicycle at New Airport Colony, Vile Parle (E). The car coming at high speed, in a rash and negligent manner, dashed his bicycle. They submitted that due to this impact, the boy sustained serious abdominal injuries and died while under treatment. It was contended that the accident would not have taken place but for the gross negligence and rashness of the car driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mother-of-teen-mishap-victim-to-get-rs-14l-as-relief/articleshow/85526150.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Meerut||As monsoon enters last phase, heavy rainfall lashes western UP||MEERUT: Moderate to massive rainfall in the western UP region threw life out of gear on Saturday, with several districts receiving rains above 500mm. Though farmers welcomed the much-awaited rainfall, it inundated marketplaces and residential areas giving a harrowing time to locals. The downpour has inundated several shops in Baghpat and caused traffic jams at several locations in Meerut at a time when the construction work on the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project is in full swing. Similarly, Loni area in Ghaziabad was the worst hit as the overflowing water from a pond entered residential areas. According to the India Meteorological Department’s Hydromet Division, Muzaffarnagar on Saturday recorded a rainfall of 76.6mm, the heaviest in the western UP region, which is 1,078% more than the normal for the day — 6.5mm. Similarly, Sambhal received 63.3mm against 6.9mm, which accounts for 818% above the normal. Other western UP districts such as Badaun, Baghpat, Bijnor, Etah, and Saharanpur, among others, too received rainfalls 200% above the normal. Dr RS Sengar, an agriculture scientist at the department of biotechnology, College of Agriculture, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Agriculture University, said, “The rainfall is a boon for the paddy and sugarcane farmers as both crops require a considerable amount of water. Farmers had been waiting for this for quite some time.” With the Uttarakhand hills, too, witnessing incessant rainfall, most of the rivers in the Gangetic plain are in spate. “In Bijnor, the swollen Ganga has not only displaced people living on the banks, but the erosion of soil is causing a huge loss of sowing area as well as loss of crops,” said Digambar Singh, a local farmer. It started raining in Baghpat on Friday midnight and continued till late Saturday afternoon. The UP border district (with Haryana) witnessed 48mm rainfall that submerged almost all roads and towns. According to Skymet, the rain will continue in Delhi, west UP and Uttarakhand for the next 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/as-monsoon-enters-last-phase-heavy-rainfall-lashes-western-up/articleshow/85521253.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Nagpur||Gender reassignment surgery not feasible for many in Vidarbha: Activists||NAGPUR: While the country was celebrating 75th Independence Day, Rajrajeshwari, earlier known as Anand, said that she celebrated freedom from the male body with which she was living for the last 31 years. The youngster from Saoner found “new and true identity” recently after going trough the first gender reassignment surgery (GRS) at Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, Sawangi (Meghe), in Wardha. While doctors claimed that many such surgeries are now happening in the Nagpur city, activists who work for the welfare of transgender community claimed that it’s not that easy at all. Rajrajeshwari said, “I have a feeling of being reborn. I was born as a boy but right from childhood I had a feeling this body is not mine. Even family members refused to accept me as who I was.” Dr Pradip Patil, head of psychiatry department of the hospital, supported Rajrajeshwari and managed to perform the surgery at the hospital. “There are many such youths who have such psychiatric issues. One in 500 adults may fall somewhere on a transgender spectrum. But gender dysphoria remains largely under reported in our society,” he said. The surgery requires multidisciplinary approach — at least six months of observation by a qualified psychiatrist, series of plastic surgeries and a tedious legal process. But not all those who have accepted they have gender dysphoria and wish to get this surgery done are as lucky as Rajrajeshwari. Activists said that the government hospitals don’t have any such provision and it’s not affordable for them in private hospitals. According to Anand Chandrani, founder of Sarathi Trust, needy people in Central India prefer to go to Raipur, Delhi and there is a long waiting list in Mumbai too. “It requires earnings of a lifetime to conduct these surgeries. Many of the transgenders don’t have that much money,” said Chandrani. Chandrani further said that it’s a problem of life and death for these people. “Despite approaching the district collectors many times with a demand to provide some support for such surgeries, we got nothing but only assurances,” said the activist. Plastic surgeon Dr Pranam Sadawarte said that several such surgeries happen on and off in Nagpur in the private set-up. “It’s a long process. There is no doubt that plastic surgeons play the most important role. Making facial changes, creating breasts and female genitals is done in phases. Next come the endocrinologists who give hormone therapy to bring the desired changes in the body,” he said. Surgeon Dr Yashwant Lamture said that such surgeries are performed only in 51 hospitals across the country. “It requires super-specialty approach. I am happy that we have done a good job in giving identity to Rajrajeshwari. I think this surgery is a milestone for charity hospitals in Central India,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gender-reassignment-surgery-not-feasible-for-many-in-vidarbha-activists/articleshow/85522884.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Hyderabad||Face-off||In its recent executive council (EC) meeting, Osmania University has decided to prohibit all non-academic activities including protests, calendar/poster releases, birthday parties, installation of flexis/banners, rituals etc. at Arts College and it surrounding areas. The varsity V-C and a student leader debate the pros and cons of this move ‘Such events are hampering perception of university’ Prof D Ravinder, vice-chancellor, Osmania UniversityThe reputation and prestige of the university are linked to the Arts College — the first wing to have started in OU. The diverse events on campus that unfold in front of this building become major debating points, both in the media and society, and sends out strong a message on the academic standing of the university. Thus, it is incumbent on each of the stakeholders to take responsibility for the nature of activities being held within the campus, especially before the Arts College. Any academic activity that strengthens the vibrancy of the university is undisputed. However, Osmania University has scored low on the perception parameter in the National Institutional Ranking Framework and several national surveys by independent organisations. This is a very distressing fact as the university is misconceived because of certain non-academic activities: release of calendars/posters, birthdays, staging protests, being some of them. Some of these events go viral on social media and dent the image and reputation of the university to say the least. The university cannot afford to lose prospective students who wish to join the institution but are apprehensive because they view it as a cauldron of politics. This is detrimental to the university even as it faces stiff challenges posed by the entry of the private sector in higher education. Our intent is not to stifle the rights of students/student groups or disallow them from expressing dissent and protest. In pursuance of the ECs decision, the university administration has decided to provide an alternative venue on campus to stage such activities. - As told to Preeti Biswas Prof D Ravinder, vice-chancellor, Osmania University‘University must focus on resolving faculty, infra issues’ Venkat Naik, final year LLB student, OU Law College & state secretary, NSUIThe Osmania University Arts College has always been the epicentre of protests and other social events. It was also the hotspot of the separate statehood movement. So, to keep students away from holding non-academic events from such a space — synonymous with student political movements for decades now — appears to be an attempt to suppress the voices of students within the campus. Such measures were not taken even during the Telangana movement. The way Dharna Chowk in Hyderabad or India Gate in Delhi is identified as a site for common citizens to come together for a cause, Arts College in Osmania University is looked at as a venue for students to unite for various events. I wonder how holding a poster release, speeches or birthday parties here is going to cause harm either to the structure or the reputation of the institution. The university has made no attempts to even seek the students’ point of view on the matter before passing the resolution in the executive council meeting. It only speaks volumes about how undemocratic the decision is. Also, at a time when the university has not bothered to resolve academic issues such as shortage of faculty and other infrastructural problems, its decision to ban social events in and around Arts College seems completely uncalled for. If the university really wants to improve the perception among prospective students, it should first start considering them as a major stakeholder in the functioning of the varsity.

It could be a trap by some crook. The crime branch has nabbed one such crook on Saturday. The crook used to send friend requests by making IDs on Facebook and Instagram through his several fake identities. After befriending them, he used to blackmail them by making obscene videos and trapping them in his love. He would then blackmail them by making their porn videos. Police have recovered obscene videos of about 65 girls from the mobile phone of the accused. A woman, hailing from Kalyanpur area, who had become a victim of the crook’s vicious trap, lodged an FIR at Kalyanpur police station on August 7. “The complainant had alleged that a person named Ankur Omar, after befriending her on Facebook, made physical relations with her and also filmed obscene videos of her by trapping her in his love. Now, he is blackmailing her. Her family members have also come to know about all this”. Subsequently, the police lodged an FIR under relevant sections of IPC with regard to the complaint and launched an investigation. Thereafter, the crime branch arrested Shekhar Suman (28), a resident of Jalalabad locality of Shahjahanpur. When the crime branch cops cross-checked his mobile and Facebook account, they were stunned. “Around 65 pornographic videos of girls were recovered from his mobile phone. Along with this, chatting details of hundreds of girls and their contact numbers were also found,” said a police official. “Shekhar Suman used to chat with 150 to 200 girls every day. He has made fake IDs on Facebook in the name of Ankur Gupta, Ayush Aggarwal, Ankur Omar, Neha Aggarwal, Soumya Omar etc. The account which has been created under the name Ankur Omar, only has its real photo in it while in the rest, fake photos of girls have been used. Ankur is Shekhar’s nick name”, he added. The case lodged at Kalyanpur police station is only the tip of the iceberg. Apart from this, Shekhar was in touch with girls from Agra, Shahjahanpur, Lucknow, Bareilly, Moradabad, Prayagraj as well as Delhi, Mumbai, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand. Shekhar, who has trapped hundreds of girls, had pursued his graduation from a postgraduate Sanskrit college of Shahjahanpur. He got this idea from a friend of his, named Satyam Awasthi. According to Shekhar, Satyam also used to befriend girls in the same way. Shekhar is the third among four brothers and a sister. “The crime branch will now try to contact other victims. For this, the social media accounts of Shekhar Suman will also be scanned. The complaint of a person who has become the victim may come forward and get the FIR registered. Their complaint will also be included and further action will be taken against the accused,” said DCP (crime) Salman Taj Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/crime-branch-arrests-man-recovers-65-porn-videos-of-girls/articleshow/85525225.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

On the eve of the festival, markets were flooded with people as women scouted for glittering rakhis and packets of sweets and chocolates for their brothers. After almost 17 months, markets in the Pink City saw a good footfall. Sweet shops, which remained mostly shut last year during Holi and Diwali last year, are now getting good number of customers. People at Sindhi Camp bus stand as they head to their hometowns to celebrate the much-awaited festival“Pandemic compelled to stay at home. Since cases have dipped, we mustered courage to celebrate the festival like pre-Covid days. I have got both my vaccines and went out to select a bunch of rakhis for my brother and cousins,” Meenu Bhatt, who was seen at Vaishali Nagar market, said. Likewise, Walled City markets saw heavy traffic as people thronged shops to purchase new clothes for their sisters and brothers. “As cases are dipping and people getting vaccinated, I will pray to god that the same flood of customers may continue for the upcoming festivals. In the past two days, we have had good number of customers,” said Santosh Agarwal, who owns a sweet shop at in Walled City. Rakshabandhan was also homecoming for many after a gap of almost a year. “I have taken four days leave as I am at home almost after a year. I had gone to Chandpole bazaar, which was full of customers. I enjoyed a lot as things were looking normal in the markets,” said Ashutosh Singh, who works in a multi national company at Bengaluru and returned home to his Shyam Nagar residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/markets-abuzz-with-activities-on-rakhi-eve/articleshow/85524914.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Why a Bengal village is losing its sleep over nightmare in Afghanistan||SONAMUKHI/KOLKATA: A cluster of families in Sonamukhi - a Bengal town some 3,000km from Kabul - are watching the events unfolding in Afghanistan with more than the normal degree of interest. For more than half a century, these families in Bankura district have had a thriving trade relation with Afghanistan, supplying high-quality silk turbans, or saafa, to Kabuliwallahs. With trade between India and Afghanistan coming to a halt following the Taliban takeover, the turban weavers and sellers are staring at a loss in business and some have already started shifting to stocking and weaving the indigenous but intricate Baluchari saris. "We have been in this business for three generations. Till last year, I had an annual turnover of Rs 1 crore just from selling these turbans but the trade has come to a sudden stop now," said Shyamapada Dutta, 49, who runs a loom at Sonamukhi and has a shop at Rabindra Sarani in Kolkata. Sonamukhi's ties with Afghans dates back to the 1960s when some Kabuliwallahs while travelling across Bengal with their spices and dry fruits were drawn to the village known for its rich silk weaves. "They gave the first orders for silk turbans and liked the products so much that they kept coming back for more, and that is how the trade began," said Asit Baran Shoo, another weaver. He added that even in the 1990s around 500 families in the village were engaged in the turban trade but the number has now dwindled to around 50 owing to digital printing and a large section of new-age Afghans discarding turbans. The turbans are priced between Rs 350 and Rs 3,500 depending on the quality of silk used. City-based Afghans like Md Rasul and Akhdat Khan told they had time and again bought turbans from the Rabindra Sarani store as well as from Sonamukhi either for personal use or for export. "But the situation looks grim now. We have no idea when things will get better," said Rasul, who has been in Kolkata for the last 40 years and deals in garments.

The move triggered nationwide protests. Amid such a volatile situation, BJP leader Kalyan Singh once visited the RSS office in Model House in Lucknow. Coincidently, the then sah sar karyavah Murlidhar Dattatreya Deoras, popularly known as Bhaurao Deoras, was also present on the first floor of the building. Read AlsoFormer Uttar Pradesh CM Kalyan Singh passes away at 89Former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Kalyan Singh succumbed to prolonged illness at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow at around 9.30pm on Saturday evening.Coming to know about Bhaurao’s presence, Kalyan sent a messenger seeking an appointment. Bhaurao immediately called him upstairs. During the meeting, Kalyan expressed concern over the caste divide on the issue of reservation but Bhaurao asked him not to worry and exhorted him to start touring the state with the aim to unite the people as Hindus. “The more intense the Ram Temple movement gets, the lesser would be the implications of the Mandal report implementation,” he believed to have told Kalyan. Read AlsoWhen Kalyan Singh’s penned his political vision in a poemWhile most know Kalyan Singh as an ace politician who played an important role changing the political landscape of India, the veteran was a poet at heart.A true ‘swayamsewak’ that Kalyan was, he immediately embarked on a whirlwind tour of the state. It was during Kalyan’s visit to Prayagraj (then Allahabad) that he was arrested on the way, thus becoming the first BJP leader to be taken into custody for leading the Ram Temple movement in the state. Before the touring spree, Kalyan was just another Lodh leader in the BJP, taking on other backward caste politician, Mulayam SinghYadav, who was then with the Janata Dal. Read Also‘Crestfallen’ over demolition, Kalyan said history will fix responsibilityLucknow: In the early nineties, police stations in UP used to put up photographs of top 10 criminals of their respective areas. Many of these criminals were rounded up while others were warned against creating any disturbance. In a short span of one-and-a-half years, then Chief Minister Kalyan SinghWhile leading the Ram Temple movement, Kalyan united several smaller OBC castes like Binds, Mallahs and Kashyaps and emerged as a strong OBC leader and the BJP’s poster boy of Hindutva. Not that he was the only OBC leader in the BJP at that time but the fact that he followed the Sangh functionary’s directives in letter and spirit, he was able to unite several smaller non-Yadav OBC castes. All these castes added up to around 16-17% of the OBC population, much more than any single OBC caste, be it Yadavs or Kurmis. His public addresses mainly focussed on uniting every caste for the sake of the country and in the name of Lord Ram. The message worked for him and Kalyan became the leader of 16-17% OBCs. In doing so, he emerged as the Hindutva poster boy and sole leader of the Ram Temple movement in the state. Prior to this, Kalyan was appointed the UP BJP president after the death of Madhav Prasad Tripathi, the founder state chief of the party. “However, Kalyan was known as a Lodh leader at that time,” said Rajendra Tiwari, the man who was the state secretary during his tenure. BJP had a poor presence in Uttar Pradesh assembly with only 11 MLAs in 1980, 16 in 1985 and 57 in 1989. However, he had already earned the sobriquet of a tough administrator when he became the health minister during the Janata Party government in the state in 1977. That was the time when doctors posted in Lucknow hardly got transferred to any other place. Singh, as health minister, transferred famous cardiologist Dr SC Rai to Kanpur from Lucknow. Despite requests from Nanaji Deshmukh and Rajendra Singh aka Rajju Bhaiyya, he declined to stay Dr Rai’s transfer. Dr Rai was forced to complete one season in Kanpur before coming back to Lucknow. After his retirement, Dr Rai got elected as Lucknow Mayor on a BJP ticket. It was Kalyan’s image that made him a leader with a difference and this paved the way for him to become the state BJP chief in 1984. “Kalyan had started establishing himself as an OBC leader in 1986 and had emerged as one of the main leaders who took on Mulayam SinghYadav,” said senior journalist Brijesh Shukla. “After the Ram Temple movement began, he became the Sangh parivar’s mascot of Hindutva. Kalyan’s Hindutva was incomplete without social justice,” Shukla said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kalyan-formula-how-he-united-non-yadav-obcs-in-bjps-favour/articleshow/85526459.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Nagpur||Doctors warn toothbrush injuries on rise, can be fatal||NAGPUR: Doctors at the Government Dental College and Hospital (GDCH) have recorded an increase in incidence of toothbrush injuries recently. Most of the injuries have taken place among children who were either busy playing while brushing their teeth or parents forcibly tried to brush their teeth, or they were pushed by someone. Doctors warned that these injuries in the soft tissues can also be life threatening if proper care is not taken while carrying out the daily activity. A five-year-old old girl, who had a brush in her mouth, was pushed by a sibling at home following which the brush penetrated through her cheek, causing severe injury. Dr Ritesh Kalaskar, professor and head of department of paediatrics and preventive dentistry at GDCH, told TOI that they had to make a cut to remove the brush as it got stuck in soft tissues. “Every year many cases pertaining to toothbrush injuries are reported to our department. The five-year-old girl was hit by an external object while the brush was inside her mouth, leading to the penetration of the entire head of the brush inside the buccal mucosa, that is, the soft tissue of the cheek,” he said. Kalaskar added, “The patient was made calm and after administration of local anaesthesia, an incision was made and the toothbrush was retrieved. Sutures were given and the patient was kept on a follow-up thereafter. The patient was completely normal after one month without any traces of the injury.” The GDCH doctor said one of the reasons for increase in incidence is restriction of movement. “As kids are largely confined to homes these days, they tend to indulge in mischief from the morning. Since there is no rush for school, they start playing even while brushing. Most of the patients reside in smaller houses and have limited space to move about. Hence, it is important to pay attention to these activities as negligence can prove harmful,” he said. The dental professor added that quality of the toothbrush is also paramount. “We found that people used poor quality brushes and often don’t change them for long,” he said. Kalaskar said that in some cases reported from other parts of the world, the toothbrush reached the posterior neck and caused damage to important organs such as the trachea and large blood vessels. This might lead to serious complications such as breathing problems, pharyngeal abscess, hematoma and even death due to damage to the internal carotid artery, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-warn-toothbrush-injuries-on-rise-can-be-fatal/articleshow/85522943.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Nagpur||Divisional panel reviews 84 rejected FRA claims||Nagpur: The divisional-level committee (DLC) discussed 84 individual forest rights (IFRs) claims under the Forest Rights Act, (FRA), 2006, and is likely to clear most of them. In 2012, all these claims were rejected by the district-level committee headed by collector for lack of evidence. However, on May 18, 2020, the governor had issued a notification making modifications in the FRA, 2006. The notification empowered divisional-level committees under the chairmanship of divisional commissioners to hear the appeals against the decision of the district-level committees. Accordingly, the committee headed by divisional commissioner Prajakta Verma, in a virtual meet, reviewed the 84 claims in the presence of member-secretary and additional tribal development commissioner Ravindra Thakre, Gadchiroli conservator of forests (CF) Kishor Mankar, nodal officer of divisional FRA cell Harish Bhambre and others. Verma gave a patient hearing to the claimants and verified the claims. In a press release, the divisional commissioner appealed to work positively on the pending claims so that poor tribals get justice. Verma, however, did not respond to TOI calls when sought to know how many claims would be cleared and why these were rejected. Of the 84 IFR claims, most of them belonged to tribals and other forest tribal dwellers (OFTDs) from Bhamragarh, Sironcha, Allapalli, Gadchiroli and Wadsa. “The claims were rejected earlier for want of substantial evidence like caste certificates, 75 years of residential proof, additional encroachments other than the claimed land etc. Not all the 84 claims will be settled. In the last meeting held in April, around 60 FRA claims were approved by the divisional committee,” said sources attending the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/divisional-panel-reviews-84-rejected-fra-claims/articleshow/85519219.cms||---

While 478 complaints were registered between January and July last year, 643 were lodged till July this year. The complaints are of acid attacks, domestic violence, dowry deaths, police apathy, rapes, female foeticides, sexual harassment/assaults, stalking and others. Out of 907 complaints registered in 2020, Jaipur’s share was 134, the highest among all districts. This year too, the capital district recorded 106 complaints, the maximum among all districts. Apart from Jaipur, districts such as Alwar with 48 complaints and Bharatpur (41) also recorded a significantly high number of complaints of atrocities against women. Officials claimed that the number of complaints in 2021 would easily surpass previous year’s records. In 2019, a total of 764 complaints were received by the NCW from the state. “Since Rajasthan has no active women commission, it leaves the women with no option but to write to the NCW. Repeated reminders to the state government have been futile. Incidents of crimes against women are reported daily. The commission has already received 71 complaints in August,” said an official. Last month, the NCW had written to DGP stating that it was seriously concerned about increasing crimes against women and girls. In 2021, the commission has written to the authorities several times about the security of the women. It also suggested that police officers of all levels be imparted special training to deal with women related crimes especially rape and sexual assault cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ncw-gets-165-more-plaints-from-raj-in-jan-july-21-than-first-7-mths-of-20/articleshow/85524953.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

According to reports, while it rained in the entire district, Liliya taluka received the highest with around 110 mm rain and the town was inundated in waist-deep flood water. Amreli town received 61mm rain resulting in water logging in many areas too. Navli river started to overflow with water entering several shops in Liliya and Amreli. Looking at the flood situation, the district administration was forced to close the Liliya-Savarkundla-Palitana and also Gariyadhar state highways. However, downpour was a relief for the tillers who were afraid that their standing groundnut and cotton crop would be badly affected from lack of required water this time. Amreli district farmers are totally dependant upon rain water for their farms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/heavy-rains-fill-amreli-farmers-with-joy/articleshow/85521330.cms||---

An additional public prosecutor, H J Dedhia, said the complainant has not attended the police station despite letters which were returned, “unclaimed”. Justice S K Shinde of the HC directed the prosecution to make further efforts to “secure the presence of the complainant for completing the investigation” and for further hearing adjourned his pre-arrest bail plea to September 3. The police officer’s case is that their love matured over the years and physical relations that followed were not isolated in nature. The HC said it perused the first information report (FIR) and its order noted, “Prosecutrix [complainant] had even stayed with the applicant [accused police officer] at different places. She had been to Mumbai to celebrate applicant’s birthday. She would also allege that the applicant had declined to marry her because she belongs to another caste.” Till the next date, after hearing his counsel, N S Ghanekar, HC protected the police officer against arrest and directed that if arrested he be released on a bond for Rs 25,000 with sureties. The HC directed him to join the probe and not tamper with evidence or attempt to contact the complainant, witnesses or any other person concerned with the case.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Demand for fresh pet food spikes as owners worry about nutrition||The chipped walls of Dhara Jain's Andheri home speak of the time six-month-old Lola would bite off more than she could chew. Months into her adoption in March this year, the rescued Indie dog had made Jain spritz chew-stopping spray on electronic cables, sofas, walls and other corners that her baby canine teeth favoured. But the nibbling didn’t end until Jain attended an online course on pet parenting that made her suspect that Lola’s habit may not have to do with teething so much as a calcium deficiency. So, Jain--a busy production designer and nervous pet mum who used to feed her pet boiled carrots and packaged dry food by turns--opted for a fresh-pet-food delivery service that offered three customised, nutritious meals a day at around Rs 15,000 per month. Today, except for the odd delivery package carton, Lola’s fangs don’t destroy much else. “Even her skin and coat have improved without any supplements or products,” says Jain.  Heightened consciousness of pet nutrition coupled with the spurt in lockdown pet adoptions by busy WFH employees has meant good business for fresh pet food delivery services that offer everything from homemade chicken soup to “24-hour bone broth” customised according to the pet’s size and breed. Clients largely tend to be organic-produce-favouring, health-conscious millennial pet parents driven by scepticism about the nutritional content of packaged dry foods and vegetarians who are aware of their pet’s animal protein requirements but are unable to provide these at home.  Rehaan Qureshi, who runs a three-year-old pet tiffin service that also offers baked protein snacks among the options on its daily menu, has been getting double the number of enquiries per day than in pre-Covid times while Rashee Kuchroo, owner of a ten-year-old Delhi-based fresh pet food delivery firm that switched from offering freeze-dried to ready-to-eat pet meals during the lockdown, has seen a 20 per cent rise in demand per month in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and smaller cities “where the availability of meats is low.” “The pandemic has forced people to actually spend more time with their dogs,” says Kuchroo. “And they have learnt that a good quality diet can prevent a host of health issues,” adds Kuchroo, pointing out that the Indian market is “dominated by products of poor quality.”  Lack of government regulation on feed-grade meat adds to the wariness. “Nobody is quite sure about the kind of meat used in packaged foods,” says Nayan Shah whose eight-month-old fresh pet food delivery service in Mumbai already boasts over 70 clients across the city. While the firm has run into the odd vegetarian clients who chafe at the idea of frozen meats and some others who find the Rs 5000-odd-per-month meals expensive when compared to packaged dry food, “many clients have noticed an improvement in the digestive health and skin of the pets,” says Shah, whose company slow-cooks the meat and customises meals as per the weight and breed of the dog. To make the move from dry food to wet food easy for pets, Shah says they even offer a “transition period” of ten days where the pet is progressively introduced to their brand of chicken grubs and bone broths.  To be sure, “even a preservative-free diet of only chicken and rice or only milk and roti can be as dangerous as relying solely on packaged foods,” says Kuchroo. Vets advise finding a happy medium. “Many pet parents feel pets are like their children and don’t want to feed the pets food they will not eat,” says veterinarian Dr Amrita Deb, who typically suggests feeding pets an equal measure of fresh and dry food per day. Packaged food isn’t all bad, feels Deb, pointing out that many imported dry food brands in the market tend to meet the World Small Animal Veterinary Association’s pet food dietary guidelines that ask things like whether the meat was ethically sourced. “If pet owners are opting for fresh food, it’s essential to make sure they have a certified nutritionist,” says Deb.  Dr Dhananjay Pandit, the only veterinarian in the city who is also a certified pet nutritionist, warns about the recent rise of “quack nutritionists.” “Some advocate a complete raw-food diet while others advise going grain-free,” says Pandit, who once treated a dog who had developed kidney ailments because the owner was told carbs were the villain. “So, the pet was fed 80% meat. Pet food is about nutrients the dogs get in appropriate amounts as per their stage, activity, size and ailments while grain-free diets are only for pets who have a gluten allergy,” says Pandit. Meanwhile, Jain got this science somewhat right. Though Lola is the culprit behind the missing nose of the Kathakali dancer on her sofa cushion, Jain says the act didn’t stem from a deficiency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-demand-for-fresh-pet-food-spikes-as-owners-worry-about-nutrition/articleshow/85526164.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

---||Patna||Oppn unity move: It’s bumpy road ahead for Congress in Bihar||PATNA: Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Friday might have formally initiated the move to lead a united opposition front by holding a meeting of 19 political parties against the BJP-led NDA for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, but the strong regional parties are likely to ask for major share of the pie in terms of seats, as indicated by RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. Though Congress may not have problems in playing second fiddle to RJD in Bihar, as it has been doing for the last many elections, the other regional parties and satraps across the country may shatter the grand old party’s dream of coming back to power in lead role. Tejashwi admitted recently that Congress with a pan-India presence should be the fulcrum of any opposition coalition against the BJP-led NDA, but he also said it should allow regional parties to be in the driving seat in the constituencies other than the 200 where Congress was in a direct fight with the BJP, meaning thereby to leave around 60% of the seats for the allies to contest. Bihar Congress president Madan Mohan Jha admitted that RJD is a big party in the state, but it’s too early to say anything at this stage. “Sonia ji and Rahul (Gandhi) ji will think over the Tejashwi’s proposal and take a decision. We will abide by that,” Jha said. Reacting to the opposition move, BJP ally and JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi said RJD has been trying to gobble up whatever little space the Congress is left with in Bihar. “We are already in the driving seat in Bihar despite winning a smaller number of seats than our ally BJP. We are comfortable in NDA. Tejashwi’s statement will trigger a fight in the Congress-led UPA. RJD always treats the allies as an extension of its own,” Tyagi told TOI. But RJD Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha said Tejashwi has the right logic to fight against BJP. “Coalition of ideas and struggles among the opposition parties is more important at this stage than coalition of political parties,” Manoj told TOI. Though politics is always pregnant with possibilities and no one knows which party will stand where to serve its political and electoral interests in the coming days, the same is true about opposition unity in Bihar. The Left, especially the CPI(ML) after winning 12 out of the 19 seats it contested in the last assembly elections, and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi, which won five seats in the Seemanchal area, may threaten the unity move. The role of Chirag Paswan will also be a major factor as his LJP had 5.66% vote share in the 2020 assembly elections and 100% strike rate with 7.86% vote share against RJD’s 15.36% in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The split in LJP with his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras leading the other faction and becoming a Union minister will test the political strength of Chirag, whose decision to either contest alone or with NDA or RJD will be closely watched. The JD(U) will never like to bring him back to the NDA fold. BJP state general secretary Devesh Kumar, MLC, however, pooh-poohed the idea of opposition unity and said they are like amoeba and set to be fragmented. “Any alliance without specific agenda for governance is bound to collapse, as has happened in the past. The index of opposition disunity is very high. In Bihar, Left, particularly the CPI(ML), thinks that RJD could win that many seats (75) because of their cadre strength and may demand a greater number of seats to contest. There are also Pappu Yadav and AIMIM factors. Congress has ambition, but no base. There is Chirag Paswan factor as well and it would be interesting to see he remains with which side in the next election,” Devesh told TOI. The first test for any opposition unity will be the upcoming assembly elections in seven states, with Uttar Pradesh going to the polls with four other states early next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oppn-unity-move-its-bumpy-road-ahead-for-congress-in-bihar/articleshow/85522140.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

Pune police registered a criminal case for defamation and trademark infringement and under Information Technology Act on a complaint by Karad Urban Co-operative Bank. Sony Pictures Network India Pvt Ltd, represented by senior counsel Shirish Gupte, was seeking a stay as interim orders and quashing of prosecution initiated against them over a ‘calender’ in the background of a scene in the series. For the producers, senior counsel Amit Desai with counsel Vaibhav Bhure said the scene was “so fleeting” for few seconds and missable in the backdrop, with the calendar on the far wall, saying ‘Bank of Karaj’, not Karad, and the objection was to a ‘logo’ “purportedly of Bank of Karad, which filed the complaint. “The scene in its third episode shows protagonist Harshad Mehta meeting an official of the fictitious Bank of Karaj, Bombay,’’ said the petition by Nair. The logo was “not even prominently placed or properly visible’’, to draw viewers’ attention, the producer’s petition said. The bank said the logo resembled its trademark, damaging its “financial, commercial and social reputation’’.  Advocates Shekhar Jagtap and Sairuchita Chowdhary for Bank of Karad sought time to file an affidavit in reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-quash-fir-over-bank-logo-say-web-series-producer-network/articleshow/85526168.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Jewellers’ one-day strike against new gold hallmarking norm tomorrow||NAGPUR: Jewellers in the city affiliated to Nagpur Sarafa Association will be holding a day-long strike on Monday against hall marking unique ID (HUID) system, a recent addition to the gold hallmarking norm. The jewellery shops will remain shut as a mark of protest. The jewellers have already filed a petition in the Jabalpur high court against the rule. Hallmarking is a system of certifying the purity by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). HUID calls for hallmarking of each individual ornament, details of which have to be maintained by the jewellers. Even each of the purchasers’ details have to be uploaded. The move has left the jewellers ruffled. The ministry of commerce had made it mandatory to get the gold jewellery hallmarked from June 16 this year. This was followed by another order on HUID. Traders said that HUID, which calls for uploading the details of each and every ornament on the portal, has only made the process slow. It takes almost 10 days to get the piece back from the hallmarking agency after the process is over, they said. “This holds up the stock in trade at the hallmarking centres and the jewellers are not able to meet their commitment to buyers of delivering in time,” said Rakesh Rokde, secretary of Sarafa Association. Rokde said that if the government does not accept their demands, the agitation may be intensified. The jewellers had agreed to the hallmarking norm insisting that it should be allowed in the centres where the facility is available. “Initially, bulk jewellery in terms of weight was hallmarked, which was a smooth process. However, HUID has slowed down the procedure, due to which the stock remains held up at the hallmarking centre,” said Rokde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jewellers-one-day-strike-against-new-gold-hallmarking-norm-tomorrow/articleshow/85523078.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Goa||Dylan Fox, NorthEast United locked in contractual dispute over transfer clause||Panaji: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has refused to intervene in a contractual dispute involving Dylan Fox and NorthEast United FC. Fox had signed a six-month contract – October 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 – with NorthEast last season with the parties “mutually agreeing” to extend for another year, if the Australian played a minimum of 15 matches and the club does not lose more than seven games in the league stage of Indian Super League (ISL). Fox played 21 of the team’s 22 matches and NorthEast United lost just three games during the league stage. The defender had interest from other Indian Super League (ISL) clubs but was handicapped by his contract which prevented him from joining any Indian club for the 2021-22 season. “If he does so, then he shall be liable to pay a transfer fee of 40,000 US dollars to the club. However, he is free to join any other club outside India,” states clause 3.2 in his contract. Other foreign players are also known to have similar clauses in their contracts. Fox believes he has met his contractual obligations and should be allowed to sign for a club of his choice, without a transfer fee. The club, however, thinks otherwise. “As far as the club is concerned, we have a contract with the player and we are abiding by that,” said one official. To seek clarity, the Australian defender’s agent first wrote to the AIFF seeking their opinion on the contract. When the federation didn’t respond, Fox himself got in touch with the player status committee, only to be told that their hands are tied. According to the player status committee, they can only look into matters “pertaining to national dimension,” meaning both the parties should belong to the same national association. “Since you are an international player having an Australian passport, while NorthEast United is affiliated to AIFF, this makes it an international dimension. The AIFF player status committee does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon your matter,” the AIFF wrote to Fox last week. Instead, the player was asked to approach the Fifa dispute resolution chamber, as per Article 22 of the Fifa regulations on the status and transfer of players. “We suggest you to kindly write to Fifa player status department regarding your concerns, issues or seeking an opinion on the contract. If we get any directions fom Fifa in relation to your matter, then we will be happy to assist you,” AIFF said in their email to Fox.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dylan-fox-northeast-united-locked-in-contractual-dispute-over-transfer-clause/articleshow/85545558.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

A member of the DMK-led alliance, the VCK chief hailed the efforts of Congress president Sonia Gandhi in this regard. “It is necessary to form a formidable opposition ahead of the parliamentary election. There will be no problems in choosing the prime ministerial candidate but bringing the opposition together is the challenge,” he told reporters here on Saturday. Thirumavalavan felt that if former chief ministers Edappadi K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam had no connections with the Kodanad murder case, they need not fear a fresh probe into the case. Appreciating DMK government for appointing trained ‘archakas’ of all castes in temples run by Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE), Thirumavalavan wondered why those vocal about the need for unity among Hindus are opposing the ‘revolutionary’ step. “VCK will stand by DMK in the actions for ensuring social justice,” he said. He exuded confidence that chief minister M K Stalin would take a tougher stand against caste atrocities by ordering proper implementation of the existing Acts. VCK will welcome the caste-based census based on which reservation should be implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/opposition-must-unite-against-bjp-in-ls-poll-thirumavalavan/articleshow/85523129.cms||---
---||Surat||Corona victim docs’ kin yet to get aid||Surat: Shocked at the non-payment of insurance and aid money to the families of doctors who lost their lives due to Covid-19, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has decided to raise the issue with the government. Of the 1,500 doctors who died due to Covid, families of just 187 have so far received the aid of Rs 50 lakh, claimed IMA officials. Several national-level office bearers of the IMA, including its national president Dr J A Jaylal and general secretary Dr Jayesh Lele, were present in the city for IMA National Junior Doctors’ Network Leaders’ meet. Delegates from across the country participated in the meet. “Over 1,500 doctors have died due to Covid-19 of which families of only 187 have received the aid of Rs 50 lakh so far. IMA is going to raise this issue with the government and will demand financial aid for the remaining families. We have prepared the necessary documents for it,” said Lele. IMA has drafted a letter, stating their various demands, which will soon be submitted to the government. “Security and safety at work places are frequently threatened thus making the lives of our frontline junior doctors miserable. National IMA demands a central law to protect this noble profession against violence and professional insecurity,” the letter states. “Our young doctors have to face a lot of unwanted, impractical acts and rules which deter them from starting single doctor and small or medium clinics, which are major providers of quality and affordable health services to the vast poor population of the country,” the letter further states. The letter also raises the issue of medical science being questioned by many. “Modern medical science, in which our young doctors are shaping their future, is being attacked from various corners. Governments are unscientifically trying to promote mixopathy and crosspathy. Internship training of modern medicine doctors in Ayush Hospitals is totally unwarranted. The whole health system in the country is being run and ruled by the bureaucrats who are often not practical. This impedes the development of the medical sector,” the letter states. “There is a big variation in the stipend of interns from six thousand to thirty thousand. All interns in the country should be immediately paid a uniform stipend of Rs 30,000 or more per month. Variations exist in compensations of various levels of doctors,” it is started in the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/corona-victim-docs-kin-yet-to-get-aid/articleshow/85521534.cms||---

---||Lucknow||‘Crestfallen’ over demolition, Kalyan said history will fix responsibility||Lucknow: In the early nineties, police stations in UP used to put up photographs of top 10 criminals of their respective areas. Many of these criminals were rounded up while others were warned against creating any disturbance. In a short span of one-and-a-half years, then Chief Minister Kalyan Singh earned the sobriquet of a ‘tough administrator’. However, his tenure is remembered more for another event – demolition of the disputed structure in Ayodhya. While the opposition parties held Kalyan Singh responsible for the demolition, the then director, information, Anil Swaroop, wrote in his book, ‘Ethical Dilemmas of a Civil Servant’: “Mr Singh (Kalyan Singh) was “livid and crestfallen” on December 6, 1992, when he came to know that the structure had been brought down. Mr Singh, in a telephonic talk with the then Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhairon SinghShekhawat, had “reflected his angst against the party leadership”. He had also spoken to LK Advani, who was in Ayodhya then. Swarup claimed that he was “the only person” with Kalyan Singh when the conversations took place. He rose within party ranks as the OBC leader and a Hindutva mascot during the Ram Temple movement which made him the obvious choice as the first BJP chief minister of the most populous state. BJP old-timers like Rajendra Tiwari even claim that BJP leader Dr Murli Manohar Joshi was also nursing the ambition of becoming the Chief Minister of UP, however, senior pracharaks of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) like Kushabhau Thakre rejected any other claim citing Kalyan’s hard work as an OBC leader and the leader of Ram Temple movement. The Sangh firmly believed that it was Kalyan’s image as a champion of Hindutva that blended with his OBC leader’s image and ultimately paved the way for BJP winning a majority in 1991 assembly polls. Riding the Ram Temple wave, BJP won 221 seats in 1991 polls. Senior journalist Brijesh Shukla also said that Singh never wanted the structure to come down this way. During his meetings with RSS leaders, he used to say that there was no hurry and a stable government should be the priority. “If there is a BJP government, Ram Temple would ultimately be constructed,” he had said. “He was taking a sunbath when he was informed that the karsevaks had gone berserk at the disputed site. Singh immediately called then principal secretary, home, Prabhat Kumar and asked him to submit a report on the incident,” Shukla said. He added that though Kalyan never wanted the December 6 incident to happen, he made it clear to Kumar that at no cost he would order firing on karsevaks. Surprisingly, Kalyan never came up with his own version of the incident. On the evening of December 6, 1992, the party leadership asked him to step down as Chief Minister, sensing that the central government, led by Prime Minister PV Narsimha Rao, was planning to dismiss the government. On returning from the Governor’s House after tendering his resignation, Kalyan, while replying to a media query as to who was responsible for the demolition, had claimed: “Yeh itihaas tay karega (History will decide)”. On Kalyan’s reputation as a tough administrator, Shukla said, “There were reports of clashes in a west UP district and he came to know about the role of some RSS members in the incident. Despite knowing that any action against them would draw Sangh’s ire, he directed the officials to take stern action against the guilty.” In a meeting with RSS members, he got a dossier prepared about the role of some of the Sangh’s cadres and convinced them that his action was in the larger interest of the state. Another senior journalist JP Shukla said Kalyan Singh never withdrew any decision. He could post any bureaucrat anywhere. “When Kalyan Singh took over as the UP CM, he was all powerful. There was no one to oppose him. There was no murmuring around him whether inside or outside the party. This gave him the confidence to work on his terms,” Shukla said. “However, he could not make many policy decisions as his term was short-lived,” Shukla said. Singh took over as the CM in June 1991 and resigned on December 6, 1992.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/crestfallen-over-demolition-kalyan-said-history-will-fix-responsibility/articleshow/85526627.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

Marriage itself and a consequential conversion is deemed as an unlawful conversion attracting penal provisions”. The judges observed that from the perception of the common man, merely because conversion occurs because of marriage, “it per se cannot be held to be an unlawful conversion or a marriage done for the purpose of unlawful conversion”. On shifting the burden of proof on to the accused to establish that the marriage and later conversion had not taken place on account of any fraud, allurement or coercion, the court said, “This again puts the parties validly entering into interfaith marriage in great jeopardy.” It further recorded, “Prima facie interfaith marriages between two consenting adults by operation of the provisions of Section 3 of the 2003 Act interferes with the intricacies of marriage including the right to the choice of an individual, thereby infringing Article 21 of the Constitution.” In an interim order, the HC stayed the provisions in response to two petitions filed by Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind and an activist, Mujahid Nafees of the Minority Coordination Committee. Their lawyers raised various issues and stressed that the changes to the anti-conversion laws deprives a person of his or her right to choose a partner for marriage. It is a direct attack on the right to privacy. Besides, making a law aimed at restraining a person from embracing another religion by marriage is also in violation of provisions of Article 25 of the Constitution. The state government maintained that the law will apply only when elements of force, allurement or fraudulent means are found in conversion. The court asked on multiple occasions whether the law aimed at prohibiting interfaith marriages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/burden-of-proof-puts-interfaith-couples-at-great-jeopardy/articleshow/85523170.cms||---

The dispute between farmer K Gopalsamy and village assistant P Muthusamy took place at Kurukalaiyampalayam in Ottarpalayam on August 6. A video showing Muthusamy prostrating before Gopalsamy went viral the next day. The Annur police registered a case against Gopalsamy based on the complaint from village administrative officer V Kalaiselvi under sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and the IPC. Soon after, Gopalsamy went into hiding. Another video that surfaced on August 14 showed Muthusamy slapping Gopalsamy in front of Kalaiselvi. The incident is said to have taken place minutes before he prostrated before Gopalsamy. Following this, Muthusamy was booked by the police. After farmers in the region launched a protest seeking action against Muthusamy and Kalaiselvi, the district administration placed them under suspension on August 17. On August 20, a revenue department official lodged a police complaint seeking action against the person who recorded the video and released it in parts to create communal disharmony. Police booked a case under Section 153A (1) (b) (commits any act which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities, and which disturbs or is likely to disturb the public tranquility) of the IPC without naming anyone. Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, which staged a protest a couple of days ago, wrote to the chief minister seeking his intervention on Saturday. “The village administrative officer and the village assistant had submitted false information before the inquiry committee set up by the collector,” a representative said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/annur-dalit-case-man-who-recorded-video-booked/articleshow/85523162.cms||---

On Saturday, the civic body expanded vaccination centres to 35 locations, the highest ever organised so far covering two to three wards in a vaccination camp.As poor publicity was cited as one of the reasons for poor patronage, the corporation started using public address system in waste collection vehicles to inform the locations of the camps. Also, as people were hesitant to travel for taking the jab, the civic body said that locations at 35 spots were identified to enable residents to get the jab within a two-four kilometre radius. Usually, the city witnesses camps at 10-15 locations. Also, as the locals were citing the absence of either Covishield or Covaxin as the reason for not visiting the camp even if located closer, the civic body for the first time started administering both the vaccines at different spots within the same venue in all locations. Despite the rain-soaked morning, the vaccination centres covered at least 100 to 275 persons overall. The civic body said that certain locations were handpicked. Special arrangements such as red carpet welcome and adequate sitting benches were ensured in the camps organised in schools.“We have to cover all the eligible population. If we get more than 8,000 doses, extensive coverage can be made through as many camps possible,” Trichy corporation commissioner P M N Mujibir Rahuman told TOI. As the civic body started vaccinating those in the 18-44 age group extensively, the requirement for second dose of Covishield is expected to soar in the coming days. Similarly, the health department has increased the number of camps in 14 administrative rural blocks here by identifying poorly covered ones. The locations of the camps were shared in advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dists-alter-vax-strategy-as-numbers-dip/articleshow/85523166.cms||---

After organising the counselling for the transfer of the teachers, we will find out what are the requirements in the schools where the admissions have gone up.” Earlier, speaking at the district central library in Trichy, Poyyamozhi said that he has mooted an idea to encourage the students to maintain a library of their previous years’ textbooks, which would come in handy while preparing for UPSC exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tn-govt-firm-on-reopening-schools-on-sept-1-min/articleshow/85523161.cms||---

With Rakshabandhan being celebrated on Sunday, the bond between siblings is apparent even in organ donation, said IKDRC officials. “Women outnumber men manifold in terms of kidney donations. The trend is positively changing over past few years, but still the number is low,” said Dr Vineet Mishra, director of IKDRC. Recently a doctor gave her kidney to her brother, an IRS officer, at the hospital. “In majority of the cases, the kidney disease not only hampers quality of life, but also becomes life-threatening. Mothers, wives and sisters are often donors if the blood groups match. The brothers might be giving a gift to sisters, but for sisters, their donation is literally a gift of life,” said an IKDRC official. August is considered the month of awareness for organ donation, whereas August 13 is celebrated as World Organ Donation Day. “Cadaver organ donation will reduce the excessive burden on living donors in organs such as kidneys,” said Dr Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sisters-to-brothers-270-brothers-to-sisters-57/articleshow/85525156.cms||---

This followed dismissal of their petition by a local court. The family has preserved Shivank’s body in a deep freezer at their Sultanpur house after bringing Shivank’s body from Delhi on August 1.

Shivank’s father, Shiv Prasad, a retired soldier, claimed his son telephoned him just days before his death to inform he could be murdered or implicated in a criminal case. “Until a case is registered, I will not perform the last rites of my son. Till then his body will be preserved in a deep freezer,” he said.

---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: 11th century Chola era stone oil press found in Perambalur village||TRICHY: A group of archaeological enthusiasts has identified a Chola era stone oil press (Kal Sekku) in Vengalam village in Perambalur district. Based on the pattern of the Tamil script engraved on the press, epigraphists estimated that the object may belong to the 11th century. The stone oil press is still being used by the villagers to grind flour while celebrating festivals in a temple nearby. The team comprising M Selvapandian, Ramesh Karuppiah and P Vasanthan spotted the stone press near a Selliamman temple in the outskirts of Vengalam village. It measures 33cm in height and 71cm in diameter. The well of the press was 30cm deep and 20cm in diameter. The side portion of the press was engraved with a few lines in Tamil. Research scholar and iconographist Selvapandian said the script identifies ‘Malladi Naattan’ as the sponsor or maker of the stone press. “It must have been established for public use, probably to produce oil for lamps in temples or for food or medicinal purposes. There are similar stone oil press identified in Perambalur district but the one found in Vengalam village is the oldest one identified so far,” said Selvapandian. The readable script says the stone press was installed in ‘pandhal ambalam’ (community centre). Except for the top surface eroded due the weather, the rest of the stone structure is intact. “Vengalam village could have served as a mercantile town during Chola kingdom. There were other archaeological evidence that a merchant guild functioned in the village,” Ramesh Karuppiah, an archaeology enthusiast told TOI. Usually, the stone oil press installed centuries ago mentions the purpose of press but such a mention was not found in this one, Karuppiah added. Senjeri and Chandramanai Velur in the Perambalur district have such similar stone oil press but their period was classified as the 18th century.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/stone-oil-press-from-11th-c-found-in-perambalur/articleshow/85523205.cms||Deepak Karthik

The inauguration of the second phase of redevelopment took place in July 2015, but the work is yet to start, sparking angry reactions from stakeholders. In March 2019, the South Central Railway (SCR) had said RITES Ltd, a Government of India enterprise, would carry out the redevelopment work under phase two, which involves giving a facelift to the old station building and setting up a foreign currency exchange counter among other facilities. Railway activist Gautam Nahata said it is an irony that the railway station catering to Aurangabad, the tourism capital of Maharashtra, is waiting for redevelopment for the past six years. Earlier, the railway authorities had said the delay in the works was because the redevelopment project was being undertaken with the support of the tourism ministry. “We want to know what RITES Ltd did in the past two years ever since getting appointed as the project management consultancy. No start to the work at the railway station is a classic example of the failure of the project undertaken by two ministries,” Nahata said. SCR general manager Gajanan Mallya could not be reached for his comments. The division-level SCR authorities refused to comment .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/redevelopment-of-rly-station-yet-to-start/articleshow/85519838.cms||Prasad Joshi

As people from Kerala constitute a significant part of the Coimbatore population, the district administration had announced local holiday on Saturday, when the 10-day long festival concluded with thiruvonam celebrations. The Sidhapudur Sree Ayyappan temple, which was decorated with a colourful flower rangoli, witnessed large crowds from the morning. However, the temple was closed for devotees because of the restriction. People had darshan of the deity from outside the temple. “It would have been a fulfilling experience if we were allowed inside temple as it is one of the important aspects of Onam celebration,” said 40-year-old Aravind Kutty. “While restrictions are necessary to prevent further spread of Covid, people kept coming to the temple to see if it would open for a special darshan,” he said. Malayalees made flower rangoli, an integral part of the harvest festival, in front of their homes on Saturday morning. As food is an integral part of the celebrations, city hotels offered attractive combo of Onam sadhya and even took advance booking. While Onam was celebrated in educational institutions in a grand manner, this year, college and schoolteachers celebrated the festival over the last one week, which were largely subdued. Students attending online classes from home missed the rangoli competition and an opportunity to don traditional attire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coronavirus-dampens-onam-festivities/articleshow/85523232.cms||---

It would certainly reveal that people across the country want caste-wise headcount at least once so that actual population of each caste could be known,” Nitish said on Saturday while asserting that once completed, the caste census would be very beneficial for all in the country. Nitish, who will leave for Delhi on Sunday, said the PM has given appointment at 11am on August 23 and a list of the delegation members had already been sent to the PMO. State parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, who will part of the delegation, told TOI that Tejashwi Prasad Yadav would represent RJD in the delegation. Similarly, mines and geology minister Janak Ram would represent the BJP while Ajeet Sharma (Congress), Mehboob Alam (CPI-ML), Akhtarul Iman (AIMIM), Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM-S), Mukesh Sahani (VIP), Suryakant Paswan (CPI) and Ajay Kumar (CPM) will be the other members of the delegation. BJP has two deputy chief ministers in Bihar, but the party preferred Janak, an SC leader. Interestingly, deputy CM Renu Devi is the backward classes/extremely backward classes welfare minister in the state, but she was not asked to be part of the delegation. “The delegation would make a formal request to the PM for holding caste-wise enumeration of population during the Census 2021,” Choudhary said, adding, “Earlier, the Bihar assembly had passed unanimous resolutions on February 18, 2019 and again on February 27, 2020, seeking a caste-based headcount across the country during the forthcoming Census 2021.” Choudhary said copies of the assembly resolutions were sent to the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) and the census commissioner for taking necessary action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-to-meet-pm-on-aug-23-says-people-want-caste-census/articleshow/85523266.cms||Madan Kumar

Many of the culvert openings are not flagged properly to caution the commuters, resulting in the openings going unnoticed especially during rain and nights.Thillai Nagar, East Boulevard road, Woraiyur, Collector office road and other areas have such openings. While some were damaged due to wear and tear, some were kept open permanently to clear the recurring blockages in the drains. On normal days, commuters have a clear view of such openings, but the damp weather makes it tough to see them. “A culvert, which was opened in Thillai Nagar first cross 20 days back is still kept open. Pedestrians crossing the busy road notice the wide gap only at the last moment,” N N S Ganesh, a social activist said.“On Walajah road, a makeshift slab, metal plates and wooden poles were used to cover a broken culvert. It is highly risky during peak hour traffic,” R Sivakumar, a resident of Lingam Nagar said. Trichy corporation officials said that the broken culverts require a permanent solution. “We have planned to reconstruct the culverts in a phased manner. For time being, the openings will be overhauled temporarily,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/broken-culverts-give-nightmares-to-trichy-road-users-during-rain/articleshow/85523222.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: At 11,000 feet, country’s highest garden at Mana||DEHRADUN: India's highest-altitude herbal garden with 40 species of Himalayan herbs, including some that are extremely rare and endangered, has come up at a height of 11,000 feet in Mana — the last Indian village near Indo-China border. The garden spanning three acres was built on van panchayat land by the forest department and inaugurated by Mana village pradhan on Saturday. “We have established India's highest-altitude herbal garden with an aim to preserve the rich biodiversity of Himalayas which is under threat from climate change,” Sanjeev Chaturvedi, chief conservator of forests (research), Uttarakhand forest department told TOI. It took the forest department three years to gather the herbs — many of which are found in remote, inaccessible areas that remain snowbound for several months — and grow them in Mana. The harsh weather in the village posed challenges — it experiences snowfall for four months and severe rainfall for at least three months. “To provide the right conditions for the plants to grow here, we experimented with seeds, rhizomes and various scientific methods,” said Chaturvedi. The park is divided into four zones. The first zone has plants that generally grow at an altitude of 13,700 feet and above and have high medicinal value. It contains endangered Himalayan alpine species like Van Kakdi (podophyllum hexandrum) which is the only surviving species in its genus. The second zone houses Saussurea species, including the rare Brahma Kamal (saussurea obvallata) — the state flower of Uttarakhand. The third zone contains Ashtavarga species — a group of eight immune system boosters from the Himalayas. Among them are some extremely rare herbs like Kakoli (lilium polyphyllum), Ksheer Kakoli (lilium polyphyllum) and Rishbhak (malaxis acuminata). The fourth zone is dedicated to Badrinath shrine, which is located just 5km from Mana, and contains plants that are often offered to the deity. These include Badri Tulsi (origanum vulgare), Badri Ber (hippophae salicifolia) and the sacred Bhojpatra. Village pradhan Pitambar Singh Moolpa said Mana was proud to have “India’s first such high-altitude herbal garden”. Van panchayat sarpanch Veena Badwal added, “Herbs that grow at such high altitudes are vulnerable to climate change. Therefore, we donated the van panchayat land to this conservation program.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/at-11k-ft-countrys-highest-garden-at-mana-indias-last-village/articleshow/85519864.cms||Shivani Azad

The same day, 250 of his secondary contacts were made to undergo Covid-19 testing and 17 of them were found to be positive when results came on August 20.“We have cordoned off the entire street as containment zone. All the infected were shifted to the Covid care centre at Codissia trade fair complex. None of them are in critical condition and in need of oxygen support. They are kept under observation,” the official said.Deputy director of health services P Aruna, who inspected the locality on Saturday, said so many people wouldn’t have been infected if they had worn face masks properly. “During field visit, our staff members had spotted most of the people either without a face mask or wearing them improperly. While the staff asked them to adhere to the face mask etiquette, the response was lukewarm.”Pointing out that the area was congested with houses next to each other, Aruna said the virus transmission would be faster in such thickly populated areas, if people were not strictly following the precautionary measures. “We have sensitised others on the importance of wearing face masks and washing their hands and sanitising them at frequent intervals to keep the virus at bay.” The street, she said, was disinfected for the past three days. “Fever camps are being conducted to check if more people have symptoms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/improper-use-of-mask-caused-somanur-cluster/articleshow/85523218.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Saying ‘go and die’ not abetment of suicide: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: In a case of suicide by a 23-year-old who “owed” some money to the accused, the Bombay high court said that prima facie the extreme step due to “humiliation” or because he was scolded, confronted, threatened with action or had his father informed could not fall within the meaning of suicide caused by abetment. The high court granted bail for a bond of Rs 25,000 to the accused, who was arrested last month in Pune district. Justice Bharati Dangre on August 17 said: “The utterance of the words such as ‘go and die’, though humiliating, have been held not to amount to instigation and no offence of abetment of suicide is attracted.” The judge said a man behind bars since July 14 for offences of abetment of suicide and criminal intimidation deserved his release on bail on the condition that he would continue to render his cooperation to the investigating agency for the investigation. The accused had engaged the youth at his petrol pump. His counsel, Aniket Nikam, argued for his bail on merits saying no case of abetment was made out. Prosecutor S H Yadav said a suicide note revealed that the petrol pump attendant owed an amount to the accused and sought time for repayment and also expressed an apology to his family and the accused for the extreme step. “The genuineness of the suicide note is, of course, a matter of investigation and, even if it is accepted as written by the deceased, it does not indicate any instigation”, which would need intentional aid or any facilitation by the accused in commission of the act, said the high court order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-saying-go-and-die-not-abetment-of-suicide-in-mumbai/articleshow/85526215.cms||Swati Deshpande

He had taken his three cows to a nearby grazing field on Friday. “I heard a blasting sound after which one of my cows fell on the ground with wounds in its mouth,” Madevappa said. He lodged a complaint with the Thalavadi police, who registered the case and initiated inquiry. Preliminary probe revealed that 51-year-old M Amalraj, of Mariapuram village, had placed avuttukkai on the grazing field. “During interrogation, he has confessed to poaching small wild animals with avuttukkai regularly. We have seized for such bombs from his house and arrested him after registering a case against him,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/man-plants-bomb-near-str-to-poach-animals-arrested/articleshow/85523238.cms||---

The case was listed for hearing on August 21 and the three other accused in this case appeared in the court. Earlier, the court had issued an NBW against Sahu for non-appearance during court proceedings on may dates for over two years. Eleven people, including Sahu, now 59, were accused of killing a Jain couple inside their Bareilly house in the presence of their daughters in 1990. Four of the accused have died since then while one is on the run. Sahu, an influential leader of Samajwadi Party then, had allegedly transferred ownership of the timber merchant family’s property and feared that they might approach court. On June 11, 1990, Sahu and 10 others barged into the house, locked the daughters in a room and allegedly murdered the couple. The daughters later identified Sahu as the prime accused in court but the case never caught pace because of several reasons. The case completely lost its track after the case file was stolen in 2013 from the court record room. Additional district government counsel (ADGC) Suneel Singh said, “The case was heard on August 21 and three accused who were granted bail were present but Girdhari Lal Sahu didn’t appear. The NBW will continue against Sahu and the next date of hearing in this case is September 10.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/jain-couple-murder-case-ukhand-ministers-husband-skips-court-again/articleshow/85519928.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Ahmedabad||Ties that bind: Siblings keep memories alive||AHMEDABAD: This Rakshabandhan is set to be a sombre affair for many people who lost their brother or sister to the mayhem of the second Covid wave. Amidst the wave of grief, many have resolved to retain the bitter-sweet memories of their siblings and keep them alive in their hearts. “My baby brother and I shared so much love. We had so many differences yet we were so similar and so close. I shared all of my life’s happiest moments with him. Wherever he is, I am sure he is in a better place. He will be with me in my thoughts, always,” says Dr Lily Sen, a clinical psychologist, about her brother Neeleshwar Sen whom she lost on April 15. Sabarmati resident Radhika Bhavsar reminisces about brother Maulik, the owner of an upscale garage specializing in car parts and repairs in Sarkhej, who succumbed to Covid this year. “He would not miss Rakshabandhan for anything – his work would take him places, both in and out of Gujarat. But he would invariably be at my home in the evening to celebrate Rakhi if I could not catch him in the morning,” she says. Maulik with Mahi and Radhika“It will be the first Rakshabandhan in over three decades that I will not tie a rakhi on his hand. I am nonetheless putting one near his picture on Sunday,” she adds. A divorcee, Maulik had custody of his 10-year-old daughter Maahi. Radhika has started the procedure to legally adopt her. Maulik’s untimely departure was not the only tragedy the Bhavsar family had to endure. Radhika’s mother passed away on March 31, just a week ahead of Maulik. “Three of my family members were down with viral infection. To keep Maahi safe, I brought her to my house as we bond well. After Maulik’s death, I decided that she would not go anywhere,” says Radhika. “After all, I am her closest relative. My family including my husband and in-laws understood this perfectly and wholeheartedly supported my wish. It was the best day of my life. I am just keeping Maulik’s memory alive.” Students tied rakhis to corona warriors at Gujarat VidyapithDr Lily says she and her brother had rarely stayed apart. “We were a close-knit unit. In fact, my last conversation with my brother was ‘Nothing is going to happen to you. Come home and look after your dogs who are missing you sorely’ and then next day he was no more. Just like that. I wish to set up an animal shelter as a homage to his love for strays,” says Dr Lily who looks after the four dogs they had once shared. Her brother died on April 15 this year followed by the demise of her mother on May 15. Both succumbed to Covid. Dr Lily says Neeleshwar loved Rakshabandhan and he will be sorely missed and lovingly remembered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ties-that-bind-siblings-keep-memories-alive/articleshow/85525378.cms||---

---||Delhi||Highest August rain since 2007 sends Delhi reeling under water||NEW DELHI: “Where should the common man go to make themselves heard? When will we finally get relief from this severe waterlogging? Is there any agency that is answerable to the public or is a blame game their only strategy?” groaned B S Vohra, head of East Delhi RWAs Joint Front. Like him, frustrated Delhiites took to social media on Saturday to raise a collective sigh of resignation over the failure of the civic agencies in making the city flood proof. The record rainfall through Friday and early Saturday brought in its wake inundated roads and traffic gridlocks. Two buses were stuck under a bridge in east Delhi, while underpasses were submerged in several areas. The most telling image of the day’s wet havoc was a boat deployed to manage the situation at Pul Prahladpur, which has been deluged every time it has rained this year. Delhi traffic police said the situation returned to near normalcy after the waters receded in most places by Saturday afternoon. By then, two buses had been stranded under a bridge near Welcome metro station in east Delhi while underpasses and underbridges at Moolchand, Pul Prahladpur, Dwarka, Mother Dairy, Rajokri, Vivek Vihar, Tilak Bridge and Mangi Bridge went under. The situation was no better in inner colony roads and water entered the houses in colonies in the Walled city and East Delhi. Markets like Sadar Bazar were in knee-deep water as was the redeveloped Chandni Chowk. Train operations in Delhi were also impacted in the 8-11.30am period, with at least seven trains being rescheduled due to waterlogging between the New Delhi and Nizamuddin stations and between New Delhi and Old Delhi railway stations. “Though train operations resumed after 11.30am, there were delays,” said Deepak Kumar, CPRO, Northern Railway. The East Delhi Municipal Corporation reported a partial building collapse in Johripur and received waterlogging complaints from 16 regions, including Mayur Vihar, Patparganj, Old Kondli, Shastri Park metro station, Anand Vihar, East Vinod Nagar and IP Extension. In Shahdara, similar complaints came from Sonia Vihar, New Seelampur, Dilshad Garden, Shivaji Park, Naveen Shahdara and Old Mustafabad. SDMC reported waterlogging in some places in its south and central zones, though none from Najafgarh zone. There were 15 cases of trees falling in Govindpuri, Ring Road near Lajpat Nagar, South Extension II, Kalkaji, Nizamuddin West, Munirka, Mandakini Enclave Alaknanda, Panchsheel Enclave, CR Park and RK Puram Sector 3. Commuters were forced to spend hours stuck in traffic. Rahul Ashra said he progressed at snail’s pace in the Rajghat area for over three hours. “Why weren’t there police teams on the stretch? An ambulance was stuck in the jam and desperately seeking help,” Ashra said. Designed as it is to handle a maximum of 50mm of rain in a day, Delhi’s ageing drainage system was unable to cope with Saturday heavy downpour, measured at 138.8mm at Safdarjung weather stations. The crisis highlighted the need to expedite the implementation of a new drainage masterplan prepared by IIT-Delhi. The IIT-D report, accepted by Delhi government in 2019, took almost a decade to be finalised. Yet it remains on paper even today. Some of its recommendations are the restoration of the natural drain system, separation of sewage and stormwater drains and improvement in the effectiveness of drain desilting with public display of work and certification on completion. Multiple agencies and absence of a framework have plagued Delhi’s drainage. To manage the 3,700-km network of stormwater drains, Delhi has 10 agencies, including the corporations, PWD, DSIIDC, DDA and the state govt’s flood control department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/highest-august-rain-since-2007-sends-delhi-reeling-under-water/articleshow/85523265.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Brother donates kidney to elder sister||NEW DELHI: On the eve of Rakshabandhan, a 28-year-old man gave the gift of life to his elder sister beset with prolonged dialysis of her kidneys. The brother donated his kidney to his elder sister, who risked losing her life due to kidney failure after prolonged dialysis. Hailing from Rohtak in Haryana, the 31-year-old woman had been suffering from kidney problems for five years and had been on medical treatment for long and neglected her high blood pressure causing damage to her kidneys, doctors at Aakash Healthcare said here.“Unfortunately, like many other patients, she had also fallen victim to the myths regarding dialysis and delaying the initiation, which worsened her condition. Around three years ago, her condition deteriorated suddenly and she was admitted to an ICU,” the doctors said. “There, she was diagnosed with tuberculosis due to her poor immunity and her lungs were filled with fluid due to heart failure,” they said. The delay in dialysis and uncontrolled blood pressure had led to weakening of her heart, they said. Her dialysis began immediately along with other treatments, good diet and rehabilitation that led to improvement in her health. However, after assessing her overall condition, and considering her young age, doctors advised a kidney transplant. Dr Vikram Kalra, additional director, department of nephrology and kidney transplant, Aakash Healthcare, Dwarka, who transplanted the kidney, said, “Her prolonged high blood pressure was caused by the initial kidney disease which was not addressed properly. This led to rapid progression of kidney failure and damage to other organs. She required dialysis thrice a week in the hospital and later underwent a kidney transplant." According to the senior doctor, diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension) are the most common causes of kidney disease.  Ninety per cent of patients affected with kidney disease have high blood pressure, but overall, five out of 100 hypertension patients may face kidney damage. “Many in her family volunteered to be the live donor. Her husband was the first one but he was not a fit candidate as their blood groups did not match.Fortunately, her brother's blood group matched and we completed the transplant in a five-hour-long surgery. It was a challenging surgery because her heart was pumping at only 25% capacity, the risk of pulmonary oedema (accumulation of excess fluid in the lungs) remained”. However, the transplant was successful since her body accepted the organ and her heart function improved as well. “She can lead a normal life of a young, married woman she can even become a mother when she chooses,” he said. “My sister was suffering a lot. It was unbearable. When the doctors said that I can donate because our blood groups matched and answered all our questions, I did not think twice before agreeing to give her a kidney from my body. She is very precious to me and I am very happy that she can live a happy life from now on,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bro-donates-kidney-to-elder-sister/articleshow/85526229.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Jai Ganesh Cong's battle cry for U'khand polls: Harish Rawat||Dehradun: All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat on Saturday said that the Congress will not allow the BJP to “hijack the word Hindu for political gains” and that ‘Jai Shri Ganesh’ would be the party’s battle cry for polls scheduled in the hill state early next year. Rawat, who is heading the state election campaign committee for 2022, said, “They (BJP) have reduced Hindus to a mere vote bank. I am not going to allow this. We are followers of Sanatan Dharm which preaches harmony and peace among people and religions. The BJP, however, is more inclined towards creating differences among people in the name of religion and caste.” The veteran leader, back from his successful mediation in the messy tuff battle in Punjab between Capt Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu, said that the slogan ‘Jai Shri Ganesh’ would drive the party’s election campaign in the state. “Before beginning any auspicious work, Lord Ganesh is remembered and worshipped which is why we have selected this slogan. ‘Shri Ganesh’ is a reference to a new beginning and Lord Ganesh is known as Vighnaharta (the destroyer of all obstacles).” Earlier, Rawat had said that if voted to power, the Congress would restart welfare policies launched during his previous tenure. “We have decided to give a subsidy amount of Rs 200 on LPG cylinders to women and double the pension for widows. Our focus will be to create job opportunities and strengthen the state’s infrastructure,” he said. The party has announced a ‘parivartan yatra' from September 3. The yatra will be conducted in four phases starting from Khatima, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami’s home turf. In the second phase, the yatra will go through Kumaon division while six districts of Garhwal would be covered in the third leg. The fourth and final phase of the yatra would be through Haridwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/jai-ganesh-congs-battle-cry-for-ukhand-polls-harish-rawat/articleshow/85519969.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: After season’s max rain, light shower today||NEW DELHI: The capital woke up wet and flooded after strong overnight showers on Saturday. The Safdarjung weather station, Delhi’s base station, recorded 138.8mm of rainfall till 8.30am — the highest rainfall in a single day so far this year. This is also the highest single-day precipitation recorded in August since 2007, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). The last time Delhi recorded more rainfall in a single day in August at Safdarjung was on August 2 fourteen years ago, when it logged 166.6mm of precipitation. On Saturday, at least four stations recorded ‘very heavy’ rainfall, including Safdarjung, each entering more than 115.5mm of rainfall in the logbook. The Ridge station received the highest single-day rainfall recorded so far this year at any location in Delhi at 149.2mm. IMD has forecast light showers for Sunday, with very light rain likely again on Monday before another dry spell between August 24 and August 27. Met officials said while an ‘orange’ alert for moderate and possibly heavy rainfall was issued for Saturday, the monsoon trough moving towards the north led to a dense formation of clouds over Delhi-NCR, bringing intense showers between 2am and 8am. “While the capital recorded light rain on Friday, most of the rain occurred after midnight, carrying on till 8-9 am,” said a met official. There was ‘light’ rainfall in the afternoon and ‘light to moderate’ precipitation in the evening in central and north Delhi. Safdarjung added 4.7mm till 5.30pm to the 138.8mm it had received till 8.30 am. “Towards the evening, a cloud belt again passed through northern and central parts of Delhi, leading to rainfall and thunderstorm activity once again,” said a met official. The Ridge station recorded 149.2mm of rainfall till 8.30am and another 21.9mm till 5.30pm. Lodhi Road, meanwhile, received 149mm in the morning and an additional 4.1mm over the next nine hours. The Sports Complex station in east Delhi was the fourth station to record ‘very heavy’ rainfall in the morning, logging 124.5mm till 8.30am. IMD claimed it was not abnormal to record a ‘very heavy’ rainfall spell in August, particularly towards the end of the month. Overall, this is the ninth highest single-day spell of showers in the month of August. Recent one-day measures of heavy rainfall include 166.6mm in 2007 and 159.8mm on August 14, 2001. The all-time record for a single day’s rainfall in August is in 1961 when Delhi received 184mm on August 2. Overall, Delhi’s monsoon is in the ‘normal’ category so far, having received an average rainfall of 478.3mm between June and August 21 against the normal rainfall measure of 417.6mm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-seasons-max-rain-light-shower-today/articleshow/85523300.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Ahmedabad||HUID: Jewellers in Gujarat to observe shutdown tomorrow||AHMEDABAD: Joining the nationwide protest over the implementation of Hallmarking Unique ID (HUID) some jewellers across Gujarat will observe a total shutdown on Monday. The nationwide strike call has been announced by the All India Gems and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC) against the arbitrary implementation of HUID. Jewellers have cited abysmal delays that are triggered due to the HUID implementation, causing piling up of gold at hallmarking centres in Gujarat and increase in order pendency. Jigar Soni, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA), said, “The procedure that has been laid out for obtaining hallmarking on jewellery is so cumbersome that the turnaround time for getting a jewellery hallmarked has gone up to a minimum of five to seven days instead of a day. This is causing a massive increase in pendency of jewellery orders and our customers are forced to wait, as a result of which our business is hit.” Industry estimates suggest that Gujarat is home to thousands of jewellers. Mandatory gold hallmarking came into force from June 16 in a phased manner and the government has identified some 256 districts from 28 states and union territories for the phase-1 implementation. Around 150 jewellers, who are members of the Vadodara Jewellers Association, will also join the nationwide strike of jewellers on Monday. “All showrooms and shops of our members will remain closed on Monday as a token strike,” said Atul Shah, president of Vadodara Jewellers Association. Shah said that it is a myth that jewellers are opposing purity. “We are for purity and we welcome hallmarking. But we are against the wrong implementation of HUID as it will put at risk security of customers. If customers HUID gets hacked, any person can know that who purchased jewellery from a particular store which will put life of the customer at risk and there will be no safety of the jewellery,” he said. Jewellers from Surat and state are protesting the recent modification related to Hallmarking on Monday. “Up to Hallmarking we have no issues but other related mandatory requirements are unnecessary. We have made representation in the past as well," said Nainesh Pachchigar, chairman, Gujarat advisory board in Indian Bullion Jewellers Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/huid-jewellers-in-gujarat-to-observe-shutdown-tomorrow/articleshow/85523307.cms||---

A probe has been ordered. Based on a complaint by the college committee members, a case has been registered against 12 people, including the students. “We are gathering more CCTV footage of the incident to identify more people involved in the incident,” said Moradabad superintendent of police Amit Kumar Anand. The girls allegedly vandalized the college property and created a ruckus. College authorities told police that they barged into the principal’s office and broke the windowpanes and later, damaged property in the staff room and classrooms. A teacher and a staff member were injured. The students of Class XII have been staging protests after they were declared “fail” in the UP Board exams as they were marked “absent” in the pre-board exams on the basis of which the results were declared by the Board. However, due to continued agitation, the girls were later declared “pass” but were not given their marksheets. Furious, the students on Thursday first staged a protest at the collectorate and later, entered their college and allegedly went berserk. A video of the purported incident had gone viral on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/class-xii-girl-students-guardians-vandalize-college-property-attack-staff-booked/articleshow/85519978.cms||Maria Khan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray attacks Narayan Rane-led yatra, police add 20 FIRs||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Saturday that to serve their interests, political parties should not do anything which endangers the lives of the public. His words came after the Jan Ashirwad Yatra led by union minister Narayan Rane of the BJP in the city on Thursday and Friday, in which the police filed 20 more FIRs against the organisers. The total number of FIRs filed rose to 39. The charges relate to violation of Covid-19 safety protocols. The four newly inducted central ministers of state from the BJP joined the Jan Ashirwad Yatra through the week, which is taking place across 22 states. In Thane, too, the police registered a case against four BJP functionaries, including two corporators, for the yatra led by union minister of state Kapil Patil last Sunday. Thackeray appealed to all political, religious and social organisations to avoid events that led to crowding since the pandemic was not over yet. “The threat of Covid-19 still looms large. People should not let their guard down. If rules are not followed, the third wave will hit us sooner than anticipated,” said Thackeray. He was speaking to the media after inaugurating a 30-bed Covid-19 care centre in Kalina for children. He said the government had eased restrictions only to keep the economic cycle moving. “It has to be made clear once again that the oxygen production in the state has not increased significantly. Once the oxygen usage in the state crosses 700MT, we will have to impose a lockdown in the state once again. If a lockdown has to be avoided, citizens must not fall prey to any provocation,” said Thackeray. In connection with Rane’s rallies, the Ghatkopar and Khar police stations recorded two cases each, while Mulund, Vikhroli, Bhandup, Pantnagar, Santacruz, Powai, MIDC, Saki Naka, Meghwadi, Goregaon, Charkop, Borivli, Vanrai, Kurar, Dahisar and MHB Colony police stations recorded a single case each. In Thane, the BJP functionaries slapped with a case were Manohar Sugdhare, Vilas Sathe and corporators Sanjay Waghule and Bharat Chavan. The case filed was for violating Covid-19 rules. The complaint said the organisers had set up the stage without permission and attracted a large crowd by playing songs. It said that despite the Covid-19 rules, Kapil Patil came to the venue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uddhav-attacks-rane-led-yatra-police-add-20-firs/articleshow/85525322.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Commuters demand 5 standees in buses in Mumbai||MUMBAI: With daily ridership rising upto 25 lakh, commuters in BEST buses are now demanding that at least 5 standees should be ‘legally’ allowed to board the vehicle. This will reduce the wait time at stops by 10-20 minutes. At present, government rule bars passengers from entering the bus once all seats are full. “Nobody is allowed to travel standing in the bus,” warned BEST's spokesperson Manoj Varade. TOI has noticed that at a few stops such as the one at Kamani in Vidyavihar, there are arguments between passengers and bus inspectors and with conductors. In some places, the passengers disregard the government rule on standees and "force their way" inside the bus. With the conductor unable to control the crowd, there are instances of buses running packed during peak hours on a few routes. “The buses don't have good frequency and we cannot be left stranded, So, it's better to board the bus and travel standing even if this is illegal,” said an angry commuter from Bhandup, requesting anonymity. “The buses depart from its originating (first) point filled with passengers, but leaving behind several commuters waiting at the stop in frustration.

---||Goa||Expedite claims of Madgaum Urban bank’s depositors: HC to liquidator||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has directed the liquidator of Madgaum Urban Co-operative Bank S V Naik to take necessary steps expeditiously to provide relief to depositors from Curtorim, Macazanna, St Jose de Areal, Raia and others. “The liquidator will have to pursue the matter with Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), so that at least depositors maintaining balance of less than Rs 5 lakh receive the amount up to Rs 5 lakh, in terms of the insurance scheme. Even the depositors maintaining a deposit of above Rs 5 lakh will be entitled to receive the amounts up to Rs 5 lakh under the scheme,” the court held. “The liquidator should process all such claims as expeditiously as possible so that there is no undue delay in the matter,” stated the division bench comprising Chief Justice of the Bombay high court Dipankar Datta and Justice Mahesh Sonak. The residents from Curtorim and neighbouring villages in Salcete, in a letter to the high court in September last year, stated that almost 8,000 account holders mostly agriculturists, fishermen, tenants and labourers had deposited their hard-earned earnings in the bank, which had now gone into liquidation. They stated that they were not being permitted to withdraw any amount over Rs 5,000 from their bank accounts in terms of directives dated May 3, 2019 issued by the RBI and highlighted the immense difficulties faced by them, particularly during Covid-19 pandemic on account of being unable to access their bank accounts. During the pendency of the petition, the limit for withdrawal was enhanced from Rs 5,000 to Rs 30,000 and on January 19, the high court directing RBI to consider whether the limit could be further enhanced to Rs 50,000 since Adv C A Coutinho, the counsel for the bank, submitted that the grievances of no less than 49,500 depositors from out of a total of 58,000 depositors would be redressed with the enhancement of such limit. Assistant general manager of RBI, Sandra Rodrigues submitted to the high court on August 17 that in the present situation, where an order of liquidation or winding up of an insured bank has been made, every depositor in respect of his deposit in the bank shall be entitled to receive up to Rs.5 lakh from in accordance with the provisions of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, 1961. The court was told that almost 55,999 depositors had deposits of less than Rs 5 lakh with the bank and such depositors would therefore be entitled to receive amounts up to Rs 5 lakh from DICGC. This would leave about 636 depositors having a deposit of over Rs 5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/expedite-claims-of-madgaum-urban-banks-depositors-hc-to-liquidator/articleshow/85525381.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: When Kalyan Singh had a face-off with mentor Atal Bihari Vajpayee||LUCKNOW: Kalyan Singh was at the centre of the long-standing schism that engulfed the BJP during his second tenure as UP Chief Minister in 1998. At the time when the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led coalition government at the Centre was grappling with internal contradictions, Kalyan upped the ante saying a section of party leaders were hatching a conspiracy to oust him from the office by tarnishing his image. Singh’s relations with Vajpayee turned sour in 1997 when the BJP formed a coalition government with the Kanshiram-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). A new power-sharing formula was mooted where Kalyan Singh and Mayawati had to serve as CM for six months on rotation. Mayawati, whose tenure was about to end in September 1997, started showing signs of restlessness. Kalyan sensed foul play and thought that Vajpayee was trying to strike an alliance with the BSP at the national level while allowing Mayawati to occupy the CM’s chair in UP. BSP eventually ended the alliance with the BJP, forcing Kalyan Singh to form the government with the help of rebel MLAs in BSP, Congress and JD (U). However, he had to resign in November 1999, allegedly under the pressure of party leadership, and was replaced by Ram Prakash Gupta. This agitated Kalyan, who, reportedly, termed Vajpayee a “Brahminwadi conspirator”. In 1998-99, when the Vajpayee government lasted for only 13 months, differences between the two leaders came out in the open. During a press conference in 1999, when fresh Lok Sabha elections were about to be conducted, Kalyan made a covert jibe at Vajpayee: “PM banne ke liye MP bhi banna padega…” Though Vajpayee won from Lucknow, BJP’s strength in UP got reduced from 58 Lok Sabha seats in 1998 to 29 in 1999. Voices againstKalyan grew stronger and his relationship with a woman corporator also became the talk of the town. He stopped all communications with Vajpayee, who he thought was supporting leaders conspiring against him. Kalyan Singh’s terms with the then UP BJP chief Rajnath Singh and urban development minister Lalji Tandon also got strained when the duo reportedly complained to the central leadership about his style of functioning. The biggest complaint against him was that he was inaccessible to party MLAs and didn’t treat them well. Vajpayee, who was already preoccupied with finding ways to mollify various constituents of the coalition government, had to intervene. Vajpayee held prolonged meetings with Kalyan in the presence of Rajnath. BJP leaders claim that Kalyan was asked to mend his ways even though he was acknowledged as the “most popular” BJP leader in UP. The conflict is learnt to have emanated from the struggle between the upper caste and the backward caste groups. The problem got aggravated by the allegations of corruption and differences between the BJP and the Loktantrik Congress, led by Congress defector Naresh Agarwal. Kalyan forged an alliance with the group of Thakur leaders led by Rajnath. It, however, collapsed in the wake of Kalyan’s apparent feeling of insecurity stemming from the increasing clout of Rajnath, who was also unhappy as he was denied a say in the affairs of the government. Sensing the conflict between two leaders, then urban development minister, Lalji Tandon, patched up with Rajnath and reportedly even agreed to support his candidature for the CM’s post. Even as the new group started enlisting the support of MLAs to overthrow Kalyan, Tandon found himself in the midst of a row following a CAG report that pointed at the financial mismanagement of the Ambedkar park project, initiated during the previous BJP-BSP regime led by Mayawati. Tandon, according to reports, had then created a flutter by claiming that the report was deliberately leaked by officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/when-kalyan-singh-had-a-face-off-with-mentor-atal/articleshow/85526727.cms||Pankaj Shah

Minto Bridge, Rajghat, Connaught Place, Moolchand, Azad Market and ITO were among worst-affected areas. Due to waterlogging, Delhi Traffic Police closed several crucial underpasses and traffic moved at a snail’s pace at many stretches. It was a harrowing time for commuters through the day. The traffic police, however, took to Twitter to regularly inform commuters about road closures. “Traffic is affected at Moolchand Underpass due to waterlogging,” the traffic police tweeted at 7.43am. Before that, it warned commuters at 7.27am to avoid Minto Bridge while informing that both carriageways had been closed due to waterlogging. The traffic remained heavy due to waterlogging at Mehram Nagar Underpass, Dwarka Underpass and Bijwasan Flyover. The Azad Market underpass was closed while traffic was affected at Moolchand Underpass. Both carriageways from Rajghat and Shantivan were choked by 9am. Around this time, the traffic police also tweeted about waterlogging and jams at stretches like Rajdhani Park Metro Station to Mundka, Nangloi to Najafgarh Road and towards Bakkarwala. The alerts about ITO and adjacent areas were coming in till 2.30pm. With a respite for a short span of time, the jams were back in the afternoon and were reported on till late evening. “Traffic affected due to waterlogging at GTK Depot, kindly avoid using this route. Traffic diverted from Mukarba Chowk to Outer Ring Road and Azadpur to Road No. 51,” the traffic police tweeted at 4.36pm. Severe waterlogging was reported from Pul Prahladpur Underpass, while traffic was interrupted at MB Road and diverted on Mathura Road. Other major stretches and traffic points flooded with rainwater included Dhaula Kuan to Gurgaon with traffic moving in one lane, Rajdhani Park Metro Station to Mundka, Nangloi to Najafgarh Road, MB Road, stretches around Kashmere Gate Metro Station, Sanjay T-point, Chhatta Rail Chowk, Monkey Bridge, Iron Bridge, etc. Due to waterlogging near Chirag Dilli, traffic on Press Enclave Road and lanes within Malviya Nagar were affected till around 10.30pm.

Traffic moved slowly at South Extension, Lajpat Nagar, Mathura Road, Pragati Maidan too. “We provided live updates about the situation to civic agencies. They were being simultaneously asked to pump out water from affected areas. Motorists were asked to avoid the affected stretches through social media handles of Delhi Traffic Police,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/commuters-face-harrowing-time-as-major-stretches-hit-by-flooding/articleshow/85523355.cms||---
---||Mumbai||At Air India Express, new rule, no ‘Sir’ in the cockpit||MUMBAI: In a bid to rejig the power gradient in the cockpit, Air India Express has instructed its first officers to address the pilot-in-command, not as ‘Sir’, but by their first name or simply as ‘Captain’. The operations circular issued on Friday referred to the October 2018 Trichy accident in which an Air India Express aircraft had a tail strike, then hit a ground-based navigation aid and finally took down the upper portion of the airport boundary wall before it took off for Dubai. The eventful take-off left the aircraft with a fissured underbelly. According to the final investigation report released last month by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, the trigger was a sudden and unexpected reclining of commander’s seat during the take-off roll. As the seat reclined, the commander inadvertently pulled back the thrust lever, reducing the power on the engines. Both the pilots did not register the fall in thrust and take corrective action, said the report, deeming it a breakdown of crew co-ordination__essentially, communication failure between the pilots. “It is proposed that in order to improve cockpit resource management [communication process in multi-crew cockpit] and reduce trans-cockpit-authority-gradient, a more informal cockpit environment is required. This many be a generational and culture shift which has built up over the years and may take time to be fully accepted and reap results,” said the Air India Express circular which issued the instruction that pilots-in-command be either called by their first name or “Capt”. Captain Amit Singh, an air safety expert, said: “In Indian culture, calling a senior by the first name doesn’t go down well generally, especially in organisations like Air India Express. A 55-year old ex-IAF commander, would not be like a 25-year old co-pilot to address him by his first name. That’s a huge leap. But calling the PIC [pilot-in-command] ‘Capt’ would work. The whole organisation culture has to change, like it has in some low-cost carriers. You cannot ask the co-pilots to not use ‘Sir’ in the cockpit and then expect them to use it in the office environment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-at-air-india-express-new-rule-no-sir-in-the-cockpit/articleshow/85526245.cms||Manju V

---||Chennai||Chequered history of Madurai mutt keeps succession row alive||By R RangarajThe 292nd pontiff of the Madurai Adheenam Sri Arunagirinathar who died on August 13, was a colourful and controversial swami. From being caught carrying arms, to taking on a minister and promoting godman Nithyananda despite sexual allegations against him, the pontiff had a brazen way of doing things. A less-known incident took place on October 17, 1983, when he brandished a revolver at a public meeting in Tamil Nadu, after which the Trichy police filed a case against him and his security personnel. Among the charges made against him were possession of rifles and a revolver without licence.The pontiff had then made a call for support to the Sri Lankan Tamil militants’ struggle for Tamil Eelam. He also sent telegrams to the Prime Minister and the chief justice of the Madras high court demanding the removal of the minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, R M Veerappan, who he said was instigating the Trichy police to foist a case against him.The telegram of the Adheenam head was admitted as a writ petition. As per the documents filed in court, the telegram from the pontiff warned Tamils of the genocide in Sri Lanka and urged them to stand against it despite the Sinhalese violence. Police report recorded the seizure of three weapons after a search of the mutt premises, the pontiff’s ancestral house and the house of one Rajomani Ammal. The inspector said in his counter-affidavit that the allegations that the HR&CE minister had instigated police to foist a case were unfounded. The court later turned down the demand for removal of minister Veerappan and dismissed the petition.The pontiff had been known to make statements of a political nature from time to time, initially a supporter of the DMK, and later of the AIADMK, when J Jayalalithaa was chief minister. Sri Arunagirinathar also took part in an agitation in 1985 demanding retrieval of Katchatheevu island from Sri Lanka.Before coming under the aegis of the mutt, Arunagirinathar was a reporter of Tamil daily ‘Tamil Murasu’, and was seen every day at the police commissioner’s office premises in Egmore to gather crime news. After his father reportedly developed strong contacts in the Adheenam, Arunagirinathar was appointed junior pontiff. His elevation was fast. After the death of the 291st guru, he was appointed pontiff on March 14, 1980.The pontiff’s most controversial move was the appointment of Nithyananda (above) as his successor in 2012, when the self-styled godman was facing charges of having a relationship with a mutt inmate. (Bengaluru police had arrested him in Shimla in 2010 in connection with various cases. He was later let out on bail). After Sri Arunagirinathar received a donation of `1 crore from Nithyananda, the latter was crowned and presented a sceptre. Nithyananda took charge and began performing all the religious and spiritual duties, and performed ‘annadhanam’ too. However, after several writ petitions challenged this appointment, and 13 Shaivite mutts opposed the coronation, Sri Arunagirinathar had to revoke the appointment. The HR&CE department also quashed the appointment.Nithyananda was restricted by the court from entering the mutt, but this order was partially modified allowing him to enter the mutt as a devotee. Nithyananda’s petition seeking to quash the Adheenam order revoking his appointment, besides other petitions are pending in the courts. The issue of successor to Sri Arunagirinathar may continue to be fought in courtrooms as Nithyananda makes a fresh bid. Even as the end came near for the 292nd pontiff last week, his chamber at the Madurai Aadheenam was sealed by the pontiff of the Dharmapuram Adheenam, Masilamani Swamigal from Mayiladuthurai, seen as a bid to prevent Nithyananda from occupying the seat of the Adheenam.The Adheenam seeks to elevate junior pontiff, Sundaramoorthy Thambiran, as the 293rd guru. He had earlier served in the Shaivite maths at Kundrakudi, Dharmapuram and Thiruvaduthurai. The other Shaivite Adheenams of the state are exerting pressure on the Tamil Nadu government to support their choice of a pontiff in keeping with the Shaivite traditions of the Madurai Adheenam, and preventing a comeback bid by Nithyananda.The Tamil Nadu government, which usually stays away, had in 2012 told the court that it would take over the mutt in view of the various charges against the institution, and that the appointment of Nithyananda as pontiff was illegal. It remains to be seen if the present DMK government would continue on the same line and take over the Adheenam or back the move of the other Adheenams to have a new pontiff of their choice.Meanwhile, Nithyananda who issued a statement from the land of ‘Kailasa’ condoling the death of Sri Arunagirinathar, announced 13-day mourning, and said he would confer sainthood on Sri Arunagirinathar. He also declared himself as the 293rd pontiff of the Madurai Adheenam and announced that he had taken charge. Over the past few years, Nithyananda has created a buzz by declaring that he had set up a Kailasa nation, with its own currency, and invited people to join the nation as e-citizens. All these pronouncements were made using the Twitter handle, even as the Union government said it had no knowledge of his whereabouts. This invited derisive comments from netizens who have trolled the godman for his claims, as well as the Union government for its ‘inability’ to track down the man. The events in the next few months could get curiouser and curiouser.(The writer is a senior journalist)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chequered-history-of-madurai-mutt-keeps-succession-row-alive/articleshow/85515666.cms||---
---||Delhi||A rakhi gift of liver from sisters saves teen brother||NEW DELHI: A 14-year-old boy, who was terminally ill with liver failure, has received a new lease of life, thanks to his two elder sisters. The child’s siblings donated portions of their liver to him for a challenging transplant surgery, doctors said on Saturday. Akshat, the teenager from Budaun in Uttar Pradesh, was fighting for his life just over a month ago due to liver failure resulting in deep jaundice. The case was made even more complex since the patient was overweight, weighing around 92 kg. Dr Neelam Mohan, director, paediatric liver diseases and transplantation at Medanta hospital said while two of his sisters, Neha (29) and Prerna (22), were eligible donors but weighed much less. Therefore, she added, the teenager required half-a-liver from both his sisters. To fit in both halves while keeping him from sinking through the long surgical procedure was challenging, said Dr A S Soin, chairman, Medanta Liver Transplant Institute and chief surgeon in the case. The first-of-its-kind surgery for a critically-ill child that put all three siblings on the operating table together was a tough one, not just for the doctor’s team, but also the parents. “For a successful transplant, it is essential that the transplanted liver weighs at least 0.8% to 1% of the patient's body weight. In this case, a single donor liver half weighed only 0.5 to 0.55% of the recipient's weight. Hence, two liver halves were needed to make up the required liver volume,” he said, adding that they were delighted that the procedure worked out well. While the initial period of recovery in ICU was complex for the patient, all the three siblings recovered well, the doctors said. “The story of these siblings will certainly bring cheers to the family on the occasion of Rakshabandhan,” Dr Mohan said. “This is a unique example of the power of organ donation to save lives. It draws attention to the fact that any healthy person can save a loved one’s life by donating half their liver or a single kidney without suffering any harm,” said Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director, Medanta Hospital in a statement by the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-rakhi-gift-of-liver-from-sisters-saves-teen-brother/articleshow/85526242.cms||---

A total of 11 nails, including one of a tiger with locket, have been seized by the forest officials. A bigger interstate racket is expected to be involved, the forest department officials said. Investigating officer in this case, Mahesh Zanjurne, assistant conservator of forests, said, “The forest department and wildlife crime control bureau officials were closely monitoring the two suspects for the past few days. On Monday, Dinesh Rawal came near a shop at Krushna Naka in Karad with two tiger nails and was caught in a trap laid by us. Later, another accused Anup Revankar was taken into custody from a shop in Ravivar Peth area of Karad, where eight tiger/leopard nails were found with him. A chain locket with tiger nail was also found during further investigation.” Honorary wildlife warden from Karad Rohan Bhate said, “Killing a wild animal is a criminal offense. Likewise, killing a tiger or leopard and using their nails or teeth as chain lockets is also non-bailable criminal offense. If anyone comes to know about these activities, they should inform the forest department or call at 9422004800 as soon as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/two-held-at-karad-for-trying-to-sell-tiger-nails/articleshow/85513797.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The victim is Salman Mirza of Fatehwadi, who died on June 25 after being hospitalized in what appeared be drugged condition. On Friday, Vejalpur police sent his postmortem report to the Forensic Science Laboratory, Gandhinagar, for an in-depth analysis. His viscera had been sent for examination soon after his death. Mirza was the only earning member of his family and took care of his two sisters and parents. A complaint had been registered on June 25 by his family member, Sayrabanu Mirza. Police treated it as accidental death. The complainant said that Mirza had been found lying in the shrubs near Amber Tower on June 23. The complainant said that he was brought home by a man called Firoz Shaikh. Later, Mirza’s condition deteriorated and he was taken to Sola Civil Hospital where he died. Mirza’s family has stated that his friends had said he had taken some drug. Vejalpur police inspector L D Odedara said: “There were accounts of Mirza being seen with two women, heading to a hotel in the area.” Odedara added: “CCTV footage was checked and we found that one of the women had not entered the hotel. Mirza and the other woman stayed at the hotel.” Odedara went on to say: “In the morning, the woman left the hotel first. Mirza departed later.” Odedara said that the statements of the women have been taken and it has emerged that the woman who was in the hotel with Mirza was his former fiancée. Odedara said the FSL report will help determine if the death was caused by a drug overdose. As for the family’s claim that Mirza’s private parts had been sealed with glue, doctors have said that aspect did not cause the death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mystery-death-investigators-scan-drug-murder-angles/articleshow/85523398.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat to give aid worth Rs 498 crore to Covid-hit industries||GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani announced a plan for assistance to industrial units and MSMEs in the state which had been adversely affected by the second wave of Covid-19 cases. A meeting was chaired by chief minister Vijay Rupani, with the chairman and managing director of GIDC and additional chief secretary of the industries and mines department. Before this, the chief minister had announced an ‘Atmanirbhar Package’ of Rs 14,000 crore, after the first wave of Covid-19, to boost the economy by reviving industry and trade. Under this package, 31,166 industrialists received benefits worth Rs 407.72 crore under 14 schemes from GIDC. Industry Associations, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and FIA proposed to the chief minister Vijay Rupani that this package should be re-introduced for industries for the second wave of Covid cases as well. GIDC has announced four policy-driven schemes in this regard. These schemes will benefit 2,544 beneficiaries across the state to the tune of Rs 497.26 crore. Sharing details on these schemes, GIDC managing director N Thennarasan said that it was decided to provide economic incentives to industrialists, for example the time limit for industrialists to start production, i.e. the moratorium period will be extended for one more year without levying non-use penalty. According to this, industrialists whose time limit to start production ends in 2021-22 will get an extension till 2022-23 i.e. up to March 2023, without levying the non-use penalty. Due to this decision, industrialists will get more time to use the property and will be relieved from payment of non-use penalty of around Rs 16.70 crore. Around 672 parties will benefit from this. Allottees of the industrial estates who did not get the benefit of the extended time limit for usage under the previous policy and those who were provided benefits up to March 2022 will also get the extension up to March 2023. Under this policy, 1,656 such industrialists will get benefits worth around Rs 350 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-to-give-aid-worth-rs-498-crore-tocovid-hit-industries/articleshow/85523422.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Jai Ganesh Congress’s battle cry for Uttarakhand polls: Harish Rawat||DEHRADUN: All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat on Saturday said that the Congress will not allow the BJP to “hijack the word Hindu for political gains” and that ‘Jai Shri Ganesh’ would be the party’s battle cry for polls scheduled in the hill state early next year. Rawat, who is heading the state election campaign committee for 2022, said, “They (BJP) have reduced Hindus to a mere vote bank. I am not going to allow this. We are followers of Sanatan Dharm which preaches harmony and peace among people and religions. The BJP, however, is more inclined towards creating differences among people in the name of religion and caste.” The veteran leader, back from his successful mediation in the messy tuff battle in Punjab between Capt Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu, said that the slogan ‘Jai Shri Ganesh’ would drive the party’s election campaign in the state. “Before beginning any auspicious work, Lord Ganesh is remembered and worshipped which is why we have selected this slogan. ‘Shri Ganesh’ is a reference to a new beginning and Lord Ganesh is known as Vighnaharta (the destroyer of all obstacles).” Earlier, Rawat had said that if voted to power, the Congress would restart welfare policies launched during his previous tenure. “We have decided to give a subsidy amount of Rs 200 on LPG cylinders to women and double the pension for widows. Our focus will be to create job opportunities and strengthen the state’s infrastructure,” he said. The party has announced a ‘parivartan yatra' from September 3. The yatra will be conducted in four phases starting from Khatima, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami’s home turf. In the second phase, the yatra will go through Kumaon division while six districts of Garhwal would be covered in the third leg. The fourth and final phase of the yatra would be through Haridwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/jai-ganesh-congs-battle-cry-for-ukhand-polls-harish-rawat/articleshow/85520082.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||15 districts in Maharashtra have fewer than 100 active cases of Covid-19||MUMBAI: As the second wave of Covid-19 declines, there are 15 districts in the state that have fewer than 100 active cases of Covid-19. Six of these 15 districts have active cases that are in single digits, while the tribal-dominated Nandurbar district has absolutely no active case at all. Of the 55,000 active cases in the state, over 37,000 are concentrated in the five districts of Pune, Thane, Satara, Ahmednagar and Sangli. The city, with just over 3,000 cases, is in seventh spot in the state. “These 15 districts are smaller, with sparse population density and limited movement,” a state official said. The officer said that the challenge now was to keep the daily detection numbers and active cases low in these parts of the state. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, technical advisor to the state government, said that the Delta variant was still active in the state and new cases were being seen among people who were not previously exposed to it. Health minister Rajesh Tope said that of the 36 districts in the state, only seven districts were reporting an infection rate that was higher than the average infection rate for the state. “The numbers are still being driven by these districts. We are still focusing in these districts to ensure that the containment norms are implemented properly to curb the spread,” Tope said. The health minister warned that districts with cases in single digits should not let their guard down. Dr Salunkhe said that the country was at the moment in an advantageous situation compared to Israel or the US, which are witnessing the third wave because of the Delta variant. “Our second wave was caused by the Delta variant and the variant seems stable at the moment. We need to use this time to vaccinate as many people as possible if we want to prevent a huge third wave,” he said. He said recent sero-surveys in the state and Kerala had shown that antibody levels among people were dropping. “The weather conditions in the next few months will see fluctuating temperatures that are conducive for viral growth. We have to use this time to ensure people are vaccinated,” he said. Lastly, he said people have a tendency to forget that it has been only four months since bodies were found floating in the Ganga. “We have to take precautions,” he said. Dr Vishal Patil, Dhule district coordinator for Covid-19, said that the district was reaping the rewards of consistently following all preventive and corrective protocols. “Our intense testing, tracking and treating throughout the pandemic helped us reduce the cases soon. We carried out 2,500 to 4,000 tests per day. The aim was to ensure that no one was left out,” Dr Patil said. Jalgaon civil surgeon Dr N S Chavan said the district put to good use the data on people with comorbidity generated by ‘My Family My Responsibility’ survey of the state government. “The administration ensured special attention for them. We managed to curb the spread of the infection through intense testing and tracking of the close contacts,” Dr Chavan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-15-districts-have-fewer-than-100-active-cases-of-covid-19/articleshow/85525447.cms||Bhavika Jain

Key accused, who posed as Dr Mark John, befriended the 50-year-old victim on a social media site in July. Thereafter, under the pretext of sending her birthday gift of 37 lakh US dollars, gold ornaments, leather footwear and bag, the e-fraudster made her gradually transfer the sum to a bank account through his three aides posing as agents. It was just last week, a 70-year-old Nerul widow had registered a FIR for being cheated of Rs 10.64 lakh by two cyber criminals under pretext of sending her gold and dollars for a social cause. On July 12, the fraudster made a whatsapp video call from a UK based mobile number and showed her the gift containing lots of US dollars, gold, watch and leather items. He told her that his agent will contact her for delivering the gift to her residence. But the victim gave him her friend’s address. On July 13, agent Rishi Jha contacted her and made her transfer Rs 29,000 to a bank account claiming it was courier charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/nerul-woman-cheated-of-rs-13l-online-second-victim-in-a-week-in-mumbai/articleshow/85526251.cms||George Mendonca
---||Lucknow||‘No regrets’: Kalyan was unfazed by Liberhan panel’s indictment||Lucknow: Kalyan Singh was one of the key leaders to be indicted by the Liberhan Commission, constituted after the demolition of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya by a frenzied mob of kar sevaks on December 6, 1992. The commission was formed 10 days after the incident but submitted its report 17 years later to the then PM Manmohan Singh on June 30, 2009. The report categorically hit out at Kalyan Singh for “embarking on a pogrom leading up to the events of December 6, 1992” soon after assuming the office. “Prior to the 6th of December, the CM changed the local officers of the administration holding key posts, including the commissioner, IG, DGP, DM, SP, DIG, and others, by liberally exercising the power of transfers,” the report said. According to political analysts, Kalyan was an essential component of the Sangh Parivar for the purpose and he lived up to the expectations. The report further claimed that Singh maintained a “studied silence” even at the height of the crisis in December 1992 and did not take a single measure which could have impeded the Ayodhya campaign or prevented the assault on the disputed structures and innocent people. However, Kalyan had rubbished the Commission’s report, claiming it to be “politically motivated”. The former CM had maintained that he had “no regrets” on the destruction of the disputed structure in Ayodhya. He had also condemned the Commission for indicting a “nationalist leader” like BJP stalwart Atal Behari Vajpayee. He had also shrugged off the allegations that the demolition was pre-planned, saying that had it been so, top BJP leaders would not have been present close to the site as they could have been held responsible. Kalyan had quit the BJP just before the 2009 Lok Sabha elections claiming that he was “humiliated and insulted” in the organisation. He later allied with the then Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Rajveer Singh formally joined the SP and appointed its national general secretary. Kalyan also announced that he would campaign for the SP in the Lok Sabha elections. Months later, Kalyan dropped broad hints of returning to the BJP saying that he saw a new political course being charted after tabling of the report. Singh, who had formed his own political outfit, Jan Kranti Party (Rashtrawadi) formally merged it with the BJP in 2013 to help boost the saffron party’s chances in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections which saw emergence of PM Narendra Modi on the national political turf.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-regrets-kalyan-was-unfazed-by-liberhan-panels-indictment/articleshow/85526784.cms||Pankaj Shah

At present, the water is released in the sea. The state should consider discharge of this water in Goa’s water stressed areas to rejuvenate the rivers, the new state water policy 2021 has recommended. STPs are presently operational in Panaji, Margao and Vasco in the state. Their combined capacity is 78.3MLD. Five more STPs are under construction in Goa with a capacity of 35.5 MLD. These are likely to be completed by December 2021, taking the treated water produced by the plants to 165MLD by the end of this year, notes the water policy. “The state is generating significant quantum of treated sewage water which is estimated to be 165MLD by December 2021. At present, the treated sewerage water is mostly simply let out in the river seas. To judiciously use the treated water, schemes need to be formulated to supply the same for industrial and agricultural consumers or to discharge it in water stress areas as e-flow to rejuvenate the rivers,” the policy has suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stp-treated-water-can-rejuvenategoas-rivers/articleshow/85523460.cms||---

The officers from the region told TOI that without physical verification they cannot approve documents, especially medical certificates, of candidates appearing for online learner’s licence tests. So, the state transport commissioner now plans to empanel some doctors to issue medical certificates for use in RTOs. The Maharashtra government started online learner licence test facility from home in June this year. The facility allows a candidate to book a slot online and appear for the LL test sitting at home. However, MVIs and AMVIs expressed displeasure over being assigned the role of validating documents submitted by LL applicants. Citing an example, one of the AMVIs said that suppose a candidate, who is medically unfit for a driving licence, appears for the online learner’s licence test, and suppresses his physical condition by arranging fake medical certificate. “If we approve such an application, we may be charged with dereliction of duty and penal action for no fault of ours,” the AMVI pointed out and added that in the past many have submitted fake medical certificates to avail driving licence, but were foiled due to strict scrutiny. “We have brought this lacuna to the notice of our seniors, and they have apprised the transport commissioner in Mumbai,” they claimed. “Now, the transport department has decided to assign doctors to issue medical certificates to candidates applying for both, learning and permanent, driving licence. The doctor will declare if the applicant is medically fit to drive or ride the vehicle. Responsibility has been entrusted to a doctor,” said a senior official from the city RTO office. As per the new order, the RTO will authorize some doctors in the city for the purpose. “The doctors will have to visit RTO offices and have their medical qualifications verified. Then, they will be given a login ID to upload medical certificates of candidates appearing for online tests and other purposes, including renewal of driving licences etc on Sarathi portal,” he said. In short, they (the appointed doctors) will be made accountable for the applicants’ medical fitness at the time of appearing for tests, he said. The officer admitted that so far not a single doctor has approached the office to get registered for issuing medical fitness certificates. He claimed, though, that the transport commissioner’s office is yet to issue the procedure for authorizing doctors for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rtos-to-empanel-doctors-to-issue-fitness-certs-for-online-licence-seekers/articleshow/85515688.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Narayan Rane’s credibility is poor even in BJP, say MVA partners||Mumbai: After Narayan Rane said on Saturday that Eknath Shinde was unhappy in the Sena and BJP was willing to induct him, the Sena’s MVA partners NCP and Congress said there was no need to take Rane’s statement seriously as “even in BJP, his credibility is poor.” NCP spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik said BJP was trying to create confusion in the MVA government, but it would not succeed. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said this was nothing but BJP’s pressure tactics and Shinde would not join the BJP. Rane, who was the Sena’s CM in 1999, has been targeting the Sena and in particular Sena president and current CM Uddhav Thackeray throughout his Jan Ashirwad campaign. “I built my father’s memorial with my own money,” Rane said, targeting Thackeray. Shiv Sainiks had performed ‘abhishek,’ a purification ceremony after Rane visited the late Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray’s memorial at Shivaji Park on Thursday. On Friday, Rane criticised the poor maintenance of the memorial. Criticising Thackeray, Rane said he does not work from home. “There are 350 companies that have shut down in the state and three lakh people have been rendered jobless. Those sprinkling ‘gaumutra’ are not aware of this reality. Instead of sprinkling ‘gaumutra’, they should be demanding jobs. Get employment for the youth. I shall speak to the state industry minister,” he said. NCP’s Malik said, “First it was Devendra Fadnavis, who on umpteen occasions stated MVA’s was a temporary government. He made all attempts to destabilise the government. He was followed by state BJP president Chandrakant Patil. Both failed, now it is Rane’s turn. Let them try, there is no threat to the government. There is no question of Eknath Shinde joining BJP.” Congress’ Sachin Sawant said, “MVA is firmly in saddle. We do not think Shinde will ever think of joining BJP. “||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-narayan-ranes-credibility-is-poor-even-in-bjp-say-mva-partners/articleshow/85526254.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Cinemas’ Covid woes: Rent dispute reach courts||Ahmedabad: With the film exhibition business being severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions imposed by the government for more than a year, serious rent disputes have emerged between cinema exhibitors and multiplex owners, drawing the parties to courts. In one such case, a film exhibitor company, Time Cinemas and Entertainment Pvt Ltd, approached the city civil court seeking protection against eviction by the multiplex owner, Venus Infrastructure & Developers Pvt Ltd, for defaulting on payment of rent since the lockdown in March 2020. The multiplex owner is demanding Rs 1.66 crore towards accrued rent with interest and issued notice to Time Cinemas to evict it from the premises on CG Road. Time Cinemas moved court and said they are seeking arbitration under the Arbitration & Reconciliation Act and till the tribunal is established and it passes an award, it may not be asked to vacate the premise. To build its case, Time Cinema cited a lease deed clause that in the event of cinema exhibition closing for more than 15 days due to restriction of entry into the mall in it is situated, then the obligation to pay rent ceases till the dispute is resolved. Due to the lockdown and later curbs, cinema halls remained completely closed in two phases and they were allowed to function with restrictions for five months. The cinema business was badly affected and the circumstances should be considered force majeure. The court took notice of the pending petition in the Gujarat high court for establishment of the arbitration tribunal and the HC issued notice and stayed coercive action. The court granted relief for 90 days to the exhibitor, that it should not be vacated from the premises. In another case, Zen Matrix Pvt Ltd, the owner of a multiplex in Ghatlodia, dragged its tenant exhibitor, Rajhans Cine World Ltd, to court for recovery of Rs 3.03 crore towards rent, which had accumulated till March 2021. It also sought a court order to Rajhans to continue to pay Rs 27.52 lakh rent per month from April 2021 till it vacates the property. The court refused to grant any relief to Zen Matrix, which has now approached the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cinemas-covid-woes-rent-dispute-reach-courts/articleshow/85523491.cms||---

Another person from north Bengal was among 85 others in a flight that departed Kabul on Saturday afternoon. However, rumours of Taliban militia abducting 150 Indians on Saturday while they were on the way to the airport left those awaiting extraction in panic. The group was later released after gun-toting men went through the documents. “A C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft has on Friday rescued more than 100 people from the Darjeeling and Kalimpong area who were employed there as private security guards. They are being brought back home via Dubai,” Darjeeling MP Raju Bista said, adding that the PMO and the ministry of external affairs were coordinating efforts to rescue the remaining Indian nationals, including those from Bengal, who are still stranded there. So far, around 200 people from Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Dooars have been rescued from Afghanistan during the week. While the rescue sorties offered hope to families of those still stranded there, Saturday’s incident in which 150 airportbound Indians were waylaid by Taliban militia for a few hours has left everyone shaken. “To be rescued, people have to reach the airport. Taliban militia have set up roadblocks and checkpoints at all roads leading to the airport. Reports of sporadic violence coupled with Saturday’s incident has further instilled fear into the minds of those who are yet to travel to the airport. The stranded also do not have any means to come out of their homes and make the perilous journey unless the companies that had employed them offer them transport and ensure their safe passage,” said Upendra M Pradhan, a social activist who is keeping in touch with the people stranded there. The desperation of the people awaiting their family members’ return is growing by the day. Spending sleepless nights since August15, Sudeshna Subba from Lower Dungra, Kalimpong, said her husband had finally managed to leave Kabul on Saturday with about 84 others from several parts of India. “They have been inside the airport since Thursday, awaiting to be evacuated. We, too, have been spending sleepless nights since Independence Day. When news of his departure from Kabul arrived, we could finally breathe easy,” said Subba.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/homebound-journey-for-more-than-100-stuck-in-af/articleshow/85523483.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Aurangabad||Karad ends outreach rally on grand note in Aurangabad||Aurangabad: The public outreach rally of BJP leader Bhagwat Karad, after becoming the Union minister of state for finance, concluded on the outskirts of Aurangabad on Saturday. The six-day rally saw mega celebrations by local BJP unit at 22 different chowks and other key places in and around Aurangabad amid high level of enthusiasm among the party workers. The NCP has criticised BJP over organising such a rally in an alleged violation of Covid prevention norms. Besides putting hoardings and banners at different places in Aurangabad, BJP workers had hired garlanded cranes at few places to take the celebrations to a new level. Speaking to the media, Karad said he was committed to bringing the welfare schemes and programmes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi towards the beneficiaries. “Being the first union minister from Aurangabad, I know I have a big responsibility on my shoulders. I will give my best to fulfil all expectations,” he said. NCP state spokesperson Jaidev Gaikwad hit out at the BJP over the public outreach rally, stating that the party would be responsible if Covid cases again rise due to such rallies. “BJP leaders are taking out ‘Jan Ashirwad’ yatras across the country with elections in mind. Such grand celebrations are taking place even if the threat of the third wave of coronavirus pandemic is looming large,” he said. NCP leader Surjit Singh Khunger demanded stern action by local authorities against the rallies. Reacting, Karad said Covid-appropriate behaviour was followed during rally in question. “All 40 newly elected ministers across India have been asked by the top BJP leadership to carry out public outreach rally covering at least six Lok Sabha constituencies each. The Covid norms are followed in letter and spirit,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/karad-ends-outreach-rally-on-grand-note-in-aurangabad/articleshow/85520173.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa severely lacks in quality data on water availability||PANAJI: Goa is not a water stressed state, however, all of the estimated water in the state is not available for human consumption. The state severely lacks reliable and quality data on water availability and discharge of its rivers. Rigorous studies are therefore needed to assess the actual availability of water in Goa from various sources and accordingly a water atlas for the state needs to be prepared, states the draft state water policy 2021 prepared for Goa by the water resources department (WRD). “Per capita annual availability (in Goa) is 1,807CuM. If the amount of renewable water in a country is less than 1,700 CuM per person per year that country is said to be experiencing water stress. By this yardstick, water availability in Goa seems to be well above water stress. However, all estimated water is not available for human consumption,” the 2021 document reads. The state does not even have data on discharge of its rivers. “In all the nine river basins, there are only two river gauging sites maintained by the Central Water Commission, both these sites are in the Mandovi (Mahadayi) basin. The data at both these sites has been analysed extensively and the conclusion is that the quality of the data is not satisfactory. Thus, effectively there is no reliable and long-term discharge data available on any river in Goa,” the water policy has noted. Without the necessary data, planning Goa’s water resources is a challenge, states the 2021 policy. “Data is the fuel that drives the engine of planning, and at present there is paucity of data in the state of Goa, whether on the resource side or on the utilisation side. Whilst the overall matrix of data is very large, urgent steps shall be taken to improve the collection of data,” states the new water policy. RTDAS (Real Time Data Acquisition System) and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems have been installed in some places for acquisition of hydro-met data. It has been recommended by the policy that these systems should be extended to all the water bodies across the state. “Rigorous hydrological studies shall be carried out based on RTDAS and other data. Mapping of the data shall be undertaken to prepare water atlas for the state of Goa, based on the data collected and analysed,” the water policy has suggested. All data collected by Goa should also be stored in suitable digital format as independent scholars need water related data for their research, states the policy. “All data shall be made available freely without any impediment, on the internet,” states the policy. Also, notes the policy, in Goa, groundwater in an area of 430.3 sq km, with an in-storage ground water resource estimated as 68MCuM, has been found to be of poor quality in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-severely-lacks-in-quality-data-on-water-availability/articleshow/85523484.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The total number of beneficiaries under this scheme have now touched 9.36 lakh. Sitharaman also launched the Women and Police Beat Programme under which over 10,000 women beat officers have been appointed in the state. These will be posted under all 1,537 police station areas. Over 58,000 special 'Mission Shakti Kaksh' have also been built for the women cops in all gram panchayat bhawans. The CM laid the foundation stone of the Avantibai battalion, out of the three new women battalions of the PAC. The government had organised events similar to the one held in Lucknow, in all district headquarters. At each such event, an outstanding woman was honoured under the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav programme for their contribution in various fields. "Mission Shakti is a symbol of women's safety, security and self-respect. Under the guidance of PM Modi, we have spared no effort to make women self-reliant. Since 2014, the Centre has launched many schemes for the empowerment of women, including Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao, Janani Suraksha, Varasat Abhiyan, PM Awas Yojna etc," the CM said.

But worries mounted for the family in UP’s Shahjahanpur on Saturday, as hours passed but there was no word from Thapa, who worked as a supervisor in a private company in Kabul. “He was sending us messages every few hours to let us know he was safe. But over 36 hours have passed and we haven’t heard from him. We were especially worried when we heard that Indians going to the airport were picked up by the Taliban. My brother was also supposed to go to airport…” said Santoshi. There were reports earlier in the day that 150 Indians had been “picked up” by the Taliban. Later, media reports said that Indian nationals were taken to a nearby police station for questioning and released while the Afghan Hindus and Sikhs were turned back. The Indian nationals are inside Kabul airport awaiting evacuation. For Thapa’s family, the news brought little relief. “No one actually seems to know what’s happening there. If he is safe, why haven’t we heard from Jeet? He knows how worried we would be,” said Santoshi. On Friday, the 35-year-old had told his family that he had taken shelter in an army base near the airport and was surviving on biscuits. “I urge chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring all stranded Indians back as soon as possible,” mother Dhan Devi, wife of a former Armyman, told TOI. Devi said that she last met her son in November 2020. “If I had known something like this would happen, I would not have let him go,” she said. The family members said they have also contacted the ministry of external affairs and were told that Thapa’s name had been added to a list of stranded Indians with the ministry. “They told us he would be brought to India soon. But no one has updated us. In the meantime, all we can do is pray,” said Devi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/been-36-hrs-havent-heard-from-son-in-af-he-was-surviving-on-biscuits-up-family/articleshow/85517433.cms||---

The Rs 4.2 crore project will pave the way for a restaurant and an exhibition space to be set up at a later stage on the 12-mt wide and 300-mt long island. Envisioned under the AMRUT mission, the project is expected to take nine months to complete once the work order is issued. The final plan aims to have a mangrove boardwalk cum footbridge that will allow people and tourists to walk along the Ourem creek right from the Central Library to the Santa Monica jetty. “The existing Mangrove boardwalk behind the Central Library will be connected to the narrow Island by a footbridge,” said an official. The unique mangrove boardwalk, spread over 1,100 sqmtrs, was designed and opened up in 2018 under the AMRUT mission to highlight the role played by mangroves in the ecology of the Ourem creek. The mangrove boardwalk behind central library at Patto has been picked by Niti Aayog for its India Voluntary National Review 2020 report on sustainable development goals. IPSCDL wants to extend the mangrove boardwalk and also create a green space on the island. “This garden will be the lungs of Panaji City and Patto area,” said an official. The narrow island already has some structures which will be revamped to house the restaurant, exhibition space and a series of pavilions. IPSCDL also plans to construct three footbridges linking the mangrove boardwalk to the proposed convention centre being built by the Goa Tourism Development Corporation. IPSCDL has adopted a two-stage process to execute the project with the contractor likely to be picked based on technical and financial evaluation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mangrove-park-at-patto-complex-to-be-extended-under-amrut-mission/articleshow/85523517.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The other two are Hingoli in Marathwada and Gadchiroli in Vidarbha. Health officials said improved testing and tracking of the patients, besides early treatment, had led to more recoveries. Dhule district reported its last Covid fatality on June 8, Nandurbar on July 8, Jalgaon on July 16, and Hingoli and Gadchiroli on July 20. State surveillance officer Dr Pradip Awate attributed the zero deaths to local geographical and demographic profiles. “These districts are much smaller compared to districts like Pune or Solapur. There is not much urbanisation and population is sparse,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-zero-covid-19-fatalities-in-five-districts-for-a-month/articleshow/85525598.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Salt Lake road cave-ins pose threat to motorists||KOLKATA: Portions of roads in Salt Lake are dangerously caving in, creating very risky condition for motorists, particularly bikers. TOI found at least a couple of such spots across Salt Lake where road subsidence have started that can trigger a collapse in case there is heavy rainfall. One such spot is on the lane beside FD Block park, on the other side of which the Bidhannagar Poura Bhavan is located. The road is caving in with two deep holes already on it, creating a dangerous situation for pedestrians and bikers alike. Another such spot is located near Arunachal Bhavan on the Second Avenue Road where the surface is caving in. Construction engineers said that this happened due to cracks and water leakage on the underground drainage line ducts, which is displacing the soil. “The drainage ducts are either getting unsettled or developing cracks due to its age or other factors. This is disturbing the soil and developing a vacuum underneath as large soil particles create gap by having more air space and resulting in the road to subside,” said soil expert and construction engineer Anjan Kumar Dutta. Locals said that there are a few places like Amul Island intersection beside Salt Lake stadium which has always been vulnerable to cave-ins due to weakened soil underneath the road. The civic authorities often fence off a portion of the road which caves in. TOI spotted a large portion of the road at the crossing to be uneven with the bitumen layer applied on it coming out. Motorists, especially bikers, often face inconvenience while moving on the battered stretches as a crater or pothole comes up out of nowhere. They said that they need to constantly stay alert. “It is very dangerous and risky for people like us who ride bikes to move on such roads, more so after dark when it becomes more difficult to see these spots from a distance,” said Kawshik Dutta, a resident of BD Block. Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities said that they will be taking up corrective measures as and when such matters come to their notice. “Such subsidence of land occasionally happens due to uneven movement and displacement of the underground soil. The spots will be identified and measures will be taken,” said a BMC roads department official. BMC officials are making a list of places in Salt Lake, where road condition has deteriorated within a few months of their repair. They will discuss the matter with the agencies engaged in the repair work and ask them to look after maintenance for three years. Failing which action will be taken against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salt-lake-road-cave-ins-pose-threat-to-motorists/articleshow/85523563.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Ahmedabad||Covid turns Gujarati feature film love story into tragedy||Ahmedabad: Two lockdowns, curfews, the shutting down of industry and cinema halls have shattered Gujarati filmmakers’ dreams of making feature films. Financiers who were upbeat about Gujarati films pre-Covid have suffered losses in their own industries and are discouraged by the poor response of cinema goers while movie halls have opened with restrictions in place. Filmmakers and producers say there are many Gujarati films which were ready but could not be released due to Covid-19 restrictions. The financiers of such films are stuck in a a vicious circle of debt. Abhishek Shah, director of national award-winning Gujarati film Hellaro says, “Covid has created a very scary and sad situation for Gujarati film-makers. Gujarati businessmen for long had a keen interest in films and this association grew when they started financing Gujarati films, which saw a big turnaround in the last decade.” Financial backers from various business background such as tiles, marble, real estate, diamond processing and even the scrap business have invested in films in this period. Today, their main focus is to recoup the losses incurred in their original business and to revive them, he said. “From about 15-20 queries a month for film financing in pre-Covid times, the figure has come down to a couple in the past two or three months,” Shah said. They have also shifted their focus from feature films to over-the-top (OTT) platforms, which comes with its own challenges. “Gujarati films have always faced competition from Hindi films as the audience here has grown up watching Hindi films, a language they follow easily. Films in other languages, including Hollywood are being dubbed in Hindi and released on major OTT platforms. The OTT space is already overcrowded so a lot of good content needs to be generated for a new venture to succeed,” Shah said. Arpit Mehta, chairman of City Pulse Multiplex Ltd, a listed company that runs over 20 multiplexes in Gujarat said Covid has nearly stalled feature film making. “Many films are ready but the makers and producers are not confident enough to release them as they see meagre footfalls at cinema houses. However, there are other avenues opening up such as OTT platforms,” Mehta said. Abhishek Jain, a filmmaker who recently launched the Gujarati OTT streaming platform Oho Gujarati says it is difficult for an OTT platform to generate original feature films. “We are a small industry with small budgets so releasing new films directly on OTT is not possible. One can make 20 episodes of a good web series for the budget of a feature length film. Only a feature film with a miniscule budget can be considered for a direct OTT release.” Vitthal Teedi, a drama web series featuring well-known actor Pratik Gandhi and based on a short story by Mukesh Sojitra, a hitherto unknown writer, was released recently on Jain’s new platform. High hopes from OTT: Filmmakers who would have earlier preferred to make a feature film over a series are now left with no option but to make web series. They are highly dependent on Gujarati OTT platforms that have come up. There are few existing OTT platforms that primarily give content in Gujarati language such as Shemaroo, CityShor TV and Oho Gujarati. More OTT platforms are coming up soon. Dhruvin Shah, a Gujarati film actor turned producer is in the process of launching an OTT platform. “We have conceptualised an OTT platform which will be different from existing regional OTT platforms. Our platform will feature content for both the masses and the classes. We believe that rural audiences cannot be left out of an OTT platform,” Shah said. He said that the launch of the new OTT platform will take a few months as some technology aspects are being worked out. Shah said he is currently making a web series called Medal, which is based on a village kid’s struggle of becoming a sportsperson and winning an Olympic medal. Arpit Mehta, whose company runs a cinema hall chain under the brand name of Wow Cine Pulse, will soon launch an OTT platform WowPlex. “Our idea of an OTT platform is keeping a balance between creativity and the business aspect of film making. We have a production house so we will be able to present new content every fortnight,” Mehta said. A ROLLERCOASTER RIDE: Compared to other regional cinema, the Gujarati film industry has seen a lot of ups and downs over the last few decades. After a golden period in the 70s and 80s, the industry saw the urban audience turn to Hindi cinema over Gujarati films. In the last decade, after filmmakers focussed on making films for the urban audience, the Gujarati film industry witnessed a major revival. While films targeted at rural audiences kept doing well, more urban themes gave new life to the industry. However, filmmakers believe Covid has brought the industry to a halt amid this joyride.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-turns-gujarati-feature-film-love-story-into-tragedy/articleshow/85523632.cms||Soumitra Trivedi
---||Delhi||Mere presence not enough for rape charge: Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Mere presence of a person without any “overt” act at the time of rape won’t attract the charge of gang rape, the Delhi high court has said. “An offence under Section 376D of the IPC is made out when one or more person commits the offence of rape in furtherance of a common intention,” justice Mukta Gupta noted in a recent order, granting bail to a boy who landed up in a party at the invite of his girlfriend whose friend claimed she was gang-raped. A “chilling out” session by youngsters where they created a WhatsApp group to plan a get-together, booked a room on Air BnB in south Delhi last year, landed three of them in jail. The complainant girl alleged she was tricked into going to the room booked by her friends and was given sedatives after which she was raped by two of the boys. The police also booked the petitioner’s girlfriend as an accused as it was alleged she facilitated the offence by bolting the door. However, the high court, while granting bail to one of the accused youngsters, found that the complainant girl was the one who made the initial programme for the get-together and even created a WhatsApp group of all the accused to discuss the plan. “There is no allegation against the petitioner that he committed rape on the prosecution, rather her case was that the petitioner and Ananya were dating each other,” HC noted while granting bail to one of the accused, who said he was invited to the party by his girlfriend Ananya and doesn’t even know the victim. While the girl alleged when she came to her senses the three threatened her to keep quiet about the incident, claiming that the boys had her naked pictures and video, HC highlighted that nothing was recovered from the seized mobile phones. It also highlighted that probe into the offence has been completed and besides the main chargesheet, two supplementary chargesheets have been filed. “Co-accused Ananya against whom the allegations are that she bolted the door and took away the phone of the prosecutrix has already been granted bail. The mere presence of the petitioner at the spot without any overt act would not prima facie make out a case under gang rape,” it observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mere-presence-not-enough-for-rape-charge-hc/articleshow/85525562.cms||Abhinav Garg

Later, serving the battalion based in Baramulla, Kashmir, Lucky, with his heroic deeds and dutiful attribute, was always held in high regard among the servicemen, with senior officials even touching his feet often. For over ten years, ‘Lucky’ served the battalion. “He has been a true military man – disciplined and very sharp when it came to detecting explosives or firearms. There was no one like him,” says a source in the know of things. In February this year, ‘Lucky’ retired with grace but with no certainty. The ten-and-a-half- year old Labrador had nowhere to go to. “For few months, it was kept in the room of dog squads in Kashmir. However, instructions were given to his handler to shift him to make space for new dogs,” the source tells. TOI learnt that the ‘Lucky’ was brought to the hometown of his handler in Saoner, a town near Nagpur. “Lucky’s handler was trying to shift it to a dog shelter based in Mumbai but the necessary arrangements could not be made. When the activists from there informed me about him, I decided to bring the dog to Nagpur,” says local animal welfare activist Karishma Galani. On seeing Lucky’s deteriorating health, Galani admitted it to a hospital run by Ajay Maheshwari, founder of Nagpur-based Maheshwari Animal Welfare Foundation (MAWF), where he is currently being treated. “Sniffer dogs undergo intense training from a young age to smell detectives and other explosives. This damages various organs of their body. Lucky was about three months old when he joined the CRPF,” says Galani. Stating that the animal did not eat for few days, Maheshwari says, “After living at a place for over ten years, coming here has been a big change for him. He is recovering though.” While the activists are “more than happy” to take care of Lucky, they express deep disappointment to the fact that despite serving the country, such dogs are left to die. “There are so many like Lucky who are at no one’s mercy. Their skills and services are used for the country’s welfare for years but they get nothing in return—no pension, no shelter house, no food and no treatment,” they say, demanding that the government should set-up shelter houses for retired dogs. In 2017, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court took sou motu cognizance of TOI reports exposing the absence of measures for rehabilitation of canines serving in the bomb disposal and detection units. Citing the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, the appointed amicus had stated that laws concerning prevention of cruelty to animals don’t take in to consideration welfare of animals serving in the forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dogs-luck-runs-out-now-being-treated-by-local-vet/articleshow/85521855.cms||Manka Behl

The woman has denied making any such complaint, said the SP. The SP on Saturday evening told media that since no complaint was filed by the woman or her closed relatives against the Shiv Sena MLA from Digras, he has been given a clean chit. “Now, there is no question of filing FIR against Rathod who had recorded his statement with the SIT on August 19,” said the SP.BJP leader Chitra Wagh had demanded filing FIR against Rathod in the case. “Truth alone triumphs. They are chasing me and are out to ruin my political career which I have built with my determination,” said Rathod.A team led by additional SP Khanderao Dharne had recorded statement of the woman, wife of the ex-teacher at Rathod’s ashram shala, at Ghatanji police station in camera in presence of her husband and father on August 14. “The woman in her confession denied that Digras MLA Rathod sought sexual favours if she wanted her husband to be reinstated on the teacher’s post after he voluntarily resigned in 2017,” said the SP. Patil-Bhubal further said that the woman also stated that she had not sent any complaint either to him or the Ghatanji police station by post. “The woman claimed that she never signed such a complaint and the name of her husband was wrongly mentioned in it. The woman said Rathod never sought any sexual favours from her,” the SP said. The SP said the SIT visited the Ghatanji Post office where the Speed Post containing the complaint was registered. “The employees there said that two men posted the letters one after another but denied knowing them,” he said. The SIT sought the information from assistant commissioner of VJ/NT and verified the affidavit filed by the woman’s husband in connection with the resignation letter. Rathod had to resign from the state cabinet after his name was embroiled in the Pooja Chavan suicide case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sit-clean-chit-to-rathod-in-sex-for-job-complaint/articleshow/85521859.cms||---

Since 2002, Sanghamitra Dafadar has been staying there, but life has not been the same. She is separated from her husband for the past couple of years. She works in Sharana provincial hospital as a nurse and is living with her 19-yearold son and seven-year-old daughter. She earlier had worked at a city hospital in Ekbalpore. She had appealed to the Indian authority to rescue her and her children as she stated that reaching the airport is difficult as Taliban are opening fire at random near the airport. Sanghamitra said: “I don’t have anyone here. I am totally at a loss with my two children. I want to be back home to Kolkata. I am not getting any help from anyone here. I want to be in Kolkata with my two children. But whom shall I contact?” Her elderly parents at Behala are worried about the worsening situation in Afghanistan. “On August 15, she called to say that she was unsure whether she could return to Kolkata alive. We are sitting at home amid a great fear,” said her mother Ruby. Ruby said that her grandson Arbaz Khan was asked to join Taliban and since then the family is staying inside the home in a complete lockdown situation. Rajib Guha, a cousin, said they are writing to the ministry of external affairs for help. Jinnar Ali of NATC, an NGO, said they had written to the MEA for evacuation of Sanghamitra and her children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nurse-from-behala-stranded-in-kabul/articleshow/85523619.cms||Debasish Konar
---||Goa||Goa: DCS-Vascon emerges as top bidder for convention centre||PANAJI: The state government has finalised the firm for the construction of a mega convention centre at Dona Paula, the cost of which is estimated to be over Rs 800 crore. A senior officer said the letter of award will be given next week to the DCS-Vascon consortium, which has emerged as the highest bidder. “A long pending dream of having an international convention centre at Dona Paula will finally be achieved. The foundation stone for the convention centre will be laid shortly,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said. The convention centre will be constructed on public private partnership (PPP) mode and revenue sharing model. On January 14, the PPP cell of the state government held a virtual pre-bid meeting with companies and answered their queries related to the project. Though the government had received an overwhelming response at the pre-bid meeting with 15 firms evincing interest in the project, only two companies had shown interest to take up the project. Over the five years, after outlining plans to construct the 5,000-seating capacity convention centre, the state government had in December floated a tender inviting firms to set up the facility. In the first phase, along with the convention centre, a multiplex and a five-star hotel have been proposed at Dona Paula in an area of around 97,000 sqm. Earlier, the project was proposed in 2.9 lakh sqm land, which was earmarked for setting up the Rajiv Gandhi IT Habitat. The first phase of the project will cost around Rs 800 crore, and depending on further expansion plans, the cost will increase and it will be borne by the bidder. Early this year, the state cabinet approved the re-engagement of Knight Frank (India) Private Ltd as the project consultant. Initially conceptualised in 2015, the project went through a lengthy bureaucratic process and was shunted between departments before landing with the PPP cell. In 2018, when the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) was responsible for the project, 25 firms had shown interest. These included ITC, Inorbit, Strong Australia, Dempo Group, HKS-US, Essel, Hiranandani Group, Chowrangee Group, L&T, Amanora, Zee and Feedback Infra. EDC’s proposal, estimated at Rs 1,400 crore and had also included an indoor film shooting shed, office of the Entertainment Society of Goa, Iffi office, and the smart city centre of excellence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dcs-vascon-emerges-as-top-bidder-for-convention-centre/articleshow/85523603.cms||Murari Shetye

They become regular students a year later against vacancies caused by college students who fail or drop out.“I had registered as a private candidate with Rajasthan University in 2019 since I was hoping to get admission in a foreign university with a scholarship in December. I missed the deadline as a regular candidate then. I scored over 65% in the first year B Com with an eye to take admission in the second year in any of the good colleges affiliated with the RU as a regular student in 2020. This year, too, I hoped to enrol as a regular student, but outright promotions have dashed my dreams,” said Anshu Sharma, a private student based in Jaipur.Sharma is not alone in the struggle to study as a regular student. For the past years, several among them have been suffering due to pandemic. Rashmi Jain, head of department, Sociology, RU, says that the university should provide them admission on the basis of merit. “Pursuing a degree as a private student comes with a lot of shortcomings like no classroom learning, no peer learning, no access to resources like the library and resource persons,” said Jain, adding those who have showcased excellence as a private candidate should be inducted as regular students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pvt-students-unable-to-get-admission-in-colleges/articleshow/85525527.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: With 24 hours left, no takers for 60% Std XI seats||NAGPUR: While registration for the Std XI common admission procedure (CAP) closes late on Sunday night, there are still no takers for almost 60% of junior college seats in Nagpur city. This trend is not new for the city as on an average, 20,000 seats go vacant every year in Std XI. As of Friday, just over 22,000 students had completed their online registration for Std XI admissions. Though it’s certain that more students will register as the deadline is 11pm on Sunday, still it’s impossible for the entire deficit to be covered in such a short period. Senior academics say regardless of how high the registrations rise, still almost half of the seats shall remain vacant. Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers’ Association (VJUCTA), said, “I can guarantee you that around 45% of the seats will remain vacant because that has been the norm every year.” A strong proponent of cancelling the CAP, Gavhankar said that it’s a more time consuming process. “Look at where we are now in the academic calendar. August is almost over and here we are still in the registration process, not even the admission stage. Compared to this, junior colleges just outside city limits have been operating for almost a month with students attending classes regularly,” said Gavhankar. CAP is applicable only to colleges located within city limits, whereas in rural, admissions are done directly with the student applying at the college. CAP was started with the intent of saving time for students who would run from college to college and apply at multiple places. Gavhankar said, “That’s not applicable now because 20,000 seats go vacant every year, which means every single student is guaranteed admission. Yes, you may not get admission in the college you desire but you won’t be deprived of education in the city. Colleges can start their own online admission process so that students don’t have to visit colleges physically.” VJUCTA had petitioned the deputy director of education (Nagpur division) office demanding that CAP be cancelled. “There are over 200 colleges in CAP, but students don’t apply everywhere, it’s just between 5-10 colleges that they are interested in and even get admissions. Similarly, students can apply online to these colleges from the comfort of their homes and classes can start early,” said Gavhankar.

Now, we are expected to submit a fresh proposal along with the charges. This is not fair,” said the elderly man. Like Didore, a large number of citizens who have had submitted proposals for regularising their properties in the past have sought an official decision on the fate of their earlier files. While the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has decided to appoint experts to prepare proposals for regularising the gunthewari properties, affected citizens want a panel to investigate the past proposals. Former corporator Renukadas Vaidya, who has been following up on the gunthewari-related demands with the state government, said citizens who had applied earlier must be exempted from the new process. “People had shelled out their hard-earned money as fees while submitting the proposals in past. Such proposals should not just be considered but also receive a priority while processing,” said Vaidya. In a memorandum submitted to the AMC, Vaidya, a former chairman of the standing committee of the civic body, has sought measures to spread awareness about the gunthewari property regularisation. AMC administrator Astik Kumar Pandey could not be reached for his comments. The municipal limits of Aurangabad have around 118 gunthewari areas housing around 4lakh citizens. The owners concerned are keen on regularising their properties in order to get rid of the limitations on transactions involving these properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/many-want-to-know-fate-of-past-applications/articleshow/85520333.cms||Prasad Joshi

After being promised a steady income in the catering industry, she was forced to sleep with strangers. Fortunately, a police raid in 2016 came to her rescue.Post rescue, the minor was lodged at a government shelter home from where she was sent to Pune for a course in nursing, a part of a rehabilitation scheme. After turning 18, she had to leave the shelter home and her course too got discontinued.District legal services authorities (DLSA) secretary Abhijeet Deshmukh, also a civil judge (senior division), said the Rs 3 lakh which the minor had received helped her to resume her professional training and also settle down with a married life. “The minor had lost motivation of continuing the professional nursing course after stepping out of the shelter home which may be due to her inability to pay the fees or some other reason,” said Deshmukh. “After returning to Nagpur, she was untraceable, but we wanted to find her to steady her life with the government scheme for survivors like her,” he said.The girl was traced from a location in Nagpur with the help of a special team and counselled again to motivate her to rejoin the nursing course in Pune. “She was subsequently selected under the Manodhairya scheme and given the monetary benefit. The minor returned to Pune with the motivation to complete the nursing course with our assistance and subsequently, also got married,” he said. “DLSA and our team had been extending steady support to girls falling prey to crimes of rape, acid attack and trafficking,” he said.The minor was among the 122 beneficiaries of the special scheme for rape, acid attack and victims of atrocities through DLSA which disbursed Rs 1.65 crore to the victims after disposing of 193 cases. Apart from monetary assistance, the survivors also receive legal help, counselling and assistance through other rehabilitation plans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/minor-rescued-from-flesh-trade-is-pursuing-nursing/articleshow/85521901.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Jaipur||Admission to engg colleges under state univs from next week||Jaipur: The admission to engineering colleges is set to begin from next week on Class 12 scores in colleges affiliated to Rajasthan Technical University and Bikaner Technical University while private universities have already started the admission process.Colleges with Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS) courses are integrated with computer science.R A Gupta, vice-chancellor of RTU, said that they have sourced a cloud computing facility that would allow students to access international research on varied subjects including AI, ML and DS.“The facility is available for all students enrolled in our affiliated colleges,” said Gupta, who claimed modern technology-driven courses will fetch more high placed jobs to their students. Many private colleges claimed that every second query they are getting on the mentioned three courses which are available in very few colleges and universities. The core branches—Civil, Mechanical along electronics and communication engineering are still popular in colleges located in semi-urban areas. The Centre of Electronic Governance will conduct the admission process in all engineering colleges affiliated with RTU and BTU.“The chances that students from outside will head to the state for engineering is very bleak. It is a chance for the state students to avail this opportunity since an engineering degree is set to accelerate the technology-driven economies,” said Puneet Sharma, an expert on higher education. The colleges are expecting at least 20000 engineering seats to be filled in this session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/admission-to-engg-colleges-under-state-univs-from-next-week/articleshow/85525551.cms||---

FDA had to withdraw Ambibio E injections bearing the batch number HIUP2103, after several mucormycosis patients started developing reactions after medication.FDA Nagpur assistant commissioner PM Ballal said the drug inspector who had collected the sample (NV Lohakare) shall file a chargesheet before the court after the receipt of the prosecution order from the FDA joint commissioner. “The manufacturer is likely to face prosecution in the court of law under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, as it is a case of sterility test failure,” said Ballal.A sample of Amphotericin B injection manufactured by Jodas Expoim private limited under the brand name ‘AmphiJO’, collected from the pharmacist Anil Dindokar at Government Medical College and Sarvopchar Hospital in Akola, on July 1 was also found “not of standard quality” by FDA. The government analyst had underlined the fact that the Amphotericin B content in the sample was less than the permissible limit, and that it also failed in particulate matter and clarity tests.Amphotericin B emulsion was in high demand towards the end of second Covid wave, when fungal infection mucormycosis started surfacing at an alarming rate. In Nagpur district, 1,757 patients had suffered from mucormycosis and 178 have died due to the fungus till August 20. Around 1,398 patients had to go under the scalpel, and around 21 are still in hospitals. Amid the crisis, the Amphotericin B emulsion of a particular brand and batch had triggered adverse reactions among patients.The Ambibio E samples from the manufacturer Health Biotech Ltd were collected after FDA was alerted by a number of hospitals in the city about the mucormycosis patients’ suffering.One of the patients nearly suffered a cardiac arrest and was revived by the alert medical team, shortly after this drug was administered. FDA sources had then said that around 200 vials were distributed. Out of the total, around 42 vials had already been used. The rest of the vials were withdrawn from the hospitals by FDA. Samples from around 28 vials of this drug with the specific batch number were collected by the FDA’s drug inspector Lohakare before being sent to FDA’s Mumbai lab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amphotericin-b-sample-from-city-fails-sterility-test-in-fda-lab/articleshow/85521891.cms||Soumitra Bose

The 594-km expressway, India's second-longest, to be constructed between Meerut and Prayagraj will reduce the travel time between Delhi and eastern UP from the existing 11 hours to nearly seven hours. On Saturday, PNB CEO SS Mallikarjuna Rao transferred a sanction letter of the securitisation-based loan to the UPEIDA in the presence of Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and CM Yogi Adityanath. Over 92% land acquisition work for the Rs 36,000-crore project has been done and the construction is likely to begin next month after foundation-laying by PM Modi. The CM said the eway would cross 11 districts and would become "the backbone of UP economy".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/5100cr-loan-for-ganga-eway-cleared-work-set-to-start-soon/articleshow/85527580.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Nagpur||Fortified rice & petrified parents: State asks dist to create awareness||Nagpur: The state education department has asked its district level officials to create awareness about fortified rice being used in midday meals (MDM) scheme, as some parents have confused it with “adulteration”.In some parts of Maharashtra, parents have complained about ‘plastic’ rice being included with regular MDM rice though the samples tested negative later. Officials say the confusion is being created because fortified rice sometime leaks yellow colour after being soaked and may even start floating in water as it’s lighter. Every one KG of rice given as part of MDM comprises 10 grams of fortified rice and it was introduced for the first time this financial year itself. “Since this thing is new, many parents are getting scared and reporting it as adulterated. We need to make parents aware of the facts and ensure that their kids are not deprived of MDM,” said an education official.In the post-Covid era, cooked MDM scheme has come to a halt and students are being supplied raw rice and dal. It’s when parents cook this rice at home that they get worried over a few kernels which seem to be slightly different from the rest. State education director Dattatrey Jagtap wrote a comprehensive letter to district education officers explaining the ‘science’ behind fortified rice and how it may sometimes react with water, to create optical confusion about its purity. In his letter Jagtap said that a very small quantity of fortified is added to the mix as the ratio is set at 1:100. “This fortified rice contains important nutrients for kids. It includes iron, folic acid, vitamin b12, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin b1, b2, b5, b6,” said Jagtap. Gautam Gedam, MDM in-charge for Nagpur district said, “We have been regularly distributing the requisite food grains under the MDM scheme. Parents are called to school on specific days and handed out the monthly quota in form of raw grains.” In every district, some random samples will be collected and tested at government-approved labs, to allay fears of parents. MDM scheme is provided free of cost to all students between Std I-VIII who are enrolled in government or grant-in-aid schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fortified-rice-petrified-parents-state-asks-dist-to-create-awareness/articleshow/85521911.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The BJP chief, while addressing a gathering of seers in Haridwar on Saturday, assured social justice and last-mile delivery of government welfare schemes. “The Narendra Modi government is working for all countrymen with the motto of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwaas’... Our PM helped Muslim women get rid of the shackles of triple talaq. The primitive practice, which was being followed in India, was even prohibited in the Islamic countries of the world,” said Nadda. He added that the Modi government believes in justice for all but doesn’t indulge in appeasement. “The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, provides security to the persecuted communities — Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, and Parsis — in Pakistan,” added Nadda. Nadda also pointed out that the Modi government has fulfilled several of its poll promises, including the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution. He further said that the construction of a grand Shri Ram Temple at Ayodhya, which was a long-cherished dream of our countrymen, is also underway. Meanwhile, the saffron party’s national spokesperson Anil Baluni told media persons that a strategy was chalked out to ensure BJP’s victory with a greater margin in the forthcoming assembly elections in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-govt-has-ensured-justice-for-all-without-appeasement-nadda/articleshow/85520335.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

The branch will have 60 seats. Established in 1997, PCCE is the oldest private engineering college in the state. Now, in its silver jubilee year, PCCE will be offering the Bachelor of Electronics and Computer Engineering programme. The branch has been approved by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi, and is affiliated to Goa University, the college said. “The branch will serve as a launching pad for the introduction of courses in emerging areas, encompassing hardware and software engineering. These courses would be in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), data sciences, communication technologies, internet of things (IoT), robotics and automation. The branch has been introduced in response to the industry demand for expertise in these areas,” the college said. The first year seats to the new programme will be offered at the centralised admissions to be conducted shortly by the directorate of technical education. The programme offers dual skills to engineering graduates with career opportunities in software-enabled services, process control industries, embedded solutions and IT sector, the college said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/electronics-and-computer-engg-branch-at-pcce/articleshow/85525612.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Two Jaipur institutes to offer BTech in Hindi from coming session||JAIPUR: In a first, two private engineering colleges have granted permission to run BTech in computer science in Hindi from the coming session. Nationally, only 14 colleges have been granted permission by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to run BTech courses in local languages. Poornima Institute of Engineering and Technology and Poornima College of Engineering, both based in Jaipur, have been allowed 60 seats each in computer science course. Calling it a matter of pride to be among the 14 colleges, institute director Rahul Sanghi said, “Since majority of the students in Jaipur come from villages, small towns and cities having cleared their schooling in Hindi, they face difficulty in studying higher education in English. The language barrier is also one of the major reasons for dropout of engineering students.” Shifting from Hindi to English isn’t an easy task. The administration of both the colleges has started training their teachers to translate terminologies into Hindi. Colleges alone run the technical courses in Hindi. Rajasthan Technical University is also leading by example by providing all assistance to its affiliated colleges. “We are designing the syllabus in Hindi to suit the language and also sourcing books on the subjects,” said RA Gupta, vicechancellor, RTU. He added that trend is going to increase in the coming years and its impact would be visible in gross enrolment ration of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-jaipur-institutes-to-offer-btech-in-hindi-from-coming-session/articleshow/85525567.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Raj to release detailed SOP for school reopening soon||Jaipur: Multiple state government agencies are working overtime to chalk out the final Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) for schools set to reopen from September 1. Sources said there will be different opening and closing hours for classes 9-10 and 11-12 for better adherence to social distancing norms. Students with chronic illnesses (diabetes, cancer, renal failures and any organ malfunction)will be exempted from coming to school. The report said the education directorate had prepared a 20-point SoP for schools and submitted it before the state for its approval. TOI learnt that classes 9 and 11 will function from 7.30am to 12.30pm. “For board classes 10 and 12, classes will be held from 8am to 1pm. The whole idea is that majority of the schools have limited entry and exit points making it crowded during the start and end of the classes,” said the source. It was also being considered to keep laboratories open for classes 10 and 12 students so that they don’t suffer. Over 50 lakh students will attend 31,000 schools across the state. The state government had announced the reopening of schools with 50% of students every alternate day. The education directorate is considering that they should call 100% students which can accommodate them all following Covid protocols. ‘ “The view emerges that since students from class 9 will come, there will be enough space for them in every school. Also, calling students every alternate day is not a feasible option for the majority of the schools with limited resources,” said the source. Similar guidelines will be followed for coaching institutes and higher education institutes. The second phase from classes 6 to 8 reopening would depend upon how successful the first phase is. The alternate-day classes option cannot be possible without downsizing the courses. “Rajasthan State Council of Educational Research & Training, Udaipur, responsible for the designing the revised curriculum for different classes,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-to-release-detailed-sop-for-school-reopening-soon/articleshow/85525590.cms||---

Some people are creating unnecessary controversies about his projection as the CM. Yadav, who is on a threeday Jan Ashirwad Yatra in the state, talked at length with mediapersons on Saturday. He said that the yatra was undertaken to connect to the people and seek their blessings. All the 39 new ministers are on yatra in their states to connect to people. “People have showered so much love which clearly indicate that days of Gehlot government are over in Rajasthan. Soon, there will be a BJP government in the state.” He clarified that the yatra was not his individual yatra, but it is a party programme. As general secretary of the party, he said he had worked in various states. To link this yatra with political agenda is totally wrong, he added. “The opposition parties did not allow Parliament to work and they did not allow Prime Minister Narendra Modi to introduce new members of cabinet. Protest and disruptions are understood but just to create pandemonium and not allow the House to work is not proper. He also dismissed a question about discontent of former chief minister Vasundhara Raje and said that she could not join the yatra due to her personal reasons. Senior BJP leader Kailash Meghwal is quite old and could not attend due to health conditions. He said that he held 75 rallies and seven big rallies during the Jan Ashirwad Yatra. Ajmer MP Bhagirath Chaudhary, MLA Anita Bhadel, Mayor Brijlata Hada, deputy mayor Niraj Jain and many other party leaders and workers were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/not-in-the-race-for-cms-post-union-forest-min-yadav/articleshow/85525604.cms||---
---||Dehradun||New faces for 3 key posts this session||DEHRADUN: It will be for the first time since the formation of Uttarakhand when the state assembly will witness new faces for the three key posts of — leader of the House (chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami), leader of Opposition (Pritam Singh), and parliamentary affairs minister (Banshidhar Bhagat) — during a mid-term session, scheduled to start from August 23. In the last assembly session held in March this year, former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat was the leader of the House. He was replaced by Tirath Singh Rawat, who took oath as the CM on March 10. However, in his four-month term in office, no assembly session was held. Later in July, he was replaced by Pushkar Singh Dhami as the state CM and the new leader of the House. Similarly, Madan Kaushik, who was the parliamentary affairs minister in the Trivendra Singh Rawat government was made the state BJP chief in March. Thereafter, Bansidhar Bhagat was made the new parliamentary affairs minister. Meanwhile, the post of the leader of Opposition fell vacant after the demise of senior Congress MLA Indira Hridayesh. After much deliberations, Congress named Pritam Singh as the new leader of the Opposition in the state assembly. All three leaders — CM Dhami, Bansidhar Bhagat, and Pritam Singh — will be holding their respective responsibilities for the first time in their political careers during the upcoming five-day-long assembly session. Besides, the state also has a new chief secretary — SS Sandhu. Veteran journalist and political analyst Jay Singh Rawat said, “In the past, there have been instances of the leader of the House being changed mid-term. Only ND Tiwari has completed his full term as the CM. But it has never happened in the past when the House got a new leader of the House, a new leader of Opposition and new parliamentary affair minister mid-term.” The five-day monsoon session is expected to start on a stormy note as Congress aims to strongly raise the issues of changes to the land law and scrapping of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act. On the other hand, the government would table a Rs 5,300 crore supplementary budget in the House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/assembly-session-to-start-with-new-leader-of-house-leader-of-opposition-parliamentary-affairs-minister/articleshow/85520353.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Kolkata||MEA passport clarification eases vax hurdle for expats||Kolkata: A ministry of external affairs declaration to allow vaccination of foreigners living in India is likely to put an end to some centre’s insistence on Aadhar and not passport, a practice that had delayed vaccination for some expatriates. The foreign ministry had stressed the need for vaccination of foreign nationals living in metros. The ministry had said foreigners could use their passport to register on CoWin and show it at vaccination centres. Indians, too, can use any of their government-approved ID cards—Aadhaar, driving licence, PAN, passport, pension passbook, NPR smart card and voters’ ID card. Several foreign nationals in Kolkata had complained they could book vaccine slots on CoWin with passports but at the vaccination centres, they were either asked multiple questions or even denied shots. Last month, a Pakistani national, Sahar Qaisar, who has been living in Park Circus for eight years with her Indian husband and children had claimed she was denied the first dose at Medica Superspeciality Hospital. “I registered on CoWin with my Pakistani passport and booked a slot. But a hospital official checked my ID and denied me vaccination as I didn’t have an Aadhar and because I was a Pakistani,” said Qaisar. She called up the state health department, following which another private hospital vaccinated her. Medica Alok Roy told TOI the health department couldn’t provide them with clear instructions on vaccinating the woman. Another Bangladeshi national, married to an Indian and living in Kolkata for five years, said she was asked several questions as she didn’t have an Aadhar card, but was finally vaccinated based on her passport. A number of expats in Kolkata, however, spoke about seamless vaccination. “I got both my shots at a private hospital without any hassle,” said Gulsina Akhunova (46), a Kyrgyzstan national living here for 16 years. British diplomat Paul Walsh also said he got vaccinated even before the 84-day gap was imposed. “I used my driving licence,” he said. The British deputy high commission’s spokesperson in Kolkata said, “There is no plan of rolling out the UK’s NHS vaccination programme to British nationals living abroad. They should seek advice from their local healthcare providers.” A US Consulate General official said US citizens travelling or living overseas should follow host country’s guidelines for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mea-passport-clarification-eases-vax-hurdle-for-expats/articleshow/85523667.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Dehradun||Masur, shrub after which Mussoorie was named, is now disappearing||MUSSOORIE: The Masur shrub (Coriaria nepalensis), which once grew in abundance in the hills of Mussoorie and after which the town was named, is now fading from its landscape and from memories of its residents. Also known as Masuri berry or ‘Masuriya’, the 10-feet-tall shrub with large, green pointy leaves, which blooms with reddish flowers in spring and produces dark, poisonous berries later in the year, were found all over the Queen of Hills when the British first came to the town. Residents believe that due to urbanization, the species has now disappeared from the town it is synonymous with and can be found only in its outskirts. In fact, in late 19th century works, like the text ‘Historical Sketch of Masuri and Landour’ (1832) by Fisher and the book ‘Guide to Masuri, Landaur, Dehradun’ (1884) by John Northam, the town is spelled ‘Masuri’. “The Masur shrub once occurred in abundance in these hills and apparently the town’s founding fathers named the town ‘Masuri’ after this shrub. The spelling changed to ‘Mussoorie’ sometime later. It is concerning that the shrub which the town was named after and which once grew in abundance has vastly declined from the hills,” said noted Mussoorie-based historian Ganesh Saili. Gopal Bhardwaj, another Mussoorie-based historian, said, “The number of Masur shrubs has declined considerably. Barring a few which can be spotted on Camel’s Back road, one would have to travel to the city’s outskirts towards Hathipaon to catch a glimpse of the shrub.” Like the shrub, awareness around it is also receding. “The younger generation is completely ignorant about this plant,” Bhardwaj said. Surabhi Aggarwal of Mussoorie Heritage Centre, who organizes heritage walks across the town, said, “Trails could be developed to generate awareness among the youth and tourists about the Masur plant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/masur-the-shrub-after-which-mussoorie-was-named-now-fading-from-the-town/articleshow/85520361.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Hyderabad||‘Human actions hold key to extent of future damage to our planet’||Dr Krishna AchutaRao, one of the lead authors of the recently-released Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report 2021 and head of the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at IIT-Delhi speaks to U Sudhakar Reddy on the impact of climate change on India, how the country’s agriculture sector was at risk if future projections of monsoon materialise and the danger of urban flooding looming over many cities. Excerpts: Q: Would you please explain climate change projections and impact on India and South India? Rao: The projections reported in this report cover the South Asian region as a whole and generally point to more temperature and rainfall extremes occurring already, and more will occur in future as the globe warms. Q: What is your contribution to the IPCC report? Rao: I was a lead author on Chapter 3, which deals with quantifying the human contribution to climate change. I was also a contributing author on the Summary for Policymakers. Q: What are the projected carbon emissions for India and the biggest contributors here? Rao: The projected carbon emissions are calculated as “scenarios”. Emissions depend on various socio-economic and technological factors as well as policy interventions. So what will happen in the future is not possible to predict, but possible pathways are used to look at future climate change. Some of the details of future projections are not done at country level — so India’s contribution in the future is entirely dependent on what we do in the future. Whether we continue to use coal and other fossil fuels (for energy, transport) will decide our future emissions. In addition to these, we have sizeable emissions from agriculture which also need to be addressed. Q: What should be done at the national and state levels to mitigate climate change impact? Rao: We clearly have to focus on reducing emissions by reducing use of fossil fuels. With the recent increases in renewable energy production, we have a great opportunity to scale up our low or zero carbon energy to meet more of our needs. We also have to replace high emission parts of industrial processes with lower emission ones. In addition to reducing emissions, we also need to plan on how to adapt to the changes that are already occurring and will continue to happen. These will be important in order to reduce the worst effects of climate change on our communities. Q: Your earlier research papers from IIT Delhi have projected several impacts and dangers to Earth due to increase in temperature. Rao: Much of my work has focused on how climate changes due to natural and human factors. The future is certainly going to be impacted more and more by human factors. Q: How would you see India’s agriculture sector being impacted? Will urban flooding increase? Rao: India’s agriculture is certainly at risk if future projections of monsoon are to materialise. If monsoon rainfall goes up and at the same time becomes more erratic (more excess and deficit seasons), farmers’ dependence on it is bound to become problematic. The added issue is that as the climate warms, more water evaporates from land and from plants’ transpiration, requiring more irrigation to compensate for water lost from the soil. This will put additional pressure on groundwater systems. Urban and other flooding will certainly become more probable as rainfall amounts increase and the chances of heavy rainfall events are projected to increase with additional warming.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/human-actions-hold-key-to-extent-of-future-damage-to-our-planet/articleshow/85524464.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The victims met SP Jaisalmer, SDM Fatehgarh, Sangad police station and Fatehgarh tehsildar and demanded justice.Victims in their memorandum submitted to SP told that eight months ago at Sankda, a married woman along with her lover murdered her husband. Later, 45 families known to the brother and families of the lover were ostracised. These families are of Betina village in Sankda police station area and these 45 people are of Meghwal community who have been boycotted from the society. The logic of the panchs was that the youth has committed the crime of falling in love with a married woman, therefore families of his relatives have been ostracised.It is to be mentioned that Koshalaram, a resident of Harjiram ki Dhani in Madhopura village under Sankda police station area, was murdered by his wife on August 17, 2020. The wife and mother-in-law of the deceased killed Koshalaram. The panchs of the society boycotted 45 families of relatives and family members of Madan Ram who was having an affair with the wife of the deceased. All are residents of Betina village.In this regard, SP Ajay Singh confirmed that the victims had met him and the matter is of Sankda police station area, but many victims are also from Sangad police station area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/45-families-ostracised-over-murder-in-jaisalmer/articleshow/85525629.cms||---

One of the accused allegedly raped the minor girl later. The incident took place when the girl and boy were sitting at an isolated place near the Khakharia Narmada canal. The girl and the boy were at the isolated location when GRD jawan Anil Gohil reached there with his friend Sangharsh Patel. The duo introduced themselves as cops and threatened the couple. They said that they would call their parents Two other GRD jawans Jayendra Gohil and Mahesh Vasava also reached the spot and pressurized the duo. They roughed up the boy and took his motorcycle away and asked them to cough up Rs 8,000. Three accused — Patel, Jayendra and Vasava — took the boy to an ATM on the Halol Road to withdraw money. Anil took the girl to an isolated place in his car and allegedly raped her. After leaving the place, the girl told the boy about the rape. The incident took place on Thursday and all the three accused other than Anil were nabbed on Friday. Anil was held on Saturday. A police official said that the accused had not been formally arrested yet. Their RT-PCR tests had been performed. A medical examination of the girl had also been done.

The social audit action taken report states that there was a total misappropriation of Rs 935 crore in the whole country. The reports further state that 8284 social audit reports were uploaded in Rajasthan and 535 issues were reported in the state. However, zero financial misappropriation of money and zero recovery has been reported in the state. A department official, on condition of anonymity, said, it was impossible to have zero misappropriation in Rajasthan as around Rs 20-30 lakh amount has been recovered in last one year. “It is quite possible that reports may not have been uploaded online,” the official said. Another rural development department official said, at times, the amount misappropriated gets recovered by conducting an inquiry even before the social audit takes place. “In some cases, social audits fail to trace or detect misappropriation of amounts in various works under the scheme,” said the official. Mukesh Goswami of MKSS said, “It is impossible that there is zero misappropriation under NREGA in Rajasthan. There is a large amount of misappropriation in use of material components. Social audits are not happening in Rajasthan. In many cases, misappropriation is done by manipulating the measurement of work done by junior technical assistants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/report-finds-no-graft-but-officials-deny-claim/articleshow/85525661.cms||Sidhartha Dutta
---||Mysuru||BJP strives for a deal with JD(S) for mayor’s post||Mysuru: Six months after it unsuccessfully tried to woo JD(S) to rule Mysuru City Corporation, BJP is making fresh efforts to win their support to get the mayor’s post. The mayor’s post fell vacant after the high court annulled the election of JD(S) corporator Rukmini Madegowda from Yaraganahalli – Ambedkar Colony (ward 36) recently. The byelection is scheduled to be held on August 25. Cooperation minister ST Somashekar, who is touring the district, called on JD(S) MLA SR Mahesh to strike a deal with JD(S). Somashekar, along with MP Pratap Simha held discussions with Mahesh over the alliance. Mahesh however stopped short of promising an alliance and said he would bring the matter to the notice of JD(S) high command. Sources said that at the meeting, JD(S) leaders expressed helplessness as both the parties have shared power as mayor and deputy mayor. “JD(S) leaders do not want a bad name at this juncture by joining hands with BJP. They also fear losing the mayor’s post which they currently hold,” a source said. BJP city president TS Srivatsa told STOI, “JD(S) leaders have sought two days to announce their decision. We are hoping for the best and will wait for their response.” Though BJP is the single largest party with 22 councillors in the 65-member MCC, it is not able to rule as Congress with 19 seats has teamed up with JD(S), which has 18 seats. In the previous mayoral election, BJP tried hard to strike an alliance with JD(S) but backed off at the eleventh hour as JD(S) wanted the mayor’s post. Taking the opportunity, Congress MLA Tanveer Sait managed to strike a deal with JD(S) by giving away the mayor’s post to JD(S) and settling for the deputy mayor’s post much against the agreement between the parties and against the wish of senior party leaders. Congress sources told TOI that the relationship between former CM Siddaramaiah and Tanveer Sait has turned sour after the incident. “While Sait has approached JD(S) leaders to continue the alliance, it is as usual left to the JD(S) high command and MLA Mahesh to take a final call. Congress has adopted a wait and watch policy as some JD(S) corporators, mainly from the Muslim community, had opposed the alliance with BJP the previous time. They might oppose this time too,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/bjp-strives-for-a-deal-with-jds-for-mayors-post/articleshow/85521449.cms||---

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has made a forecast of moderate rainfall activity over Aurangabad and parts of Marathwada for the next 24-hours. Marathwada, comprising eight districts, has received average 561 mm rainfall so far since June 1, which accounts for 124% of the normal showers. The extended dry spell observed till the second half of August, however, showed rainfall deficiency in the third month of monsoon in six of the eight districts.. Barring Aurangabad (139%) and Jalna (119%) districts that show surplus showers in August, the remaining six districts namely Beed (66%), Latur (46%), Osmanabad (46%), Nanded (61%), Parbhani (57%), and Hingoli (76%) show rainfall deficiency in August. The ongoing revival of monsoon in the region is proving to be conducive for kharif crops. K K Dakhore, agricultural meteorologist with Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, said all kharif crops are vulnerable to attack from pests and diseases during the current stage due to overall set of weather conditions. “Soyabean, cotton and pigeon pea need spraying of pesticides and insecticides, which is possible only after rain takes intermittent breaks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/marathwadas-august-rain-deficit-reduces/articleshow/85520429.cms||---

Some organizers have informed cops of changes that they propose to make in their pandals this year, keeping in mind the possibility of a Covid third wave. Md Ali Park in central Kolkata and Mudiali in the south are shifting venues to allow revellers a better view of the idols. “We wish to understand the plans of organisers so that we can accordingly make traffic arrangements. However, the final clearances will be given only after the government declares the SOP,” said an officer. “We have informed local Tollygunge police and traffic guard that we are shifting our venue so that we can keep the pandal as open as possible. We are following every government and court order from last year. Thus, this year, we wanted to keep space open for movement of car in front of our pandal and a clean view of the entire pandal from a long distance. We have also told them that our pandal is being constructed indoors and that we will only assemble it before the Pujas,” said Ashok Dey of Mudiali Club. TimesViewThe year’s biggest festival is still a few weeks away and one cannot predict which way the virus is going to turn. But all precautions must be taken to ensure we have a safe Durga Puja. If that means cutting corners or changing decades-old plans, so be it.Ahiritola Sarbojanin that has begun construction of their pandal and Chorbagan organisers, too, have discussed their initial plans with local traffic guards. “We have discussed our plans with local police,” said Sushanta Kumar Saha, president of Ahiritola Sarbojanin. Organisers at Md Ali Park also held a meeting with police on the return to the park premises after two years. Cops are insisting that pandals along Central Avenue be constructed in such a way that idols cannot be viewed from road and there’s no traffic snarl.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-take-stock-of-puja-clubs-plans-discuss-shifting-of-venues-crowd-mgmt/articleshow/85523712.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

A mother-son duo and other members of the family were returning from Purnia in the SUV when the incident occurred. It was a nightmarish experience for the occupants of the vehicle as the mob was on the boil and hitting the vehicle from all sides. The three injured occupants of the vehicle were admitted to a community health centre at Korha for treatment. Katihar SP Vikas Kumar on Saturday said two FIRs were lodged in connection with the incident. “Raids are on to arrest those involved in the attack. Specific orders were issued not to carry out any religious procession in the district due to Covid-19. It is being investigated how the procession was carried out,” the SP added. Mohammad Masood Alam, one of the occupants of the vehicle and a resident of Dumar in Katihar district, said, “We were returning home from Purnia after the treatment of my mother. When our vehicle reached near Musapur Chowk on NH-31, it was attacked by those participating in the procession. Miscreants also snatched Rs 7,000 in cash and a cellphone from my brother.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-injured-as-mob-attacks-suv-in-katihar/articleshow/85520762.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Not Enough Paid Opportunities For Women In New Normal||HYDERABAD: In its 75th year of independence, India has more women enrolling in schools, colleges and universities, even as the number of women joining the workforce is on the decline, shows data. And the Covid-19 pandemic has only accelerated this pace with women, more than men, losing their jobs over the past year. Among them, many might never find their way back to work again. Prabhakar Singh, head (institutional business), Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), said: “The most disproportionate loss of jobs because of the Covid-19 first wave was among urban women, who account for nearly 3% of total employment but accounted for 39% of total job losses. Of the 6.3 million jobs lost, urban women accounted for 2.4 million jobs lost,” he said. Only silver lining: Women in white collar jobs in services sectors like technology, consulting and BFSI were not hit, said Anjali Raghuvanshi, chief people officer, Randstad India. In fact, the share of women in hiring increased in H2 of 2020 in BFSI, manufacturing and e-commerce sectors, shared Deval Singh, business head - telecom, IT&ITeS, media and government, TeamLease Services. For instance, BFSI witnessed a rise in women participation from 39% to 41% in 2020. But barring these segments, a high number of women seem to be dropping out of the workforce due to mental and physical health reasons, she said. The burden of domestic responsibilities thrust upon them by Covid-19, is also a reason. When it comes to semi-skilled and unskilled jobs, Sona Mitra, principal economist at the Initiative for What Works to Advance Women and Girls in the Economy (IWWAGE), said that men are taking over some of the jobs, earlier held by women. Example: the construction sector and MNREGA. The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2019-20 shows that the construction sector witnessed a decline of 26% in jobs between April and June 2020 as compared to April and June 2019 with women losing more jobs than men. “Generally, women used to take up work under MNREGA. But after many migrant workers returned to their villages, the number of men participating in MNREGA work has significantly gone up,” she added. In agriculture too women are being edged out by farm mechanisation with the exception of states like Punjab and Haryana where women are being trained for modern farming.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/not-enough-paid-opportunities-for-women-in-new-normal/articleshow/85524362.cms||---

The residents claimed that the civic body usually performed fogging once or twice in their areas which was insufficient and gave thrust on fogging only when people became victims of vector-borne diseases. However, the officials blamed inadequate machine and increased city area for low coverage. Vijay Kapoor, a resident of Haibowal, said, “Last year, the civic body had come once with a big machine to carry out fogging only when we had raised the issue with officials concerned. This year monsoon season is about to end, but no fogging has taken place in the locality even once till date.” Another resident from Gill road Manjit Singh said fogging was just being done on paper and nothing on the ground. He said there is a need to keep track of the fogging process and ensure compliance of the schedule prepared by officials. Krishna Gupta, a resident from Civil Lines, said, “The authorities should make the fogging schedule a public document, so that we could easily check when fogging will take place in our area. The issue can be resolved if officials share the fogging schedule at the MC website.” BJP councillor Annie Sikka said, “We have access to small fogging machines, but big machines have not been put to use in out area even once. I had a turn last week, but the machine developed a snag. Afterwards, I did not get my turn.” Congress councillor Gurdeep Neetu said, “I am still waiting for big machines to arrive in the ward. I have not been given the fogging schedule which I had been seeking for a long time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/2-weeks-on-mcs-fogging-exercise-makes-little-progress/articleshow/85525667.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Big-budget Puja to gift Durga idols to 13 small-scale organisers in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Chorbagan Sarbojanin Durgotsav will gift 13 ‘ekchala’ Durga idols to clubs and organisations of small-scale Pujas, who are in severe financial distress due to the Covid situation. On Saturday, members of Chorbagan Puja committee held a lottery to select 10 Pujas out of 33 organisers who had applied for help. In addition, it had set aside names of three Puja committees — one organised by sex workers, another by an all-women’s team and a third from East Midnapore — who will also be gifted idols. Each idol will cost around Rs 55,000. These apart, the north Kolkata club will provide a monetary help of Rs 10,000 to three more Puja organisers. In all, Chorbagan will spend around Rs 7.5 lakh on the endeavour. “Last year, many did not get sponsors and had taken loans to organise the Puja, hoping to make good this year. But with the pandemic still raging, several organisers are in dire straits. Many are unsure if they can at all bear the basic cost for this year’s Puja. Since we had planned to do a frugal Durga Puja this year, we decided to provide assistance to a few in distress,” said Chorbagan Sarbojanin Durgotsav general secretary Jayanta Banerjee. The idols are being crafted at the very ground where Chorbagan Puja is held. Artisans from Midnapore are working under the guidance of artist Bimal Samanta. All 13 idols will be 12-ft ekchala. “The initiative is also helping artisans who were not getting orders this year,” explained Samanta, who is the theme artist for Chorbagan. Initally, 54 Puja committees had collected the forms of which 35 submitted the application for assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/big-budget-puja-to-gift-durga-idols-to-13-small-scale-organisers/articleshow/85523741.cms||---

He pumped five bullets into her in front of his children and later tried to kill himself by consuming poison. The women died on the spot while the condition of accused is said to be critical. According to ASP City Gopal Swaroop Mewara, the daughter of the accused called up Abhay Command Centre and informed police that her father has killed his mother. Police reached the spot and found the women lying dead in a pool of blood on the first floor. The accused lay unconscious on the ground floor and was immediately rushed to a hospital. A suicide note was also recovered. The deceased Sunita Charles was working as a nurse in a government hospital and had returned from work in the afternoon. Accused Prince Charles was previously booked under Posco Act for allegedly raping his daughter in 2020. He was later released on bail by the high court. The matter then reached Supreme Court and the bail was rejected recently. The accused was asked to surrender in the court within few days. Prima facie family dispute and frustration over surrendering in the court was said to be the motive behind the murder, added Mewara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/husband-shoots-wife-dead-over-family-row/articleshow/85525670.cms||---
---||Mumbai||One-time gene therapy shot for spinal disorder costs Rs 16 crore||MUMBAI: For Mahim resident Zeba Gufran, whose husband works in Egypt, funding her son’s treatment is simply impossible. While Affan Farooquie’s spinal injection treatment (Spinraza) cost will become Rs 3.2 crore from the second year, a one-time gene therapy shot (Zolgensma) costs Rs 16 crore. A daily syrup (Evrysdi) is available in India since July at a cost of Rs 72 lakh in the first year and Rs 56 lakh thereafter. A lung or liver transplant would, in contrast, work out to Rs 25 lakh to Rs 30 lakh or cutting-edge cancer immunotherapy about Rs 2 lakh a month. “When it comes to SMA, all of us are BPL families,’’ said Kharghar resident Alpana Sharma, who founded the Cure SMA Foundation in 2014, and mother of 9-year-old Aarav who has SMA. She wants the government, either at the Centre or state, to start helping soon. “We lost 48 children in the last six months alone,” said Sharma, who has about 650 children, including 70 from Maharashtra, enrolled in the NGO registry. The pharmaceutical companies have been running compassionate use programmes in India for about a year now. Professor Dr Shefali Gulati who heads the neuromuscular disorders clinic at AIIMS, Delhi, was the first in the country to use these drugs and says children have improved. She has used Spinraza for 14 children, Zolgensma for six and Evrysdi for seven children. “While one cannot expect the children to be cured and start running about, it can be said that most children have had some significant improvement in certain motor function,” she said. One 3-year-old, for instance, who could not sit up on his own can now hold his head and sit for a brief moment. “This child’s improvement has occurred within eight months of taking the daily drug,” Dr Gulati added. At Mumbai’s Hinduja Hospital, pediatric neurologist Dr Neelu Desai got approval for the daily therapy on compassionate use for three children, including Gufran’s younger son. The parents of one of her SMA patients, Teera Kamat, were the first to raise Rs 16 crore for the gene therapy. “Children are showing subtle changes. One of the children who would fall down on sitting up can manage to sit for a while,” said Dr Desai. The change is slow. “These are children who have never walked or sat before. With the drugs, they are better, but the changes could take months if not years,” she said. She expects that the cost of treatment will come down with time, but parents are worried. Zeba Gufran said, “The medicines are so expensive that we cannot pay from our pockets and have been at the mercy of pharmaceutical companies. So, you are either waiting for your child to get assistance or die.” The NGO, Cure SMA Foundation, has been proactively meeting health ministers and bureaucrats to devise a sustainable programme. Its representatives met Maharashtra health secretary Dr P Vyas on Friday who said that the government doesn’t have funds to support SMA programmes. “The point is that such a programme is not sustainable without government funding,” said founder Sharma. Even if the government holds talks with pharmaceutical companies, it would help with the costing mechanism. “The government has several unclaimed accounts or cash-rich programmes such as ESIS. Even if the interest from these funds is diverted to SMA treatment, it would help a great deal,” said Sharma. The bigger problem, according to parents and doctors, is the lack of awareness about rare diseases. By the time the parents reach out to doctors, there has already been a delay; in case of SMA, the gene therapy cannot be offered to children beyond two years of age. “Also, parents should believe that these medicines offer some magical cure, the children will need support therapies such as physiotherapy for a long time,” said AIIMS’s Dr Gulati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-one-time-gene-therapy-shot-for-spinal-disorder-costs-rs-16crore/articleshow/85525735.cms||Malathy Iyer

It is an exercise which will bring out the result of the work done in different districts since the second Covid wave started to slow down, to ensure better healthcare facilities. “For better management of Covid, it is required to have all the relevant information from the district level to the healthcare centres at block level on health facilities,” Siddharth Mahajan, secretary health, mentioned in the order on district profiling. A health department official said that directions have been issued to all the districts to complete and submit district profiles till August 25. The district profiles will be updated on 5th and 25th of every month. Not only district profiles, but also profiles at the level of medical colleges, district, block and Covid centres at district hospital, sub-district hospital, satellite hospital and community health centre will be prepared. Official said the district profile will have details such as population in rural and urban areas, population below 18 years, number of beds available in hospitals, beds with oxygen and ventilators, facilities for treatment of children which include beds in neonatal ICUs (NICUs) and sick newborn care units in government and private hospitals. Also, the special focus of district profile is on availability and resources for oxygen generation for medical use, which include availability of oxygen concentrators and oxygen tankers. Oxygen is a major component for Covid treatment, shortage of which was felt during the second wave of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/district-profiling-to-gauge-preparedness-for-3rd-wave/articleshow/85525671.cms||---

In the past two days, 17 illegally installed cabins were removed, which meant the area is now encroachment-free. This led to heated arguments between the KMC officials and the cabin owners but with the help of the police, the action was carried out. The state government had ordered to remove the encroachments in the nullah areas and accordingly the KMC initiated the drive. The officials from the town planning department, anti-encroachment department and Tararani market ward office were part of the drive. Harshit Ghatage, the deputy city engineer of the KMC, said, “On Friday and Saturday, we conducted the anti-encroachment drive against the encroachers in Jayanti nullah area near Khanwilkar petrol pump. The area is free from encroachments and around 17 illegally installed cabins have been removed. A meeting for further action against the encroachers will be taken in the coming week. Accordingly, the action will continue against the encroachers”. The cabin owners complained about the action being taken only against the small encroachers. Smita Desai, a cabin owner, said, “KMC takes action only against small encroachments. We have taken this cabin on rent and have filled the cabin material by taking a loan. We have got electricity connection from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). If the cabin is illegal then how did the MSEB provide us electricity? The politicians and other rich people, who encroach on acres of land, are left as it is and action is only taken against the poor people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-civic-body-cracks-down-on-encroachments/articleshow/85520477.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Paradise Cinema in Kolkata likely to adopt Prachi model, Rathindra shuts shop||KOLKATA: Paradise Cinema, which shut during the pandemic, will not reopen in its old avatar. If the model set by Prachi Cinema, which reopened on Thursday in its new look works, Paradise is likely to adopt the same. Prachi is the only single screen theatre in Kolkata to have retained its original format while using the ground floor to set up a franchise of a retail chain. Meanwhile, Rathindra Cinema in Sodepur has decided to permanently shut down this week, despite an investment worth a crore. Everything including the sound system, screen, seats and sofa has been removed from the auditorium. The priority is to now recover the investment as a commercial space. Most single screen cinemas which have shut down in Kolkata has made way for malls or apartments. Metro has been revamped with a retail chain on the ground floor and a multiplex on top. “We originally had 784 seats. That was reduced to 500 in 2016. Now, the seating capacity is 200,” said Prachi owner Vidisha Basu. Bengal Properties, which owns the lease for Paradise, is weighing options to see if it can follow the Prachi model. Sunit Singh of Bengal Properties, which has another 30 years of lease of Paradise, told TOI, “If we ever reopen, it won’t be with the full capacity. We are now allowed to run in 50% capacity. That doesn’t make much of a difference to a single screen as we, in any case, would run with a 20% capacity.” The current capacity of Paradise is 1,119 seats. “We might have a small screen at the top with a commercial set-up on the ground floor. Whatever happens, we will not be returning with a 1,119-seater,” he added. “However, there are no talks at all about selling the cinema,” he informed. Ranadip Singha Roy of Rathindra Cinema that was established in 1987 said his family had spent approximately a crore in 2019. “Our cinema had two auditoriums from the beginning. We had shut down one in 2019 and renovated the other. The seating capacity for that was reduced to 174. We tried reopening twice during the lockdown. But we had no returns. The OTT releases killed us completely. Instead, there were additional expenses of Rs 10 lakh,” he said. In the current circumstances, he wants to concentrate on using the property for other commercial purposes. “For the love of cinema, we had remodelled and retained one auditorium. But that didn’t work. Now we have plans of diversification but are not currently thinking of having a cinema there. However, one can’t predict the future,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/paradise-likely-to-adopt-prachi-model-rathindra-shuts-shop/articleshow/85523742.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

---||Jaipur||Four monsoon spells over, but Rajasthan rain deficit still at 6%||JAIPUR: Even after the completion of four spells of southwest monsoon in the state, the average monsoon rainfall is 6% deficit compared to August 21, 2020. Among the 33 districts, only Kota and Baran received abnormal rainfall while Bundi, Jhalawar, Sawai Madhopur and Tonk received excess rainfall. Rest of the districts either had deficit or scanty rainfall. Jaipur Met office on Saturday said the final spell of the monsoon is likely to bring bountiful rainfall. According to figures available with the water resources department, the state had an average rainfall of 389.62 mm till August 21, 2020, but received an average rainfall of 366.12 mm this year till date. “It is evident that we still have a deficit of 6% of rainfall. Thus, there is a desperate need to have good widespread rainfall in the state,” said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. Baran have received a rainfall of 1,032.63 mm, which is 77% more than what the district received last year. Similarly, Kota has received a rainfall of 898.89 mm, which is 66.8% higher compared to last year. “The districts which receive 60% or more rainfall compared to last year are placed in the category of abnormal rainfall. Thus Baran and Kota had the abnormal rainfall,” the officer added. Sirohi, which had floods in 2017, is in the category of scanty rainfall. “Sirohi so far has received a rainfall of 240.67mm compared to 627.87mm received till August 21, 2020. That means Sirohi has 61.7% deficit rainfall this year,” said an officer. Jaipur, which had one good spell of monsoon rainfall, is in the category of normal rainfall. “Jaipur in this season so far has received a rainfall of 398.84 mm compared to 381.00 mm received till August 21, 2020. That means Jaipur has received 4.7 % higher rainfall compared to last year,” the officer added. Jaipur Met office said from August 23 onwards, widespread rainfall activity would be witnessed and that is likely to improve the monsoon rainfall performance of many districts, which are in the category of deficit and scanty rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4-monsoon-spells-over-but-raj-rain-deficit-still-at-6/articleshow/85525674.cms||Ashish Mehta

Bisalpur dam, catering to the drinking water needs of Jaipur, Tonk and Ajmer, is only 34% filled. Likewise, water levels in other dams is below 50%. However, engineers at various dams hope to get some rainfall in the catchment areas, which will help to elevate water levels in the dams. Bisalpur dam was nearly 60% filled after the end of monsoon season on September 15, 2020. But so far this year, it is merely 34% full and with no rainfall in the catchment areas, water is depleting. “One good spell in the catchment areas can do wonders. It is 34% filled this year, but we are hopeful to get a good bout of rain,” said Manish Bansal, executive engineer, Bisalpur dam. The present water level of the dam is 372.60 Relative Level (RL)/metre against the full capacity of 1095.84 RL/metre. Likewise, other dams including Mahi Dam at Banswara is 65.02 % filled, Jawai Dam(Pali) is 11.91% filled, and Jaisamand lake dam at Udaipur is 65.04% filled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/most-dams-need-another-bout-of-rain-to-get-filled/articleshow/85525682.cms||---
---||Dehradun||How 4 from Dehradun dodged Taliban men to reach Delhi||DEHRADUN: As Deepak Kumar left for work on the morning of August 13, he didn’t think it would be the last time he saw his home in Kabul or that his quest to reach India would take him halfway across the globe on a journey spanning 13,000 kilometres. But a few hours later, Kumar found himself, along with 50 Indians, on a bus to the airport, clutching a document — that would act as a ticket of sorts — to Dubai. The Taliban was advancing towards Kabul, but not many had anticipated the swiftness with which the country’s capital would fall. Kumar’s employer, the British Embassy, however, had made advance preparations. As Kumar reached office on August 13, he and his colleagues were handed “tickets” for a British cargo plane that was to leave Kabul in the next few hours and told to quickly board a bus to the airport. “For most of us, there was no time to think or to go pack. So we took the bus. As we passed the city, we could hear explosions. We didn’t know whether we would make it to the airport alive. Some Talibani men opened fire on our bus. Luckily, the vehicle was bulletproof,” said Kumar, a retired Armyman who worked in the security team of the embassy. Kumar was accompanied by his colleagues, Ajay Thapa, Puran Thapa and Prem Kumar — all of them residents of Dehradun. “On the way to the airport, we saw hordes of Afghans trying to stop our bus. They were pleading with us to take them along, many of them were women. I have never felt so helpless,” said Ajay. The group managed to safely reach the airport which had been cordoned off by the US military. “We waited at the airport for several hours until we were able to board a British cargo plane which took off for Dubai at 3.30am. From Dubai, we took a flight to Heathrow Airport (London) and then reached Delhi on a commercial flight, landing on the morning of August 18,” said Ajay. The total flight distance they covered was 13,000 kilometres. “We barely slept throughout and managed with whatever little food was available. But we survived and reached home to our families. That is all that matters,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/how-4-indians-in-af-dodged-taliban-bullets-on-bus-covered-13k-km-in-3-days-to-reach-delhi/articleshow/85520535.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Jaipur||Officials pulled up for not taking survey orders seriously||Jaipur: Door-to-door survey for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which was launched in July, is losing steam. Health department has alleged that the orders issued in July on survey of houses for NCDs such as diabetes, hypertension, tuberculosis, cancer, asthma have not been taken seriously in several areas. “The figures of the survey have not been updated on NCD portal,” wrote a senior health department official, while pulling up chief medical health officers in the districts. With the second wave of Covid almost vanished, the health department started focusing on non-communicable diseases. For the purpose, the health department had issued directions in July to conduct door-to-door survey to find actual burden of NCDs and to ensure early treatment of the patients found suffering from the NCDs. Before Covid pandemic, increasing number of NCD cases was posing a challenge for the health authorities. Since the pandemic became the priority of the health department in past one year, the department has now started to focus on NCDs. For the purpose, the survey was planned in which a team of booth-level officer, auxiliary nurse midwife, ASHA worker, Covid health assistant and nursing student was directed to conduct door-to-door survey in their respective areas. The team is equipped with pulse oximeter, thermal scanner and medicines used for the treatment of seasonal diseases such as diarrhoea, fever, cold and cough as well. Orders have also been issued to officials in districts to ensure availability of medicines for NCDs for next three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/officials-pulled-up-for-not-taking-survey-orders-seriously/articleshow/85525699.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi rains: July test passed, Minto Bridge sinks again||NEW DELHI: The downpour on Saturday was so heavy that the newly heralded symbol of PWD’s efficiency in flood control this season, Minto Bridge, went under like every year. The water level sensors, CCTV cameras with live feed to the flood control room, additional pumps and a new drainage line proved no match for the heavy rain on Saturday morning and the bridge, now barricaded by police to prevent entry of cars, went back to being synonymous with Delhi’s waterlogging woes. A Public Works Department official said that the area was cordoned off for around three-and-a-half hours after the water level below the bridge started rising around 7am. “The rain started around 12.30-1am and there was no waterlogging through the night. The problem started around 7am when the sewage line got overwhelmed,” claimed the official.  “The sewage line that carries the runoff from the Paharganj locality began overflowing and began deluging the site. However, we were able to ‘de-water’ the area within 2-3 hours." The water level under the bridge reached a high of 350mm on Saturday morning and the carriageways were closed as a precautionary measure. Whenever rainwater accumulates at Minto Bridge, there have been numerous instances in previous years of vehicles, even those as large as buses, getting stuck. In July last year, a 56-year-old man drowned in the pool of water there. To prevent such accidents, PWD had deployed three divers at Minto Bridge and Pul Prahladpur in south Delhi, where another drowning claimed a life earlier this year. The terrain of the localities and the existence of a common sewage/drainage system at these points render them prone to waterlogging. As an interim solution, PWD laid down an additional drainage line at Minto Bridge to divert the runoff along Minto Road towards Jawaharlal Nehru Marg, but this measure also proved inadequate on Saturday. As the only viable long-term solution for this vulnerable spot, PWD needs to create an alternative drainage system. All city underpasses suffer waterlogging after rain spells due to the lack of a separate drainage system. The nearby localities and unauthorised colonies, due to the lack of a proper drainage system, discharge wastewater into the low-lying bowls around the underpasses. Since the latter are not designed to drain awaylarge volumes of water, they go under if there is heavy precipitation, highlighting the need for a massive overhaul of the drainage. On Saturday, all major underpasses were submerged after the city recorded 138.8mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours.  These included the underpasses at Moolchand, Vivek Vihar, Mehram Nagar, Rajokri, Dwarka, Mother Dairy, Pul Prahladpur, Tilak Bridge, Welcome and Mankey Bridge. Ironically enough, a boat was deployed at the Pul Prahladpur underpass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/july-test-passed-minto-bridge-sinks-again/articleshow/85523779.cms||Paras Singh

---||Pune||Work on Metro stations from Vanaz to Garware College 50% complete||PUNE: Following the successful trial run on the Vanaz to Garware College Metro stretch, the focus has now shifted to the stations on this 5km stretch. The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro), which is executing the project, said around 50% of the work on the five stations was complete. Construction of three stations at Vanaz, Anandnagar and Garware College was in the advanced stages, MahaMetro said. MahaMetro officials said MahaMetro was planning to complete as much work as possible at all five sites by the end of November. The Vanaz to Garware College section has been deemed a priority stretch — one of two in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad — by MahaMetro. Efforts to complete this stretch were on a war-footing and, taking into account delays caused by the pandemic, everything was completed, allowing trial runs to be held in the past two weeks, officials said. “We are now putting all our effort into completing the stations’ construction. This is complicated, as many agencies are involved. Each station will have two levels — the concourse where the commuters will be able to purchase tickets, and the platform where they will board, or alight from, the train. At nearly every station, the concourse and platform levels are ready,” a MahaMetro official said. MahaMetro said each station will have its entry-exit points on the footpath on both sides of the road. The official said each station would have at least two entry-exit points initially; some will eventually have three or more. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (PR) of MahaMetro, said the stations will be equipped with adequate safety measures for commuters. “MahaMetro is installing elevators and escalators; the stations will also have foot overbridges and staircases for the commuters,” he said. zSonawane added that MahaMetro will continue trial runs even as the work on the stations has been expedited. The trials will help officials constantly check various technical parameters. “As we approach the deadline, the trails may be held on a daily basis, as the need arises,” Sonawane said.

---||Chennai||Haute and hired||Chenai: Mahima Kalra is all set to launch her own design label in the coming months. As a young fashionista, she has always been anal about repeating outfits at weddings, while also aspiring to don looks that are nothing short of a statement.But having been at home with a full wardrobe for most of the pandemic year, Mahima, like many designers, has been looking at ways to cut down on mindless production, and decided to start with herself. For the first time, the 27-year-old wore a rented lehenga to a friend’s wedding in Chennai earlier this month."It was a lovely garment in silk and zari. It was priced at `35,000, but I hired it for four days for `3,000," she says. "The way we participate in social gatherings is changing. This wedding, for instance, had less than 100 guests, and I felt fulfilled at having made a responsible choice."For those who spent most of last year lounging and rediscovering their love for PJs and shorts, personal fashion has become a matter of keen choice — both in terms of what you consume and how much. And rented clothes give you an edge both ways.At the beginning of 2020, the luxury industry was at the precipice of a seismic shift; consumers were choosing experiences over things, facilitating the rise of the resale and rental markets, says a Mckinsey article. Other studies by them state that GenZ and millennials are expected to drive the demand for rental models, and that circular business models, including fashion rentals, could enable the industry to cut around 143 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2030.As A Nisha, a Coimbatore homemaker, and until recently, a "chronic shopper", observes, "I began buying most of my clothes online because I couldn’t go out and shop. Being a plus-size woman, I invariably ended up returning most of them because they didn’t fit. It hit me just how much carbon footprint I was leaving — with the plastic packaging, fuel, road and air transport — when we were just recovering from a deadly second wave of the pandemic," she says. Nisha tried renting an evening dress a couple of months ago to wear at the first family get-together in a whole year. "The sequined designer dress was priced at `6,000 but could be rented for less than `1,500 for two days. Its quality finishing ensured it fit perfectly, and it made a lot of economic sense because there are fewer such opportunities to dress this fancy," she says.Aanchal Saini, CEO of fashion rental platform Flyrobe, says they have witnessed a 30% growth in new customers in the past year. "We primarily rent out occasion wear, and although the number of weddings has come down, our new customers have grown from 50% to 80%," says Aanchal.Rental companies are also going the extra mile to publicise their protocol. Bengaluru rental startup Ziniosa follows a seven-step hygiene and sanitisation process. "After getting a product back, we keep it isolated for 24 hours. It is then sent for cleaning, UV-sanitised and re-isolated for 24 hours. When an order is finally placed, it is packed and boxed, and scheduled for a pick-up only 24 hours later, when there is zero contact between the warehouse personnel and their personal agents," says the company’s co-founder Varun Ramani. "Data shows more than 70% of our closet remains unused and only about six outfits keep getting repeated. This is why, other than essential wear, we want people to know there’s less and less need for them to shop for parties and meetings here on."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/haute-and-hired/articleshow/85523776.cms||---
---||Pune||Elgar accused move HC over plea for cloned copies of data||Mumbai: Elgar Parishad accused Sudha Bharadwaj and Gautam Navlakha have approached Bombay high court with appeals against a special trial court’s rejection of their plea seeking cloned copies of digital evidence seized by Pune police, and a stay on trial proceedings till their appeals are decided. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is the prosecuting agency in the 2018 case in which they are accused of links with the banned Maoist outfit and under the stringent anti-terror law — Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Appearing for the NIA, additional solicitor general Anil Singh and Sandesh Patil sought time. Patil said, “I was informed about the matter at 11.30 am.” The HC posted the matter for hearing on August 25 after the NIA’s counsel informed the bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar that it would take an adjournment before the trial court, which was otherwise scheduled to begin hearing defence submission on framing of charges from August 23. On such assurance, counsel for one of the appellants, Yug Chaudhry, agreed to the hearing for next Wednesday. Bharadwaj (59) and Navlakha (69) had sought cloned copies of the hard disk before the trial court. The NIA court on June 23 had said NIA has claimed “it does not have the cloned copies” and that “it would not be just to give such directions to the prosecution”. But the trial court had said that NIA would supply clone copies to the defence as and when it would rely on them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/elgar-accused-move-hc-over-plea-for-cloned-copies-of-data/articleshow/85523826.cms||---

TOI on August 20 had reported that some quarries are in operation at Boracachi-Gally in Uguem even after expiry of leases. The operetors were allegedly discharging polluted water into a nullah linked to river Sangam. Locals said some unused quarries have water and this can lead to drowning incidents. Locals brought the issue before the chief minister during a meeting and demanded immediate closure of the basalt stone quarries. The quarry operators are regularly blasting gelatin (explosives) at the quarry site and this affects the nearby residents, they said. Locals said that some of the houses in the locality have developed cracks on their walls due to the blasting, while people are also suffering from noise pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-uguem-basalt-quarries-will-stop/articleshow/85525775.cms||---
---||Pune||Only 4% in 18-44 age group fully covered in Pune Metropolitan Region so far||PUNE: Vaccination data from the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) revealed on Saturday that just 4% of its 48.26 lakh population in the 18-44 age group has been completely vaccinated so far, making them eligible for a host of relaxations allowed by the state government. Dr Subhash Salunke, the state’s technical advisor on Covid, told TOI, “Just 4% second dose coverage in the age group is very low indeed. This would not have happened if there was adequate quantity of vaccines supplied from the Centre, considering that vaccinations for this age group began on May 1.” He said many beneficiaries were still hesitant to get paid jabs from private vaccination sites, though those who are due and can afford paid shots must get their second doses as soon as possible. “The price of Covishield, which a majority of people have taken, is much lower than that of the other vaccines at private sites and should not be a deterrent to those who can afford. That’s a small cost for gaining protection against Covid-19,” Dr Salunke said. The data showed that from August 1-21, daily vaccinations had touched or crossed 50,000 on just a few days in PMR. Vaccine shortage at government centres had caused municipal bodies to suspend vaccinations on several days in August. Officials said nearly 2.5 lakh vaccine doses were currently lying unused with the private sector as demand for paid jabs had plummeted. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “The age group started getting jabs in June. So, many second doses are pending in this segment, almost 80%. Barely 10% people take second doses on time. The rest keep putting it off to a future date. To expedite second doses, we are now giving priority to second dose recipients, with 70% jabs at vaccination sites allocated to those due, and the rest to first dose takers.” Dr Salunke said experts were hoping that the state would achieve full vaccination of at least 50% of eligible population by September. But the fully vaccinated numbers are still very low, which could create problems. “Low central supplies are solely to be blamed for the situation, while the state government has been trying to make best use of all possible doses it receives,” he said. He said the experts had already made two-fold recommendations to the state government - expediting vaccination and increasing surveillance of fever cases, ILI, SARI and mutation cases in the prevailing situation when the cases are on the lower side.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/only-4-in-18-44-age-group-fully-covered-in-pmr-so-far/articleshow/85523804.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two-year-old boy kidnapped, murdered, couple caught||NEW DELHI: A two-year-old boy was kidnapped and murdered by a couple in west Delhi’s Rajouri Garden and the body dumped in a drain in Punjabi Bagh area, police said on Saturday. The accused duo was arrested after a 36-hour-long manhunt. Family rivalry led to the murder, said police. According to DCP Urvija Goel, the accused have been identified as Rajesh (26) and Yamuna (24). The case was cracked following a major operation carried out by SHO Anil Sharma and a team comprising almost 150 people, including civilians and flood department workers. Five boats and 18 divers were pressed into service to trace the victim’s body. The victim’s parents are beggars and were found around Raja Garden circle. “The case was registered because of the alertness of local police and their self-observation. The family belongs to the deprived section earning their livelihood through begging,” said a senior officer. The incident was reported on early Friday morning, when the local beat officer spotted the child’s mother crying on the footpath after she couldn’t find her son. SHO Anil Sharma immediately filed a case and formed ten teams suspecting the involvement of an organised begging gang behind the disappearance of the boy. As an investigation kicked off, a team led by ACP Sanjay Sharma analysed the footage from CCTV cameras located in a five kilometre-long stretch. Yamuna, a relative of the victim, was spotted carrying the child in one of them. After the accused were identified, police first nabbed Yamuna from Tughlaqabad area based on a tip-off, said an official adding that she subsequently led the cops to her husband Rajesh, who was caught after an hourlong chase. During interrogation, it came to fore that the accused couple was apprehensive that they would be ousted from the circle once the child grows up because his grandmother, who was the head of the family, chose the boy over the couple’s daughter. They feared being sidelined and deprived of their livelihood and thus planned to kill the child. After picking him up in sleep, they throttled the child and drowned him in water till he died. They then disposed of the body in an overflooded section of a drain near Punjabi Bagh and went underground. Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana appreciated the team’s efforts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-year-old-boy-kidnapped-murdered-couple-caught/articleshow/85525726.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 2.5 years after marriage, Jaisalmer man’s Pakistan bride to reach India soon||JAISALMER: A bride stuck in Pakistan for 2.5 years due to the strained Indo-Pak ties since the Pulwama attack will finally come to India. After the attack, train and bus services to Pakistan were suspended. However, after efforts by Union minister of agriculture for state Kailash Choudhary, visa was approved for the wife of one Vikram Singh, a resident of Bayeea village in Jaisalmer. His wife is expected to reach India through the Wagah border in the next 2 to 3 days. Vikram’s 1.5-year-old son came to India on March 8, but his mother’s visa was cancelled due to some reasons. The child will finally get to meet his mother. Vikram and his brother Nepal got married to two girls in Sindh area of Pakistan in January 2019. But relations between the two countries soured after the Pulwama attack. Thus, for the around 4-5 months, Vikram remained at his inlaws’ place and when his wife did not get a visa for long, he came to India alone. It was hoped that after the relations get normal between the two countries, she will come to India. But Vikram’s wife Nirmala Kanwar’s passport was blacklisted and she could not come to India. On March 8, 2021 on International Women's Day, Vikram’s brother Nepal and Barmer’s Girab resident Mahendra’s wives came to India from Pakistan, but Nirmala still could not come due to passport problems. Vikram’s son Rajveer got a visa and came to India. Now after 2.5 years, Nirmala’s passport was revived by Pakistan and she can now come back to India. On August 24 or later, Nirmala can come to India anytime. Kailash Choudhary said that people in Jaisalmer and Barmer have relatives in Pakistan. Many men from here get married to brides from Pakistan. In 2019, three youths got married in Pakistan, but due to the Pulwama attack they did not get visa and faced many problems. When he got the information, he spoke to Pak external affairs ministry and through correspondence, continuously advocated the case. Two brides came to India on International Women's Day, but the visa of the third bride was blacklisted. Now, her visa has been cleared and soon Nirmala will be brought to India through Wagah border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-5-yrs-after-marriage-mans-pak-bride-to-reach-india-soon/articleshow/85525731.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhiites suffer as water enters houses & shops||NEW DELHI: On Saturday, families living in the DDA flats in Pocket 4 of Mayur Vihar I got busy from 5am bailing out the rainwater flowing into their houses. “For five-six years, we have asked the municipal corporation to look into this problem, but nothing has happened,” bemoaned Sanjay Browne. “People had to get rid of the water from the rooms, kitchens and washrooms before it damaged the fridge or washing machine or other appliances. It took us five hours to normalise things.” Asha Browne, Sanjay’s mother, said that it took a lengthy argument before East Delhi Municipal Corporation provided an electric pump, that too one with a damaged part. “The residents had to arrange for the fuel to get it running,” she added. An EDMC official, however, insisted that the chief engineer and other officials worked continuously to resolve the complaints. “In many places, there might have been delays, but we did reach assistance everywhere,” the official maintained. In Greater Kailash, Vasant Kunj and some areas in east Delhi, including Naveen Shahdara, water seepage haunted the residents. “Our furniture in the basement got damaged due to flooding early this year. On Saturday, there again was major seepage and the basements had knee-deep water,” said Dr G P Vashist of E Block, GK II. At Teliwara Bazar in old Delhi, water from sewer lines overflowed into shops and houses. “Shop owners suffered huge losses due to their stocks being damaged by water,” claimed Rakesh Yadav, president, Federation of Sadar Bazar Market Associations. The area municipal councillor and former mayor, Jai Prakash, said traders were adamant on relief. “I finally had to call in super sucker machines to get rid of the dirty water entering the houses and shops in the area,” Jai Prakash said. Sadar Bazar MLA Somdutt Sharma felt the waterlogging had nothing to do with the sewer lines. “Why doesn’t this problem arise during the rest of the year? The fact is that we need stormwater drains to channelise rainwater. There is no proper drain on this stretch.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhiites-suffer-as-water-enters-houses-shops/articleshow/85523815.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Delhi||Delhi had a deficit of 64% in August till Friday, now it shows 9% surplus||NEW DELHI: Safdarjung had received just 63.2mm of rainfall in August till around 8.30am on Friday, as opposed to the normal mark of 176.5mm. It was in a deficit of 64%. But all of this changed in just 24 hours as Saturday morning’s ‘very heavy’ rainfall spell saw Safdarjung touch 202mm of rainfall till 8.30am — taking it to a ‘surplus’ of 9%. The normal mark for Safdarjung, which is considered as the base station for Delhi’s weather, until August 21 is 185.8mm, while the normal mark for the month is 247.7mm. India Meteorological Department had at the start of the month forecast Delhi to receive ‘normal’ rainfall in August and Met officials say Saturday’s spell should keep the overall monthly rainfall around the normal mark now. “Within 24 hours, the deficit, which was over 60%, turned into surplus. More rainfall was recorded after 8.30 am, which will be added in the next day’s figures, while light showers are also expected on Sunday. This should keep Delhi’s rainfall in the surplus category until a dry spell returns from August 24 onwards,” said a Met official. Till Saturday morning, the Safdarjung station had already received 954.5mm of rainfall this year. The annual average rainfall for Delhi for the entire year is 779mm, according to IMD data.  “July has recorded over 500mm of rainfall alone, as opposed to a normal mark of 210.6mm, and decent rainfall is expected by the end of August as well,” said a Met official. Last year, August recorded 237.7mm of rainfall. In 2021, IMD has forecast the city to record ‘normal’ to just ‘above normal’ rainfall during the monsoon season. While initially expected to arrive early, the southwest monsoon arrived 16 days late into the capital this year — reaching Delhi on July 13 — as opposed to the normal date of June 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-had-a-deficit-of-64-in-august-till-friday-now-it-shows-9-surplus/articleshow/85523833.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Jodhpur||Malkhan Singh Bishnoi hails Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot, takes stock of poll preparedness||JODHPUR: Contrary to perception, former legislator and one of the main accused in Bhanwari Devi abduction and murder case, Malkhan Singh Bishnoi, showered admiration on chief minister Ashok Gehlot here on Saturday. Bishnoi expressed gratitude to Gehlot for respecting the political legacy of his family and giving opportunity to his son Mahendra Bishnoi to contest the recent election and his mother Amri Devi, the previous election. He said this in his first public appearance at his residence, just three days after the high court granted him bail. Looking weak, but jubilant, he met the visitors and looked into the preparations for the panchayat elections claiming that the Congress will wipe out the BJP. While staying away from talking about the case, he has been facing trial and is out on bail after spending 10 years in jail, he eulogised Gehlot for giving Jodhpur a lot like IIT, NLU, IIFT, FDDI, agriculture university and many more. “All these institutions of national repute are in Jodhpur today because of Gehlot and Jodhpur has a name in the country because of these institutions,” he said adding that it was his third term and he contributed enormously in Jodhpur’s development. He further stated, “Gehlot kept trust in our family. He gave ticket to my son and he is an MLA of Luni and carrying forward the political legacy of the family”. It may be noted that Gehlot has been considered a nemesis of Maderna and Bishnoi families among the political corridors and has been unequivocally held responsible for implicating both Mahipal Maderna and Malkhan Singh Bishnoi from these families in Bhanwari Devi case. While Maderna family has been quite vocal in criticizing Gehlot, though, he chose Mahipal’s daughter Divya Maderna to contest election from Osian constituency, Bishnoi family remained reticent over these allegations on Gehlot as he earlier gave ticket to Amri Devi, wife of Congress stalwart of yesteryears Ram Singh Bishnoi and mother of Malkhan Singh, in 2013 state election from Luni constituency and Mahendra, son of Malkhan Singh, in 2018 state election from the same constituency. But interestingly, both Divya and Mahendra left the political observers amused by their choosing not to criticize Gehlot and even supporting him during the crisis his government faced during purported revolt by Sachin Pilot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/malkhan-hails-cm-takes-stock-of-poll-preparedness/articleshow/85525772.cms||---

Sources from the Centre said Zydus Cadila was considered as a part of the supply chain of Covid vaccines. “We are in touch with the company and looking at five crore doses for the adult population till the end of the year,” said a source from the government. India’s drug regulator approved Zydus Cadila’s three-dose Covid-19 DNA vaccine for emergency use in adults and children aged 12 years and above on Friday. It is the sixth vaccine authorised for use in the country. On the immediate use of Zydus Cadila’s vaccine for children, the source from the Centre said the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) would first study it in details. Earlier, NTAGI’s Covid working group chairman Dr NK Arora said they would start immunisation of children after the adult population was covered. Zydus Cadila’s vaccine was developed in partnership with the department of biotechnology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-likely-to-order-5-crore-doses-from-zydus-cadila/articleshow/85523874.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Pune: Tri-services’ chiefs review training & infra at NDA||PUNE: The chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force reviewed the training of cadets and related infrastructure at National Defence Academy (NDA) in Khadakwasla on Friday and Saturday. The three current service chiefs are batchmates of the 56th NDA course. “The last time all three service chiefs were batchmates was in 1991, in the first NDA course (erstwhile Joint Services Wing) course,” said NDA authorities. Admiral Karambir Singh took over as Chief of the Naval Staff on May 31, 2019; Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria took over as Chief of the Air Staff on September 30, 2019; and General M M Naravane was appointed Chief of the Army Staff on December 31, 2019. Speaking on behalf of the three chiefs, Admiral Karambir Singh dwelled upon the emerging trends of modern warfare. He also exhorted cadets to imbibe the basic tenets of modern military leadership. The visit of the three chiefs of staff is significant in view of the Supreme Court’s interim order allowing women to appear for the NDA entrance examination. “Various issues pertaining to training and infrastructure, including future plans and challenges, were discussed at length during the meeting,” said a senior NDA officer. The chiefs paid homage at the ‘Hut of Remembrance’, which commemorates NDA officers who were killed in the line of duty. The three service chiefs also visited their parent squadrons — ‘Hunter’ (Admiral Karambir Singh) and ‘Lima’ (Gen Naravane and Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria ) — and interacted with the cadets of the respective squadrons. An interaction with the faculty and staff of NDA was also organised towards the end of their visit. NDA authorities said the visit of three chiefs to their alma mater together reaffirms the spirit of jointmanship, which the tri-service training institution stands for. “Their visit to the academy has provided inspiration and a sense of pride to all the cadets and would further catalyse them to strive for excellence in their military careers and reinforce the ‘spirit of camaraderie’ and ‘jointmanship’ amongst the three services,” added NDA authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tri-services-chiefs-review-training-infra-at-nda/articleshow/85523873.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Pune: Portable equipment & freelance fitness trainers give gyms a run for their money||PUNE: Many fitness trainers have started to freelance after several gyms shut shop since last year. Even while the facilities are slowly opening up and calling their staffers back to work, trainers have found a sense of financial security in continuing as freelancers and are giving the establishments a run for their money. Over 10,000 trainers have been left unemployed since last year. Swagat Joshi, who started freelancing as a personal trainer last year, said, “Clients tend to bond with the trainer more than the gym they go to. So, it was not that difficult for me to get in touch with them and offer my services at home.” Akhil Jadhav, freelance trainer, said, “It is difficult to work out while wearing masks, face shields and other protective gear as the pace of your breathing increases with strenuous activity. At home, you don’t need to worry about all these factors and can focus on your workout. ” According to Nilesh Kale, president, Pune Fitness Club Association, there were over 3,500 member-gyms in Pune before the pandemic, out of which about 1,000 were permanently shut down by the end of 2020 and another 1,000 are on the verge of going under this year. The consequential loss of jobs has now turned into one of the biggest factors to add to the shutting down of gyms. “After paying the rent, electricity bill and other costs, gyms have to struggle to offer heavy discounts to reel clients back in. Personal trainers don’t have overhead expenses. They are our biggest competition, along with fitness apps and online training sessions,” said a gym owner from Pimpri. As clients choose to work out from home due to safety concerns and most importantly, convenience, they replace bulky equipment that would take up space in their homes, with compact and multi-purpose products, such as replacing dumbbells with tension bands. Fitness enthusiast Jashan Bhumkar said, “As a gym enthusiast, I was majorly into weight lifting before the pandemic. Now, I have purchased a resistance band and a kettlebell, both of which have helped me break the monotony and try new workout routines at home everyday.” “Resistance bands can be equally effective as dumbbells and weights when used correctly. Apart from building and toning of muscle, it can also help with fat loss,” said another fitness enthusiast, Jasim Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/portable-equipment-freelance-fitness-trainers-give-gyms-a-run-for-their-money/articleshow/85523914.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Delhi||Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana holds review meeting ahead of festive season||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana on Saturday held a crime review meeting and also took stock of police arrangements in the wake of upcoming festivals and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee elections scheduled for Sunday. The police chief asked for initiating a drive against absconding criminals and setting up ‘public facilitation booth’ in high footfall areas for the convenience of citizens. To ease out the rain-induced traffic situation in the city, Asthana directed senior traffic officials to focus on ensuring smooth movement of vehicular traffic during peak hours. He also directed the district DCPs to coordinate with the police and PCR teams while putting barricades on roads for checking so as to not affect the smooth flow of traffic or cause avoidable public inconvenience. “The top cop held a crime and Covid review meeting with field functionaries to discuss police preparedness, law and order arrangements and implementation of Covid guidelines ahead of the festive season. All district and unit DCPs and higher ups attended the meeting through video conference and in person at the police headquarters,” Delhi Police PRO Chinmoy Biswal said. According to senior officials, the commissioner discussed anti-terror measures at outset and proceeded towards taking stock of street crime and crimes against women. Asthana is learnt to have stressed upon taking strong preventive measures to keep crimes in check. He also underlined the importance of time-bound and scientific investigation of kidnapping/abduction and POCSO Act cases with methodical follow up of trials for convictions. “Public trust is earned through evidence-based scientific investigation and professional follow up during trials to secure punishment for the guilty,” Asthana told officers. On action against criminals under special and preventive laws, the CP directed the district police chiefs to mount surveillance on criminals, review it periodically and keep a thorough check on organised crime. “A drive must be initiated to apprehend all absconding criminals,” he told the special commissioners. Highlighting the advisories on prospective third wave of Covid pandemic, Asthana also took stock of Covid prosecution, stressing upon ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour in market places by roping in market welfare associations to sensitise and educate the public. On Saturday, he also interacted with divyang children of families of Delhi Police personnel staying in residential colonies across the capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/top-cop-holds-review-meet-ahead-of-the-festive-season/articleshow/85523928.cms||---

Heavy police force has been deployed to avoid any untoward incident. The market in both these villages was closed for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Additional superintendent of police Tirupati Kakade and deputy superintendent of police R R Patil assured the villagers that the investigation will be done so that the suspect gets maximum punishment. The boy was found dead in a lake on Friday morning, almost four days after he was reported missing. His father’s friend, Dattatreya alias Maruti Vaidya, has been arrested. Assistant police inspector Vikas Badwe with Murgud police station said, “The suspect has been remanded him in police custody for four days.” The boy’s family has told the police that they had homely relations with the suspect’s family. On August 16, the suspect and his wife were invited for breaking the fast kept on Shrawan Monday and were also given clothes on the occasion. “The next day, when the boy and his parents visited his grandfather’s house-warming ceremony at Sawarde Budruk village, the suspect and his wife were also invited. At night, Vaidya took the boy out for a round. He later killed him and threw the body in the lake. He has spoken about the reason behind the murder,” added Badwe. Rural development minister Hasan Mushriff gave visit to the victim’s home. “This is a very shocking incident.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Time relief gives hope to starving restaurants||NEW DELHI: Restaurants had barely started breathing without life support in March when a new surge in coronavirus infections pushed them back into the ICU.  Many outlets closed permanently and hundreds of jobs were lost. TimesViewAllowing bars and restaurants to function till 1 am is a welcome return to normalcy. The 10 pm deadline for shutting shop in force till this point effectively meant severely curtailing their business since dinner is their peak earning time. The Covid situation may have compelled the government to impose such restrictions in the past, but with cases and deaths declining to very manageable levels, the sooner we return to normal, the better for businesses and livelihoods. Of course, necessary precautions must continue to be taken.Those that did open had to contend with low patronage, 50% cap on seating and early closing times. There was some relief after relaxation of lockdown, but restaurants still struggled with having to pull the shutters down hours before normal time, killing the dinner sales golden goose that contributed almost 70% of their daily business. The recent Delhi Disaster Management Authority order restoring normal hours of operations is, therefore, being met with a sigh of relief. This will boost the beleaguered industry, where many operators were on their last leg, said Zorawar Kalra of Massive Restaurants.  He explained that the extended operating time would mean well spread-out dinner operations, so no crowding and, therefore, in tune with Covid-19 protocols. Apart from shutting shop, many operators had either delayed their new projects or cancelled them altogether fearing an uncertain market. A restaurateur said the various restrictions had reduced restaurants to mere lunch canteens with little or no dinner sales, forced to take the last orders at 9.30pm to enable closing down at the stipulated 10pm. Most outlets had to cut expenses, and sadly among the first casualties were the staffers. Deepak Bhatia, vice-president (operations), Lite Bite Foods, pointed out that even an additional hour of operation would mean a big boost in dining sales. He now hopes for better footfall at malls and markets. “Dining-in revenue will go up and we will be able to serve more customers while following the necessary protocols,” he said. Terming the extension of working hours as an extremely encouraging move for the food and beverages industry, Satyajit Dhingra, chief regional officer (north), Impresario Handmade Restaurants, noted that with the festive season round the corner and with daily cases of fresh Covid infection reducing in the city, people were looking forward to dining out. “A lot of our dinner guests, at both Social and Smoke House Deli, have been wanting to stay past 10pm,” Dhingra said. “Our being operational for longer will allow them to extend their nights out. It also gives us room to cater to our guests comfortably without overcrowding the rooms at any point.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/time-relief-gives-hope-to-starving-restaurants/articleshow/85523902.cms||Amin Ali
---||India||New dawn: India's largest floating solar power plant starts in Andhra||NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh can now boast of India's largest floating solar power plant after state-run NTPC commissioned a 25MW project on the reservoir at its Simhadri coal-fired power station in Vishakhapatnam on Saturday. Floating solar power projects are seen as a game-changer in India's quest for building 450 GW (gigawatts) renewable energy capacity because of their inherent advantages over onland projects, which require large contiguous tracts of non-farming, non-forest land. Floating solar reduces temperature-related losses due to the cooling effect of water they float on, reduce evaporation rate of water bodies and have lower maintenance costs. NTPC's floating solar installation covers 75 acres of the Simhadri reservoir's surface. It will produce power from more than a lakh of solar PV modules for lighting 7,000 households. The project will annually save 46,000 tonnes of CO2 emission and 1,364 million litres of water, which is adequate to meet the requirement of 6,700 households in a year. The floating solar plant is part of the coal-burning behemoth's plan to turn green by adding a 60 gigawatts renewable energy capacity by 2032. It is also the first solar project to be set up under the power ministry's 2018 'flexibilisation' scheme allowing generators to supply power from any of their sources, based on plant efficiency, to reduce discoms' cost. NTPC is also building a 100 MW floating solar power plant on the reservoir of its Ramagundam thermal power station in Tamil Nadu. Green Energy Development Corporation of Odisha Ltd has tied up with NHPC to explore, plan and develop commercially feasible floating solar power projects with a total capacity of 500 MW in a phased manner on the state's reservoirs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-dawn-indias-largest-floating-solar-power-plant-starts-in-andhra/articleshow/85527611.cms||---

A special track will be laid for running the high-speed train, which will run at 320km/hour. Ayodhya will have a second modern railway terminal to cater to the bullet train, which will be come up opposite of the proposed international airport on Lucknow-Faizabad national highway. The project was set rolling with experts of National High Speed Rail Corporation finalizing the site for railway station on Friday evening and applying for no-objection certificate from Airports Authority of India (AAI). Executive director of National High Speed Rail Corporation, Anoop Kumar Agarwal, who came to Ayodhya to finalise the site for railway station told TOI “there is a plan to directly connect city of Lord Ram with the national capital”. An aerial survey has been done and the plan has also been approved by the Centre. “National High Speed Rail Corporation will begin work as soon as we receive a no-objection certificate from the AAI. It will take seven years for completion of the project,” he said. A 130km railway track will be laid connecting Ayodhya to Lucknow, which will be part of the 941.5km high-speed railway corridor straddling Delhi to Varanasi via Agra-Lucknow-Allahabad. Two separate bullet trains will run on the route connecting Delhi to Ayodhya and Delhi to Varanasi, another pilgrimage site. To cut the high railway traffic on the Delhi-Varanasi-Ayodhya route, a portion of bullet train railway corridor may go underground in Lucknow and Agra, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-on-world-tourist-map-bullet-train-from-delhi-being-fast-tracked/articleshow/85526328.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Pune||No Covid deaths in 5 Maharashtra districts for over a month||PUNE/NASHIK: Covid fatalities may not be declining as rapidly as the cases in Maharashtra, but five districts in the state have not reported a single death due to the contagion in a month. Three of these districts — Dhule, Nandurbar and Jalgaon — are in the north Maharashtra region. The other two districts are Hingoli in Marathwada and Gadchiroli in Vidarbha. Health officials said improved testing and tracking of the patients, besides early treatment, had led to more recoveries. Dhule district reported its last Covid fatality on June 8. Nandurbar and Jalgaon reported the last casualties on July 8 and July 16, respectively. Since July 20, both Hingoli and Gadchiroli have not registered any Covid deaths. State surveillance officer Dr Pradip Awate confirmed that these districts had not reported a single death in more than a month, but said the local geographical and demographic profile had a major role to play in this. He said, “It is not that there is something very different being done here. These districts are much smaller in comparison to the districts such as Pune or Solapur. Moreover, there is not much urbanisation and the districts are sparsely populated.. All these districts have just four talukas, while Pune has 11. The population is also much lower there compared to some of the bigger districts.” A tribal-dominated district in north Maharashtra, Nandurbar was the worst hit during the initial phase of the second wave of the pandemic. It is now a Covid-free district with no new cases. Led by then collector Rajendra Bharud, Nandurbar was the first district to have its own Pressure Swing Adsorption Oxygen generation plant in Nashik division earlier this year. Dhule district has had an impressive Covid control experience. Recently, it was also a Covid-free district for a brief period. Though the district has since reported a couple of cases, it has among the lowest Covid deaths and infections in the state. Dhule’s district coordinator for Covid, Dr Vishal Patil, said the state was witnessing a decline in cases almost everywhere. “But our intense testing, tracking and treating throughout the pandemic helped us reduce the cases fast. Since the patients even with mild symptoms were presented in an early stage, there was no chance for them getting critically ill. We carried 2,500-4,000 tests per day. The aim was to ensure that no one was left out,” said Dr Patil. Jalgaon district had also witnessed a higher number of patients in the second wave of the pandemic. But an aggressive approach to isolation and quarantine arrangements, along with surveillance of the people with comorbidities, had helped the administration keep the number of critical patients in check. “The state government's' My Family My Responsibility’ survey provided us with the data of people with comorbidity. The administration ensured special attention for them. We managed to curb the spread of the infection through intense testing and tracking of the close contacts,” Jalgaon civil surgeon Dr N S Chavan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-covid-deaths-in-5-maha-districts-for-over-a-month/articleshow/85523953.cms||Swatee Kher
---||Pune||Pune: Woman constable suspended over Khadki man’s death||PUNE: Two days after Khadki resident Suresh Vitthal Pingle (42) succumbed to burn injuries suffered after he set himself ablaze on the premises of the Pune police commissioner’s office, a woman constable was suspended. Deputy commissioner of police (special branch) Mitesh Ghatte issued the suspension order on Friday night after an inquiry established that there was gross negligence on her part in dealing with the deceased’s character verification plea. The constable, who is attached to the Khadki police station, was given the task of conducting character verification of applicants between July 1 and 22. In his order, Ghatte stated, “The constable had told Pingle that there were criminal cases registered against him and delayed conducting his verification, even though there were no cases registered against him.” According to Ghatte, “Pingle had made numerous rounds of the police station and requested the constable to get his verification process expedited, but she did not consider his plea and said his application cannot be considered because of the criminal cases registered against him.” The order read, “The constable later told Pingle that he had mentioned the wrong address in his application and instructed him to correct it and gave vague and misleading responses. Pingle started suffering from stress after his office asked him not to report for duty over the delay in submitting the character verification report.” Pingle had set himself ablaze on Wednesday and succumbed to 75% burn injuries at a private hospital on Thursday. His last rites were performed on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-constable-suspended-over-khadki-mans-death/articleshow/85523973.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata autonomous colleges to start UG interviews next week||KOLKATA: Autonomous colleges in the city will start the second phase of undergraduate admission from next week by publishing the provisional lists and date and time for online interview with shortlisted candidates. The higher education department on Friday postponed the deadline for application to undergraduate courses to August 27 but it is not binding on autonomous colleges, which are affiliated to Calcutta University but have the freedom to conduct admissions on their own and to take administrative decisions. Many of these colleges started inviting applications much earlier and have already started screening candidates. Since the autonomous institutes will not wait for the revised application deadline, they will start publishing multiple merit lists over the next few days, depending on the vacancies in their undergraduate programmes. “On Monday, the college will publish the list of students selected for online interview in certain subjects, including English and physics. After the online interaction is completed, selected candidates will be asked to submit admission fees on virtual platforms. The dates will be shared accordingly,” said Swami Shastrajnananda, principal of Ramakrishna Mission Residential College (Autonomous), Narendrapur. “All the information will be available on college website.” Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, affiliated to Calcutta University but an autonomous institute, will publish the initial merit list on August 22. “The online viva voce will be held between August 24 and August 28. Some departments have also decided to screen students on the basis of Class X and Class XII board results,” said Swami Ekachittananda, principal of the college. The last date of online application for the institute was August 14. The number of undergraduate seats at the college is around 200. St Xavier’s College (Autonomous), Kolkata ,will publish the first list at 5pm on August 23 and admissions will be held between August 24 and August 27. “The second merit list will be published on September 3,” said an official. Many of these institutes have screened students by conducting admission tests or online interviews though the government ruled out any entrance test or interview to admit undergraduate students to non-autonomous institutes. The government has said that colleges and universities here will have to admit students, based on their Class XII marks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-autonomous-colleges-to-start-ug-interviews-next-wk/articleshow/85523977.cms||Zeeshan Javed

After completing their three-year training stint at NDA, Chief of the Army Staff General M M Naravane, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh and Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria went on to their respective service academies before being commissioned as officers in June-July 1980. They all belong to the 56th course of NDA. While General Naravane and Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria are from NDA’s ‘Lima’ squadron, Admiral Singh is from ‘Hunter’ squadron. Major General R S Malve (retd), a coursemate who attended the event, termed it ‘historic” and ‘nostalgic”. “It was the first time we met the three chiefs together under one roof. It was a proud moment for all coursemates,” Malve told TOI. Malve, who is from ‘Foxtrot’ squadron, said, “We spent our formative years together in the academy. Today, we revisited those memories.” Brigadier Arvind Kundalkar (retd), from ‘India’ squadron, said the coursemates were together more than they were with their families. “The affection and respect for each other is intact even after four decades. We are proud of their achievements,” said Kundalkar. A retired colonel said the meeting was a rare occasion to share memories of their days at NDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lunch-with-coursemates-a-trip-down-memory-lane/articleshow/85523935.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Gurgaon||334 workers hired to collect waste in new areas of MCG||Gurgaon: The Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) has hired 334 sanitation workers to collect garbage from households in the villages and new sectors that were added to the civic body’s jurisdiction in December last year. The corporation is also planning to set up transfer stations, where the waste can be sorted before being taken to the landfill in Bandhwari. MCG officials said they had identified land in Ullawas and Bhondsi for setting up the transfer stations and were looking for two more sites. “We have hired 334 workers to collect garbage in the areas that were added recently. We have also identified two sites for setting up transfer stations. One of them is Ullawas, where 12 to 15 acres are available. We can set up a transfer station on just two acres. The second land is in Bhondsi. This plot was already being used by the villagers to dump waste,” an official said. The officials said they were drafting a formal proposal to set up the transfer stations. A total of 16 villages and a few new sectors were added to the MCG’s jurisdiction in December last year. The revenues estates of villages Bajghera, Babupur, Mohammadheri, Dharampur, Daultabad, Kherki Majra, Dhankot, Palra, Ullawas, Nangli Umarpur, Behrampur, Dhumaspur, Bhondsi, Nayagaon, Kadarpur and Maidawas were brought under the MCG. For the past eight months since the takeover, residents of the villages and new sectors have been demanding a proper sanitation system and basic civic amenities. “MCG is not doing door-to-door collection in this sector. As of now, our society collects garbage from each block and then gives it to the MCG workers. Moreover, our internal roads are not cleaned by the civic body. It, however, takes care of the 60 metre roads,” said Rajat Srivastava, a resident of Sector 70A.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/334-workers-hired-to-collect-waste-in-new-areas-of-mcg/articleshow/85523944.cms||Vishakha Chaman

The murder has been captured on the CCTV of Sakshi Jewellers located on the busy ST stand road in Nalasopara (west) Kishore Jain (45) had reached the store at 10.30am. He lived across the shop. He did not have any employee and handled the store by himself. Around 11.30 am, Jain’s daughter Sakshi dropped in to the shop. She opened the glass door and entered to find her father lying in a pool of blood. Her screams alerted other shopkeepers. Sakshi collapsed on seeing her father. Jain was taken to Alliance Hospital, Nalasopara (east), where he was declared ‘brought dead’. The CCTV footage shows the men enter the showroom at around 10.43 am. While one of them heads towards the strong room, the other, carrying a backpack, turns around and shuts the glass door. Jain was caught unaware and tried to scream for help but the men gagged him and tied him up. The men, wearing caps and masks, slit Jain’s neck, stabbed him in the abdomen and walk out of the shop. They have been captured on CCTV heading towards the railway station, said Vilas Tupe of Nalasopara police station. Police said that it is not known if the men opened the safe which were found locked when the police arrived. As Jain had just opened the shop, the valuables may have been inside the safe. Fingerprint experts have examined the safes. A dog squad was also brought in. Police said it was raining and most shopkeepers were inside their shops when the crime took place. Shop keepers told the police they did not hear anything unusual. A woman running a grocery shop in the vicinity said Jain used to step out for tea after opening his shop. On Saturday he did not. Police said the robbers may have kept a watch on Jain before committing the crime on Saturday. No murder weapon has been found as yet. As word spread, shopkeepers, including jewellers in the vicinity, downed their shutters, demanding that the killers be nabbed at the earliest. Locals said that a few days ago a theft was reported at a doctor’s clinic wherein thieves took away Rs 10,000. s||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-masked-men-gag-tie-up-and-murder-nalasopara-jeweller/articleshow/85525866.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Lucknow||Crooks hack hospital server, issue fake birth certificates||Lucknow: Cyber criminals hacked into the computer network of Balrampur Hospital and fraudulently generated dozens of fake birth and death certificates over the past month and issued it to different people. The hospital administration on Saturday lodged an FIR against unidentified hackers under the IT Act 2008 at Wazirganj police station. The hospital does not have a gynaecology and obstetrics wings, hence not a single birth took place here. However, the hospital authorities so far have found that at least 41 birth certificates have been issued. Officers believe that it could be just a tip of the iceberg and are conducting an audit to find out if more fake certificates related to birth or death and any other medical documents were also generated through the hospital system. Police did not rule out the possibility that the act could be the handiwork of an all India racket which has been hacking into hospital portals across the country and generating fake death and birth certificates online and selling them to people. Dr MP Singh, officer in charge of issuing certificates, said the hospital is connected to the centralised network of portals run by the Civil Registration System (CRS) which works under the chief registrar (birth and death), New Delhi, and keeps the population record of the country. “We have a separate user ID and password. In the past one month, we experienced snags while accessing the system for issuing death certificates. It denied us access every now and then. When we lodged a complaint with the chief registrar office, it told us that there might be some `suspicious activities’ being carried out by using the hospital's user ID and password," said Dr Singh. “On August 16, when the portal denied us access again, we contacted computer experts at the health directorate and got a probe done which revealed that the system has been hacked,” he added. "Later, an internal audit found that as many as fake 41 birth certificates were generated through our user ID in the span of a month despite the fact that we don't take delivery cases,” he added. Assistant commissioner of police, Chowk, IP Singh said, "A case has been registered and a probe is underway to trace the trail of hacking." Chief Medical Officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said, "We have asked other hospitals to report if they are also facing similar problems.” At present, nine district government hospitals and three government-aided medical educational institutions in the city are connected to the CRS portal and allowed to issue birth or death certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/crooks-hack-hospital-server-issue-fake-birth-certificates/articleshow/85526330.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

On Sunday, my cousins will also come over for a get-together. We plan to watch movies, eat a whole lot of tasty food and catch up with one another,” said Heena Saxena, a resident of Pimpri. Prajakta Kulkarni from Kothrud said, “I spent a lot of time during the lockdown trying out new recipes and sharing the photos on the family WhatsApp group. This year, my brothers wanted me to cook some of the dishes I have learnt during the lockdown. I will be making a variety of Indian sweets and plan to lay out a lavish spread of traditional Maharashtrian food for lunch.” While some prefer to celebrate the day with their siblings indoors, others want to take advantage of the ease of restrictions and make themselves merry. Varun Trivedi from Undri plans to take his sister out on a shopping spree this weekend. “My sister graduated this year, so I want to make this Rakshabandhan extra special by taking her on a shopping spree” Shruti Mahajan, from Pashan, has planned a vacation for her kids. “My husband and I figured out that the best way for my son and daughter to celebrate the festival would be a weekend getaway together,” she said. “Since we have been celebrating festivals at home, we thought of going out for a brunch this year. Many restaurants are advertising offers for Rakshabandhan, and we plan to take advantage of it,” said Jeetu Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ease-in-curbs-makes-rakshabandhan-special/articleshow/85524070.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Lucknow||Can’t book vax slot online, no shots for many in 18+ category||LUCKNOW: With a limited quota of doses supplied, many seeking a second shot of Covid-19 vaccine through on-site registration mode had to face disappointment on Saturday. A number of people, who reached various centres in the city, could not get the shot due to the limited quota of doses supplied in comparison to the lot supplied for those who booked slots online in advance. Starting last week, the health department had announced to run a special drive on Saturdays for those in the 18-44 years age group looking to take the second dose of vaccine but could not book slots online. It was then announced that on Saturdays walk-in inoculation facility will be available to all age groups along with the option of advance booking. Officers had also assured that enough vaccines will be supplied to cater to people coming to take the jab in both the modes. However, on Saturday, there were complaints that vaccination centres were provided limited vials for the on-site-registration mode, hence, many reaching centres 2-3 hours after the start of the drive were told that the quota allotted for their category is over. Sona Shukla (36), a working woman, who had been unsuccessfully trying to book the slot to get a second dose for several days, reached BRD Hospital in Mahanagar after reading in newspaper about the availability of on-the-spot registration facility on Saturdays. “I stood in the queue for an hour and when my turn came, the staff told me that this facility is available only to 45 years and above. I will have to book the slot. I told them about the newspaper report, but the man at the registration counter said that he is not aware of any such guideline,” she told TOI.When TOI spoke to senior officers of the hospital, they said that the staff misled the people. “We were allotted 400 doses – 300 for online booking category and 100 for on-site registration. The latter was consumed within two hours because of the huge turnout,” said an officer. Similarly, the vaccination centre at TB Hospital in Balaganj was also given 100 doses for the on-spot facility. Rajendra Kumar (42), who reached at around 1 pm, said “Officials here are saying stock is over, come early next time.” District Immunization Officer Dr MK Singh said, “After receiving several such complaints, we have decided to increase the quota and provide an equal number of doses for walk-in and advance booking categories from next Saturday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cant-book-vax-slot-online-no-shots-for-many-in-18-category/articleshow/85526342.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Aftab apparently plotted the murder, inspired by a crime series he recently watched. The Jamtara district police, which registered the case, arrived in the city and sought transit remand of the accused, who will be tried in a Jharkhand court. According to an officer of the anti-rowdy squad in the detective department, which cracked the case, Khan, a resident of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, had lent Rs 15 lakh to Aftab, a Beniapukur resident, four years ago. Khan had asked for repayment but Aftab dilly-dallied on Rs 4 lakh. The two’s friensdhip soured over this. “On Tuesday, Aftab called Khan to New Market, saying he would pay the money. After a drink, he proposed to go on a drive. Inspired by a crime series, Aftab spiked Khan’s beer with sleeping pills. On Kona Expressway, Khan fell asleep and he was put in the car’s dicky. The accused sped to the forests of Jamtara, where they killed him and dumped his body,” said an officer. SP (Jamtara) Deepak Kumar Sinha told TOI they visited Khan’s home, New Market area and Kona Expressway. “We may summon a few people to Jharkhand,” said another officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/friend-driver-held-for-park-st-promoters-killing/articleshow/85524089.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Traffic police and motorists had a tough time moving vehicles through the clogged city chowks. The heavy rainfall hampered smooth movement of vehicles on many city roads due to low visibility and potholes. Traffic jams were seen at four major areas — Dwarka chowk, Mumbai Naka, Amrutdham, Swami Narayan temple. Ramesh Misal, a city resident, said it took him over 20 minutes to cross the Dwarka chowk area. “The rain in Nashik road area was very intense and the visibility was had he added. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported that Nashik city received 28.4 mm of rainfall between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm. However, maximum rainfall occured within the short span of 12.30 pm to 3 pm. The IMD had made a forecast of more rainfall in the district in the next 48 hours. Inspector Subash Pawar of the city traffic branch said that disrupted movement of vehicles at the four major chowks stretching from Tapovan junction to Mumbai Naka — a distance of over 4 kms — for almost three hours. “Several internal roads connected to these chowks too were packed with vehicles and we had to divert traffic to ease the congestion on the roads,” added Pawar. Traffic police officials said that due to the downpour, portions of road along the Tapovan junction-Mumbai Naka stretch had become slushy and had to be closed for two-wheelers. There was a risk of the vehicles skidding. “The two wheelers were diverted via the service roads. Since the flow of vehicles was quite high, the traffic movement on the main road and the service roads was slow. Our policemen had a tough time clearing the jams,” the police said. The Nashik Municipal Corporation’s fire brigade said that one case of tree falling took place in Savarkar Nagar in Gangapur Road area of the city although there were no casualties. Somesh Ahire, a city resident, said that it took him over an hour to travel from Nashik Road to the College Road area, which usually takes about 30 minutes. “The condition of the roads is very bad, with innumerable potholes everywhere. I had a tough time negotiating. At Mumbai Naka chowk, I remained stranded for over 15 minutes due to the huge traffic jam and vehicles virtually crawled in that busy chowk,” he recalled. In rural Nashik, movement of vehicles in the Kasara ghat section on the Mumbai-Agra NH was slow due to the rain and poor condition of the road. “Vehicuklar movement has reduced but there was no traffic jam in the ghat,” the highway police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/midday-spell-of-heavy-rain-causes-jams-in-nashik-city/articleshow/85520645.cms||---

Day temperatures have consistently remained below-normal since August 15. When compared to the same period in 2019 and 2020, the August 17-20 period this year has been the coolest. The average daily temperatures in Pune from August 17 to 20 this year has been in the range of 36-37°C. Last year, it was 37-38°C during the same period. It remained between 38°C and 41°C in the August 17-20 period in 2019. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, India Meteorological Department (IMD) Pune, told TOI, “The diurnal variation between the day and night temperatures in Pune is much lower this August than last few years, which means that maximums and minimums are running very close to each other. There has been a marked fall in day temperatures last few days, with Pune (Shivajinagar) not recording maximum temperature around 30°C in over 10 days now.” Kashyapi said generally or partially cloudy conditions have persisted in the city and adjoining areas for many days (6-7 okta cloud cover), hindering the penetration of direct and indirect solar radiation. “With low day temperatures persisting for days and lack of sunlight, the chill has been consistent and pronounced, which is unusual for the month of August,” he said. Puneites have been feeling the chill for some days now. Many claimed that they did not need fans for a good part of August. Some have even unpacked their woollens much earlier, courtesy the lingering chill. Parth Gupta, a working professional, said he did not use the air-conditioner (AC) even once in August. “Last few days have been very cool, and we barely needed fans. Even with fans switched off, I have been in my jacket most times, even during the daytime,” he said. Arjun Arora, an event professional, said, “Last month, my electricity bill was Rs2000, which is likely to drop significantly as we have not used fans or the AC almost all of August.” Many residents claimed that areas like Bavdhan, Bhugaon and Parvati had been especially chilly in the last few days. Twitter comments on the chill in the city have also been doing the rounds. One user commented, “Incidentally, [the past few days] reminded me of the time I was in Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani some years ago when it was freezing cold.” Another said, “Yes. Causing health issues, this dip in temperature, especially in early morning.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/chill-feel-in-august-due-to-drop-in-day-night-temp-difference/articleshow/85524093.cms||Neha Madaan

The proposal of making water meter mandatory for availing 24x7 water supply is drawing the ire of opposition parties and taxpayers’ associations. Most of the water supply lines in the city are in a bad shape and water gets wasted due to leaks. The VMC had proposed to restore old pipe lines and provide uninterrupted water supply in key divisions like Suryaraopet, Gandhi Nagar and Governorpet. The civic body started work with an estimated cost of Rs 100.7 crore by utilising the funds from the AMRUT scheme of the Union government. Around 251.2 km long water lines will be replaced and 3.2 km long main lines from the reservoirs will be repaired to ease the water supply in the city. With continuous flow in water lines, there will be a chance of water leakages and VMC had decided to set up an agency to monitor the scheme. Meanwhile, the civic body is gearing to install water meters after restoring old pipelines. CPI(M) and various civic associations are opposing the proposal. “The VMC is adding a huge burden on the public for the sake of funds. The Union government has made water meters mandatory to utilise funds under AMRUT scheme. Cities like Vijayawada have plenty of water resources and the civic body is spending very less on water supply,” said CH Babu Rao, state secretariat member, CPI(M). Vijayawada Taxpayers Association said that VMC had made a similar proposal of installing water meters to avail of the JNNURM scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/meter-rider-sparks-water-scheme-row/articleshow/85522176.cms||Venu Lanka

And the alert to the control room will enable engineers to ask the mobile field teams to switch off the supply within minutes,” explained CESC managing director (distribution) Debasish Banerjee. Around 150 distribution boxes have been identified in vulnerable localities. Of these, sensors have been installed in over 50 boxes while the rest will be fitted with the sensors by this year-end. Among the localities where sensors have been installed include Muktaram Babu Street, Amherst Street, Lansdowne Road and Kidderpore. Among other areas where the boxes will be made smart include Ekbalpore, Mominpore, Alimuddin Street, College Street and Park Circus. A few years ago, the utility had surveyed distribution boxes during the monsoon and raised the height of several of them to prevent them from getting inundated. However, intensity of rain has increased and there have been instances of cloud burst, which, coupled with high tide, has pushed the water level higher this year. Till now, CESC was dependent on complaints from consumers or alerts from police or the administration to act when water level increased during a downpour. However, this system wasn’t foolproof as some bylanes or alleys could get overlooked, particularly during latenight showers. “The sensors will again issue an alert when the water level recedes so that power can be switched on,” CESC vice-president (LT distribution) Avijit Ghosh said. There have also been several instances of electrocution in the city. While not all of them are related to the CESC service points, officials at the utility said they will try to ensure that no one is harmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cesc-goes-for-smart-boxes-to-pre-empt-electrocution/articleshow/85522185.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Kolkata||Tree-trimming snaps cable wires||Kolkata: A pre-Puja tree-trimming exercise undertaken by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has left several south Kolkata thoroughfares strewn with cable TV and broadband wires, which are lying on carriageways, making it risky for motorists and pedestrians. While local cable operators have acted swiftly at some places to clear the cable mess and put them back, both cable and broadband services were disrupted across several neighbourhoods in New Alipore, Chetla, Alipore and Bhowanipore over the last week. A biker was killed in Salt Lake last week after his front wheel got entangled in a cable mesh. “This could be dangerous, so we have asked all our local operators to remove the wires as soon as possible. There have been some disruption in service but it was not major,” said a representative of the All Bengal Cable and Broadband Operators’ United. He added that most wires that were pulled down during tree trimming by KMC were ‘live’ ones. “Most dead cables, other than those used by cell phone operators, have been removed from the Bhowanipore-New Alipore-Chetla area, apart from the stretch between Gariahat and Ruby,” he said. Dead and defunct cables along the Rashbehari Avenue-EM Bypass connector were pulled down by the forum last January following a prod by the state government. All dead wires along a 4km stretch between the Ruby crossing and Gariahat junction were removed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tree-trimming-snaps-cable-wires/articleshow/85522203.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Pune: Docs perform stool transplant to cure infection||PUNE: While Anita (name changed) was tending to a hospitalized family member in September 2020, she suffered from nausea stomach cramping and diarrhoea. The symptoms stayed on for weeks and she was finally diagnosed with a nasty infection of the bowel called Clostridium difficile or C. diff. The doctors initially tried to treat the infection with targeted drugs but it didn’t work. A faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) also referred to as a stool transplant finally cured her. A carefully selected donor with healthy gut flora donated his stool sample, which was transplanted into the patient’s large bowel after due processing and tests to rid her of the stubborn infection. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that faecal transplantation is more effective than oral vancomycin in preventing further recurrences in individuals with recurrent C. diff. “It is one of the few cases in India and the first in Pune where a patient with C diff was successfully treated with the stool transplant. We have treated about six patients successfully with the FMT or stool transplant method since September last year,” said infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag of the Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital (DMH). Other experts in the DMH team treating patients with the FMT are microbiologist Samapada Patwardhan, haematologist Sameer Melinkeri and hepatologist Sachin Palnitkar. The patients had been suffering from severe refractory C. diff for over months and were not responding to the targetted antibiotic therapy. “C diff is a bacterial infection that manifests as diarrahea and is the result of taking too much antibiotics. The antibiotics also destroy the good bacteria in the gut and this results in an imbalance in the gut bacteria and gives rise to Clostridium infection,” Prayag said. “We carefully select the donor, before which a number of medical conditions have to be ruled out. Then the presence of the infection has to carefully screened out. We need to make sure that we do not transmit any infection via the transplant. Our hepatologist does the transplanting of the faecal preparation,” Prayag said. FMT works by repopulating the patient’s microbiome with diverse microorganisms that competitively exclude C diff. “There are ongoing trials in the world looking at whether this can be used as a first-line therapy for C diff infection,” Prayag said. Transplant recipients vouch for relief. “I am completely free of chronic abdominal issues for more than six months post stool transplant,” a recipient said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/docs-perform-stool-transplant-to-cure-infection/articleshow/85524113.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Dacoity appears to be the motive of the murder, the police said, adding that at least two other persons could be involved in the crime. Nearly 1.5kg of silver worth at least Rs 1 lakh has been seized from one of the arrested persons, said a police officer. The body of the jeweller, Bharat Jain, who owned a shop in Charai locality of Thane, was fished out of Retibunder creek at Kalwa on Friday. As he did not return home until late evening on August 15, his wife had lodged a missing person’s complaint. Jain had the keys of his shop. Footage from cameras installed outside his jewellery store show him being taken away by a few men, said senior police inspector of Naupada police station, Ravi Kshirsagar. The police would not give specific information of the motive of the crime and did not even identify the arrested persons. Technical and human intelligence helped nab the two, is all what inspector Avinash Sondkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/2-held-for-robbing-and-killing-thane-jeweller-others-on-run/articleshow/85525901.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

It is the world’s first DNA-based vaccine for Covid-19 that will be given to children above 12 years and adults. Patel said that presently, the vaccine will be given on day 1, day 28 and day 56. “The whole vaccination programme can be completed in two months for any adult or child,” Patel said, and added that the doses will be uniform for adults and adolescents. The MD, however, declined to comment on the pricing of the vaccine. He said that although the commissioning of the firm’s new plant was delayed by 45 days, it is hopeful of manufacturing 3-5 crore doses by the end of January. The company has received expressions of interest from at least 2-3 manufacturers in India and requests for transferring technology to countries outside India as it looks to scale up manufacturing in India and abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/zycov-d-vax-could-be-2-dose-regimen-in-future/articleshow/85525897.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kalighat Setu: Focus on long-term repairs||Kolkata: Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) is preparing a project report for long-term measures to renovate Kalighat Setu as the short-term repair work nears completion. It will include dismantling the structurally vulnerable portions of the bridge and retrofit rest of the bridge structure. “Retrofitting and strengthening work of the bridge is being done through micro-concreting. All the support structures of the bridge, including the beams and pier walls, are being repaired through reinforcement and micro-concreting to remove the corroded portions. Work on the bridge’s superstructure is almost complete and now the corroded portions on the piers of the bridge will be repaired,” said a KMDA official. The piers of the 60-year-old bridge had been badly corroded due to the acidic water of the canal. “As of now, the bridge’s upper structure is being repaired as short-term measures. A report for long-term corrective measures of the bridge is being prepared and expected to be submitted to the government next month. The long-term measures will include pulling down some portions of the bridge that are beyond repairs and renovate rest of the structure,” said a KMDA official. Officials said that eventually the plan is to reconstruct the entire bridge as the existing structure may not be able to continue taking extra load. “The objective of the ongoing short-term repair work is to strengthen the bridge for at least the next few years till long-term measures are being taken up,” said a bridge expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kalighat-setu-focus-on-long-term-repairs/articleshow/85522220.cms||Suman Chakraborti

K K Manjunathkumar from the district tourism dependents’ union, has demanded the withdrawal of the curfew imposed by the district administration till August-end. Meanwhile, Covid positivity rate came down to 1.22% on Saturday. The district tourism consultant officer Narthan said all tourist centres have been closed this weekend and it will continue next week too as per the recent order by Kodagu DC Charulatha Somal. Tourists, who had already arrived before the implementation of weekend curbs, were found disappointed after seeing Raja’s Seat and other tourist places shut. The union has expressed its concerns regarding the loss of jobs of 33,000 who are entirely dependent on tourism in Kodagu. Tourism is mainly dependent on weekend bookings and arrivals, which has stopped owing the rise in Covid cases in the neighbouring Kerala state. The union called for unity amongst tourism stakeholders to seek easing of curbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/weekend-curfew-hits-tourism-in-kodagu/articleshow/85520731.cms||G RAJENDRA
---||Kolkata||Academy auditorium in Kolkata to reopen gates today after patchwork||KOLKATA: After some patchwork, the Academy of Fine Arts will finally reopen on Sunday, close to a week after the state government allowed relaxation of curbs and three months after it was temporarily shut down, with HK Theatre Workers’ ‘Hokas Fokas’. The pandemic has taken its toll on the building. Recently, a viral video showing wet seats and damaged ceiling have left many shocked. “We have been assured that water seepage will not happen when the play is being staged on Sunday. We are taking a risk,” HK Theatre Workers director Asoke Ghosh told TOI . The Academy is run by a trustee board chaired by former Kolkata Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. According to him, repair work of the old building goes on throughout the year. “During this monsoon, there has been some damage. A crack has surfaced on the roof of the auditorium. An engineer and an architect have inspected. Tenders have been floated and repair work will begin soon,” he said. Mukherjee added that though normally no one wants to start repair work during the monsoon, some urgent work had to be started on Saturday since the hall needed to be reopened. “Funds have been an issue. I’ve tried a lot and even written to the chief minister about our problems. Since March ’20, we have had no earnings but only expenses. As a desperate measure, the staff salary had to be curtailed from June this year. Before that, we had been paying full salary,” he said. Doctor-turned-actor Arup Bandopadhyay, whose construction company received the work order to do the patchwork, said, “We are just arresting the seepage from the ceiling. The Academy authorities will be placing a net so that plaster of paris chunks don’t fall inside the auditorium if there is a false ceiling collapse. However, this isn’t a permanent solution,” he said. Joint secretary of the Academy’s executive committee Kallol Bose insisted that the building had only “seen patchwork in the name of repair”. “It is shameful that the Academy will have to use a net to prevent false ceiling collapse. Trustees were hardly proactive despite repeated requests to them for seeking government intervention,” Bose said. Theatre personality Sima Mukhopadhyay is unhappy with the condition of the terrace. “Water leaks in the room housing electric equipment. Patchwork will help us to stage our play ‘Jonmodin Mrityudun’ on August 29 but this building needs proper repair,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/academy-auditorium-to-reopen-gates-today-after-patchwork/articleshow/85522254.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Contract nurse Jyothi was issued a memo by the district authorities for performing the dance while on duty. “We have called for an explanation from her and a preliminary enquiry has been conducted,”Suman Mohan Rao, District Medical and Health Officer, told TOI. Jyothi danced to the song ‘Bullet Bandi’ at the Primary Health Centre (PHC) at Thangalapalli mandal on August 15. Officials said though August 15 was a holiday, the nurse was on duty at the PHC and also in her uniform. The nurse told officials that she had danced after the Independence Day celebrations with other staff watching her and she did not mean to neglect her duties. The original video of the song was released on YouTube on April 7 this year. The song was sung by Mohana Bhogaraju, which became an instant hit. The lyrics for the song were penned by Laxman in Telangana slang. It talks about a bride dressed in her traditional attire and looking for her bridegroom. The health officials said even though August 15 was a holiday, Jyoti, a contract nurse at Thangalapalli mandal, was on duty at the Primary Health Center and was alsoin her uniform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/health-worker-gets-memo-for-dancing-on-duty/articleshow/85524208.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Goa||Contempt power to protect rights of people, not court’s dignity, says high court of Bombay at Goa||PANAJI: Stating that the shoulders of its institution are “broad enough to shrug off such scurrilous allegations”, the high court of Bombay at Goa has declined to punish a man who allegedly made allegations on social media against the judiciary. A bench comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M S Sonak stated that the power to punish for contempt “is to be only sparingly exercised, not to protect the dignity of the court against insult or injury, but to protect and vindicate the right of the people so that the administration of justice is not perverted, prejudiced, obstructed, or interfered with”. The bench held that the dignity and authority of its judicial institutions are “neither dependent on the opinions allegedly expressed by David Clever, nor can the dignity of our institution and its officers be tarnished by such stray slights or irresponsible content”. The court made these comments in a petition filed by Kashinath Shetye stating that Clever, who is possibly based in the UK, committed criminal contempt of court by making false and scurrilous allegations against some judicial officers of the district judiciary, and uploading the content on Youtube and WhatsApp. “Such content, allegedly uploaded by David Clever, is best treated with contempt, rather than in contempt, particularly since David Clever has neither bothered to cite any specific instances nor bothered to lodge any complaints backed by even prima facie, credible material,” said the high court. “The inquiries made on our administrative side revealed the irresponsibility of the comments and the possible use of the uploader as a front by some disgruntled litigants. Therefore, to take this matter any further might only serve to feed the publicity craze of those that have uploaded this content to provoke, rather than out of some concern to bring to the fore some genuine grievance concerning the administration of justice in Goa.” The court further stated the it is the people who have a vital stake in the free and effective administration of justice, and the court has the duty of protecting this interest of the community in administration of justice, and so it is entrusted with the power to punish for its contempt. “At least prima facie, the content allegedly uploaded by David Clever is quite contumacious and might, if established, constitute criminal contempt. However, the question is whether we ought to proceed any further in this matter, or is it better to proceed with confidence in our institutions and our judicial officers, who function to the best of their abilities without fear or favor. According to us, the shoulders of our institution are broad enough to shrug off such scurrilous allegations,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/contempt-power-to-protect-rights-of-people-not-courts-dignity-says-hc/articleshow/85524178.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Sources said the special camp officials admitted a total of 35 out of over 100 inmates to MGMGH after most of them consumed sleeping pills. Two of them also sliced their stomachs with a knife. Like the previous protests, this one was also for the same demand of releasing them from the special camp being administered by the district administration. The inmates insisted on their release from the cases related to crimes including murder, dacoit, robbery. Around 20 of them were held for using fake passports. Sources said though the special camp housed the nationals of various countries including Bangladesh, Nigeria, Germany, Sudan and Iran, only the Srilankan nationals and refugees took part in protests. On Wednesday, Trichy collector S Sivarasu visited the camp and explained about the legal constraints in releasing them from the camp, with pending trials in the courts.

---||Goa||Rights as single occupants will be protected: CM to Uguem locals||Quepem: CM Pramod Sawant said on Saturday that the Sociedade Patriotico dos Baldios das Novas Conquistas, Uguem, sold some land by cheating the government, but assured residents that their rights as single occupants would be protected. The government will not do injustice to buyers and due process will be followed to declare their rights, Sawant said at a special meeting with around 200 Uguem villagers. The government recently deleted the Sociedade’s name and included itself as occupant along with farmers, based on a 1966 official gazette notification, triggering strong opposition from the farmers. Replying to a question, Sawant said that his government would delete the government’s name after completing the legal process. On behalf of Uguem locals, former sarpanch Sanjay Parwar brought it to Sawant’s notice that locals were furious about the sudden changes made by the Sanguem mamlatdar in form I&XIV records by including the government as co-owner of the property without sending any notices. Sawant promised the aggrieved locals that the government would not take away the land of those who had earlier purchased it from the sociedade, as also those whose names are in the other rights and tenants column. He warned locals not to encroach on government land. If anyone tries to encroach or construct huts or houses, the government will demolish them, he said. Sawant requested the locals to submit an application to the deputy collector of Sanguem, along with their sale deeds or any other documents, showing that they are in possession of the land. The CM requested the Uguem locals to constitute a five-member committee to follow up with the deputy collector. Without mentioning the IIT, the CM said that some people are creating a “wrong atmosphere” among the people that something is coming up on the land. The government will do whatever is good for the people of Uguem, he claimed. “I know who is responsible for not deleting the Sociedade’s name from survey records,” he said. “The court told us to maintain status quo, but I promise you that it will not take long to finish off the matter in favour of the government.” Meanwhile, a group of farmers, reacting to the CM’s statement, decided not to submit their documents to the deputy collector office. “We don’t have faith in the CM’s words, we will submit our documents only after the high court disposes of the case,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rights-as-single-occupants-will-be-protected-cm-to-uguem-locals/articleshow/85524189.cms||Johnny M
---||Hubballi||Stand-off between real estate organisations, revenue officials stalls property registration||Hubballi: The ongoing tussle between real estate bodies and officials at the Hubballi North sub-registrar’s office has put the brakes on registration of property for more than five days. Engineers, real estate developers and builders have alleged that officials in the sub-registrar’s office harass them by citing obscure rules and delaying the process of registration. In fact, many of the bond writers have boycotted work in a sign of protest, and have sought action against the officials. This standoff between the officials and those in the real estate sector is being seen by stakeholders as another obstacle to the development of the twin cities. President-elect of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai), Hubballi Sajid Farash pointed out that many of the officials at the sub-registrar’s office in question had been occupying their respective posts for eight years. “They have been citing new rules, asking for a full-size Aadhaar card, and the mobile number registered with the Aadhaar card, etc. This is leading to a delay of many hours for even small tasks,” Farash said. Credai Hubballi treasurer Narayan Acharya said that officials often insisted on the applicants being present in person to receive the registration token. “In many cases, the applicants are senior citizens or disabled individuals, who find it hard to stand in the queue for hours together. Businessmen and employees too cannot afford to spend as much time waiting since there is work to attend to. This is why they send others in their stead to obtain the token, and turn up in person for the registration when it is their turn,” Acharya said. President of Hubballi Taluka Bond Writers’ Association Shataraj Pol pointed to the unreasonable demands of the officials at the Hubballi North sub-registrar’s office. “When people bring a letter from the bank bearing a square seal, the officials demand a circular seal, and when applicants bring a letter with the round seal, they return them demanding a rectangular or square seal. Such behaviour is unacceptable and we have decided against offering our services unless the officials are transferred,” Pol said. Karnatak Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Engineers’ Association, Architects’ Association and Bar Association have written to the government demanding transfer of officials from the sub-registrar’s office. MLA and former chief minister Jagadish Shettar, under whose constituency falls the sub-registrar’s office in question, has written to revenue minister R Ashoka, appealing to the latter to transfer the officials. “There are many corrupt officials, the actions of whom have caused loss to the exchequer,” Shettar said. Dharwad deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil admitted to having received various complaints against the officials. “However, since the authority to transfer these officials is with the department of stamps and registration, we will send our recommendation seeking appropriate action,” the DC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/stand-off-between-real-estate-organisations-revenue-officials-stalls-property-registration/articleshow/85520712.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The associations argue that the app is not available on the play store, not safe to use and is not a practical solution for checking bogus attendance. They plan to give a representation to the new mayor after the House meeting on August 27 and take other steps if required. “The problem is that checking the location of staff, especially women staff, may lead to safety issues. Also not everyone has a smartphone, and due to irregular salaries, many of us are not in a position to buy smartphones. Moreover, why should we use personal phones for official work?” asked Deepak Sharma of Confederation of MCD Employees Union. “We had given a representation to former mayor Jai Prakash, but without any result. Now we are planning to meet new mayor Raja Iqbal Singh on this issue,” said Sharma, a municipal school teacher. Jai Prakash said the municipal staff should accept the change as it was better for everyone. “We have to change with time and adopt a new mechanism for transparency rather than making excuses. The new system will streamline the attendance procedure and no one will be targeted unnecessarily,” he assured. The associations are also unhappy with no increase in dearness allowances and the corporation not disbursing it as per the guidelines of Government of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corpn-staff-unhappy-with-attendance-application/articleshow/85524267.cms||---

After failing to evoke good response from bidders, Citco recently floated a fresh tender for a party boat at Sukhna Lake. Citco had planned to introduce the city's first 80-seater party boat at Sukhna Lake. The agency will provide a brand new party boat with terrace, having a capacity of 80 people. The boat should eco-friendly, that is, solar/battery operated and have lighting arrangement for operations at night. It will be the responsibility of the agency to keep the party boat in running conditions at all times. There was no response from private players for running the multi-cuisine restaurant, Magic Wok at hotel Mountview, Sector 10. Citco runs three big hotels, Mountview in Sector 10, Shivalikview in Sector 17 and Parkview in Sector 24. The administration has decided to lease them out to make them profitable but protesting employees see this as privatisation. Box: Covid upends plans The second Covid wave put brakes on Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Development Corporation Limited (Citco) plan to develop Sector 42 lake as a new tourism attraction in the city. UT administration wanted to develop the Sector 42 lake as a new tourist attraction and was planning a number of activities.

Police said the arrested accused has been identified as Jaswant alias Rinku of Kajiwas village, Saharanpur district in UP. He was produced in the district court on Saturday, which remanded him in six-day police custody. On June 17, 2021, Rajeev Kumar of Model Town, Ambala lodged a police complaint against the accused, Ranjit Singh of Singhawala village in Ambala district, Bijender of Yamunanagar and Rajinder Nagar of Ghaziabad, UP, alleging that they had duped him of Rs 30.30 lakh by promising Cancer medicine between December 2020 and May 24, 2021. The complainant, Rajeev runs a business of curtains at Ghas Mandi area of Ambala City. He told police that the accused, Ranjit, had been coming to his shop to buy curtains for a long time and had developed friendly relations with him. “In December 2020, Ranjit came to my shop and told me that Bijender of Yamunanagar gives rare and expensive cancer medicine which surely cures all cancer patients. He told me that if I knew any cancer patient, I should refer them to Bijender. My friend Mohan Lal of Kaith Majri, Ambala City was a cancer patient. After a few days, Ranjit came to my shop and I called my friend Mohan and Sandeep to my shop. We held a meeting with Ranjit, who said the medicine cost Rs 70 lakh,” said Rajeev. He added that Ranjeet said since he was a friend, he would have to pay between Rs 55 lakh and Rs 60 lakh. “In a bid to help my friends, we struck a deal for Rs 52 lakh. On January 7, 2021, Ranjit and Bijender took me to Kala Amb, where we met one Rajinder Nagar. They asked us to bring the money as the medicine was ready. On January 8, 2021, I went to Kala Amb again and met Rajinder and a person by the name of Tinku Jain. They demanded cash for the medicine but I gave them a cheque of Rs 50 lakh. They said they would not accept a cheque and asked me to bring cash,” said Rajeev. Rajeev said he told them that he had only Rs 28 lakh in cash and the accused asked him to bring the same and arrange the remaining later. “I withdrew Rs 28 lakh from my HDFC and PNB bank accounts and gave the cash to Bijender, Rajinder Nagar, Tinku Jain and another unknown person. We waited for them to bring the medicine but they assured to deliver it in Ambala in a day,” said Rajeev. The medicine, he said, never came and when he asked for a refund, the accused allegedly threatened him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/one-held-for-duping-man-of-rs-30-lakh-fraud-for-cancer-medicine/articleshow/85522317.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Ganga e-way gets sanction for Rs 5,000 crore loan||LUCKNOW: In a crucial headway towards the construction of the Ganga Expressway, the UP Expressway Industrial Development Authority received the sanction letter of securitisation-based loan of Rs 5,100 crore here on Saturday. The 594-km expressway, India's second-longest, to be constructed between Meerut and Prayagraj will reduce the travel time between Delhi and eastern UP from the existing eleven hours to nearly seven hours. On Saturday, Punjab National Bank CEO SS Mallikarjuna Rao transferred a sanction letter of the securitisation-based loan to the UPEIDA for the Ganga Expressway in the presence of Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Over 92% land acquisition work for the Rs 36,000-crore project has been done and the construction is likely to begin next month after foundation-laying by PM Narendra Modi. The CM said that the expressway would cross 11 districts from Prayagraj to Meerut and would become “the backbone of UP’s economy”. “UP will not just be the center of cultural and spiritual heritage of India, but will also become the growth engine for the country’s economic development. Infrastructure is the backbone of the economy and an expressway is not just a road, but industrial clusters will also be developed on both sides,” he said. The CM thanked Sitharaman for the budget of 2021-22, in which she had spoken about the necessity for infrastructure to ensure coordinated development in different parts of the country through ‘National Infrastructure Pipeline’ and ‘National Monetization Pipeline’. He said that taking this concept forward, the UP Government had arranged for securitization based loans from banks to mobilize finances for the Ganga Expressway. The Union Finance Minister congratulated the CM for the infrastructural development in the state and a conducive environment for industrial activities, attributing the achievement to the “visionary duo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the CM”. She encouraged people from across the country to visit UP to see how infrastructure development is done. “The Yogi Adityanath government has introduced a new UP to the world by developing infrastructure projects like the Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway, Gorakhpur and Ballia Link Expressways and now Ganga Expressway. All this has happened in the past four-five years. The mantra of ‘vocal for local’ given by the PM is clearly reflected in the state’s one district-one product scheme. UP, which has generally been known for agriculture and MSME, has not only shown interest in a mega project like the Defence Corridor but is also executing it successfully,” the finance minister said. The six-lane (expandable to eight lanes) greenfield expressway, will pass through Meerut, Hapur, Bulandshahar, Amroha, Sambhal, Badaun, Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Unnao, Rae Bareli, Pratapgarh, and Prayagraj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ganga-e-way-gets-sanction-for-rs-5k-cr-loan/articleshow/85526374.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Vijayalaxmi Sarvottam Deshpande Edication and Social Welfare Society (VSDESWS), which runs a day-care center for physically challenged children, has prepared rakhis made of cow-dung and tulsi. Seeds of tulasi plant, which gives maximum quantity of oxygen and even purifies the surroundings, are placed inside a rakhi. Before the rakhi is thrown, the tulsi seed can be removed and planted. Prashant Deshpande, Founder and CEO, VSDESWS, told TOI that 40 children with various disabilities, are sheltered in the rehabilitation center. “Thirty of them are from a poor background. When we came up with the proposal of manufacturing organic rakhis, 10 parents volunteered to prepare rakhis on a daily wage basis. They were rendered jobless after the lockdown. Six children, who are above 16, also wished to join them,” he said. And how did the idea germinate? Deshpande said he had observed how rakhis are thrown after the festival each year. “We too are guilty as we contribute to pollution by throwing plastic and chemical-coloured rakhis after its use. We discussed this with Shivakumar Halli, a social worker in Kalaburagi district. He mentioned how a trend had begun in Nagpur of making a product out of cow dung,” he said. “ Inspired by this we thought of making rakhis out of cow dung. About 200 rakhis got spoilt during the trial. We put 8 to 10 tulsi seeds in each rakhi. As our initiative got public attention, and many organisations like Brahmakumari’s, Bharavase of Bengaluru, Akkana Balaga from Vijayapura, Belagavi and Bengaluru and other places evinced interest in these rakhis,” he added. Each rakhi costs Rs 15 -20 Each rakhi weighs about 5 grams. “We have prepared about 2,000 rakhis with an investment of Rs 12,000 a month. Each rakhi costs around Rs 15 to 50. We have got returns of Rs 22,000. We will spend the profit for the welfare of our needy children. We got orders for about 5,000 rakhis. It was too late to take the order,” he added. Sunil Gowda, founder, Bharavase, Bengaluru, said that he bought 200 rakhis. “We are tying these rakhis to Covid warriors in Bengaluru, Tumakuru, Mysuru and Andhra Pradesh,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/watch-cow-dung-rakhi-sprout-into-a-tulsi-plant/articleshow/85520760.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Ahmedabad||Robust exports cushion denim’s domestic slump||Despite a slump in domestic sales due to the second wave, denim fabric sales have received a much-needed cushion from the export market. Backed by a sustained export demand, denim sales, and production across mills in Gujarat, have picked up pace. With about 60% of the country’s total denim manufacturing capacity here, Gujarat is rightfully called the denim capital of the country. "Demand from the international market, including countries like the US and those in Europe has improved significantly, and orders have begun pouring in. Export orders, in fact, were a saving grace for denim makers as they helped compensate for the slump in domestic demand from April to June 2021 – a time when the second wave of Covid-19 was at its peak and a slew of restrictions were imposed to curb the spread," said Gaurav Davada, head – corporate finance and strategy, Jindal Worldwide Limited. Even though denim manufacturers have shown good growth in the first quarter, mainly on a low base of the same quarter’s last fiscal, their production is inching back to pre-Covid levels. "Manufacturers are also getting a better price realisation, which is helping compensate for the margin loss. This is because of a surge in demand as retailers in key markets of Europe, UK, US are posting double-digit growth in sales both offline and online, " said an industry source. Clearly, major players manufacturing denim fabric reported a noteworthy jump in their revenues in the first quarter of 2021-22. For instance, Arvind Limited reported a 186% increase in its revenues from denim in the first quarter, rising from Rs 145 crore in the first quarter of 2020-21 to Rs 416 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2021-22. According to the company’s investor presentation, its overall volumes grew 2.8-folds year-on-year. "In the April to June quarter of 2021-22, we reached at least 80% of the pre-Covid level of our revenues from denim sales. Thanks to better realisation from exports, we clocked a revenue of at least Rs 500 crore during this period," Davda further added. Brands seek new sources Since the Covid-19 pandemic, manufacturers the world over have been looking for sourcing alternatives to China. Denim makers suggest that Gujarat and India being a manufacturing hub of denim, stands to gain. P R Roy, a denim consultant, said, "China is a dominant player given its massive production scale. However, the recent sanctions imposed by US and certain European countries on China’s Xijiang province – a textile manufacturing hub, citing reports of human rights violations, brands have shifted focus to India, and in turn Gujarat, for sourcing denim." Thus, denim makers in Gujarat have begun getting more export orders. Festive season to boost demand at home Denim manufacturers suggest that from the second quarter of 2021-22 onwards, i.e. from July, the demand is picking up once again. Covid cases have receded and the festive season is close, The domestic market, according to manufacturers, has bounced back faster after the second wave. While the growth in exports continues, domestic demand, which comprises roughly 80% of the total denim sale, is also on the revival path. Sales are expected to improve in festive season, suggest denim makers. Casual wear, changing waistlines have their say The surge in denim demand can be easily attributed to the increasing shift towards casual wear due to work from home culture prevalent across the globe. Loose-fitting, comfortable outfits are once again on top of the preference list of consumers, as they are conveniently setting aside their skinny jeans and fitted dresses, according to industry players. "Denim is perfectly suited for a casual lifestyle. Given its quality of comfort, low-maintenance, flexibility and versatility, denim is the preferred fabric for work from home and casual wear, which in turn is boosting its demand," said Aamir Akhtar, CEO, Lifestyle Fabrics – Denim, Arvind Ltd. Going way beyond a pair of jeans, denim has penetrated one’s wardrobe at various levels, be it a jacket, shirt, top, kurta or even inner wears. Yet another reason for a surge in the export demand for denim is the changing waistline of Americans. Citing a survey conducted for a global denim apparel maker, Davada said, "At least one-third of Americans have changed waist sizes, 15 months since the pandemic — including both increase and decrease. Such a phenomenon will compel people to revamp their wardrobes and shop for more. This will surely have a trickle-down effect on suppliers who would also witness more demand coming their way."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/robust-exports-cushion-denims-domestic-slump/articleshow/85525944.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Mysuru||Under loss, merchants protest weekend curfew in Mysuru||MYSURU: The simmering discontent among the business community for the curfew imposed during the weekend in Mysuru district, which was enforced for the third week in a row, has led to strong opposition, with traders wearing black bands and staging a symbolic dharna. Two persons from each business establishment on D Devaraja Urs road, Shivarampet and Santhepet, lodged a protest by wearing black bands on their shoulders, as well as black clothes, and staged a dharna in front of their shops on Saturday. Though the business community has opposed the curfew, saying that it is affecting their business, they are upset as the government has not responded to them. Addressing the protesters, Mysuru Traders Federation president B S Prashanth said that extending the weekend lockdown for another two weeks till August 31 will further affect their business. “Small traders and shopkeepers will be the worst-hit. Unlike Mangaluru city which is just 15 km from the border, Mysuru city is 90 km from the Kerala border,” he said. He questioned the state government’s double standards on imposing restrictions only on traders, but not on public transport. “The government talks about social distancing and Covid-appropriate behaviour, but the same rules do not apply to the meetings of political parties and the public transport system. “Traders are facing revenue losses, and the government should allow them to keep their businesses open on weekends,” said Uma Mahesh, a trader in Shivarampet. Following the announcement of extended weekend lockdown, the streets of the central business district wore a deserted look. Except essential services like milk booths, hospitals, pharmacies, banks and public transport, most of the shops remained closed. Hotels were allowed to only offer takeaway services. Police were deployed at every major street, junction, circle, and places frequented by the public, to check if Covid guidelines were being violated. Regular pujas were conducted by priests in Chamundeshwari, Uttanahalli and Nanjangudu Srikanteshwaraswamy temples, but devotees were prohibited from entering them. Box Book people producing fake Covid -ve report: Min Minister S T Somashekhar, who reviewed the Covid situation along with officials, after visiting Moolehole checkpost near Bandipur forest in Chamarajanagar district on Saturday, directed the revenue, police and forest department officials manning checkposts to file criminal cases against people producing fake Covid-19 certificates, after seizing their vehicle documents on the spot. The minister also instructed the officials to book criminal cases against those providing fake Covid negative reports. Speaking to reporters at Moolehole checkpost on Saturday, the minister said such measures are necessary to curb the spread of the disease, as cases are increasing in neighbouring Kerala. Chamarajangar DC M R Ravi, DHO M C Ravi, ASP Sundaraj Raj, Bandiger Tiger Conservation Project director S R Natesh and tahsildar Ravishankar were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mysuru-traders-protest-weekend-curfew/articleshow/85520586.cms||---

Delhi BJP in-charge and national general secretary (organisation) Baijayant Jay Panda will also be attending it. Delhi BJP functionaries said the meeting was significant because the party wanted the state organisation to be ready for the polls in advance. BJP has been in power in the corporations for nearly 15 years. In the 2022 elections, it faces a bigger challenge with AAP having come to power in the capital with brute majority for the second time. AAP is prepared to leave no stone unturned in trying to win the municipal polls. Adesh Gupta said that all core committee members would be attending the meeting. “Those attending it in the holy city will also take a dip in the Ganga,” said Gupta. Bidhuri said that the brainstorming would be done to make a strategy to take the failures of the AAP government to the public. Delhi BJP functionaries have been holding meetings with local party functionaries and citizens in different parts of the city under the Delhi BJP’s ‘pravaas karyakram’ that seeks to mobilise ground-level party workers before the municipal elections. “With the party workers, I reviewed the strategy for taking the achievements of the Narendra Modi government to each and every household,” Bidhuri said after a meeting in Raghubarpura. He also reviewed social media activities and the appointment of ‘panna pramukhs’ (booth-level workers). A meeting was held at Safeda Basti in Geeta Colony on Friday. “People have high expectations from Narendra Modi government’s housing scheme for the slum dwellers and they are also grateful to the Modi government for getting them free ration. Many poor people are disappointed because the Ayushman Bharat scheme has not been implemented in Delhi by the AAP government,” Bidhuri claimed. The BJP functionaries’ meetings started from Friday evening and continued till Saturday afternoon. Gupta held meetings in Najafgarh, Bakkarwala JJ Colony, Baprola among other places. “BJP is not only a political platform but also a medium to connect people of various sections of the society. PM Modi is giving a new direction to the country and inspired by his vision, we are interacting with various sections of the society for expanding the party organisation,” said Gupta. Kuljeet Singh Chahal, who coordinated the meetings, said the ‘pravaas karyakram’ was the key to Delhi BJP’s strength.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-to-meet-in-haridwar-to-fix-civic-poll-strategy/articleshow/85526384.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Lucknow||Women in UP were insecure before BJP came to power in 2017: CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ascent to power in 2014 was the turning point in women’s empowerment, said chief minister Yogi Adityanath at the launch of Mission Shakti phase 3 on Saturday. “It was a year of massive transformation with PM Narendra Modi coming up with a vision to make women independent,” he said. Stating that no society can progress by ignoring half its population, the chief minister said, Modi provided a new direction to women’s empowerment by launching schemes like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, starting jan dhan accounts to make women financially independent, getting toilets constructed for the poorest, launching Swamitva scheme to ensure women got priority in inheriting property and getting homes built under PM Awas Yojana. “Everyone is aware of the situation of women in UP before 2017. There was widespread insecurity that impacted women’s sense of independence and dignity. As soon as our government came to power in 2017, we kicked off a special programme for women’s security that culminated in Mission Shakti,” he said. Laying the foundation of a women’s PAC battalion, the CM said, one unit would be set up in Lucknow and another in Gorakhpur. Commenting on how women were recruited in police, but never deployed in the field, he added his government decided that at least 20% of 1.5 lakh police recruits would be women and 10,000 have been appointed as beat constables. Elaborating on steps taken by his government to empower women, the CM said they appointed banking correspondent sakhis, who would ensure women did need not visit banks for basic work like making withdrawals and depositing cash. BC sakhis would take these facilities to their doorsteps. Self-help groups were empowered and errant fair-price shops handed over to these groups. Commending the work done by Balinee Milk Producer Company in Jhansi, the CM said, Rs 35 crore has been approved to set up milk producing companies in other districts as well. “People have been seeking 35% reservation for women in panchayats, but after recent elections, 54% new gram pradhans, 56% zila panchayat chairpersons and 54% block pramukhs are women,” he said. Governor Anandiben Patel also encouraged women to realise their dreams. Talking about a change in mindset over past 15-20 years, she said, when she visited the Lucknow Jail after coming to the state and interacted with women convicts, 80% of them said, they had been sentenced for killing their daughters-in-law for dowry. “Now when I go to villages, women say they want to end dowry. Earlier, women were not allowed to work but now there are thousands of self-reliant SHGs. Women did not approve of their daughters being educated, saying their role was to marry and raise children. Now, people realise the necessity of education,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/women-in-up-were-insecure-before-bjp-came-to-power-in-2017-cm-yogi/articleshow/85526382.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Worse, he said, the mayor passed the buck to the executive engineers, submitting that it was a misunderstanding and that in future, officials concerned would send the note to the commissioner. Bansal said that Section 52 of the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, to which the Commissioner had referred to warn the Mayor, has been on the statute book since day one, but never before in the last 30 years of the MC had the Mayor “submitted meekly to such an arrogant missive” from the Commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cops-let-loose-water-jets-as-cong-takes-on-bjp-over-misconduct-with-woman/articleshow/85522375.cms||---

Against the backdrop of Serum Institute of India chairman Cyrus Poonawalla emphasising on the need of third or booster dose of Covishield vaccine six months after the second dose, Paul said very few countries in the world had started with booster doses. He also said there was no recommendation from the WHO about it yet. "We are watching the emerging data in this regard continuously and would be guided by the NTAGI in this regard," he said. About reducing the gap between the two doses of Covishield, Paul said there was no recommendation from NTAGI on it either. "The present gap between the two doses of Covishield is based on science and there's no issue about it. So, the government is not thinking about reducing the gap between two doses," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-plan-yet-of-covid-booster-shots-niti-aayogs-vk-paul/articleshow/85527672.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Grandmother crosses all hurdles to pursue doctorate in Sufism||Clad in pristine white shalwar-kurta with a matching hijab covering her head, she sits on a sofa against decorative Arabic inscriptions on the wall featuring 99 names of Allah. One of the names is Rahman the merciful. It is divine mercy, says 75-year-old Zubeida Yacoob Khandwani, which propels her to seek knowledge regardless of hurdles she has faced. It is this joie de verve, this positive energy that makes her stand out. When most septuagenarians hang up their boots and the prosperous ones amongst them either bask in past glory or pen memoirs, this gutsy grandmother has opened yet another chapter in her life. She is researching for a doctorate on Sufism. “I would have finished it a decade ago but for a few setbacks. My guide, renowned Urdu, Persian and Islamic Studies scholar Prof Nizamuddin Gorekar (he taught at many institutions, including St Xavier’s College in South Mumbai) died, followed by the death of my husband (businessman Yacoob Khandwani and younger brother of former MLA, Haj Committee of India chairman Amin Khandwani),” she says. Then she fell and fractured an arm. Someone else might have given up. But she didn’t. Tomes on Sufism, many volumes of the Quran and its commentaries, journals, history books jostle for space at the Khandwani House, a heritage bungalow (built in 1882) in Mahim. “I shifted many of the books into my office and even at the godown as we ran short of space here,” says son Sohail Khandwani, businessman, managing trustee of Mahim Dargah and a trustee of Haji Ali Dargah. A family with a legacy of over 200 years, it is the fifth generation of the Khandwanis living in the same house. Zubeida was barely 17 when her mother died and she was married. She dropped out of college. Later she graduated in Arts through a correspondence course and subsequently completed LLB too. “There was a time when my mother, my elder sister and I were at the same educational complex run by the Sindhis in Bandra. Then it felt a bit embarrassing that my mother and I were students though we went to different classrooms,” recalls Sohail Khandwani. The real surprise, recalls Sohail, came when his father decided to do a Masters in Economics as his mother joined an MA course in Islamic Studies. Zubeida, also general secretary at the All India Memon Jamat Federation, got attracted to Sufism as she began visiting mausoleums of Sufi saints like Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (Ajmer), Nizamuddin Aulia (Dehi), Makhdoom Mahimi and Haji Ali. “Sufism is not a new religion. It is a way of life that makes you tolerant and modest,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-grandmother-crosses-all-hurdles-to-pursue-doctorate-in-sufism/articleshow/85525964.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Delhi||Delhi: Man who attempted immolation dies||NEW DELHI: A man who had attempted immolation outside the Supreme Court recently, along with a woman, died of his burn injuries early on Sunday. The woman is undergoing treatment and police are trying to find out the reason behind their extreme step. The duo, who are in their mid twenties, had set themselves on fire using two lighters outside the apex court on Monday afternoon. Police and security officials had then swiftly doused the fire and rushed them to a hospital where they were admitted for treatment. The two had sustained around 65-70 per cent burn wounds and were declared unfit for statement. Their families were informed. The girl belongs to Ballia and the man was from Ghazipur, both in Uttar Pradesh. The duo had accused police officials of UP and politicians of driving them to suicide. An investigation is underway regarding this. They had also done a Facebook live of over ten minutes just before the incident. In the live video, the woman had accused BSP MP Atul Rai of harassing the duo by implicating them in a false case after she filed a case against Rai of sexually harassing her. The woman had filed a case in 2019 against Rai and stated that the incident took place at his apartment and that he had recorded a video and threatened to circulate it on social media. Following this, a case of forgery was filed against the woman on a complaint of Rai’s brother. Later, a non-bailable warrant was also issued against the woman. The man, who died on early Saturday, was a witness in the case. During her FB live, the woman levied allegations on the MP, police officers as well as judges. Later, the man took over and the two walked towards the Supreme Court where they poured kerosene on them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-who-attempted-immolation-dies/articleshow/85524405.cms||---

---||Lucknow||UP govt enabling and handholding women via Mission Shakti initiative||Women are the largest untapped reservoir of talent in the world” – a former First Lady while stating this was also drawing attention of the world and governments towards ensuring their safety, dignity and self-reliance. Women are seen as the catalysts for development the world over and acknowledging this, the Uttar Pradesh government since 2017 has aimed at creating awareness about their rights and launched several programmes for enabling their growth and well-being. Empowered women in UP, the beneficiaries of the government launched its “Mission Shakti” programme in 2020, are setting new examples and becoming partners in the creation of a strong and more equitable society. By increasing the use of health and other services they are ensuring the well-being of their children and families as well as their own. Seeking and getting support for their economic stability and that of their communities these women are making the governments more accountable to cater to their needs which is a matter of right as a human being. The UP government through its Mahila Shakti Kendras in 75 districts has spread awareness to around 19 lakh women and daughters in the past year. A total of 37,406 activities were organised and along with this 12.76 lakh women have been linked to various welfare schemes of the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Despite the pandemic over 1.85 lakh new beneficiaries have been added under the “Destitute Women Pension Scheme” (after the death of their husbands). The scheme has benefitted about 28 lakh women. The “Mukhyamantri Kanya Sumangla Yojana” has added about 44,000 beneficiaries in first three months since March 2021 bringing the total to 7.58 lakh. Moreover, government schemes like Women Self Help Groups, Banking Correspondent (BC) Sakhis have shown the path of self-reliance while other schemes like “Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana” have lent support to the parents of the girl child. In a first, the Yogi government has launched BC Sakhi scheme and recruited and trained 17,500 banking correspondents. Training of the remaining, out of 58,000 women selected to the post is underway. This initiative gives women an opportunity to be involved in the decision-making process which impacts not just them but their families, communities and the nation eventually and gradually moving towards gender equity. For the alleviation of rural poverty and creating more sustainable livelihood opportunities for rural women, the state government has also disbursed a Revolving Fund of Rs 15,000 per group to around 40,000 SHGs in the state through online transfer amounting to Rs 88.66 crore. Besides this the government has various schemes benefitting individuals, families for education and training, construction labourers and their children, child safety etc. at the panchayat level. A government committed towards enabling and handholding its women to help them tap their reservoir of talent and potential is treading on the right path and needs to be acknowledged and appreciated.

---||Agra||Agra police asks youngsters to take up job training course of IT firm costing Rs 2 lakh||AGRA: In a surprising move, Agra police as part of its ‘community policing’ drive has tied up with a private IT firm and is encouraging youngsters to take up its yearly training course costing over Rs 2 lakh. Sharing details of the programme from its official Twitter handle, Agra police had invited students to attend a counselling session of HCL Technologies at St John’s College. Students were asked to submit their details at nearby police stations to avail the benefit of the opportunity. Agra SSP Muniraj G himself attended the counselling session on Saturday. A senior official of the IT company confirmed to TOI that the fee of the year-long training-cum-internship course is Rs 2.36 lakh. The SSP said, “We are not forcing anyone to enroll in the programme. We just wanted to support youngsters in getting a job opportunity as part of community policing. It will be very helpful for students from rural areas. There were no charges for the counselling session.” Meanwhile, ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna said he has no idea about the entire matter. Another senior official said there is no such drive in any other district of the state. “The government has not issued any directives in this regard,” he said. According to the details shared by Agra police, students will get jobs as software developer, design engineer, tech analyst, data engineer, support and process associate after successful completion of the programme. According to the HCL website, ‘TechBee’s Early Career Program’ is an “exclusive job programme for individuals looking for full-time jobs after Class XII thereby making them financially independent. Candidates undergo 12 months training for entry-level IT services and associate job roles. Successful candidates hired by HCL, will get salaries in between Rs 1.70 – 2.20 lakh per annum". A Jagdishpura-based student, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “I along with my three friends had come to attend the counselling session after seeing the information in this regard on the official Twitter account of Agra police. We thought it would be a programme in cyber technologies and we would get experience working with Agra police. But it is the same programme which the IT company has been offering for the past several years. We are not able to understand what a government organization has to do with a paid service provided by a private company. However, the programme offered by the company is good for those who want to kick-start their career in IT services after Class XII.” A retired IPS officer who served in Agra earlier said, “In my 36 years as a policeman, I never saw this sort of community policing. The government runs employment exchanges to take care of job opportunities. Police have no business in promoting a programme offered by a private company even if the department is benefiting under corporate social responsibility. Senior officials must look into the entire matter.” “Community policing is a law enforcement strategy. This allows public safety officers to engage with local residents and prevent crime from happening instead of responding to incidents after they occur,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-police-asks-youngsters-to-take-up-job-training-course-of-it-firm-costing-rs-2l-surprises-many/articleshow/85520764.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Chandigarh||Ind’l Area, Sec 19 marred by dilapidated parks, flooded roads: Residents||Panchkula: Residents of Industrial Area and Sector 19 are unhappy with the condition of the three parks situated in Industrial Area Phase I and Phase II, which, they say, are in a dilapidated state. Poor maintenance of both phases of Industrial Area is also causing problems. Despite the MC releasing funds to maintain parks under under PDS (Park Development Societies), parks here have had little by way of maintenance. Several complaints have been made to the MC but no action has been initiated so far. Social activist Dev Raj Sharma, a resident of Sector 19 alleged that during MC elections, many promises were made by mayor Kulbhushan Goyal, but residents and industrialists lack even basic amenities in Panchkula. Sharma said that while Haryana Assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta often described Panchkula as the “City of Parks,” all the three parks in Industrial Area had run wild. “Benches and footpaths in the parks are covered with weeds. The MC issued an amount to maintain the parks but nothing is being done on the ground and we do not know where that money has gone,” an industrialist alleged. Industrialists also alleged that roads were damaged and stagnant water, blocked road gullies and garbage dumps could be seen all around. They expressed concern over the presence of stray cattle. They said stagnant water had become a breeding ground for mosquitoes while garbage dumps drew stray cattle and caused the area to stink. Also, members of the welfare society alleged that there was no let up in illegal encroachments and that despite multiple complaints, the issues were not being resolved. BOX: Industrial Area, Sector-19 woes: - Poorly maintained parks - Broken roads - Illegal encroachments - Blocked road gullies - Stagnant water - Stray cattle Photo quotes: Unkept promises Dev Raj Sharma | Social activist The MC is spending Rs 40 lakh to grow grass along footpaths in the city, but they forgot to remove excess wild grass from parks. If newly grown grass is not maintained, it is of no use. Bittu Sudana | AAP worker Mayor promised to provide all basic amenities during the election, but the ground reality says something else. Rakesh Aggarwal | President, Lok Sarvhitkari Society MC must focus on providing basic facilities to residents before announcing major projects for the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/indl-area-sec-19-marred-by-dilapidated-parks-flooded-roads-residents/articleshow/85522415.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

---||Chennai||Why do you punish states with fewer MPs for reducing population?: Madras HC||CHENNAI: A bench of the Madras high court has questioned the rationale of states like Tamil Nadu being punished with reduction of Parliament seats for successfully implementing population control measures and asked whether they could be compensated monetarily for losing out on Parliament members. Till 1962, there were 41 Lok Sabha members from Tamil Nadu. But after the 1967 general elections, the number has come down to 39 as the state had successfully controlled its population growth. Using the analogy of the no-confidence motion in 1999 in which former PM A B Vajpayee’s government lost by one vote, a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice B Pugalendhi said, “When a vote of one member of Parliament is capable of toppling a government, it is very shocking that Tamil Nadu lost two MPs because of successful implementation of birth control measures in the state.” “Notionally, the contribution of an MP in five years could be taken as Rs 200 crore, though it cannot be determined monetarily. Therefore, for every election since 1967, Tamil Nadu has to be compensated Rs 400 crore for reduction of two MP seats which amounts to Rs 5,600 crore,” the bench said. Tamil Nadu should be compensated either monetarily or through an additional representation in the Rajya Sabha, the court said. Questioning the Union government as to why it cannot restore the number to 41 MPs in the state from the next general elections, the bench also suo motu impleaded 10 top political parties, including the ruling DMK and the main opposition AIADMK, besides the Congress and the BJP to submit their responses. The court was hearing a public interest writ petition seeking dereservation of Tenkasi parliamentary constituency which has remained a reserved constituency for more than 50 years. Population control cannot be a factor to decide the number of political representatives of states in Parliament, the bench said. “Those states that fail to implement birth control programmes benefited with more political representatives in Parliament whereas states, especially southern states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, which successfully implemented birth control measures lost two seats each in Parliament. Andhra Pradesh also lost two MPs and got the number reduced from 42 to 40 seats in Parliament.” The judges also noted that population control is a must and there will be acute shortage of natural resources, public amenities and people cannot lead a healthy life without it. “Normally, a state government has to be honoured and complimented for successfully implementing central government’s policies and projects and interests of such state cannot be adversely affected.” The bench asked the authorities concerned to respond to the proposal within four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-why-do-you-punish-states-with-fewer-mps-for-reducing-population/articleshow/85524455.cms||Srikkanth D

The students visited the city police commissioner’s office on Saturday and expressed their concerns to city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar and DCP (Law and Order) Hariram Shankar. A total 58 Afghan students are studying in the city, and of them 11 had returned home. Some of them are living with their families. On the sidelines of this meeting, Nasir Ahmad Shafiei, a PhD student, told TOI that their major concern is the extension of visas and passport renewal. “Visas of a few students, especially those in the final year, may expire by September, and extension of their visas for about six months would be useful. We also request the Indian government to grant Afghan students who have graduated to get work permits and refugee status, so that they overcome their problems, especially financial issues. We hope that the Indian government will grant humanitarian aid to help students and researchers who are stuck in Afghanistan, so that they can come back, and do not miss the academic year,” he said. The students said that nearly 100 Afghan students selected for educational support by the Indian government may be given emergency visas to come here, as the academic year is commencing. They also hoped that the government would help students who want to go back to reunite with their families, who are in Afghanistan. A few students said that it was painful to see certain incidents, due to which they have had sleepless nights. They are mostly in touch with their families through text messages. The women said that their dreams have been destroyed, due to the events that have transpired back home. They came to India to study, and wanted to go back and work in their country. They are worried about the future. City police commissioner N Shashi Kumar assured all possible cooperation for their safety, and said that their concerns would be shared with the state government. The state government appointed additional DGP Umesh Kumar as the nodal officer to coordinate with the central government for bringing back the people of the state who are stranded in Afghanistan.

---||Lucknow||We were told to convert 5 people a day: Mastermind||Lucknow: The Nagpur module of illegal religious conversion network was tasked to convert at least five youths to Islam every day, said Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (UPATS) officials on Saturday. This was unearthed after prolonged interrogation of accused Rameshwar Kawre alias Adam, Kaushar Alam, Bhuriya Bando alias Arslan Mustafa and Dr Firoz Shah. IG, ATS, Gajendra Kumar Goswamy, said there is evidence that conversions were done at the behest of mastermind Umar Gautam. “Gang members trapped and converted innocents in Maharashtra with financial and other allurements. Umar Gautam along with members of his gang had created a syndicate for changing the population balance through conversions,” he said. Adam confessed they were given a target of converting at least five persons per day, the IG said. “The modus operandi was to create psychological pressure to embrace Islam by weaning them away from their own religion. Economically weaker people, women, and specially deaf and dumb people, were being converted against their will. The accused designed programmes on social media sites with lucrative offers to those embracing Islam,” said the officer. ATS officials also said the four arrested from Maharashtra would conduct a ‘get-together’ parties, where participants would be brainwashed to believe that embracing Islam would help them revert to their original religion. Videos of these parties have also been recovered by ATS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/we-were-told-to-convert-5-people-a-day-mastermind/articleshow/85526389.cms||---

---||Goa||To keep a tradition alive, Goans pack coconuts to UK, but only to break it||PANAJI: Goans who migrate to the UK after acquiring Portuguese citizenship usually don’t forget to pack their bags with plenty of sausages, bottles of feni and, if it’s season time, Mancurad mangoes. More recently, there’s another addition: Coconuts. It all started as a pastime during the ‘Konsachem Fest’ or the harvest feast—thanksgiving ritual where devotees pray for God’s continued blessings—when traditionally people would indulge in breaking coconuts in an individual contest, with the winner taking home the coconut that he broke. But soon the stakes were raised, as bets were placed and coconut-breaking competitions held coinciding with the feast, even for Goans in the UK. Soon, coconuts with thicker shells were much in demand. “They are now doing this even in London and all of them take coconuts from here,” says Namdeo Kankonkar, winner of several coconut breaking competitions in the state. “I get many requests, but we are left with only one tree (that produces strong coconuts), unlike three in the past. There is not much I can do to help all my contacts.” Goa has approximately 25,000 hectares of coconut plantation and produces over 100 million coconuts a year. Thousands of Goans have migrated to the UK, making the best of Portuguese nationality law which states that those born in Goa before the Liberation, and their three generations, can acquire Portuguese citizenship. They are settled all across the UK with approximately 20,000 Goans living in Swindon alone. No surprise that the first coconut breaking competition was started in Swindon by Jesus Nazareth Boys of Siridao in 2007. “Goans have done well to keep this tradition alive here in the UK,” says Caetan Braganza, who added coconut breaking competition to other annual sports events like football and volleyball that he organised in memory of his brother Leo. “There are many who bring strong coconuts or ‘gott nall’ as they say in Konkani, from Goa, but these are used for individual contests and betting. When we organise a competition, we use coconuts available here in the UK,” he says. For 10 pounds (approximately Rs 1,000), participants are allowed to pick six coconuts of their choice from the pile placed at the venue. Each competitor then holds the coconut in his hand and smashes it against the one held by his opponent. As competitors get eliminated, the one with the maximum coconuts in the end is declared the winner. Last year, there was a complete halt to coconut breaking competitions in the UK due to Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. This year, though, competitions have already been held in Swindon, Wembley, Hounslow, Upton Park, Southall, Hayes and, for the first time, Reading. There will be more before the festival draws to a close on August 24. “We bought three bags of coconuts from the market and at the end of the day, there was nothing remaining. This was a good event. We had about 40 participants and families. Everyone had a good time,” says Milton Rodrigues of the East London Boys, who organised a competition in Upton Park early this week. Santa Cruz Boys had a competition of their own in Wembley on Friday. The tradition of harvest feast dates back to over 500 years, since March 1510 to be precise, but how and when the tradition of breaking coconuts started has not been documented. While some say this started out as a way for the bhatkars or landlords to prove the superiority of the coconuts in their plantations, others point to celebrating the abundance of harvest with what Goa has in plenty, the coconut. Whatever the reason, Goans love this tradition, whether they are at home or in the UK.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-keep-a-tradition-alive-goans-packcoconuts-to-uk-but-only-to-break-it/articleshow/85524491.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Chandigarh||Despite rules, most schools skip fire NoC||Poviet Kaur Chandigarh: Out of 200 schools in the city, only 59 have a no objection certificate (NoC) from the fire department. Government schools constitute majority of the violators, suggests data from the Chandigarh fire department. The NoC is renewed once every three years. Despite notices from the fire department, many schools do not comply with them. However, the fire department does not take strict action due to which schools do not apply for NoC, putting students’ life at risk. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has made NoC from the fire department mandatory on the ‘Saras’ portal. There are 114 government schools, seven government-aided and 79 private schools in the city. In the last three years, only 89 schools in the city applied for NoC with the fire department. Of these, NoC was issued to only 64 schools. Five schools have been applying for NoC continuously for the last three years but due to lapses, it is not being issued to them. CBSE has made it mandatory for schools to have a no-objection certificate from the fire department on the Saras portal for recognition this year. However, only 21 schools have applied. Saurabh Arora, chief fire officer said, “Schools are given notices from time to time. The NoC will be issued only after inspecting schools that have applied. NoCs are pending because of some discrepancies in schools. Our team visits the school and informs them about the loopholes, after which they can apply again.” For the NoC from the fire department, private schools must give property tax and government schools must provide service tax slips. Besides, photographs of the school building and firefighting equipment installed must also be given. Information about the floors, length, entry and exit arrangements, parking and rooms, etc. of the building is to be given to the fire department. After that, Rs 10 per square meter covered area is charged. Saurabh Arora said, “Maybe charges are too high for some of the schools, so they skip applying for fire safety no objection certificate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/despite-rules-most-schools-skip-fire-noc/articleshow/85522523.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Maths helps develop logic, induces habit of reasoning’||Sixty-eight-year-old Kishore Wankhade from Wardha is a former mathematics professor and has 35 years of teaching experience. A multifaceted personality, he defies age and continues to be a teacher, author, naturalist, bird watcher, cyclist, social activist, anti-superstition campaigner and a sportsperson with a special fondness for chess and badminton. Wankhade has also made it as a national chess arbiter. Founder of Bahar Nature Foundation, which works for research and conservation of nature and the environment, his pocketbook on the identification of 150 bird species is a colorful field guide for amateur bird watchers. to clear mathematical concepts, he recently started a YouTube channel called ‘Mathematics Bouquet’. In a freewheeling exclusive chat, TOI talks to the all-rounder about his fascinating journey. Excerpts… Q. A bird watcher, cyclist, sportsperson, writer and mathematician. How do you plan and prioritize your work? A. Being a mathematics teacher, topping the priority list was obviously mathematics. I loved teaching mathematics, but now, I’m a very satisfied former teacher. Secondly, I always kept myself close to the playground. Generally, TV and mobile are today’s means of entertainment and enjoyment, but I opted for sports and earned ‘fitness’ as a bonus. Being social animals, everyone is expected to be responsible and so, I engaged myself in social activities as well. Without hobbies, our life will become pathetic. Bird watching, sky watching, reading and writing were my hobbies. These hobbies and activities helped me to pour life into my life. Q. You pedalled long distances to attend the Maharashtra Pakshimitra Sammelan (birders’ meet). A. After retirement, I founded Bahar Nature Foundation through which I decided to promote cycling. Cycling has a double gain — it’s environment-friendly and it also imparts fitness. We started attending pakshimitra sammelans on cycles to promote cycling with the slogan being ‘Health and clean air’. Our group pedalled to Yavatmal, Chandrapur, Lonar, Karad and Alibag to attend Vidarbha and Maharashtra Pakshimitra Sammelans. This created a huge awareness about cycling throughout Maharashtra. At the Chandrapur sammelan, participants went a step ahead by resolving to use cycle as the bird watchers’ vehicle. Q. Is it true that your demand for ‘bird week’ was accepted by the Maharashtra government? A. Yes. November 5 and November 12 are birthdays of ornithologists Maruti Chitampally and Dr Salim Ali respectively. Our Bahar Nature Foundation was consistently demanding celebration of the bird week from November 5 to 12. In January 2020, four BNF volunteers traveled from Wardha to Alibag and then to Mantralaya in Mumbai on bicycles to push for the demand. Throughout the journey, we collected signatures of birders and nature lovers. After attending the birders’ meet in Alibag, we reached Mumbai and submitted a memorandum to Vikas Kharge, principal secretary to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The fact that four cyclists from Wardha peddling over 800km to submit a memorandum signed by over 300 bird lovers made a positive impact which resulted in the fulfillment of the demand. Since last year, November 5 to 12 is celebrated as the bird week on the lines of the wildlife week. Q. What are the different classes of maths and which one do you prefer? A. For me, there are two classes of maths. One is academic maths, which is taught in schools and colleges, and the other is amusement maths, which includes mental maths, mathemagic, puzzles, etc. I was engaged in teaching academic maths my entire life, but now I’m into teaching amusement maths. This is out of necessity and there are reasons for doing so. Q. Maths is considered the most difficult subject. In what way have you made it easy for students? A. No doubt mathematics is difficult because it is abstract thinking, specifically at a higher level. Those who were able to develop a taste for mathematics at the primary level and sailed through the middle level without many hurdles can only be able to withstand a higher level. If we want to make mathematics interesting and easy, then it has to be done at the primary level and later to some extent at the middle school level. At a higher level, the most a teacher can do is to deliver the ideas to students in a proper way. For this to happen, the ideas of the teacher need to be clear. I’m indebted to my primary school teachers for preparing me well, sometimes using that infamous but magical punishing stick. In middle school, I had fantastic teachers because of whom I started loving mathematics. Teaching skills of teachers and hard work of students can lead to success in maths. Q. Many institutes have opened maths labs. A. The recently introduced concept of a maths laboratory is a farce. The mathematics we learn at a higher level is ‘pure mathematics’ which is mostly abstract. So, having a maths lab and conducting practicals at the Standard XII level is somewhat funny. Practicals have been introduced merely to promote students or just to hide the inefficiency at the primary and secondary levels. Q. Why did you start your youtube channel called ‘Mathematics Bouquet’? A. I started ‘Mathematics Bouquet' to explain all the amusing feats in mathematics. Shakuntala Devi was a prodigy who knew maths since birth. Maths is a science. It’s a procedure. Anyone undergoing proper training can learn these methods with hard work. After learning these methods since the last one year, I can now explain all the amusing feats achieved by Shakuntala Devi and others. The reason behind starting ‘Mathematics Bouquet’ is basically to simplify the concepts with a proper explanation. Q. Has maths helped you to develop a scientific attitude in society? A. Mathematics is a very accurate, systematic and logical subject. In mathematics, every step goes with reasoning. This leads to logical thinking and induces a habit of reasoning among students. Being a mathematics lover, these things evolved in me as well. I got involved in the people-science movement to remove superstitions. Through several platforms, I delivered many lectures, gave demonstrations, took science to the villages and exposed many gullible babas and gurus. Through these activities, I tried to inculcate a scientific temperament in society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maths-helps-develop-logic-induces-habit-of-reasoning/articleshow/85522551.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Kolkata||Man uses helium to end life||Kolkata: The body of a 25-year-old former executive — head wrapped in a polythene bag and a pipe fixed to a helium gas cylinder injected into the plastic — was recovered from a flat of an apartment located in the Madurdaha area off EM Bypass on Saturday evening. The victim had even handcuffed himself so that he would not move at the last moment. Police said the victim, identified as Rohit Kumar Bhowmik, had written in his suicide note that he was feeling extremely lonely. His mother, to whom he had been very close, passed away in 2018. However, two recent developments may have left a lasting impression on his mind, said cops. “He had lost his job 20 days ago and his sister had married and left the flat two weeks ago. It is difficult to pinpoint any particular reason behind such an action. We are trying to speak to his shocked family,” said DC (East) Gaurav Lal. A childhood friend revealed Rohit had also suffered a break up in his relationship, police added. “One helium gas cylinder, a polythene bag, rope and a handcuff was found from the room. His father, a senior retired government officer, informed us that on Friday night Rohan told him he was not to be disturbed as he would wake up late. So the father did not disturb him until noon. But after repeated calls, when Rohan didn’t respond, his father saw the emergency window grill of Rohan's room open which had never happened before. He entered the room by climbing up the AC machine fitted outside his son's bedroom and found his son lying unconscious,” said an officer. A brilliant academic, Rohit had studied at a reputed English medium school before getting into engineering. But he dropped out and enrolled himself at a top college in central Kolkata. He was unhappy with his job where he was getting a monthly salary of around Rs 30,000. “His mobile was unlocked to get more information. After analysis it was established that he was under the impression that nobody was talking to him, nor calling him,” said an officer. Anandapur Police was informed around 2.30pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-uses-helium-to-end-life/articleshow/85522586.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Delhi||PM asking agencies to target us: Manish Sisodia||New Delhi: In a major escalation in the Delhi government’s confrontation with the BJP-ruled Centre, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia alleged on Saturday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shared a list of 15 people with Delhi Police, CBI and ED, asking them to "conduct raids and file fake FIRs" against them.  The list includes many AAP leaders, he claimed. Addressing a press conference, the AAP leader said that BJP wants to ruin these people before the next elections. Sisodia alleged the new Delhi Police commissioner has promised to get the job done. Later, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal took to twitter to indirectly target the PM. "Do politics for votes and win public trust. We have been subjected to so many false cases and raids. Nothing was found in them. You are welcome to come and raid us in false cases this time too," he said in a tweet. Calling the allegations baseless, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said AAP has a history of first making unwarranted allegations and then apologizing and was trying to repeat it. “Baffled by the Centre’s nod for a CBI probe into the DTC bus purchase scam, now deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia is making baseless statements against it,” said Gupta. “It has been seen in the past seven years that whenever a scam of the Kejriwal government gets exposed, they are baffled and start coming out with all kind of unfounded and baseless statements,” he added. Gupta asked Sisodia to either identify the sources behind his allegation or offer an apology to the Centre, threatening to otherwise launch a protest against AAP. Sisodia said BJP was getting more and more restless and petrified due to AAP’s rising popularity and the public support extended to it. “PM Modi is using his Brahmastra to falsely implicate the leaders of AAP because of the coming elections,” he said. “The party will welcome everyone because AAP does politics of truth and honesty; whatever investigation or fake case PM Modi wants to start, AAP will not be afraid and will stick to its politics of truth,” he said. He said Modi had tried this earlier too but was every time e unable to find anything against the AAP leaders. This time, too, nothing will be achieved. “BJP should win the hearts of the people by doing politics of public interest like AAP,” stated Sisodia. “The CBI raided my house twice but did not tell the public the outcome,” said Sisodia. “Similarly, 12 fake cases were filed against health minister Satyendar Jain and 21 AAP MLAs were implicated with false charges and sent to jail, but all were acquitted. The court also reprimanded Delhi Police for its partisan attitude. For the first time in the history of the country, the police entered the house and bedroom of a current CM on the pretext of a raid, but what was the result? The court again lambasted Delhi Police. To harass the Delhi government, the Central Government got 450 files checked but no evidence was found against the Delhi government,” said Sisodia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pm-asking-agenciesto-target-us-sisodia/articleshow/85526408.cms||---

An education department official said the merit list would be issued on August 25 for admission to Class XI. Applicants will be able to see the list of schools allotted to them on the basis of their marks. Around 15,000 forms came in for admission but since there were more applications than seats, the education department increased the seats by about 1,000. This time, there are many takers for science stream as percentage of students in government schools in Class 10 has increased by 19.4%. Besides, the number of students who have scored more than 90% marks has also increased. This year, over 90% of students got more than 80%. Education department officials said students generally give priority to admission in science stream, however, as seats are less, only those with merit get admission in science. 20 seats reserved for Muslim girls in vocational courses This time, 20 seats have been reserved for Muslim girls in vocational courses.

---||Mumbai||Fifth FIR lodged against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh for extortion||MUMBAI: An FIR was registered at the Goregaon police station on Friday against former police commissioner Param Bir Singh and dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze for allegedly extorting cash and cellphones collectively worth Rs 11.92 lakh from a construction contractor. Four civilians have also been booked, of which one, Sumit S, was arrested. The case has been transferred to the crime branch. This is the fifth FIR against Singh, who was promoted as director general (home guards) earlier this year. The complainant, Bimal Agrawal, told mediapersons he hoped police would offer protection to him and his family. Incidentally, Agrawal is a co-accused with Singh in an extortion case filed by Thane Nagar police in July 2021. Earlier in 2012, Agrawal was booked in a case by the Economic Offences Wing of Mumbai police and was also arrested in 2017 by the CBI and Enforcement Directorate. In his statement to the Goregaon police, Agrawal said he first came into contact with Waze in 2000-01 when he was receiving threat calls and had registered a police complaint. Almost a decade later, Waze visited Agrawal’s office to learn more about the BMC’s tendering process as Agrawal had taken up contracts with the BMC. In the beginning of 2020, Waze informed Agrawal that Singh was set to be the new police commissioner. He egged on Agrawal to start a hotel business as he (Waze) was going to be entrusted with “collection work”. Accordingly, Agrawal became a partner in two restobars. Shortly afterwards, Singh was posted as the commissioner and Waze inducted into the crime branch. Agrawal’s complaint states Waze, having conspired with Singh, and his aides threatened him from time to time to pay up if he wanted to run his restobars without police harassment. Agrawal and his business partner handed over money to Sumit on a few occasions. Singh was unavailable for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fifth-fir-lodged-against-param-bir-for-extortion/articleshow/85526007.cms||---

The constables of Metpally police station in Jagtial district tested positive for the virus on August 20. Both the constables had taken both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. As the constables showed symptoms of Covid-19, they got themselves tested. “It is possible to be infected even after taking Covid-19 vaccine. However, it will be mild and there will be nothing to worry. They will recover. It is important for everyone, even if they have taken two doses of vaccine to continue to take precautions like wearing a mask and following social distancing norms,” Jagtial district medical and health officer (DMHO) P Sridhar told TOI. He said that as per Covid-19 protocols, those who test positive for Covid-19 should be in home isolation so that the virus does not spread to others. On Friday, as many as 23 people tested positive for Covid-19 in Jagtial district, including three in Malyala, five in Jagtial and three in Metpally. Health Officer told that it is important to take precautions like wearing mask and following social distancing norms even if they have taken two doses of vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-constables-contract-covid-following-kcr-public-meeting/articleshow/85526010.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC tells state to file reply to ex-intel chief’s petition||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Saturday sought an affidavit in reply from the state to a quashing petition filed by Rashmi Shukla, former commissioner, state intelligence department, against an FIR over the ‘leak’ of her ‘top secret’ phone-tap report and posted it for final hearing on September 13. The state, through senior counsel Darius Khambata, continued till September 14 its statement made on May 6 of not taking any coercive steps against Shukla in connection with the FIR. The FIR by cyber police is against ‘unknown persons’ and does not name her as accused. Shukla’s senior counsel, Mahesh Jethmalani, with advocate Gunjan Mangla, completed arguments to seek quashing of the “mala fide” FIR. Jethmalani said the “state has sought to hound an individual who has chosen to pursue her duties diligently” and sought to “protect” some individuals’ interest “invoking draconian provisions” under the Official Secrets Act. Merely because a document is marked “secret” it doesn’t attract the special Act meant for acts affecting sovereignty of State, he said. “The state is playing hard and fast with justice and upholding of HC orders and law, trying to subvert the legal process,” argued Jethmalani. The state began its arguments to oppose her plea. Khambata said Shukla is with absolute “frivolous and reckless charges” abusing the legal and judicial process and it is she who “is seeking to subvert the truth.” Responding to Jethmalani’s submission that the state has not even filed its affidavit in reply yet, Khambata said he does not want a situation of admission of petitioner’s contentions for ‘non traverse’ (a doctrine where, for want of written denial, allegations made are treated as admitted) by state. He said, “There cannot be an argument that because state has not filed reply,” it has accepted Shukla’s contentions in her quashing plea, whose very maintainability too he is opposing. Because there was no notice the state did not file an affidavit, he said, expressing his willingness to proceed with final submissions if Jethmalani does not press the lack of affidavit argument. The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar paused the hearing, noted that the matter has been listed for hearing 10 times since May 6, and gave the state till September 4 to file its reply and a few days after that for Shukla’s rejoinder, and will hear it on September 13. Jethmalani in concluding arguments said Shukla has already responded to the departmental enquiry against her and sought to furnish her reply in a sealed cover for HC to peruse, “if necessary.” Citing former additional chief secretary Sitaram Kunte’s March 25 report to the government which mentioned Shukla’s offer to withdraw her report, he said she was not even authorized to withdraw it, and only the DGP Subodh Jaiswal who forwarded it on August 26, 2020 could. When the judges asked about his reference to Kunte, who was not even a party to the HC hearing, Jethmalani said he was referring to his report as government’s alter ego. He said it was only because of Kunte’s report that the advocate general had on March 31 “significantly” informed the HC that the file over Shukla’s report was “closed”, but the HC was not informed of the March 26 FIR into its alleged ‘leak’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-tells-state-to-file-reply-to-ex-intel-chiefs-petition/articleshow/85526016.cms||Swati Deshpande

The fund, anchored by India Exim Bank and SIDBI, will provide financial and logistical support to small companies to meet their export ambitions. “The launch of the fund has been delayed, but it is largely due to the Covid pandemic. I also think it has been beneficial for a state for two reasons, one that it has the highest number of MSMEs in the state and two, that its one district-one product scheme has already competitively identified sectors which the banks can immediately start funding and handholding,” the minister said. She further highlighted steps taken by the Centre to promote the MSME sector in the country, starting with a production linked incentive scheme. The Atma Nirbhar Bharat scheme is similarly promoting indigenous manufacturing and service providers. “The Ubharte Sitaare Fund will make investments in export-oriented small and mid-sized companies and help script a new paradigm of growth in exports,” she said. UP’s MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh said that the fund would be very beneficial for the state, which has 90 million MSMEs. “In the past four and a half years, the state government and ensured easy loans to the sector, leading to an addition of 70 lakh new MSMEs in this period. We have been able to give loans of 2.5 lakh crore in 4.5 years, creating employment of 2.6 crore. This is a record,” he said. The Ubharte Sitaare Fund will work by identifying Indian companies that have the potential to be future champions in the domestic arena, while catering to global demands, explained an official. He said that the programme will diagnose hurdles and constraints of the identified enterprises, and assist them in their growth and export strategies through financial and advisory services. “Under the programme, the Ubharte Sitaare Fund, co-sponsored by India Exim Bank and SIDBI with a contribution of Rs 40 crore each was registered with SEBI in July 2021. The corpus of the fund is Rs 250 crore. The Fund would invest by way of equity, and equity-like products in export-oriented units, both in the manufacturing and services sectors,” said SP Singh, CEO of SIDBI Venture Capital Ltd. Harsha Bangari, deputy managing director of India Exim Bank, said that the bank had developed a robust pipeline of over 100 potential proposals and supported several companies across a diverse range of sectors. Some of these companies include a manufacturer of key ingredients for Covid vaccines and black fungus drug and a company promoting environmental sustainability by recycling and manufacturing key inputs for FMCG packaging, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sitharaman-launches-fund-for-small-mid-cap-industries/articleshow/85526411.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Mumbai||Record 1 million vaccinated in Maharashtra in a single day||MUMBAI: Over a million people (10.96 lakh) got vaccinated against Covid in Maharashtra on Saturday, making it the highest single-day turnout in the mass vaccination drive that started on January 16. It included 2.58 lakh people in Mumbai, according to the daily vaccine update. BMC also created a record by providing free vaccines to 1,03,325 people, the highest in a single day so far. The remaining 1.5 lakh vaccines, according to BMC, were given by 93 private centres over three days: 50,083 on August 19, 44,375 on August 20 and 52,717 on Saturday. The drive in Mumbai restarted on Saturday after a two-day break brought on by scarcity of doses. On Friday, BMC got 1.5 lakh Covishield doses from the state government. “We also got 10,000 Covaxin from the state and have enough to vaccinate high numbers for two to three days,’’ said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. In Mumbai, special sessions were conducted to vaccinate 500 street vendors and 190 female sex workers. State officials said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and health minister Rajesh Tope praised the “incomparable’’ work by health department in vaccinating around 11 lakh citizens. “Today, health department officials and employees proved that more than 10 lakh vaccinations can be done in a day, and the state can vaccinate more,’’ said Tope. More such efforts will be made, he added. Additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradip Vyas said the 10.96 lakh figure was achieved by 7pm. “It is likely to rise by late night,’’ he added. The state gave 5.3 crore shots, including 1.4 crore who are fully vaccinated, and 3.8 crore who got the first vaccine. Maharashtra is the only state, apart from UP, to cross the 5-crore mark. On July 3, the state vaccinated 8.11 lakh people. On the eve of Independence Day, 9.46 lakh people were vaccinated. “After today’s highest number of vaccinations, a new record has been set by Maharashtra,’’ Dr Vyas added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/record-1-million-vaccinated-in-maharashtra-in-a-single-day/articleshow/85524674.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Blasting boulders & rocks causes irreversible change, say experts||HYDERABAD: In view of multiple construction activities leading to indiscriminate breaking of rocks and boulders that are the mainstay of Hyderabad’s geology, experts said that the architects should design projects around these boulders without disturbing the natural formations. In the most recent incident on Friday, a major disaster was averted after two boulders rolled down from a construction site and damaged a portion of a house in Chandanagar. Last year too, four houses adjoining each other in Hyderabad’s Ghouse Nagar were destroyed after large boulders had fallen on the asbestos sheet that covered the roof, bringing the whole place down. In all, there have been about five such incidents in the last two years. “These boulders are more than 2,500 million years old and people should know that any disturbance to these natural formations can lead to landslides resulting in loss of property and life, apart from causing an irreversible change in the landscape. Therefore, to avoid any kind catastrophic damage to the land or the people, we must ensure that the projects, both government and private, should be designed around these natural formations,” said Syed Yousuf of Society to Save Rocks, an organisation working to impress upon landowners, developers and the government that the boulders could be preserved in houses, gardens, colonies and park areas. Experts also said that for anyone in the construction business, it is important to remember that Hyderabad rocks are not monolithic rocks, but they are boulders sitting one top of the other, which can cause major destruction even if a small portion is disturbed. Speaking about how disturbing the soil profile can lead to landslides, architect Srinivas Murthy, said, “If you look at these boulders, they are so beautifully composed and sitting for millions of years and they never fell. But when you try to destroy these boulders, you also tend to disturb the soil profile which will cause landslides. It is always best not to touch these natural creations.” However, in certain unavoidable circumstances where the boulder or a rock really needs to be removed, he said that all necessary precautions need to be taken by calculating the total load of the boulder to see in which direction the load is getting transferred and balance it with huge concrete girders to avoid any unforeseen incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/blasting-boulders-rocks-causes-irreversible-change/articleshow/85524573.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Lucknow||For Kalyan Singh, Lord Rama always came first, power later, says Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Dubbing Kalyan Singh’s demise as an end of an era, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said BJP stalwart’s death was a personal loss for him and a huge loss for the party. In a statement issued on Saturday night, the CM said there was a time when the triumvirate of former PM late Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former deputy PM LK Advani and Kalyan Singh used to be the face of the BJP. "I am fortunate that I have received the love and cooperation of all three stalwarts. Kalyan Singh Ji was one of the leading voices of the (Ram) temple movement. He did not take even a second to renounce power for the sake of the temple. Such people will rarely be found in positions of power. Lord Ram came first for him, power later. This is the reason that after the disputed structure was brought down on December 6, 1992, he took moral responsibility for the incident as the CM of the state,” he said. The CM recalled Singh’s association with his gurus, saying that his Dada Guru Mahant Digvijay Nath and Guru Mahant Avaidyanath ji were also linked with the temple movement and that is why, whenever they met or Singh visited the Gorakhnath Temple, they had long discussions over the construction of a grand Ram Temple in Ayodha. “Whenever there was a discussion on the temple, he would say that its construction should start during his lifetime,” he said. The CM added that Singh was synonymous with purity, transparency and public service in Indian politics. He said that Singh always struggled for the poor, weak and marginalised sections of the society. As CM of UP, his services would also be remembered, Yogi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-yogi-for-kalyan-lord-rama-always-came-first-power-later/articleshow/85526412.cms||---
---||Meerut||6 freezers defunct for a yr at Amroha govt morgue||Amroha: It has been 12 months since the six freezers at a mortuary of district hospital in Uttar Pradesh's Amroha are lying defunct with local complaints of crawling insects, strong stench from decomposing human bodies and demands of bribes. This is nothing but a "total disrespect to the mortal remains of our loved ones", say many locals. In April, an inquiry was set up by the district magistrate after which two staffers were moved out. However, several requests and applications to medical and district authorities to repair the freezers have hit a dead end. The chief medical officer (CMO), on Saturday, said that the freezers will be repaired soon. Qamar Naqvi, a municipal councillor in Amroha nagar palika, said, "Four days ago, a person who was my acquaintance died and his body was sent to the district hospital for autopsy. When we reached there on Thursday, the body was lying on the floor with insects crawling all over. After inquiring about the freezers, the staff told us that they were lying defunct for a year." "We took it up with the hospital's chief medical superintendent, but he passed the buck to the CMO. When we approached the CMO, he told us that there is no preservation of bodies at the district hospital. This is sheer disrespect to our loved ones who are no more," Naqvi added. When contacted, Amroha's CMO Sanjay Agarwal said, "The freezers were handed over to the morgue one and a half years ago. They stopped working a few months back. We have already sent a letter to the relevant company for immediate repair." One of the freezers has been repaired and re-starting the others at the morgue is under urgent consideration, the CMO added. According to sources, locals have repeatedly complained of the mortuary staff extorting money from the relatives of the deceased for handing over the body after postmortem, and had recently created a ruckus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/6-freezers-defunct-for-a-yr-at-amroha-govt-morgue/articleshow/85520891.cms||Harveer Dabas

Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao and MLA Balka Suman said that while the Union government had completely failed in handling the pandemic, the TRS government was able to control Covid-19 effectively. Addressing a press conference on Saturday, the minister came down heavily on Union minister G Kishan Reddy’s Jana Aashirwad Yatra and dared the minister to bring more funds to the state for Dalit Bandhu and other schemes instead of making allegations. “The BJP government has not fulfilled the promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act such as steel plant at Bayyaram, tribal university at Mulugu and rail coach factory at Kazipet. Being a minister in the central government, Kishan Reddy did not get any project or special funds,” Dayakar Rao said. Balka Suman demanded Kishan Reddy to bring Rs 5,000 crore to the state apart from Rs 40 lakh to each Dalit family instead of criticising the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-to-blame-for-covid-cases-deaths-min/articleshow/85526014.cms||---

He threatened to use his “magical powers” against them if they did not do so. It was then that they turned to the police for help. An FIR has been registered against the tantrik and a hunt is on for him. According to police, six months ago, Jabbar Ahmad of Amroha's Asgirpur village met the tantrik. He allegedly convinced Ahmad that treasure is hidden in his house. In the quest for treasure, Ahmad ended up paying the tantrik Rs 2 lakh but nothing was found. Recently, Ahmad's wife gave birth to a boy and the tantrik allegedly wanted to sacrifice the newborn. Scared that he would harm their family, the couple approached police. Confirming the incident, Mohit Chaudhury, Didauli police station SHO, said, “A case has been registered against the tantrik under relevant sections of the IPC. A probe is on.

The word ‘nava’ translate to the number nine. Founder of the Sivaganga Thol Nadai Kuzhu, K Kaliraja, said that Murugan, a member of the committee, had informed him about a statue on a private land at Muthupatti, and they had gone to inspect it.He said that it has been a Tamil tradition to erect hero stones in memory of people who lost their lives in battles or sacrificed themselves for the welfare of the community. There is also mention of heroes who die by sacrificing themselves before goddess Kottravai seeking the victory of their king or leader in a war. Epics such as Tholkappiam, Silapathikaram, and Kalingathuparani among others have mentions of such sacrifices.‘Navakandam’ is a way of sacrifice where a man sacrifices himself before goddess Kottravai by cutting his body himself at nine places with a sword or a knife. “It was a practice that existed since the Sangam era, but was prevalent between the 9th century AD and 13th century AD,” he said. The recently found statue is three-and-a-half feet high and one-and-a-half feet wide. It has a hair bun on the head, and also three strands of hair on the side. There is a moustache and garland on the neck. A shield is seen in one hand and the dress is intricately designed and carved. There is a dagger in a scabbard on its hip. Footwear is seen on the feet and one hand is shown with a bow.A knife is seen pierced through the neck from right to left. He said that they had decided to convince the owner of the land to contact Sivaganga museum authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rare-16th-c-hero-stone-found-in-sivaganga-village/articleshow/85524619.cms||---

The woman denied making the complaint, the SP said. He said in Yavatmal on Saturday that as no complaint was filed by the woman or her close relatives against the Shiv Sena MLA from Digras, he had been given a clean chit. “There is no question of filing an FIR against Rathod, who had recorded his statement with SIT on August 19,” he said. BJP leader Chitra Wagh had demanded an FIR. “Truth alone triumphs. They are chasing me and are out to ruin my political career, which I have built with determination,” said Rathod. A team led by additional S P Khanderao Dharne had recorded the statement of the woman, wife of the ex-teacher at Rathod’s ashramshala, at Ghatanji police station in camera in the presence of her husband and father on August 14. “The woman denied Rathod sought sexual favours if she wanted her husband to be reinstated to the teacher’s post after he voluntarily resigned in 2017,” said the SP. Patil-Bhubal said she stated that she had not sent any complaint to him or Ghatanji police station by post. “She claimed she never signed a complaint and the name of her husband was wrongly mentioned in it. She said Rathod never sought sexual favours from her,” the SP said. He said SIT visited Ghatanji post-office where the SpeedPost with the complaint was registered. “Employees said two men posted the letters one after the other but denied knowing them,” he said. SIT sought information from assistant commissioner of VJ/NT and verified the affidavit filed by her husband in connection with the resignation letter. Rathod had to resign from cabinet as his name was embroiled in Pooja Chavan’s suicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sit-clean-chit-to-rathod-in-sex-for-job-complaint/articleshow/85526038.cms||TO Abraham

---||Mangaluru||Month-long workshop for police aspirants begins||Mangaluru: A month-long workshop for aspirants wanting to join the police force was inaugurated at the Gonzaga hall of St Aloysius Gonzaga school on Saturday. IGP Western Range Devajyoti Ray said that visionary city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar has managed to arrange this workshop and give academic support to aspirants, without any funds from the state. The competition to get a job in the police department is high. The workshop will guide and help aspirants prepare for the exam, he said, hoping that at least 50% of them would clear the exam. Dakshina Kannada superintendent of police Rishikesh Sonawane addressed the aspirants, and said that it is not a programme where spoon-feeding will be done of the aspirants. A team of officers will be guiding students, and an individual’s effort is important to crack the exam, he said. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra said that the result of these efforts will be seen in the next few years. “Having local staff will help in dealing with issues efficiently, especially in times of crisis. Clearing competitive exams is about hard and smart work,” he said. In the first week of August, city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar announced the month-long workshop for police aspirants, for which nearly 710 aspirants turned up for the screening test. Though the commissionerate was formed about a decade ago, yet during the recruitment process, less than 10% were selected from Dakshina Kannada, into the district or city police force. Hence, to encourage more people from the region to join the force, a 30-day crash course was curated. The classrooms and accommodation for the students have been arranged at St Aloysius College and Shanthi Kiran, Bajjodi. Meanwhile, Mangaladevi temple, Kadri Manjunatha temple and Iskcon will take care of the food arrangements. Out of the 200 students selected, 91 are aspiring to become police constables, of which 55 are boys and 36 are girls, and out of the 109 aspirants wanting to join as police sub-inspectors, 54 are boys and 55 are girls. Among the candidates, 161 are from Dakshina Kannada, 25 from Udupi, 10 from Uttara Kannada, two from Chikkamagaluru and one each from Hassan and Shivamogga. Nearly 11 aspirants selected from Karkala have been referred to by the ANF SP Nikhil B. The resource persons for the crash course will be 20 PSIs and a constable, and Prashanth Bhat, assistant professor of economics, will take up translation and essay writing classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/month-long-workshop-for-police-aspirants-begins/articleshow/85520959.cms||---

The number of doses administered daily has been much lower since the last few days, but going by what Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials explain, the reason is that only a very small portion of the population is yet to take the first dose. According to figures supplied by the VMC, 94.58 adults in the city are vaccinated already. Of the 13,15,477 eligible persons, 12,44,212 have already been vaccinated. But the target of eligible persons may not be precise and may actually be on a higher side as 14,46,212 voters were registered for the last civic polls. Against an average of around 12,000 doses per day in the beginning of this month, the number has now remained around 9,000 or even lower. VMC’s medial officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that most people who were keen on taking a jab have already done so. “We will have to convince the remaining and ensure they get vaccinated,” he said. Sources said that such people were either ignorant or, simply, not wanting to take a vaccine. The number may never reach 100 per cent as apart from those adamant on not taking a vaccine, there are many who have taken the vaccine at a time when they were not eligible and their entries were not made, said sources, adding that such vaccination took place across categories till vaccination was not opened up for all adults. The civic body is also trying to ensure that people take their second shot on time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vaccinations-slow-down-with-only-a-few-takers-left-now/articleshow/85521954.cms||---

Additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said he is yet to receive any official communication in this regard but stressed that the department will take up further steps after receiving it. Doctors said the move will help in providing immune cover to children and boost the parents’ morale while letting their kids outdoors. Some doctors also said the vaccination will help reduce the risk of hospitalisation and will eliminate the risk of morbidity in children who are susceptible to be infected during the predicted third wave. Talking to TOI, specialist medical officer cum paediatrician at the Palamu district hospital, Dr Gaurav Vishal, said, “Children above 12 years are the most mobile population among the younger category but they haven’t been vaccinated yet. They go to schools and visit playgrounds. So, it is necessary to vaccinate them at the earliest for primary prevention. The Centre’s move is a welcome step and a feat for us as we are the first country to approve a DNA-based vaccine for the younger population.” On whether the Cadila vaccine will suffice for the young population, Dr Vishal said, “The vaccine has been approved for emergency use as the results of its efficacy is very good and by September end, we will be having Covaxin doses, too as trials have completed.” On being contacted over the safety of the vaccine, associate professor of paediatrics surgery at Rims, Dr Abhishek Ranjan, said, “All Covid vaccines are safe and people shouldn’t worry about them as we have already seen the results among the adult population after the vaccination. It will not only help in preventing the primary spread of the virus but will also help in reducing the risk of hospitalisation as well as morbidity of infected children which has already been reported from Meghalaya and other parts of the country.” Meanwhile, parents are also happy over the approval of the vaccine and many of them said they will be relieved while letting their kids venture outdoors after they get the vaccine. Nilam Kumari, a Kokar resident, said, “My son studies in Class IX and I have been very wary about sending him to school even after state government allowed voluntary offline classes for students above Class IX. But I will ask him to go to school after he gets the vaccine. I am happy as well as thankful to the government for the move.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/docs-parents-welcome-move-to-inoculate-kids-against-covid-19/articleshow/85523234.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The flight, 6E-113, is scheduled daily from Ranchi at 2 pm while it will start from Pune at 10.55 am. With the addition of this new flight, the Birsa Munda International Airport will now have 28 flights daily in the post-Covid period. Airport authorities said the maiden flight (6E-112) took off from Lohegaon (Pune) International Airport and arrived here around 1:20 pm with over 140 passengers. The return flight reached Pune at 4:30 pm. Talking to TOI, Birsa Munda International Airport director Vinod Kumar Sharma said, “Our airport got connected to Pune by a direct flight service operated by Indigo and the first flight arrived today with 143 passengers at 1:20 pm. The flight occupancy from Ranchi was good as 137 passengers boarded the Pune-bound aircraft.” On the total number of flights operating from the city airport, Sharma said, “Currently, we are operating 20 flights daily after the Covid-19 relaxations. However, with the addition of the Pune flight, the total number of flights has increased to 28.” Meanwhile, students and people working in the IT sector at Pune from Jharkhand were a happy lot after the flight operations started. Many of them said it will help them in saving time as earlier they had to take a connecting flight for Pune via Mumbai or Bangalore with long layovers. A few of them also said it will also reduce their expenditure as the connecting flight fares are always higher in comparison with direct flights. Nitish Kishore, a resident of Argora area who works as a manager with a UK-based MNC in Pune, said, “Earlier, I had to take connecting flights either from Mumbai or from Bangalore to reach Pune for which I had to spend more than 14 hours. With direct flight, I can travel to Pune within three hours and that will help me save a lot of time.” Vidisha Mishra, a medical student at D Y Patil Medical College in Pune, said, “With the direct flight, home seems closer than before. It will be less expensive and less tiring, too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/direct-flight-between-ranchi-pune-begins/articleshow/85523420.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Ashirwad yatra bares fissures within BJP’s Dhanbad unit||Sindri: The Jan Ashirwad Yatra conducted by BJP with Union minister of state for education Annapurna Devi as the face of the event has put to the fore the cracks within the saffron party’s Dhanbad unit. While a group party leaders term it as another attempt at galvanizing the cadres and to keep the flock together, some senior leaders find it as a move to keep them at bay. Political observers say the yatra is a masterstroke by the party strategists for an image makeover from being a party of upper castes to strengthen its support base among the backward communities, but other senior BJP leaders feel that they are being sidelined so that they do not make electoral moves in the next assembly polls. Anil Pandey, a political strategist, said, "Glorifying Annapurna Devi, who crossed over to BJP from RJD, over other party stalwarts is a signal that BJP wants to strengthen its support base among the OBC. Most ranks and files of the party were elated when members of the Yadav Mahasabha and other OBC groups welcomed the Union minister in different parts of the district." This also became evident when the party leadership made Rita Yadav, the district Mahila Morcha president on Thursday, a day after Annapurna completed her yatra in Dhanbad. However, Jan Ashirwad Yatra is an initiative undertaken by BJP national president J P Nadda to disseminate the message of the Modi government to the public across the country by involving the new ministers inducted into the Union cabinet last month. "BJP wants to reap the political mileage after allowing the states to re-engineer the list of OBC castes on their own. Winning over OBCs through social engineering also suits the party interest in countering the increasing discontentment among the upper caste voters like Brahmins and Rajputs who find them being sidelined gradually in the party affairs,” observed Pandey.  Meanwhile, a senior BJP leader requesting anonymity said the party leadership should learn lessons from the past of giving turncoats more importance than the old cadres. He said, “There is an attempt to project Annapurna Devi as leader of all OBC castes at the cost of the party's leaders who have remained with BJP through thick and thin. Her supporters have already started propagating her as the next CM candidate of the state.” Another leader said, "BJP in Jharkhand faces the threat of losing old friends in its attempt to win over newer ones. And it should be prepared to face the music in the ensuing elections." The crack within the party is also evident when the party Dhanbad MP, P N Singh, remained indifferent to the yatra. While all big and small party leaders put up hoardings and banners to welcome the yatra and the Union minister, Singh was out of town for eye treatment. Notably, he did not put up any hoarding or banner to welcome the yatra. In another glaring example of the fissure, former Dhanbad mayor and state party executive committee member Chandrashekhar Agrawal was not invited to the dinner hosted by Dhanbad MLA Raj Sinha in honour of the Union minister. Party spokesperson Milton Parthsarthy, however, denied that there is any resentment among the party cadres over the yatra. “BJP has its support base among all castes and the Jan Ashirwad Yatra should be seen just like another party programme to stimulate the party cadres,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ashirwad-yatra-bares-fissures-within-bjps-dhanbad-unit/articleshow/85523272.cms||Anil Ashutosh

SSP Sanjiv Kumar on Saturday said it was revealed during a CBI interrogation that the mobile handset being used by accused autorickshaw driver Lakhan Verma was a stolen one and the owner had lodged a formal complaint with the Dhanbad police station but no case was registered. “The mobile handset owner showed a copy of his complaint being received with the signature of Vijay Yadav, who was working as Munshi (literate constable) of the police station,” he said. This is the third suspension in the case. Earlier, the officer-in-charge of the Patherdih police station was suspended. A sub-inspector of the Dhanbad police station was also placed under suspension for making the video of the autorickshaw knocking down the judge viral. Meanwhile, notices are being served to the team of doctors who conducted the postmortem of the deceased judge to appear before the investigating team of the CBI. The Jharkhand high court, in its hearing of the case on Thursday, had directed the CBI to investigate the 1.5-inch deep cut injury on the head of the deceased judge as mentioned in the postmortem report. The in-camera postmortem was conducted in presence of senior district and police officials by a team of doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/constable-suspended-in-dhanbad-judge-murder-case/articleshow/85523380.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray invites youngsters to lead global collaborations, fight climate change||NAGPUR: Taking a novel initiative to engage the youth in combating climate change, the Maharashtra government has started internships for youngsters under its latest Climate Fellowship Programme. Under this, the selected youngsters will get a rare opportunity to represent the government and lead international coalitions. Designed by the state environment and climate change department under the leadership of environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, the idea of the programme is to expand the environment department and build a solid narrative on climate change. “Though we call upon the youth to take on the challenges and say that they are the future, we hardly entrust them with responsibilities. Being in the 30s myself, I see the difference that the youth can bring about when called upon to do good,” Thackeray told TOI. The state has invited applications for the six-moth internship programme from graduates, post-graduates and research scholars from any background. A total of 20 internship positions have been announced. This is the second cycle of the programme, the first of which was held in February this year. Giving out details, Aaditya said, “Climate change mitigation and adaptation is a sector where the youth will do beyond the call of its duty because it is for them and their future generations. We need innovation, fire in the belly and newer ideas and vigour. That’s what we get from the interns.” Through the initiative, the youngsters will get an opportunity to take leadership roles in taking the climate change dialogue at national and international stages. “What we have realized is that climate change is a very cross-cutting subject and we need young policy-makers to become extremely fluid within the government. Through this programme, the interns will be taking leadership roles in going across different government departments – whether its energy, the pollution control board, agriculture or any other and stitch the climate narrative together,” said Saurabh Punamiya Jain, research and public policy assistant to the state cabinet minister of environment and climate change. To ensure sustainable development of the state and raise awareness about rising climate emergencies, Maharashtra has been pro-active in being a part of C40 Cities, Cities4Forests, U-2 Coalition along with other projects like Majhi Vasundhara. “After partaking in such enterprises, the question then arises how do you keep the engagement going as these are very contemporary forms of networks which can get difficult for a typical government officer to deal with by themselves. That’s where these fellows come into picture — they take the lead and represent the side of the government from the lowest till the highest level of administration,” added Jain. The complete details of the programme are available on the official website of the Maharashtra Environment and Climate Change Department — envd.maharashtra.gov.in. The last date of application is August 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/aaditya-invites-youngsters-to-lead-global-collaborations-fight-climate-change/articleshow/85523305.cms||Manka Behl

India reported 31,027 fresh cases as opposed to 34,307 on Friday, as per TOI’sCovid database. New infections have been on the decline through August after a brief surge in the last week of July. India recorded an average of 33,821 daily cases in the last seven days (seven-day rolling average) till Friday, the lowest in more than five months since March19, when the average was 31,647. On August 1, the number stood at 40,832. However, Saturday’s sharp fall in numbers was mainly on account of Kerala reporting a drop in cases. The state recorded 17,106 new cases, the first under-20,000 tally in five days. However, as testing dropped on the eve of Onam, Kerala’s positivity rate shot up to 17.73%, pointing to the possibility of cases surging again after the festivities are over. In Maharashtra, daily cases remained below 5,000 for the second day as the state reported 4,575 fresh infections. India recorded 402 deaths from the virus on Saturday, up marginally from Friday's toll of 374. Delhi reported just 19 fresh cases, the lowest daily count since April 15 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/31k-new-covid-cases-in-india-as-kerala-tally-dips-on-onam/articleshow/85527778.cms||---

Rane, who was in Vasai-Virar as part of his week-long Jan Ashirwad Yatra, addressed a presser after meeting local industry owners. “Shinde only signs the files. He cannot take any decision without approval from Matoshree. He is bored with the Sena. I am going to give him a call. If he comes to us (BJP), he will be welcome,” Rane said. Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande said Rane was making such comments to please his “godfathers” in BJP. “He is frustrated that Uddhavji is emerging stronger by the day. Shinde is at the helm of affairs in the government as well as the party. There is no question of him being unhappy,” Kayande said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-bjp-courts-shiv-sena-stalwart-eknath-shinde-says-hes-bored-in-party/articleshow/85527783.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||New Covid cases dip; steeper fall in Bengaluru hospitalisations||BENGALURU: The number of people needing hospitalisation in Bengaluru has been reducing more significantly than the number of fresh cases reported, reveals an analysis of data for 60 days. Between July 6 and August 19, Bengaluru has reported 28,898 cases, and 1,852 or 6.4% required hospitalisation. But the percentage of hospitalisation cases — the number of people getting admitted of the total cases — in the 15 days ending August 19 is only 4.2%. That the number of cases too have declined means the absolute number of people going to hospitals has seen a significant dip. While this may appear like a drop in the severity of cases, experts cautioned against drawing any conclusions. “This is a transient period and one should not repeat the mistakes made just before the onset of the second wave earlier this year. While the reduction in numbers is good, there needs to be a renewed strategy that enables balancing daily life with the virus, for the latter appears to be here to stay,” said Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist and member of Karnataka Covid-19 technical advisory committee (TAC). Expert: Vaccination must cover dists at faster paceBabu, also a member of Karnataka Covid-19 technical advisory committee (TAC), explained, governments or local administrations will need to constantly identify key elements that are to be tracked — like growth of cases, deaths — to trigger a response every time they breach pre-determined acceptable levels. Fifteen-day averages of new cases and hospitalisation for the 60 days show that in the first 15 days — July 6 to July 20 — Bengaluru reported 10,922 fresh cases, with 8.5% requiring hospitalisation. Average daily cases stood at 728, while 62 on average needed to be admitted. Total fresh cases in the next 15 days dipped by 39%. There was a nearly 57% decline in the number of people needing hospitalisation. The following 15-day period saw a further decline of 7.6% in cases and 25% in hospitalisation. And, between August 5 and August 19, there were 5,231 cases (down 14.5% from the previous 15-day period). Only 222 (a dip of 25.2%) needed to be admitted. The average daily fresh cases in this period was 349 and the average admissions to hospitals was 15. Senior virologist and TAC member Dr V Ravi said: “The second wave has not hit rock bottom yet and going by past experience, we know Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) is easier said than done. Therefore, while we continue to enforce CAB, vaccination is the best tool to deal with the virus.” Pointing out that vaccine coverage in Bengaluru has been good — more than twothirds of the target population has got the first jab — Ravi said the focus must shift to the districts at a much faster pace. “The uptake of vaccines in some districts is worrisome. There must be no room for complacency,” Ravi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/new-cases-dip-steeper-fall-in-bluru-hospitalisations/articleshow/85526202.cms||Chethan Kumar

And when the Covid-19 pandemic broke this sibling partnership by claiming the life of Neeleshwar Sen, a 25-year-old CA student in Ahmedabad, his sister Dr Lily Sen resolved to keep her brother alive in her life. Ahead of Rakshabandhan on Sunday, Thaltej resident Dr Sen signed up for private tutorials to learn to play Neeleshwar’s guitar. “Neeleshwar would be super-excited about Rakshabandhan. He aspired to become a professional musician and we must have had hundreds of karaoke sessions, singing and laughing together. I signed up for guitar lessons as a tribute to him,” says Dr Sen, a 29-year old clinical psychologist. She also wishes to set up an animal shelter home for stray dogs, another love of her brother. Another sister Radhika Bhavsar, a 28-year-old Sabarmati resident, has gone one step ahead and began paperwork to adopt brother Maulik’s 10-year-old daughter Maahi. Maulik succumbed to Covid-19 in March and the sister has decided to become his daughter’s support system, just like he was to her, all through their lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-sibling-lost-to-covid-a-sister-adopts-brothers-child-another-his-guitar/articleshow/85527825.cms||Parth Shastri

The accident took place on Hambran road on Saturday afternoon. While SUV was being driven by Arun Jain of Bal Singh Nagar in Basti Jodhewal area, 35-year-old Reema Maggu of Kitchlu Nagar was riding an Activa. Police officials said the Innova had come from South City area with a woman sitting on its rear seat and was on its way towards Haibowal.

---||Delhi||Festive boost: Now, bars and eateries can stay open till 1am in Delhi||NEW DELHI: In a move that could prove to be the kiss of life for beleaguered restaurateurs and shop owners just before the festival season, the Delhi government has allowed restaurants, bars and all markets, including malls and shopping complexes, to revert to their normal timings from Tuesday. This means that restaurants and bars can stay open till 1am and markets can resume their normal operations with pre-Covid timings. The capital is, finally, getting its nightlife back after over four months! The Delhi Disaster Management Authority made this announcement Saturday, buoyed by the dramatic improvement in the Covid-19 situation. Edu institutions to remain closedThe Covid positivity rate has fallen to 0.03% from over 36% on April 22. In the recent past, the capital has not reported a single Covid death in many days. At present, bars are allowed to operate from noon to 10pm while restaurants are permitted to stay open from 8am to 10pm. All markets are allowed to operate from 10am to 8pm. Now restaurants and bars can stay open till 1am while there is no specific timing for markets. However, restaurants and bars will have to cap the seating at 50%. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi: “Due to corona, markets in Delhi were till now allowed to operate till 8pm. Due to falling Covid cases, the timing restrictions are being lifted… Now markets can open as per their normal timings.” The DDMA order stated that the change will be effective from August 24 because the last DDMA order will remain in force till August 23. The new order will remain in effect till August 31. Early closure has sounded the deathknell for many restaurants in the city, already hit by falling footfall and the 50% cap on seating. Dinner sales contribute about 70% to their business and taking the last order at 9.30pm meant that many patrons simply stayed away. Unlike restaurants and bars, there are no uniform timings for markets in Delhi. At several places, the timings are regulated by market associations and vary from place to place. The decision is likely to give a boost to traders because the festive season is round the corner. The Delhi government had imposed restrictions on economic activities in the second fortnight of April and closed down restaurants and bars when Covid cases started spiralling. With the situation improving, the conditions were gradually relaxed. Delhi Disaster Management Authority, however, underlined the fact that caution has to be exercised to ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed. It has directed all district magistrates, DCPs and officers concerned to ensure wearing of masks, social distancing, regular hand washing, use of sanitiser, observing hygiene and not allowing any spitting at places where crowds gather. In case of any violation, it has warned that the premises will be closed and criminal prosecution ordered. Traders welcomed the decision. Many of them had written to the LG, CM and DDMA to seek relief. "Restriction on timings was leading to major losses and minimising the chance of any increase in sales. We are thankful to the authorities and promise to follow the Covid protocol diligently," said Ashok Randhawa, president of the Sarojini Nagar traders' association. The Chamber of Trade and Industries had also written to DDMA asking for relaxation in timings. "Due to the 8pm restriction, people would start wrapping up from 7.30pm onwards. We can operate freely and without any hassle," said Brijesh Goel, chairman of the chamber. He thanked the chief minister for providing this relief to the traders. Meanwhile, all schools, colleges and educational institutions will remain closed but students of Classes 10 to 12 are allowed to visit their schools for admission-related work, including counselling/guidance and practical activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/festive-boost-now-bars-and-eateries-can-stay-open-till-1am-in-delhi/articleshow/85527827.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Goa||Goa: Russia counsel alleges foul play in Siolim death||PANAJI: The legal counsel for the Russian consulate in Goa, Vikram Varma, on Saturday said there is suspicion of foul play in the death of 24-year-old Alexandra Ri Djavi. Further, he expressed confidence that Goa police would conduct a thorough investigation in the case. Djavi was found hanging on Thursday in a rented room in Siolim. Speaking to TOI, Varma said, “I have been informed that in 2019, before the pandemic, there had been an incident with Djavi in Chennai, wherein she was allegedly blackmailed for sexual favours by a photographer. The local police, after conducting a preliminary inquiry, had found enough evidence to lodge an FIR and arrest the accused. At this stage of the case, every bit of material information could assist the Goa police in deciding whether there is any cause for suspicion of foul play. All information available will be shared with the police,” he said Anjuna police said on Friday that there is no foul play in the cases. Anjuna police on Thursday received information from the Siolim public health centre that Djavi, 24, was brought dead in an 108 (ambulance). Upon enquiry, it was revealed that the deceased lived in a rented room with her boyfriend at Gublawaddo-Oxel, Siolim. PI Suraj Gawas said the deceased was “mentally-disturbed” and under medication. “In the absence of her boyfriend, she died by suicide by hanging herself to a ceiling fan hook in the kitchen with a red sari,” he had said. The incident took place between 3.30pm and 6.30pm. When her boyfriend reached the rented room, he found the main door latched from inside, and no response from the deceased.

Prior to his arrival, Chidambaram will meet with interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi and also hold a meeting with Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao to take stock of the party’s bearings in Goa. Goa Congress vice president M K Sheikh said that Chidambaram will meet party functionaries in North Goa on August 25 and spend August 26 in South Goa meeting office bearers, block presidents, frontal organisations. News of Chidambaram’s visit has rekindled expectations among the party’s rank and file that significant changes will be brought about to revitalise the party. “Chidambaram will meet and discuss with party functionaries and will take inputs to work out strategies for the upcoming assembly elections,” Sheikh said. Chidambaram has been appointed by AICC to oversee election strategies and ensure coordination for the 2022 assembly elections. AICC Goa desk in-charge will arrive in Goa two days earlier and will interact with party functionaries over four days starting from August 23. Party workers and functionaries say that Chidambaram and Rao have to immediately decide if the party will form an alliance with “like-minded parties” to outsmart BJP in the elections. The party high command will also need to take a call over Girish Chodankar’s role as president of the state unit. The grand old party has been adrift ever since it failed to form the government despite emerging as the single largest party in the 2017 assembly elections. Under Chodankar’s watch, the party’s strength in the state legislative assembly has dwindled down to five MLAs in the 40-member House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chidambaram-to-take-stock-of-congs-poll-strategy-for-22/articleshow/85525777.cms||---

Action needs to be taken against those not doing it. I have been to New Delhi, where the fine for violating the rule is Rs 5,000. Compared to that, the fine in Bengaluru is very low,” he said. The penalty in Bengaluru is Rs 250. A number of citizens have claimed that BBMP marshals are selective in enforcing Covid-19 safety rules. Ashoka praised those following Covid-appropriate behaviour: “Almost 90 per cent of the people in Bengaluru wear masks. We need to enforce the rule on the remaining 10 per cent.” He said that necessary precautions were being taken while reopening schools in the city. “As per the education minister’s order, government and corporation schools in Bengaluru will reopen from August 23. Given that each class would have 40 to 50 students, we want to ensure that there is no spread of the virus from schools,” he said. He added education officials had set guidelines, including steps for transporting schoolchildren.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/revenue-minister-r-ashoka-defends-mask-action-in-bengaluru/articleshow/85527879.cms||---

It also promises families electricity 24 hours a day and waiving of all previous electricity bills and free electricity for all farmers. Meanwhile, on the Rs 5 crore allocated to form the Goa Mineral Development Corporation, AAP state convenor Rahul Mhambre said, “This amount is inadequate by a huge degree.

EPFO added 12.8 lakh subscribers during June||NEW DELHI: Provisional payroll data of pension fund body, Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation, show a growing trend with 12.8 lakh payroll additions during June. According to month-onmonth analysis, 5 lakh subscribers were added during June as compared to May. The data suggested a decreasing impact of the second wave of Covid, with the net payroll additions rising in comparison to April and May. “Of the total 12.8 lakh net subscribers added, 8.1 lakh new members have come under the social security coverage of Employees’ Provident Funds Scheme for the first time. During the month (June), around 4.7 lakh net subscribers exited but rejoined EPFO by changing jobs within the establishments covered by EPFO. This shows that majority of subscribers opted to continue their membership with EPFO, transferring of funds from previous job to the current PF account rather than applying for final withdrawal of their PF accumulations,” a labour ministry statement said. The payroll data also suggested that about 6.1 lakh persons added to the payroll data were in the age group of 18-25 years, accounting for 47.8% of total net additions in June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/easing-of-covid-impact-epfo-added-12-8-lakh-subscribers-during-june/articleshow/85527896.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Karnataka: Housing sales up as vaccination drive, festivals lift mood||BENGALURU: After the slowdown during the second wave of Covid-19, the property market is picking up, thanks to the progress in vaccination drives and festive mood among homebuyers. The market, especially sales of new housing units, started to improve in July, after the state government unlocked sectors to kick-start the troubled economy, and saw further activity in August. Data from the stamps and registration department for the two-month period shows the positive sentiment on the property front. In July, more than 2.1 lakh property documents were registered, generating revenue of Rs 1,217 crore. The most sales were recorded between August 8 and 20 after Aashada, considered an inauspicious phase, ended, and officials expect document registrations in August to go up to 3 lakh. New home sales, which had remained stagnant for 18 months, have increased sharply in recent weeks, easing worries in the real estate sector that faced repeated pandemiclinked disruptions and shortages of labour and raw materials. According to officials of the revenue department, new homes sold in Bengaluru and the rest of the state have been 10-30 per cent higher in the July-August period compared to the average sales seen during pre-Covid years. Suresh Hari, the chairman of Credai-Bengaluru, said that the sector was showing signs of revival after almost 18 months of a lull. He added that low rates of home loans, certain tax benefits and creditlinked subsidy schemes of the central government had helped improve the sentiment. The state government’s measures, such as reducing stamp duty from 5 per cent to 3 per cent for homes priced between Rs 21 lakh and Rs 45 lakh, and pent-up demand have also fuelled the revival, say some other experts. “Over the past one and a half years, people have realised the importance of owning property and having a permanent roof over their head, and this sentiment is driving the demand for real estate,” said Gaurav Mohta, the chief marketing officer of Home First Finance. Developers are making extra efforts to woo buyers by offering deal sweeteners such as per sq ft rate discounts and an extended timeline to pay the down payment. According to Darshan Govindaraju, the director of Vaishnavi Group, property prices have stabilised in the wake of the pandemic and many people see this as the best time to invest as they anticipate rates to increase in the coming years. Errol Fernandes, the chairman and managing director of Ferns Estates, said that the stock market had made significant gains in the past year. “Historically, we have observed that real estate prices invariably follow with a lag, and this view is also driving the housing market,” Fernandes explained. Citing US billionaire Warren Buffett’s line “Time is the friend of the wonderful business...”, Monica Matthias, the director of Hoysala Projects, said that a well-chosen property could also be a potent financial ally over the years. “So, buying property today could well prove to be a value purchase,” Matthias said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-housing-sales-up-as-vaccination-drive-festivals-lift-mood/articleshow/85530468.cms||Manu Aiyappa

No death due to the infection was recorded in the last 24 hours, health department officials said. On Friday also, the capital did not record any deaths due to Covid-19 while 57 fresh cases were reported with a positivity rate of 0.08%. “This is a very positive sign. But we have to continue following preventive measures strictly to ensure there is no resurgence in number of cases,” said an official. Delhi reeled under a brutal second wave of the pandemic that swept the country, claiming a massive number of lives daily, and the oxygen supply shortage issue at various hospitals added to the woes. Since April 19, both daily cases and single-day deaths count had been spiralling, with over 28,000 cases and 277 deaths recorded on April 20; rising to 306 fatalities on April 22. On May 3, the city registered a record 448 deaths, according to official data. However, from June, the city has been witnessing a declining trend in both cases and deaths caused by virus. Twenty-five fresh cases of Covid-19, the lowest since April 15 last year until Saturday, and two deaths were recorded on Thursday, while the positivity rate had stood at 0.04%. On Wednesday, the city registered 36 cases and four fatalities, while the positivity rate had stood at 0.05%. On Tuesday, the city recorded 38 cases and four deaths, while the positivity rate stood at 0.07%.

It warns of repeated flooding and air pollution, as environmental shocks, leading to adverse socio-economic consequences for kids and women. The first Children’s Climate Risk Index by Unicef ranks India at a vulnerable 26 and among four South Asian nations where children would face the most significant adverse impacts of climate change. Besides India, the other South Asian countries are Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan with a ranking of 14th, 15th and 15th respectively. The 33 “extremely high-risk” countries, says the report, collectively emit just 9% of global CO2 emissions, while 10 highest emitting countries together account for nearly 70% of global emissions. For instance, China ranks at top accounting for 30.3% of gloval Co2 emissions, followed by and USA 14.6%. India accounts for much less at 7.1%. In addition, Nepal and Sri Lanka are among the top 65 countries most impacted globally with a ranking of 51 and 61 respectively. The report ranks countries based on children’s exposure to climate and environmental shocks, such as cyclones and heatwaves, as well as their vulnerability to those shocks, based on their access to essential services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/climate-crisis-puts-indian-kids-at-extremely-high-risk-unicef/articleshow/85527930.cms||Ambika Pandit

Sections of parents and teachers have expressed concerns about health safety. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai sought to allay their fears on Saturday, saying the state government had taken “extreme care” to ensure classroom learning was safe. “All preparations have been made for reopening schools. Directions have been given to government and private schools regarding how to bring students, take consent from parents or guardians, make seating arrangements, set shift-wise classes on alternate days and sanitise classrooms, among other things,” he said. Bommai urged parents to get vaccinated, pay attention to the health of their children and instil confidence in them. “We have taken necessary steps to ensure students remain safe. Our intention behind reopening schools is that children should slowly start coming to campuses. We want them to gradually develop confidence and attend classes,” he said. The chief minister and education minister BC Nagesh will inspect arrangements in schools in Bengaluru and surrounding areas on Monday. Earlier this month, the government decided to reopen schools and colleges for students from class 9 to 12 (II PUC) across the state. Later, it chose to be cautious and not reopen schools in districts where the Covid-19 positivity rate is more than 2 per cent. The decision on reopening primary schools has been deferred till the last week of August to factor in the possible third wave of Covid-19 and the way the infection is likely to spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/school-restart-extra-care-taken-to-protect-students-says-karnataka-cm-basavaraj-bommai/articleshow/85527913.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike springs surprise, repairs road five days before deadline||BENGALURU: The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, which usually receives brickbats from citizens for incessant road digging and long delays when it comes to finishing repair works, has drawn appreciation this time. Reason: A road-rebuilding project in the central part of the city was completed before deadline. The civic body had taken up redevelopment of NR Road, starting from the end of Sri Balagangadharnatha Swamiji flyover to SJP Road towards Town Hall, and completed white-topping work in 10 days instead of the 15-day deadline it had set for itself. The road was thrown open for traffic without any fanfare involving ministers or local functionaries. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said: “It is necessary to meet deadlines. But for that we need to be given a road that is completely closed. NR Road was a small stretch, we achieved it. We asked for 15-day traffic closure, but completed work in 10 days.” In fact, the spotlight was on the 200-metre stretch of NR Road recently after the down ramp of the flyover caused much trouble to motorists due to waterlogging and potholes. The Palike and police officials met to resolve the issue and cops were told to close traffic on the busy SJP Road to facilitate white-topping work. Unlike other roads where repair work moves at a snail’s pace after digging begins, NR Road was a different story. According to Gupta, 80% of time goes in shifting utilities like water, electricity and sewage lines, among others. In this case, there was no shifting of utilities. “We end up running into unforeseen hurdles. Projects are also delayed because of financial problems of contactors,” Gupta added. NR Road was redeveloped at a cost of Rs 2.5 crore. Gupta’s social-media post on the revamped NR Road drew mixed response. While many were pleasantly surprised that the civic agency could complete an infrastructure project in time, some pointed out that the walkway was still in poor shape. When contacted, BBMP chief engineer Lokesh said the stretch had been white-topped and only side-drain works are to be completed. However, BBMP’s feat also saw residents from other areas pleading with the chief commissioner to display the same speed and consistency in completing works in their localities. Some pointed to ongoing infrastructure projects like Shivananda flyover, white-topping of Intermediate Ring Road and Thanisandra Road and asked why these projects were lingering for years after having missed multiple deadlines. A netizen said a lot of good things could happen if top-level officers involve themselves in all major projects on a day-to-day basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-springs-surprise-repairs-road-five-days-before-deadline/articleshow/85522194.cms||---

In the order released on Friday, while staying various provisions of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act related to interfaith marriage, the division bench of chief justice Vikram Nath and justice Biren Vaishnav opined that with the June 2021 amendments, a marriage itself is presumed to be a medium for the purpose of unlawful conversion if the marriage was by way of allurement, force or by fraudulent means. “Prima facie on a plain reading of Section 3 of the 2003 Act, we feel that inter-faith marriage followed by conversion would amount to an offence under the 2003 Act. Marriage itself and a consequential conversion is deemed as an unlawful conversion attracting penal provisions” the court noted. It said state government’s insistence that the element of fraud, allurement or coercion should be read with the State of Objects and Reasons of the Act, but this may not be understood by the common man. On shifting the burden of proof on to the accused to establish that the marriage and later conversion had not taken place on account of any fraud, it said, “This again puts the parties validly entering into interfaith marriage in great jeopardy.” “Prima facie interfaith marriages between two adults by operation of the provisions of the Act interferes with intricacies of marriage including right to choice of a person,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-law-against-couples-validly-entering-into-interfaith-marriage-gujarat-hc/articleshow/85527952.cms||---

A bench comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M S Sonak stated that the power to punish for contempt “is to be only sparingly exercised, not to protect the dignity of the court against insult or injury, but to protect and vindicate the right of the people so that the administration of justice is not perverted, prejudiced, obstructed, or interfered with”. The bench held that the dignity and authority of its judicial institutions are “neither dependent on the opinions allegedly expressed by David Clever, nor can the dignity of our institution and its officers be tarnished by such stray slights or irresponsible content”. The court made these comments in a petition filed by Kashinath Shetye stating that Clever, who is possibly based in the UK, committed criminal contempt of court by making false and scurrilous allegations against some judicial officers of the district judiciary, and uploading the content on Youtube and WhatsApp. “Such content, allegedly uploaded by David Clever, is best treated with contempt, rather than in contempt, particularly since David Clever has neither bothered to cite any specific instances nor bothered to lodge any complaints backed by even prima facie, credible material,” said the HC. “The inquiries made on our administrative side revealed the irresponsibility of the comments and the possible use of the uploader as a front by some disgruntled litigants. To take this matter any further might only serve to feed the publicity craze of those that have uploaded this content to provoke, rather than out of some concern to bring to the fore some genuine grievance concerning the administration of justice in Goa.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/contempt-power-to-protect-rights-of-people-not-courts-dignity-hc/articleshow/85527978.cms||---

All trains will run from Byappanahalli to Kengeri (on Purple Line) only during peak hours, which are 8am to 11am and 4:30pm to 7:30pm. However, alternate trains will operate till Kengeri during non-peak hours. Other trains will run between Byappanahalli and Mysuru Road. Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri will inaugurate the Purple Line extension in the presence of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai next Sunday. BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez said: “The inauguration will be held at Nayandahalli station and commercial operations will begin on August 30 (Monday).” Asked if operating alternate trains to Kengeri during non-peak hours could lead to crowding during the pandemic, Parwez said: “Operating sixcoach trains till Kengeri during non-peak hours is not a viable option. This is a temporary arrangement. If the demand picks up, we will operate trains till Kengeri even during nonpeak hours.” Once Kengeri Metro is commissioned, Namma Metro’s total network will stretch to 55km, the third-longest after Delhi and Hyderabad. This includes 30km Green Line (Nagasandra-Silk Institute) and 25km Purple Line (Byappanahalli-Kengeri). This will be the second Phase 2 corridor to be opened after Yelachenahalli-Silk Institute on Kanakapura Road. BMRCL has been operating trains between Silk Institute and Nagasandra even during non-peak hours. On August 11 and 12, commissioner for Metro railway safety inspected the reach 2 extension line (7.4km) from Mysuru Road station to Kengeri station and gave authorisation for opening this line for passenger service. Kengeri residents heaved a sigh of relief with their locality getting Metro connectivity after a delay of nearly three years. Arun Kumar, a resident, said: “It’s a Janmashtami gift for us.” The southwestern extension of Purple Line is expected to benefit 75,000 passengers daily. The elevated Kengeri section will have seven stations — Nayandahalli, Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Jnanabharathi, Pattanagere, Kengeri bus terminal, Kengeri and Challaghatta. However, Challaghatta station, which lies across NICE Road, is likely to be operational only in 2023. BMTC to operate feeder busesBMTC officials said they are charting out Metro feeder buses from stations like Kengeri. “We are planning to operate buses to places like Challaghatta, Bidadi, Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout and Visvesvaraya Layout. The routes will be finalised in a day or two,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-all-purple-line-trains-to-run-up-to-kengeri-only-during-peak-hours/articleshow/85527977.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Jog Falls security staffers allowed visitors without vaccination or Covid negative certificate||SHIVAMOGGA: Home guards and other security personnel deployed at the famous Jog Falls have been booked under the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act for letting in visitors without asking for a full vaccination or Covid negative certificate. The staff was seen being deliberately lax during a decoy operation conducted by authorities. The operation is being described as the state’s first such exercise to check the enforcement of Covid-19 safety guidelines at popular tourist spots. A shopkeeper was allegedly part of a racket in which people paid money to visit Jog Falls without producing the said certificates. He has also been booked. The exact amount of money collected this way is not known; further inquiries are underway. Shivamogga SP BM Laxmi Prasad said that there had been allegations of violation of safety norms after the district administration imposed stricter rules at tourist spots. “We found that some security personnel and home guards were acting improperly by allowing tourists to flout norms. They were caught collecting money from tourists. We have audio clips about their conversations,” he said. A few weeks ago, Shivamogga deputy commissioner KB Sivakumar had issued a circular on strict guidelines for visiting tourist places. Srinivas, the director of Jog Authority, told STOI that no officer consulted him regarding the inquiry. He said that some local guides might be involved in the illegal activity with security staff. “The tourism department is keeping a close watch,” he said. After visitors were allowed to see Jog Falls last month, the daily count has been regularly crossing 1,000. Some locals claim that visitors from other districts don’t wear masks or follow social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-jog-falls-security-staffers-allowed-visitors-without-vaccination-or-covid-negative-certificate/articleshow/85527996.cms||---

The carcass was found on the bed of Gheesh river next to a paddy field. Burn marks on the trunk indicated electrocution, but the culprits are yet to be identified. “The area falls under Baikunthapur forest division and the DFO is conducting raids to nab the culprits,” said Rajendra Jakhar, chief conservator of forests, Northern Circle. The forest department has been unable to prevent villagers in north Bengal from tapping electricity from high tension cables and laying electric traps for jumbos. To combat the problem, the forest department had held several meetings, but little has been achieved. It is learnt the loner elephant had entered the river bank after straying out of Bhuttabari forest. “These days, culprits are also taking power from household connections. It’s our failure that we are not being able to sensitise people,” said Shyama Prasad Pandey of Society for Protecting Ophiofauna & Animal Rights. Environmentalists blame it on the indiscriminate settlement of people around forests. “The behavioural change in elephants is a result of the continuous man-elephant conflict,” said Animesh Basu, a member of the state wildlife advisory board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tusker-electrocuted-in-oodlabari/articleshow/85524940.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
---||Kolkata||State BJP eyes Durga Puja to reconnect with Bengali psyche||Kolkata: It isn’t just Lord Rama or his disciple Lord Hanuman, Bengal BJP is desperate to increase its footprint in the coming Durga Puja to get rid of the “alien” stigma and open up a groove in the Bengali psyche. The move follows from the Bengal unit’s analysis of the assembly polls in which the party fell far short of the 200-seat target set by BJP leader Amit Shah. There were arguments for and against in BJP’s meetings, but the fact remains that leaders of the Bengal unit, including Dilip Ghosh, were overshadowed by PM Narendra Modi, Union home minister Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath in public and also within the organization in the run-up to the polls. Although the central BJP’s presence was not too “overbearing” in north Bengal where the party fared well, the PM quoting Tagore or Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in “mispronounced Bengali” failed to appeal to the Bengali ‘bhadralok’ in south Bengal. Ghosh didn’t like the way Subrato Chatterjee was removed from the post of secretary Bengal BJP (organization) ahead of elections on the suggestions of Kailash Vijayvargiya, Mukul Roy and the then RSS kshetra pracharak of Bengal Pradip Joshi. State office-bearers were in many cases in the dark over entrants from Trinamool or selection of candidates. The differences came to the surface when then junior Union minister Babul Supriyo and BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu spoke up against the inclusion of former Asansol mayor Jitendra Tiwari in BJP. The party served them show-cause notices. So when the BJP brass sent forms to be filled up by Bengal BJP over candidate selections, weeks after the poll results, the dismay was evident. A section of state leaders feels that some organizers who switched from TMC were repulsed by ranks at the grassroots. Such last-minute joining worked to the contrary, as was evident in Hooghly. With the focus now on Uttar Pradesh, Bengal BJP is trying to carve out its course on its own in consultation with the BJP brass. At the Sahid Samman virtual meeting on July 21, Ghosh and leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari were the main speakers. The purpose, say leaders, was to connect with the people of Bengal. BJP president JP Nadda asked four junior Union ministers from Bengal to lead the Sahid Samman yatra. He also urged state leaders to reach out to the public and take the cases of post-poll victims to a “conclusive end”. Accordingly, the Bengal BJP is planning an expansion of organizational districts, recruitment of party workers and also ways to reach out to the public on issues of life and livelihood. BJP is, therefore, eyeing the Durga Puja in a big way. “This is not the first time we are going to organize the Durga Puja. Our leaders are also engaged with various para clubs. Let’s pray that Covid loses its sting before the pujas,” said Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-bjp-eyes-durga-puja-to-reconnect-with-bengali-psyche/articleshow/85524823.cms||Saugata Roy
---||Kolkata||Local turban-makers in West Bengal lose sleep over Afghan turmoil||SONAMUKHI/KOLKATA: A cluster of families in Sonamukhi — a Bengal town some 3,000km from Kabul — are watching the events unfolding in Afghanistan with more than the normal degree of interest. For more than half a century, these families in Bankura district have had a thriving trade relation with Afghanistan, supplying high-quality silk turbans, or saafa, to Kabuliwallahs. With trade between India and Afghanistan coming to a sudden halt following the Taliban takeover of the country, the turban weavers and sellers are staring at a loss in business and some have already started shifting to stocking and weaving the indigenous but intricate Baluchari saris. “We have been in this business for three generations now. My grandfather started the trade and then my father opened a shop in Kolkata and began exporting the turbans to Afghanistan. Till last year, I had an annual turnover of Rs 1 crore just from selling these turbans but the trade has come to a sudden stop now,” said Shyamapada Dutta, 49, who runs a loom at Sonamukhi and has a shop on Rabindra Sarani near Nakhoda Masjid.  Sonamukhi’s ties with Afghans dates back to the 1960s when some Kabuliwallahs while travelling across Bengal with their spices and dry fruits were drawn to the village known for its rich silk weaves. “They gave the first orders for silk turbans and liked the products so much that they kept coming back for more and that is how the trade began,” said Asit Baran Shoo, another weaver. He added that even in the 1990s around 500 families in the village were engaged in the turban trade but the number has now dwindled to around 50 owing to digital prints and a large section of newage Afghans discarding turbans. The colourful turbans mostly come in two lengths of 36 inches and 45 inches and are priced between Rs 350 and Rs 3,500 depending on the quality of silk used. The black, blue and grey ones are worn by the Pashtoons. The pale yellow and metallic shades are preferred in central and northern Afghanistan while the Hazaras, who claim to be descendants of Genghis Khan, go for the greens. Raju Paul, 39, a third-generation weaver and exporter said his turbans were mostly sent to Ghazni, the biggest trade hub and the sixth largest city in Afghanistan. The Taliban took control of Ghazni on August 12 and since then all his transactions have stopped. “We had a set of regular Afghan customers coming over to our village to buy the turbans and a set of Afghan agents who regularly visited our units to take bulk orders and send them to Afghanistan. But now the agents have cancelled further orders citing uncertainty back home. The situation is similar to that in 1996 when the Taliban first annexed Afghanistan but our trade had continued. This time, the agents say the situation looks grim,” said Paul. City-based Afghans at Shyampada Dutta’s shop near Nakhoda Masjid to buy turbansCity-based Afghans like Md Rasul and Akhdat Khan said they had earlier bought turbans from the Rabindra Sarani store and from Sonamukhi either for personal use or for exporting purposes. “But the situation looks grim now. We have no idea when things will get better,” said Rasul, who has been in Kolkata for last 40 years and deals in garments.

Srikanta Patra went fishing at Sarsanka jheel on Friday. His body was found near a canal at Bakultala village on Saturday. Two bamboo poles were found on the spot. The body has been sent to Midnapore Medical College for autopsy. Patra’s widow Basanti and brother Bablu went to the BJP party office in Midnapore town and alleged that he was killed by Trinamool goons. BJP’s Keshiary MLA Mosab Mullick said: “Trinamool men had beaten Patra, an active BJP worker, earlier and wanted him to join their party.” BJP district president Soumen Tewari said: “The victim was under pressure from Trinamool soon after the assembly election results.” TMC’s Dantan I block president Pratul Das, however, said: “No Trinamool worker has any role in the incident. As far as I know, he was inebriated and fell into the canal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/body-found-in-dantan-bjp-finger-at-tmc/articleshow/85524952.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Kolkata||Army holds exercises with Bofors guns along India-China border||Siliguri: The Army conducted exercises with Bofors artillery guns along the Indo-China border over the past week. Though the force claims there is no tension between the neighbours at present, they were held in the backdrop of China building three model villages near the border with Sikkim. China has indicated that it plans to initially settle people of Tibetan origin in these villages. However, sources say they have been cleverly constructed to also be used as bunkers. China has also been building infrastructure along its border with Arunachal Pradesh. “A routine exercise was held with Bofors guns. There is no tension along the border now. It is peaceful. The exercise is a precautionary measure to build confidence among the local residents along the northern and eastern borders where we have deployed troops,” said Army officials. Forces have been deployed in Lachen, Lachung and Thangu in north Sikkim and Sherathag and Kupup on the eastern border. The Swedish-made FH77 Bofors guns can fire shells beyond 30km. They were inducted into the Army in the late 1980s and played a key role in ensuring victory during the Kargil war with Pakistan in 1999. The guns are capable of firing three rounds in 12 seconds and were extensively used by the Army to dislodge Pakistani army regulars and militants from Indian peaks. The guns also proved their mettle during Operation Parakram in 2001, firing 80-90 rounds every day that inflicted heavy damage on enemy posts. “Bofors guns are crucial for maintaining firepower superiority at high altitudes where neither fighter aircraft nor helicopters can provide support,” an Army source said. Sikkim shares about 226km in the east and the north with China. The Army takes the lead on the border, ITBP and SSB also have a mandate to guard the area. SSB also patrols the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/army-holds-exercises-with-bofors-guns-along-india-china-border/articleshow/85524861.cms||Roshan Gupta
---||Kolkata||Turning over a new leaf||India is a major tea producer, but we can hardly call any global tea brand Indian. Under a huge pressure for survival, planters are embarking on portfolio diversification, better packaging, estate-specific branding and digital marketing to serve the perfect brew, piping hot Kolkata: Frankly, it boils down to the details. And the cuppa numbers tell a story that reveals how the tea industry is ready to reposition itself for a new identity and give tea drinkers a brand new reason to sip some more. The world sips approximately 8.2 billion cups of tea every day, and China and India gulp down the bulk of it. However, per-head tea consumption in a year stands at over 1 kg in the UK and Turkey against just 860gm/year in India. Out of around 1,400 million kg (mkg) tea leaves produced in our country annually, only 250 mkg is shipped overseas while 1,000 mkg is sold in the domestic market. The rest — 150 mkg — finds no takers. Experts blame India’s poor domestic consumption for the lack of demand for medium to average quality tea, which has led to the decades-long stagnation in prices. Thus, no matter how ironic it may sound, producers of the world’s cheapest and most popular stress-buster have come under severe stress. Big plantation companies have found one formula to tide over the crisis: change the unnamed agri-commodity status of tea to a well-packaged and branded household product. Most big and organised tea planters — the Tatas (TCPL), Amalgamated Plantations (APPL), Goodricke and Jay Shree Tea — and even iconic estates like Makaibari, Jungpana and Lopchu — are now busy branding and retailing their garden-specific produce. Along with Tea Board of India and other bodies, they have joined the new ‘brandwagon’ to catch the youth with a diverse portfolio of tea. India’s second-largest tea plantation company, APPL, believes that the commodity-to-product drift is a way of survival for big planters. Blaming this strategic shift on high cost of production and stagnant prices of bulk tea, its MD and CEO Vikram Singh Gulia said: “It takes time to build a distribution-logistics-retail network. For a bulk plantation company, maintaining quality is a huge headache as medium quality tea is produced aplenty while good quality leaves are scarce.” In 2017, APPL had first unveiled its garden-specific branded tea to catch the retail bus. For some years, biggies like Goodricke have embarked on product diversification and social media marketing. Goodricke MD & CEO Atul Asthana said: “Besides quality maintenance, branding is the key to reach out to retail customers. What we used to treat as an agri-commodity even a decade back is now an exclusive portfolio of products.” In its effort to beat Covid-19 blues, Luxmi Tea, the owner of Makaibari Tea Estate, has started marketing seven special varieties of estate-fresh unique brew online since last year. Rudra Chatterjee, the MD of Luxmi Tea, said, “Tea has traditionally been grown by planters and sold through auction to packers and retail sellers, but directly bringing fresh, traceable produce from estates to the consumer is nothing short of an opportunity. By promoting quality, upgrading packaging and leveraging technology, we can hope that most consumers in the world will have their fresh teas shipped directly from Kolkata.” The secretary of the premier planters’ body Indian Tea Association (ITA), Sujit Patra — who has been an integral part of global tea exports promotion — feels: “Tea is no longer a commodity, it is now a diversified product.” A word of caution, nonetheless, comes from Anshuman Kanoria, chairman of the Indian Tea Exporters’ Association. “Any move to market and brand tea is welcome. But the foremost job is to maintain quality. Just creating a jazzy website or making a tall claim while branding gardens won’t do.” During the last two decades, north Indian tea producers have been plagued by climatic change, high cost of production, paucity of skilled labour, infrastructural bottlenecks and illegal influx of cheaper tea from Nepal. The Covid-19 lockdown has added to the woes as it shrunk produce by over 15% in the peak quality period from March to June. “Indian tea must regain its due by better packaging, innovative ideas of reaching out to customers, organizing promotions, rural market capture, tea boutiques and other advertisement formats,” Parul Singh, director (plantations), Union ministry of commerce & industry, had said at a CII seminar recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/turning-over-a-new-leaf/articleshow/85525228.cms||Sovon Manna

Its carcass was found floating on the Torsa river on Saturday and recovered by foresters later from Silbarighat. The Torsa and other rivulets flowing through the national park were in full spate following heavy showers in the upper catchments and in the Bhutan hills. The rhino had strayed out of Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary and taken shelter in a bush on the Torsa river bank on the outskirts of the park. It drowned as the water level increased, flooding the patch of land it had taken shelter on. Foresters have ruled out any foul play as there was no injury mark on the animal’s body and the horn was intact. “It is a natural case of drowning,” said Deepak M, divisional forest officer, Jaldapara WL Division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rhino-drowns-at-jaldapara/articleshow/85524895.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
---||Kolkata||Déjà brew in tea lounge||Kolkata: There are very few things as quintessentially Bengali as ‘adda’. And, no ‘adda’ is complete without the ubiquitous ‘ek bhar cha’. Be it a debate over football or politics, the cuppa is a must. While India’s tea history dates back to the early 1800s, the thinker’s potion — also known as ‘chai’ — has entered the lounge lexicon only in the past couple of decades with entrepreneurs giving the makeshift roadside shop a hip makeover. Ambuja Neotia Hospitality established its flagship store Tea Junction at City Centre mall, Salt Lake, in 2004. The lounge offers multiple infusions — from bubble tea to masala chai — in its signature clay ‘kulhar (a variation of the bhar)’. “We realised there were not many tea lounges in Kolkata even though ‘adda’ sessions over ‘cha’ are so popular in Bengal. Thus began the journey of Tea Junction,” said Nitin Kohli, director, Ambuja Neotia Hospitality. Chai Break, a bootstrap startup that was launched at Chowringhee in 2011, is today a blockbuster hit among college-goers and young working professionals. It boasts 20 outlets across Kolkata, Kharagpur, Jamshedpur and Bhubaneswar. In addition to an array of flavoured brews such as lemon iced tea, peppermint tea, ‘kadak adrak chai’ and ‘kesar chai’, it also offers Indian, Chinese, Thai and Italian cuisines. Co-founder Aditya Ladsaria said the pandemic had compelled Chai Break to diversify. Established in 2000 as an integral part of the Oxford Bookstore in Park Street, Cha Bar has since been the go-to lounge for anyone who wishes to leaf through bestsellers while sipping some rejuvenating beverage. Today, it offers more than 150 varieties of blend — from Moroccan mint and South African rooibos to decaf, green tea and Ayurvedic chai. “Whether one prefers a rich, full-bodied and strong flavour or a light and fragrant taste, Cha Bar has it all,” said Nitin Warikoo, the head of business development. Cha R Baak is another emerging tea lounge that aims to augment the Bengali ‘adda’ culture in a pocket-friendly ambience. From Darjeeling tea to Kashmiri ‘kawa’, the options are many. “We also host events to provide budding talents a platform,” said co-owner Kaushik Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dj-brew-in-tea-lounge/articleshow/85525396.cms||---
---||Indore||Madhya Pradesh: With masks, daily cases 2,500, or brace for 14,000 by November 1||INDORE: Madhya Pradesh may have around 7,959 estimated daily Covid cases by November 1 at the current rate and there will be a drop thereafter, according to a model of the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) of University of Washington. But with universal masking, the projection dramatically improves – less than 2,500 cases a day. It’s a huge incentive for people to mask up and for the administration to ensure that no one steps out of their house without one. The masking projection has immense significance for trade and business as well – it’s the difference between another lockdown and keeping the economy running. Without masking and obeying other Covid precautions, the worst-case scenario is quite alarming – over 14,000 daily cases by November and a further increase thereafter. To put it in perspective, average daily cases in MP were around 7,000 in the second wave. MP will see a decline in cases after Nov: ProjectionThe projections were presented before the state government a couple of days ago in the presence of experts from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The presentation was made by Aditya Kumar Athotra, former NCDC statistical officer, Dr. Manindra Agrawal of IIT-Kanpur and authorities of MGM Medical College (MGMMC). MP has been reporting around 10-12 daily cases on average for the past two months with around 70,000 tests a day. The IHME model pegs daily cases now at 331, accounting for untested patients. It shows that at the current rate of infection, MP will see a decline in cases after November and drop to 4,260 a day by December 1. If it gets worse, however, cases would rise to 14,098 a day and shoot up to 22,162 by December instead of dropping towards year-end. With universal masking, the estimated infections may be around 2,495 and 4,913 by November 1 and December 1, according to the estimates. There is an X-factor though – further mutations in the virus. The Delta variant wreaked havoc in India in the second wave and is now raging through Europe and the US. MGMMC dean Dr Sanjay Dixit said, “In any model, the numbers are predicted on the basis of statistical methods through computation. But these statistical models don’t consider possible mutations in the virus, which happens rapidly.” In case the Covid-19 virus mutates again, the numbers may change drastically, said Dr Dixit, warning: “The low current rate of infection in the state shouldn’t make people complacent in following Covid-appropriate behavior, including masking.” The Cambridge University Covid tracker, with short-term projections, shows the effective reproduction number (Rt) for India has dropped below the threshold of 1, to 0.98. In this condition, the reported cases in the country are likely to fall below 38,000 per day by August 21, shows the Cambridge University tracker. On August 20, the daily count in India stood at 34,290, quite within range of the prediction. A third model, Sutra, factors various possibilities, including a fall in antibody levels after a period of time, vaccination coverage and contact rate (rate of infection/transmission in an area), and believes that a major third wave is unlikely. There is more than enough reason for the government to start cracking down on the ‘unmasked’ population. Indore stopped issuing mask challans around a month ago, along with most of the state. But the Jabalpur administration resumed challenging people for masks a week ago, hauling up 120 people a day. The IHME projection makes a strong case for masks – and a powerful incentive for the government to launch a mask-up mission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/madhya-pradesh-with-masks-daily-cases-2500-or-brace-for-14000-by-november-1/articleshow/85527966.cms||Antriksh Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan to release detailed SOP for school reopening soon||JAIPUR: Multiple state government agencies are working overtime to chalk out the final Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) for schools set to reopen from September 1. Sources said there will be different opening and closing hours for classes 9-10 and 11-12 for better adherence to social distancing norms. Students with chronic illnesses (diabetes, cancer, renal failures and any organ malfunction)will be exempted from coming to school. The report said the education directorate had prepared a 20-point SoP for schools and submitted it before the state for its approval. TOI learnt that classes 9 and 11 will function from 7.30am to 12.30 pm. “For board classes 10 and 12, classes will be held from 8am to 1pm. The whole idea is that majority of the schools have limited entry and exit points making it crowded during the start and end of the classes,” said the source. It was also being considered to keep laboratories open for classes 10 and 12 students so that they don’t suffer. TimesViewThe state government must release the SOPs for reopening of schools at the earliest, giving enough time to the authorities to prepare before classes start on September 1. Releasing SOPs at the last moment will help neither the school authorities nor parents. Moreover, the Rajasthan government has to consider factors such as diverse landscapes, private and government institutes, rural-urban divide and socio-economic backgrounds of families before arriving at a decision. They cannot rely on the same set of rules for the entire state.Over 50 lakh students will attend 31,000 schools across the state. The state government had announced the reopening of schools with 50% of students every alternate day. The education directorate is considering that they should call 100% students which can accommodate them all following Covid protocols. ‘ “The view emerges that since students from class 9 will come, there will be enough space for them in every school. Also, calling students every alternate day is not a feasible option for the majority of the schools with limited resources,” said the source. Similar guidelines will be followed for coaching institutes and higher education institutes. The second phase from classes 6 to 8 reopening would depend upon how successful the first phase is. The alternate-day classes option cannot be possible without downsizing the courses. “Rajasthan State Council of Educational Research & Training, Udaipur, responsible for the designing the revised curriculum for different classes,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-to-release-detailed-sop-for-school-reopening-soon/articleshow/85528038.cms||---
---||India||Kalyan Singh, UP CM when Babri came down, dead||LUCKNOW: Kalyan Singh, who was chief minister of Uttar Pradesh on December 6, 1992 when the Babri Masjid was demolished, died at SGPGI here after a prolonged illness on Saturday. He was 89 and is survived by an MP and a minister grandson. Tributes poured in after his death around 9.15pm. PM Narendra Modi called him the voice of the marginalised and home minister Amit Shah said the country would be indebted to his contributions. UP CM Yogi Adityanath termed his death as the end of an era. Yogi, who was at the hospital when Kalyan breathed his last, announced threeday national mourning in the state. “Kalyan Singh’s last rites will be performed on the bank of the Ganga in Narora in the evening of August 23. There will be a public holiday on August 23,” he said at SGPGI. As the CM, Kalyan is remembered as a tough administrator, especially during his first tenure between 1991 and 1992. As a politician, he’s considered the first BJP leader to take it beyond the image of an upper caste party. So much so that BJP’s successful 2014 experiment, uniting non-Yadav OBCs in its favour, is still called the “Kalyan Singh formula”. He started his political career in 1967 by winning the Atrauli Vidhan Sabha seat in Aligarh as a Bharatiya Jan Sangh candidate. He won the seat nine times till 2002, losing just once, in 1980. In the late 80s, he not only pushed the Ram temple movement in UP, but also united Hindus, especially after the implementation of the Mandal Commission report. As a result, BJP got majority in 1991 assembly polls — winning 221 seats — and RSS chose Kalyan over the likes of Murli Manohar Joshi for the top post in UP. It was in the first term that Kalyan earned the sobriquet of “tough administrator”. However, his tenure is remembered more for the demolition of the Babri Masjid. His second term, which started with an experiment to share office with BSP in 1997, wasn’t spectacular. When Mayawati withdrew support after completing her 6-month tenure as CM, Kalyan saved his government by breaking Congress. A few months later, governor Romesh Bhandari sacked him after Jagdambika Pal claimed majority. Pal, however, was CM for just one day and Kalyan came back. However, his ties with then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee turned sour and he was sacked from the party in 1999. He returned to the party in 2004, but left again in 2009. After Modi became PM, he joined BJP again and was appointed Rajasthan governor. In September 2019, he was brought to trial in the Babri demolition conspiracy case, but was acquitted in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kalyan-singh-up-cm-when-babri-came-down-dead/articleshow/85528062.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Kolkata||CPM Kolkata suspends Anil Biswas’s daughter Ajanta Biswas for 6 months||KOLKATA: The CPM’s Kolkata district committee on Saturday suspended for six months former state party secretary Anil Biswas’s daughter Ajanta Biswas, whose four-part article appeared in Trinamool Congress mouthpiece ‘Jago Bangla’. Most members of the district committee stuck to the CPM area committee’s recommendations for college and university teachers under the Kolkata unit that proposed a six-month suspension for Ajanta, a Rabindra Bharati University associate professor. They ignored a CPM district secretariat proposal to bring down the suspension to three months. Biswas faced the fiercest criticism from her own ilk — college and university teachers such as Keshab Bhattacharya. Some CPM leaders like Koninika Ghosh argued for the three-month suspension despite her strong criticism on the “content of the article” and its publication in a Trinamool daily. A section of leaders wondered how the CPM Kolkata committee could take the disciplinary step when the party’s central committee had announced the schedule of conferences leading to the party congress. They argued that the CPM constitution didn’t allow disciplinary action against a party member once the schedule was announced. However, a senior Kolkata leader pointed out that the cut-off date for keeping all things on hold was August 25 and the action was taken within that deadline. Ajanta, in her four-part article, wrote about prominent women participants in Bengal politics, including Basanti Devi, Sarojini Naidu, Suniti Devi and Mamata Banerjee. She wrote at length about Banerjee’s political career and termed the movement in Singur as “gana bikhobh (mass movement)”, raising eyebrows. CPM leaders held that the views expressed were not in sync with the party line. The CPM area committee served her a show-cause notice. In her reply, Ajanta reasoned that the series provided a historical perspective of women leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cpm-suspends-anil-daughter-for-6-months-over-article-in-tmc-daily/articleshow/85525166.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Dilip rakes up separate province issue, TMC calls it ‘hypocrisy’||Jalpaiguri: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Saturday stoked sentiments for a separate province in north Bengal and said the Trinamool Congress government would be responsible if such a demand arose. Calling his statement hypocritical, the Trinamool asked that if this was the BJP party stand, why did it remain silent on the issue during the assembly polls. Speaking at a Shahid Samman Yatra programme in Jalpaiguri, Ghosh said: “The backward classes, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in north Bengal and Jangalmahal have been deprived for the past 75 years. The Mamata Banerjee government will remain responsible if someone raises a separate province demand in north Bengal.” The state BJP chief was flanked by John Barla who had voiced the same demand before he became a junior Union minister. Ghosh pointed out that the Narendra Modi government at the Centre was the first to honour the underprivileged backward people and induct their representatives. “He (Barla) cannot be labelled as a separatist for voicing the concerns of his people,” Ghosh said, adding that since the people had voted for Barla, “he has to listen to what they say and be mindful of their demand”. Reacting strongly to the statements, Trinamool state general secretary Kunal Ghosh sought to know why the demand for a separate Union Territory was not raised during the assembly polls. “Why didn’t Dilipbabu or the other leaders of the party, including heavyweights from Delhi, speak on the same lines during their campaign? Why this hypocrisy? Had the BJP aired such views back then, voters of Bengal would have been aware about its stand.” Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha chief whip Sukhendu Sekhar Ray said: “The BJP is encouraging fissiparous elements to divide Bengal after suffering a humiliating defeat in the recent assembly elections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dilip-rakes-up-separate-province-issue-tmc-calls-it-hypocrisy/articleshow/85525319.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

That’s what his organisation offered then and he happily took the time off to be with his wife and daughter. What would Rajiv do if he was offered a month’s paternity leave? “I would not skip work for that long. Maybe I would take the leave in a staggered manner over a period of time. What I have generally seen is that men do not take this long a leave — it’s a mindset issue that the workplace may or may not appreciate someone taking such a long time away from work,” says Kunnekat. There’s a growing number of companies offering a gender-neutral parental leave policy that encourages men to share child-care duties with their partners. While that’s a progressive move, not many men are going for it. Most are hesitant to take the entire leave in one go fearing an adverse impact on their career. Cyient, a global engineering, manufacturing, and digital technology solutions company, recently announced a gender-neutral 12-week parental leave policy. Krishna Bodanapu, MD & CEO, Cyient, said they wanted to make parental leave equitable and inclusive, which will help boost diversity. Bodanapu says Cyient encourages men to participate more actively in parenting. “Unfortunately, our social fabric has conditioned men to play a limited role in the early months of parenting. Earlier, I don’t think men took even the one-week paternity leave that was offered to them due to the apprehensions of being disadvantaged at the workplace. This policy is really about equitable parenthood that isn’t restricted by genes, gender, or geography,” says Bodanapu. Experts believe most new fathers would like to take time off. But it’s another matter that even while on paternity leave, men may be glued to their phones and laptops for work. During the pandemic, a professional who had just become a father, put out a post on LinkedIn to show how, thanks to the “work from anywhere” culture, he has been able to be with his wife and the newborn while working at the same time. The picture he posted with his laptop beside the hospital bed was liked by many. However, what everyone missed was that the person was “working” at a time when he should be on paternity leave. Nirmala Menon, CEO, Interweave Consulting, a diversity consulting firm, says: “Companies began giving longer periods of time off, including some of them making it equal to maternity leave, just recently. A few years ago, even if the company offered longer paternity leaves, most dads didn’t use it fully. It would be interesting to see how many men use it fully now. My sense is that it will become more common for men to take time off for their children. With more women working and in nuclear homes, it is a clear expectation that their partners will contribute equally. My guess is that while women will use maternity leave at one stretch, men are more likely to take it in installments over the first year of the child.” In several companies, parental leave can be availed by new fathers anytime within a year of becoming a parent. Diageo India, for instance, introduced a policy that is applicable to all new parents and can be availed by new fathers anytime within 12 months of the birth/ adoption of the child, thereby allowing the mother to better manage her career as well as other priorities. Allowing women to better manage their careers is key as studies have revealed that such policies aid women workers in their careers. Maternity and child care is one of the key reasons why women drop off the workforce, and if organisations want to retain their women's talent enabling men to take the time off and share child care responsibilities would be crucial. Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg had famously taken two months of parental leave on the birth of his first daughter.

Many of the stakeholders who participated in the discussion felt that online classes were not benefiting majority of the students because of limited access to learning platforms. The panel was chaired by Rajendra Sathe, who is the chairman of Asha workers Association. Sathe said that online classes have led to major health issues too as screen time for students has increased. Professor Rahul Moon, coordinator of Samvidhan Pariwar, said that 70% of students have been affected in a negative way due to online classes. Professor Manohar Tambulkar said that education cannot be considered as complete unless teacher and students are back in classrooms. One of the panellists, Krishna Yerawar, said they have noticed that overall students have become “dull” due to online classes as not much supervision is possible. Everyone is being passed in exams, which, Anil Imalkar felt, was unfair to those who had studied sincerely. The panel resolved to approach public representatives over the issue and lobby for reopening of schools wherever it is safe to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/samvidhan-parivar-holds-panel-discussion-on-school-reopening/articleshow/85537364.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Business||Caution ahead: Markets may descend peaks||MUMBAI: Leading indices have been scaling fresh highs on a regular basis. This is luring hordes of new investors to enter the stock market, expecting to make some quick gains. Behind the euphoria, however, there are chances that this feel-good-situation may not last long and inexperienced investors may have to face tough times. Seasoned financial planners are advising clients to slowly shift their equity portfolio, at least a part of it, towards debt. “Inexperienced retail investors always want to extract everything from the markets, which finally becomes their undoing — timing the market by trying to get in at the bottom and get out at the very top — can rarely happen, except by fluke,” said Sanjeev Govila, founder, Hum Fauji Initiatives, a financial planning & advisory services that caters to armed forces. Leave something on the table, is Govila’s advice to clients. For example, in the current over-exuberant times, lay down a reasonable limit for yourself and start paring your equity exposure unmindful of where anybody else expects the markets to go. “If you try to take everything off the table, you will perforce have to take the big downside also with you which will come swiftly and unexpectedly.” Govila wants investors to move their funds into less volatile fixed income assets rather than stay invested in equities and incur losses in case the market enters into some strong corrective phase. There are some reasons for financial advisers and market veterans to expect a correction during this ongoing bull rally. For one, the US central bank has been pumping in money into the global economy since the time the current pandemic started. Most of the major central banks around the world are also following the same path, trying to support their country’s struggling economy back on track through fund infusion. But lately there are increasing signs that the rate of inflation is rising, which is forcing central banks to slow down fund infusions. “How long can they (the central banks) support the market? There should be some end to the liquidity infusion process,” Govila said. Experienced investors, taking the mutual fund route, however, could relax a bit. According to financial planners, those who are invested in equity mutual funds through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route, they need not take money out of the market now, unless they need money for some reason. According to them, SIPs help investors to average out the cost of acquisition of mutual funds units. So if the market falls and the net asset value of the fund the investor is invested in also falls, the investor stands to gain more units of the same fund for the same amount of monthly SIP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/caution-ahead-markets-may-descend-peaks/articleshow/85528162.cms||Partha Sinha

On Friday, the regulator put on hold the processing of papers relating to the company’s listing plans. On its website, it was marked “Issuance of observations kept in abeyance,” but did not mention any reason for the same. The company, which owns popular FMCG brand Fortune, had filed its offer document with Sebi on August 3 and is planning to raise Rs 4,500 crore. Usually, the regulator takes such a step when a group company is under investigation by the regulator or it receives any letter from any other regulator. A couple of months ago, Sebi told the Lok Sabha that it was investigating investments by some Mauritius-based foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) into six Adani group entities. Last month Sebi had also put on hold processing of two other IPOs: One by Aditya Birla Mutual Fund and the other by GoAir. In both the cases Sebi was investigating group companies of these two entities. Since then, the IPO document of the fund house has been cleared while that of the airline is still on hold. “We have not received any formal communication from Sebi with respect to the IPO observations being kept in abeyance,” a spokesperson for the group said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-message-from-sebi-on-wilmar-ipo-adani-group/articleshow/85528189.cms||---
---||Business||Insurance as % of GDP spikes||MUMBAI: The pandemic has increased the potential for health and life insurance in India. According to Swiss Re’s Sigma report on World Insurance, insurance contribution to GDP has risen to 4.2% in FY21 from 3.76% in FY20. Insurance penetration (premium as a percentage of GDP) for both life and non-life insurance has seen an increase during the pandemic. While life penetration has increased from 2.8% to 3.2%, the non-life play has increased to 1% from 0.94% last year. In non-life, India’s ranking has improved by one place despite premium shrinking in dollar terms. This is because Brazil, which was in 13th place, slipped sharply as its business shrunk 20% in dollar terms. According to the survey, many feel underinsured, despite most owning medical and life insurance. Between 30% and 40% of the respondents purchased additional life and health insurance during the crisis, and 25-50% still intend to buy new policies. “The intent was higher in emerging Asia (56%), particularly India, Vietnam and China (70%) versus advanced Asia (average: 20%),” Swiss Re said. The improved prospects for insurance are also reflected in the performance of nonlife during the first quarter. Non-life insurers have registered a 14% growth in gross premium during the first quarter as demand for health insurance increased during the deadly second wave of Covid. Nonlife companies registered premium collections wroth Rs 44,434 crore in the first quarter of FY22 as compared to Rs 39,054 crore in FY21. The trend has continued in July after the second wave subsided. According to a report by ICICI Securities, health insurance premiums at the industry level in July ’21 grew by a strong 43% year on year and 25% month on month. Fire insurance premium too staged robust 20% year-on-year while motor grew 9% over last year in July. The increase in insurance penetration bodes well for the government’s disinvestment programme. India ranks 10th in life insurance and 14th in non-life. Despite the insurance market being small relative to GDP, it is seen as having huge potential.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insurance-as-of-gdp-spikes/articleshow/85528200.cms||---

The listing of LIC would result in listed entities accounting for 60% of the insurance business. Amit Agarwal, additional secretary in the finance ministry said: “We have for the first time an opportunity to attract and leverage large amounts of risk capital, in a traditionally capital-scarce economy for enabling faster growth in the risk intensive insurance sector. Agarwal said that in the two decades after opening up the industry has matured with 69 insurers as against eight in 2,000 and a majority have achieved break-even. Noting that there were over 3,000 insurance products in the market as a result of competition, Agarwal said that such a wide array of offerings is not best suited for meeting the basic insurance needs of the masses who need products that are easy to understand and simple in terms of clean procedures. He called upon actuaries to come up with meaningful ways of assessing risk to develop simplified products at affordable prices suitable for the masses. “Such simplification necessarily entails venturing out of the comfort zone of known data. The necessary allowance for risk on account of poor data may be offset to some extent by economies of scale and leveraging lower costs and access to digital channels and bancassurance,” said Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/markets-not-promoters-to-bring-capital-to-insurers/articleshow/85528223.cms||---

Propelled in part by surging demand during the pandemic, people spent more than $610 billion on Amazon over the 12 months ending in June, according to Wall Street estimates compiled by the financial research firm FactSet. Walmart on Tuesday posted sales of $566 billion for the 12 months ending in July. Alibaba, the giant online Chinese retailer, is the world’s top seller. Neither Amazon nor Walmart is a dominant player in China. In racing past Walmart, Amazon has dethroned one of the most successful — and feared — companies of recent decades. Walmart perfected a thriving big-box model of retailing that squeezed every possible penny out of its costs, which drove down prices and vanquished competitors. But even with all of that efficiency and power, the quest to dominate today’s retail environment is being won on the internet. And no company has taken better advantage of that than Amazon. Indeed, the company’s delivery (many items land on doorsteps in a day or two) and wide selection first drew customers to online shopping, and it has kept them buying more there ever since. It has also made Jeff Bezos, the company’s founder, one of the richest people in the world. “It is a historic moment,” said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of the Marketplace Pulse, a research company. “Walmart has been around for so long, and now Amazon comes around with a different model and replaces them as a No.1.” Wall Street firms had been expecting this retail baton to change hands in the coming years. But the pandemic accelerated the timeline, as people stuck at home relied on deliveries. Walmart’s sales rose sharply during the pandemic, but it has not matched Amazon, which has added hundreds of warehouses and hired about 500,000 workers since the start of last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/brick-vs-e-order-people-now-spend-more-at-amazon-than-at-walmart/articleshow/85528238.cms||---

Despite weekend curfew, scores of his supporters gathered outside the jail to greet him, violating Covid-19 safety rules. A garland of apples weighing about 50kg was prepared for Kulkarni and firecrackers were set off the moment he stepped out of the jail premises. The CBI had arrested Kulkarni over the murder of Dharwad zilla panchayat member Yogeshgouda Goudar, accusing him of plotting the crime. He had been lodged in the Hindalga prison since November 5 last year. Recently, the court gave him bail. On Saturday, Kulkarni told reporters that his ninemonth stay in jail had brought many changes in him, describing it as a learning experience. He said that he had faith in the judiciary and would come out clean. Congress MLA Lakshmi Hebbalkar came to receive him. “I have come to see my brother, who has been my guiding force. I was missing him,” she said. She tied a rakhi on Kulkarni’s wrist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-ex-minister-vinay-kulkarnis-supporters-flout-norms/articleshow/85528263.cms||---

The order says that the land will be granted on a nominal ground rent of Rs 10 per kanal on annual basis. “Sanction is hereby accorded to the grant of land measuring 25 kanal situated at village Panthachowk, Tehsil Panthachowk, District Srinagar as per description at Annexure 'A' in favour of Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) for construction of Office and Yatri Niwas on lease basıs for a period of 40 years from the date of taking over the possession on payment of nominal ground rent of Rs 10/- per kanal per annum without charge of any premium subject to the condition that the land shall be used only for the purpose for which it is granted,” the orders said. The order also said that the allotment, lease shall be governed under the J&K Land Grants Act, 1960. The order further says that the deputy commissioner, Srinagar, shall sign the lease agreement on behalf of the government. In 2008, the Gulam Nabi Azad-led government in J&K had granted permission to the SASB to construct a concrete path to the holy cave of Amarnath, which was opposed by the PDP. The Hurriyat leadership had even set in motion an agitation opposing this decision. The PDP did not stop there; Mehbooba Mufti pulled out of the Congress-PDP government, leading to the resignation of Gulam Nabi Azad as the CM in 2008. The then governor, NN Vohra, withdrew the order later. Yatri Niwas to accommodate 3,000 pilgrimsManoj Sinha, chairman of the SASB, had earlier this month said the new facility would be built at Panthachowk in Srinagar within 18 months. The Yatri Niwas is designed to accommodate more than 3,000 pilgrims. “It will also act as an Information Centre for the guidance of pilgrims, besides many similar works would be completed for smooth conduct of the yatra,” Sinha had then said. The government of J&K, he said, is initiating various services, along with the infrastructural development to provide a memorable experience to millions of devotees of Shri Amarnathji. “We are planning to construct Yatri Niwas in various parts of the UT, besides a permanent office. A bigger Yatri Niwas will soon come up at Jammu to facilitate a large number of visiting devotees. Another Yatri Niwas with a capacity to accommodate 3,200 yatris is coming up at Chanderkote, in Ramban. With modern facilities and a conducive environment being created, the day is not far when the yatris visiting Shri Amarnathji shrine would cross the 10 lakh mark, which will make a great impact on the economy of J&K,” Sinha had then said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/l-g-allots-3-5-acres-for-yatri-niwas-in-srinagar/articleshow/85528280.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The deceased youths have been identified as Mohammad Shahnawaz (18), his elder brother Mohammad Sajjad (28) and their cousin Mohammad Niyaz (30). Their other cousin Mohammad Tammanah (23) is critically injured. All of them are natives of Malmal under Kaluahi police station area but were settled in Mumbai with family and parents. They had reached village hardly a few days back to observe Muharram. Kaluahi police station SHO Rajkumar Mandal said that all four were travelling on a bike without helmet and were going to Haripur Kazi tola where their maternal family lives. He said the accident spot is hardly a kilometre away from the tola. “Probably they lost control over the bike due to high speed and it rammed a stationary truck from behind which was parked on the side of the national highway,” SHO said. Mandal said that the trio died immediately on the spot due to severe head injuries. He said even after such a situation all four were rushed to a nearby primary health centre where doctors gave initial treatment to Tamannah and referred him to a higher centre looking at his situation. “Their fathers have denied getting post-mortems conducted. Police along with circle officer had visited their residence on Saturday morning too, to make them understand that post-mortem and an FIR was necessary for disbursal of ex-gratia. But they have denied,” he said. He said that at present, a station diary entry would be made for the death and if the family members agree for a FIR, then it would be registered afterwards for further investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/three-brothers-killed-another-injured-as-bike-ram-stationary-truck-in-madhubani/articleshow/85528315.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: How these three children utilised pandemic period to set records||BENGALURU: Three city kids have achieved incredible feats during the pandemic. D Harekrishna Patro has earned a spot in the Asia Book of Records for “maximum scientific names recited by a kid”, while Prisha Singh has made her way into the World Book of Records, UK, for memorising the capitals and currencies of 195 countries. Puli Srinitha has won a place in the International Book of Records for being “the fastest and youngest” to recite all the 118 periodic table elements in the shortest time (49 seconds). Harekrishna, 5, learned scientific names of fruits, vegetables, trees, animals, birds and so on through online classes — not of his own grade but of Std 10 and above. A student of Delhi Public School in Electronic City, Harekrishna used to listen to online classes conducted by his mother, M Sonom Patro, a chemistry and biology teacher at a different school. Puli Srinitha“One day, when I asked my students for the scientific name of mango, Hare answered from behind — Mangifera indica. I was shocked and amused. That’s when we decided to polish his talent,” she said. Sonam and her husband, D Lokraj Patro, a firmware engineer, explored options and saw their son setting a record for reciting a large number of scientific names in 2 minutes and 15 seconds. Now, Harekrishna rarely uses the original names, calling pigeons, his koala toy and neighbourhood cat by their scientific terms. He loves animals. “I don’t like hunters and poachers,” said the young boy, who wants to become an air force officer. Harekrishna PatroSeven-yearold Prisha, a student of Stella Maris School in Vyalikaval, recited the capitals and currencies of 195 countries within 7 minutes and 43 seconds, an achievement that was recognised by the World Book of Record, UK, and the Asia Book of Records. Her parents, Sneha and Prashant Singh, both engineers, discovered her talent when she was just five years old and memorised the states and capitals of India. They applied to get her mentioned in various record books. Prisha later won a spot in each of them. Prisha said she could pull this off easily because her mind worked like a computer, learning everything quickly. “Of all the countries I have studied, Malaysia is my favourite because it is so beautiful,” she said. She wants to go to NASA and become an astronaut. “It would be great to see all the countries I have read about from space,” Prisha said. Four-year-old Srinitha became interested in elements and chemistry after her parents frequently asked her to eat eggs, saying they contained calcium. She kept learning and improving, and in July, she became the fastest and youngest to state all the 118 elements in the periodic table in 49 seconds. Various organisations, including the International Book of Records, Golden Book of World Records and India Book of Records, acknowledged her feat. Her father Puli Satyanarayana’s interest in the subject also encouraged her to learn how to pronounce difficult terms. “I was always interested in chemistry and I would keep speaking out the names to myself. Srinitha kept observing and one morning, she began saying them as well. It took her just a month to perfect the pronunciations,” said the proud father, who is a manager at BHEL. Srinitha, who is also into sports, kept practising the names while playing badminton with her father. Her father and mother Puli Archana, a homemaker, would patiently answer all her questions and explain with examples until she was satisfied. Though it began as just an activity for Srinitha, Satyanarayana said that they did not expect records. “Now, she wants to bag a gold medal,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-how-these-three-children-utilised-pandemic-period-to-set-records/articleshow/85528305.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Chandigarh||‘Last scheduled flights to Kabul met with ATC’s radio slience’||Chandigarh: Air India Delhi-Kabul flight AI 243 last Sunday — among the last scheduled commercial services to the Kabul airport before the city fell to Taliban — was met with radio silence on approach. Piloted by Captains Aditya Chopra and Ashutosh Ahlawat, the Airbus A320 with 40 passengers on board kept hovering around the besieged city while waiting for clearance to land from the air traffic control (ATC). An Emirates Boeing 777 from Dubai was also holding at 28,000 ft near Kabul around the same time. It headed back to the UAE without landing in Kabul. Sources say the crew on board was unaware of the events unfolding on the ground. “When the aircraft was holding over Kabul, the ATC stopped responding. It was not before well over an hour that the crew was given the go-ahead to land,” say sources. “Possibly there were no air traffic controllers at Kabul ATC at that time. The pilots had no clue what to do and where to go. Since the approach to Kabul is busy, they had to be vigilant for other aircrafts amid the ATC’s radio silence,” say sources. AI 243 finally landed in Kabul after 2 hours and 13 minutes at 1.33 pm (local Kabul time). An event-free flight takes just under an hour. The Indian Commercial Pilots Association, union of erstwhile Indian Airlines pilots, has applauded the crew operating AI 243/244 last Sunday. “We salute the dedication of our Air India of AI 243 (Captains Aditya Chopra and Ashutosh Ahlawat), who went beyond the line of duty, amidst tension and turmoil to bring our citizens back home safely from Kabul. Jai Hind,” it had tweeted. The 162-seater A320 was fully booked on the return flight to Delhi as AI 244. But only 129 passengers managed to reach the airport. This was possibly the last scheduled flights out of Kabul. AI was the only Indian carrier with scheduled flights to Kabul. The next day, non-defence aircraft were barred from Afghan airspace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/last-scheduled-flights-to-kabul-met-with-atcs-radio-slience/articleshow/85524712.cms||---

With way things are going in their country, some fear that they might not get visa extensions. 30-year-old S Mujadidi, who started his PhD in Punjabi University in 2019, said: "My study visa is getting expired in December this year. I am getting monthly stipend under the scholarship programme. So, I am concerned about the extension of the visa. My parents were earlier expecting me to return home, but now they are asking me not to return till the situation gets better in Afghanistan. They feel at least I am safe in Punjab." There are around 40 students in the Punjabi University who are Afghan nationals. Seven of these are living inside the campus, but the others have preferred to stay outside university campus. Like Abdul H S, who is living with his wife and two kids and pursuing his PhD. Abdul started his PhD in 2019 and is expecting to complete it in the next two to three years, his visa too expires soon. According to Prof Ranjit Kaur, dean of directorate international affairs at Punjabi University, most of the students’ visa validity is till December this year. “This year, around 70 more Afghan nationals, including 15 women and 55 men have taken admission in our university, but their visas are awaited. It is now up to the government of India to decide on their visas and scholarships. We will definitely write to the Union government over this matter,” she added. Punjabi University vice-chancellor Prof Arvind also met the Afghan students and assured them of all possible help. The situation is similar in Central University of Punjab (CUPB) in Bathinda. The remaining 10 Afghan students there are also worried about visa extension, ICCR scholarship and hostel accommodation. In all, 16 students were studying at CUPB and according to the university authorities, six students had gone back home to Afghanistan during semester break and failed to return. Apart from them, 11 students from Afghanistan have taken admissions in CUPB in 2021-22, but they are still are in Afghanistan. University vice-chancellor Prof Raghavendra Tiwari and dean of student welfare Vinod K Garg met the Afghan students on Saturday to address their worries. Prof Tiwari said the university is with the students during this tough time. Prof Garg also said all possible help will be provided to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/afghan-students-worried-about-extension-of-study-visas-scholarships/articleshow/85524812.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||India||When India got freedom but didn’t know what its boundaries were||On the midnight of August 15, 1947, we knew that India had kept its tryst with destiny, we knew that the subcontinent had been divided, that we were now two countries, India and Pakistan, but what we didn’t know was where India ended and Pakistan began. The boundary lines were still unknown. That had been Viceroy Lord Mountbatten’s idea. He didn’t want the celebrations to be marred by recriminations on both sides. As if that was possible. The British had long lost the opportunity for a peaceful and orderly handover of power. With the failure of the 1942 Cripps’ mission and then the three-member 1946 Cabinet delegation (with Sir Stafford Cripps playing the key role again), partition was inevitable. But how do you divide a subcontinent? Drawing the line was never going to be easy. The man chosen for the task was Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a man who hadn’t travelled further east than the Gibraltar. But it fell on this 48-year-old Inner Temple barrister to do this impossible task — and that, too, in just five weeks. While Radcliffe may have known little or nothing of India, he was, after all, the ultimate establishment man, which is probably why he was picked for the job. He had studied at Haileybury (Clement Attlee, the British Prime Minister then, also went to the same school) and then Oxford. After that he had a brilliant career as a barrister. During the war, he had been director-general in the ministry of information, responsible for censorship and propaganda. It was Radcliffe who had run a campaign against Nehru’s sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit when she visited the United States. Radcliffe had also harassed P.G. Wodehouse ‘when he made ill-judged broadcasts while in German captivity’, wrote Patrick French. So, the Establishment Man reached India and began work as a ‘neutral umpire’ in New Delhi on July 8. He would live separately, guarded by a massive Punjabi armed with two pistols. He would take his own decisions; no one would be around to influence him. But it wasn’t such a secluded existence for Radcliffe, after all. He dined with British military commander Claude Auchinleck (maybe the Auk needed consoling; his wife had run away with his friend), Lord Mountbatten, Punjab Governor Sir Evan Jenkins and many other members of the British high society. It’s hard to believe that Radcliffe did not discuss the boundary issue with the others who all knew much more about India than he did. But more than anything else, Radcliffe had a cheat sheet. In February 1946, the ever-underrated Archibald Wavell, the viceroy Attlee unceremoniously sacked while sending in Mountbatten, had drawn up a contingency plan. Wavell knew what was coming. And he understood the need for a wellthought-out boundary line. Helping him were Reforms Commissioner V.P. Menon and Sir Benegal Rau. So, what did Radcliffe have to go with? Maybe some advice from veterans, Wavell’s map, and outdated census data. And with this he had to divide a subcontinent in 36 days. Its people, villages, rivers, canals, roads. And to compound matters, the weather was frightfully hot, and Radcliffe came down with a bout of dysentery. Seventy-four years later, it might be easy to say, ‘Poor fellow, he was only a lawyer with a brief; what more could he possibly have done?’ But in 1947, everything hinged on this lawyer and his brief. Would he award Gurdaspur to India or Pakistan? Would he really award a part of Ferozepur to Pakistan, so that it had better control over its water supply? In fact, he almost gave away a part of Ferozepur to Pakistan. In the first week of August, during a lunch with his commissioners at a club in Simla, he said he would give Pakistan a part of Ferozepur because India was getting Gurdaspur. But that was not to be. When word got out, there was frenzied behind-the-scenes activity that made the ‘neutral umpire’ change his mind — and the boundary line — within days. He handed over all the Awards to Mountbatten on August 13, but Mountbatten ruled that the Awards would not be made public till August 16. So, on August 15 a free India still did not know its exact boundaries. When at 5pm, on August 16, Liaqat Ali Khan, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Baldev Singh gathered in the Council Chamber of Government House, three hours after the Awards had been sent to them, no one looked happy. It would be months before things settled down. For the moment, freedom had arrived, and with it the horrors of Partition. For Radcliffe, it was time to go home. He boarded a flight out on August 17. He never came back. Later, when a reporter asked him if he would ever like to visit India, he said: ‘God forbid. Not even if they asked me. I suspect they would shoot me out of hand — both sides.’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/when-india-got-freedom-but-didnt-know-what-its-boundaries-were/articleshow/85528435.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Taliban crisis leads to spike in dry fruits prices||AMRITSAR: With the Taliban sealing land border trade routes resulting in a halt of import-export trade with India, prices of dry fruits have gone up by 15-20% here that is likely to shoot up more in the wake of the ensuing festive and winter season if the trade doesn’t commence soon. However, importers here are of the view that suspension of trade was a temporary phase and the import-export will resume in next few days time. While talking to TOI on Thursday B K Bajaj, president of Indo Foreign Chamber of Commerce (IFCC). said, “The suspension of import and export between India and Afghanistan is a temporary thing and the trade will resume within next week or 10 days.” The increase in prices of dry fruits was expected under such circumstances that was a normal practice, he reasoned, adding that dry fruits were a luxury items and not essential commodities. The annual import-export trade between the two countries was $1.3 billion that included $80 million of export to Afghanistan while $500 million trade was held through Integrated Check Post (ICP), Attari, said the IFCC president. Echoing similar sentiments, Anil Mehra, president of Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Commercial Association, said, “This is a temporary phase. The new crop is lying in Afghanistan and it’s a perishable item, they have to export it.” He added that for now the Taliban were in process of forming their government and in much likelihood, they could impose some taxes that would be revealed soon. When asked about the rise in dry fruit price, he said a few businessmen might have increased their stock price by 15-20%, but the stock was very limited and wouldn’t last long. On August 16 , eight truckload of goods including dry fruits, grapes and mulethi had arrived at ICP Attari from Afghanistan. “In my opinion, the goods will start arriving from Afghanistan in a few days time,” said Mehra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/taliban-crisis-leads-to-spike-in-dry-fruits-prices/articleshow/85524974.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The committee has been asked to file its report within three months. The NGT set up the panel in response to a petition filed by the Saviour Park Apartment Owners Association in Ghaziabad, which alleged that the necessary environmental clearances were not taken for the project The petition in the green tribunal claims the developer built 1,102 units against the 980 units sanctioned and groundwater was harnessed during construction when the rules clearly state that only water from a sewage treatment plant (STP) can be used for the purpose. “The project proponent dug several groundwater extraction borewells to use fresh water in the construction process as well as for drinking purposes without requisite NOC (no-objection certificate) from Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA),” the petition claims. The NGT bench led by chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed senior environment ministry and pollution control board officials to conduct an audit of the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) to find out how frequently such violations are taking place. It directed the committee to visit the site and interact with stakeholders to verify the status of compliance. Based on the findings, statutory authorities may take remedial action, including stopping creation of third-party rights and further construction activity if laws are found to have been ciolated, the tribunal said. Iqbal Singh Sodhi of Savfab Buildtech, the developer of the society, told TOI, “The map has been sanctioned by the Ghaziabad Development Authority and the project is registered with UP-Rera. Had there been violations, it is for the competent authority to take actions against us. We have applied with relevant departments seeking permission for use of groundwater.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/ngt-forms-panel-with-officials-to-check-building-sites-for-violations/articleshow/85525298.cms||Abhijay Jha

The LED lights have not only made the lighting system smarter and more efficient but also the commute of working women in the city safe after dark, officials have said. Noida Authority’s chief general manager Rajeev Tyagi said, “We have installed over a lakh LED lights across the city over the past three years. It is an achievement which no other civic body or municipal corporation has attained in the state. Though it has helped people from all sections, lit up streets were required particularly within the industrial sectors to make the day-to-day commute of the working women safe.” Sharing details, the Authority officials said that so far 1,02,519 LED lights have been installed in the city. Among them 18,965 have been set up within the urban villages, while 13,000 have been installed in the sectors dominated by industrial units. The remaining have been set up within the residential blocks. In July 2018, the Authority tied up with a subsidiary of the Tata Group to replace all the solar lamps and traditional tube lights with light emitting diodes. The Authority officials said that a central controlling system has also been set up that relays information about dysfunctional lights on a real-time basis. Swati Shukla, who stays in Sector 128, said, “From the time we got the option of working from home, I started going out for evening walks. Earlier the roads outside our society were dark. But now they are properly lit up” The officials said they have taken extra care to make the bus stops and crossings safer. “We have coordinated with the police department to increase vigil around areas that are getting developed during the night. 7X sectors is one cluster where police patrolling has been beefed up during the night,” Tyagi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-roads-now-lit-up-by-1-lakh-led-lamps/articleshow/85525349.cms||---

The power transmission wing now plans to complete the substation work by November this year instead of its earlier deadline of December 2021. For this, additional manpower has been deployed on the site. The substation is being built in Sector 32, 7 km from the upcoming airport at Jewar, at a cost of Rs 70 crore. Puneet Gupta, superintending engineer (Transmission) UPPTCL, said, “With development around the airport project gaining momentum, we too have expedited work on the 220 KV substation and plan to complete the work by November end. For this, we have deployed 50-70 additional labour an the work has been expedited.” He added that work got delayed due to the pandemic and the monsoon, but they have now managed to procure parts from China. “We aim to complete the substation by November 15 and have kept 15 days for trial and testing,” Gupta added. The substation will cater to the airport area as well as the rural belt surrounding Jewar, Rabupura, Dankaur and sectors 32, 33, 34 of YEIDA. While 5 acres have been given by YEIDA for the substation, an additional 5 acres have been sanctioned for another 400 KV substation to come up in the region in the next five years. YEIDA CEO Arun Vir Singh said that the second substation was necessary considering the industrial load of 192 MW and Jewar airport load of 107 MW expected by 2040.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/220kv-substation-at-jewar-to-be-ready-by-november-end/articleshow/85525383.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The man has been identified as Vipin Kumar (52), a resident of Noornagar in Hapur district. He was accused of murdering his granddaughter and sister-in-law in 2017. “Around 3 pm on Saturday, Kumar’s body was found hanging in the washroom of his cell. He had fastened his noose from a piece of cloth and hung himself from the washroom’s window,” said a jail official. “After coming from a court hearing on August 19, he stayed aloof.

Police have also confiscated two Pakistan-made plastic pipes that the smugglers used to slide the neatly-tied packets of contraband into Indian territory. Despite heavy deployment of personnel at the international border, Pakistan based smugglers continue to push in arms, ammunition and narcotics into Punjab, taking advantage of the chinks in the international border with Pakistan and by using drones. Vehicles used by smugglers impounded, manhunt onThe operation targeting the smugglers was conducted early morning by senior superintendent of police Amritsar (rural) Gulneet Singh Khurana along with the BSF, following inputs that one Nirmal Singh Sonu, a notorious smuggler of Gharinda area, was attempting to push in heroin through the Indo-Pakistan border. The police have also impounded a motorcycle and another two-wheeler belonging to the smugglers. “They have launched a massive manhunt for Sonu, who is also wanted by the Tarn Taran police in case of 1kg heroin recovery in 2020,” said Khurana. Sharing the smugglers’ modus operandi, the SSP said they used plastic pipes to get the heroin across the border fence. He said that a FIR under sections of the NDPS Act, Foreigners Act and Indian Passport Act has been registered at Police Station Ramdas, Amritsar. Meanwhile, Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said in a press statement that a team, comprising DSP (investigation) Gurinderpal Singh and Ajnala DSP Vipan Kumar, was collaborating with the BSF to nab the drug smugglers and seize heroin.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab vigilance bureau to file recall plea against HC order for Sumedh Singh Saini’s release||CHANDIGARH: Punjab vigilance bureau has decided to file a recall petition in the high court against the August 19 order that released former state police chief Sumedh Singh Saini from detention in a land fraud case. The bureau will also move against the high court’s interim bail order to Saini on August 12 in the disproportionate assets case against the former DGP. Saini was arrested on August 18 in the land fraud case at the vigilance bureau office in Mohali. He had gone there in accordance with the high court order awarding him interim bail subject to him joining the investigation in FIR number 13 within seven days of the grant of bail. In its order dated August 19, the HC had declared Saini’s detention “illegal in circumvented violation of protection orders dated October 11, 2018, and September 23, 2020, and interim anticipatory bail order dated August 12, 2021.” Ordering Saini’s interim bail, the HC had, on August 12, 2021, stated: “For joining loose ends, if any with regard to the documentary evidence or banking transactions, this court is of the opinion that custodial interrogation of the petitioner is not required. The petitioner is granted interim bail subject to his joining investigation within one week from today.” Pointing out that the former DGP had chosen to visit the office late in the evening on the last day of the sevenday period, an official spokesperson of the vigilance bureau said Saini had thus failed to follow the HC orders in letter and spirit. “Saini intentionally exhausted the 7-day period during which he had to join the investigation in accordance with the interim order in FIR number 13, and even then, he arrived at the Sector 68 Mohali office of the bureau without any prior intimation to the investigating officer (IO). In fact, he intentionally did not go to the office of IO VB, Unit SAS Nagar, Quarter No. 69, Police Housing Complex, Sector-62, SAS Nagar,” the spokesperson claimed. The bureau has now decided to file a petition in HC seeking the recall of its interim bail orders in the disproportionate assets case. The case relates to 35 properties and certain bank accounts of Nimratdeep XEN, with balance and transactions worth Rs 100 crores, including some in crores of rupees with Saini, leading to his undue enrichment, and exhibiting that he held assets far exceeding his income, the spokesperson added. Sufficient ground was also made out in the land fraud case for the state to seek recall of the HC orders releasing Saini from detention, the spokesperson said. Firstly, Saini had been taken into custody not under FIR 13 (where he had got interim bail) but in a case related to FIR 11 in which he had no protection from arrest. The criminal acts in FIR number 11 and FIR number 13 are different, he added. Secondly, the earlier protection orders of the HC, dated October 11, 2018, and September 23, 2020, do not apply to this particular case as those had provided for 7-day notice to be given to Saini before arresting him for any offences committed during his service period. Saini retired from service in June 2018 and the illegal land fraud case was related to 2021, so he was not protected from arrest without notice by the said orders, explained the spokesperson. The land fraud case relates to Saini allegedly conspiring with Surinderjit Singh Jaspal to forge a property purchase agreement. The bureau had charged Jaspal, who is the father of Nimratdeep, and Saini with conspiracy to prevent attachment of House 3048, Sector-20/D, Chandigarh, and had also accused them of creating a false agreement and using it as valuable security. Hence, the bureau has claimed that Jaspal and Saini had committed offences u/s 465, 467, 471 r/w 120-B IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-vigilance-bureau-to-file-recall-plea-against-hc-order-for-sumedh-singh-sainis-release/articleshow/85528544.cms||---
---||Goa||All for tradition: Goans pack coconuts to UK to break them||PANAJI: Goans who migrate to the UK after acquiring Portuguese citizenship usually don’t forget to pack their bags with plenty of sausages, bottles of feni and, if it’s season time, Mancurad mangoes. More recently, there’s yet another addition. Coconuts. It all started as a pastime during the ‘Konsachem Fest’ or the harvest feast—thanksgiving ritual where devotees pray for God’s continued blessings-—when traditionally people would indulge in breaking coconuts in an individual contest, with the winner taking home the coconut that he broke. But soon the stakes were raised, as bets were placed and coconut-breaking competitions held coinciding with the feast, even for Goans in the UK. Soon, coconuts with thicker shells were much in demand. “They are now doing this even in London and all of them take coconuts from here,” says Namdeo Kankonkar, winner of several coconut breaking competitions in the state. “I get many requests, but we are left with only one tree (that produces strong coconuts), unlike three in the past. There is not much I can do to help all my contacts.” Goa has approximately 25,000 hectares of coconut plantation and produces over 100 million coconuts a year. ‘Goans have done well to keep culture alive in UK’Thousands of Goans have migrated to the UK, making the best of Portuguese nationality law which states that those born in Goa before the Liberation, and their three generations, can acquire Portuguese citizenship. They are settled all across the UK with approximately 20,000 Goans living in Swindon alone. No surprise that the first coconut breaking competition was started in Swindon by Jesus Nazareth Boys of Siridao in 2007. “Goans have done well to keep this tradition alive here in the UK,” says Caetan Braganza, who added coconut breaking competition to other annual sports events like football and volleyball that he organised in memory of his brother Leo. “There are many who bring strong coconuts or ‘gott nall’ as they say in Konkani, from Goa, but these are used for individual contests and betting. When we organise a competition, we use coconuts available here in the UK,” he says. For 10 pounds (approximately Rs 1,000), participants are allowed to pick six coconuts of their choice from the pile placed at the venue. Each competitor then holds the coconut in his hand and smashes it against the one held by his opponent. As competitors get eliminated, the one with the maximum coconuts in the end is declared the winner. Last year, there was a complete halt to coconut breaking competitions in the UK due to Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. This year, though, competitions have already been held in Swindon, Wembley, Hounslow, Upton Park, Southall, Hayes and, for the first time, Reading. There will be more before the festival draws to a close on August 24. “We bought three bags of coconuts from the market and at the end of the day, there was nothing remaining. This was a good event. We had about 40 participants and families. Everyone had a good time,” says Milton Rodrigues of the East London Boys, who organised a competition in Upton Park early this week. Santa Cruz Boys had a competition of their own in Wembley on Friday. The tradition of harvest feast dates back to over 500 years, since March 1510 to be precise, but how and when the tradition of breaking coconuts started has not been documented. Whatever the reason, Goans love this tradition, whether they are at home or in the UK.

Fortunately, it was a weekend and there were no major snarls since traffic was lean. It drizzled early in the morning. Between 6am and 8.30am, light showers were reported. For an hour after that, it intensified, leading to apprehensions of flooding across residential areas. But even as the heavy showers continued in Delhi, they eased out in the city. The showers didn’t have an impact on the maximum temperature, which rose to 31.4 degrees Celsius compared to Friday’s 29 degrees Celsius. Saturday’s minimum temperature was 23.8 degrees Celsius, two notches below Friday’s minimum. Evening rains helped bring the mercury down. The city only received 39mm rain till 5.30pm on Saturday. This season, though, it has seen total rainfall of 474.2mm (since June 1), which is 30% more than the season’s normal of 363.5mm. Faridabad, which received 119mm rain in the last 24 hours, has cut its rain deficit from 28% to 8%. It has so far received 363mm rain. The season’s normal is 395.4 mm. According to the met department, light to very light rain accompanied by thunderstorms is likely to continue till Monday. “The intensity of rain is expected to decrease significantly from Sunday with isolated patchy rain to continue for the next two days. The monsoon trough is very likely to shift gradually northwards from August 23. The maximum temperature for the next two days is likely to hover around 31-32 degrees Celsius. Thereafter, it is expected to rise by 2-4 degrees Celsius,” said an IMD official. The morning spell of rain led to heavy waterlogging at IFFCO Chowk and near Huda City Centre metro station and parts of the expressway like Narsinghpur and the stretch near Artemis hospital. Two important arteries of the city – MG Road and Golf Course Road – were free from waterlogging, but sector roads leading to these thoroughfares were moderately inundated. All the underpasses of the city remained unaffected. IFFCO Chowk has, in fact, been getting waterlogged throughout this monsoon season. As a vital junction of the Jaipur highway and MG Road, IFFCO Chowk is one of the city’s nerve centres and a solution will need to be found quickly. Among other areas that saw waterlogging were Golf Course Road Extension, Bristol Chowk, MDI Chowk, Udyog Vihar, Galleria Market, AIT Chowk, Atul Kataria Chowk, sectors 51, 21, 22, 56, 3 and 5. Even the internal lanes and blocks of upscale colonies such as Suncity, DLF-4, Sushant Lok-1, among others, were inundated. Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer of GMDA, said, “GMDA’s officials were on the ground and monitoring the situation very closely. We have inspected most of the critical spots across the city. The dividing road of sectors 3 and 5 and a small passage from Rezangla Chowk to Sector 5 were moderately inundated but got cleared by afternoon. All the underpasses were clear and the national highway largely remained unaffected except the service road at Narsinghpur. We are examining the cause of waterlogging near IFFCO Chowk and Artemis Hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/showers-lighter-than-delhi-enough-to-flood-iffco-chowk-other-key-areas/articleshow/85525784.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||World||Taliban inherit untapped $1 trillion trove of minerals||PARIS: The Taliban now hold the keys to an untouched trillion-dollar trove of minerals including some that could power the world's transition to renewable energies, but Afghanistan has long struggled to tap its vast deposits. The Taliban are already in a financial bind since they returned to power 20 years after their ouster, as major aid donors halted their support for Afghanistan. Endless wars and poor infrastructure have prevented the country from getting its hands on the metals that could brighten its economic fortunes. The resources include bauxite, copper, iron ore, lithium and rare earths, according to a January report by the US Geological Survey (USGS). Copper, which is needed to make power cables, became a hot commodity this year as prices soared to more than $10,000 per tonne. Lithium is a crucial element to make electric car batteries, solar panels and wind farms. World demand for lithium is expected to grow by over 40 times by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. And Afghanistan "sits on a huge reserve of lithium that has not been tapped to this day," said Guillaume Pitron, author of the book "The Rare Metals War". Afghanistan is also home to rare earths that are used in the clean energy sector: Neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium. The country's untapped mineral riches have been estimated at $1 trillion by the USGS, though Afghan officials have put it three times as high. Afghanistan has done better digging for precious stones such as emeralds and rubies as well as semi-precious tourmaline and lapis lazuli, but the business is plagued with illegal smuggling to Pakistan. The country also mines for talc, marble, coal and iron. While the Taliban's takeover may deter foreign investors, one country that appears willing to do business with them is China. The world's second-biggest economy has said it was ready to have "friendly and cooperative" relations with Afghanistan after the Taliban entered Kabul. The state-owned China Metallurgical Group Corporation won rights in 2007 to lease the giant Mes Aynak copper ore deposit for 30 years and extract 11.5 million tonnes of the commodity. The project to tap the world's second-largest unexploited copper deposit has yet to start operations "due to safety issues", according to Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times. But Global Times cited a source at the group as saying that it would "consider reopening it after the situation is stabilised, and international recognition -- including the Chinese government's recognition of the Taliban regime -- takes place." While Chinese leaders are "not enthusiastic" about the Taliban takeover, "they will not allow principle to stand in the way of pragmatism," Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution think tank, said in a blog. "Beijing's lack of development at its major investment in the Mes Aynak copper mine demonstrates its willingness to exercise patience in pursuit of return on investment," he wrote. French expert Pitron said: "The Chinese don't condition their business deals on democratic principles." He warned there is no certainty that Afghanistan will become a mineral El Dorado. "For that, you need a very stable political climate," Pitron said. It can take as long as 20 years between the discovery of a mineral deposit and the start of mining operations, he said. "No company will want to invest if there is no stable political and legal system," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-inherit-untapped-1-trillion-trove-of-minerals/articleshow/85528613.cms||---

On Saturday, all the three members of parliament, plus the dozen-odd MLAs, from Chennai turned out in full strength and hauled authorities of the Greater Chennai Corporation and other state agencies over the coals over civic schemes, their quality and expenditure. The GCC, TN Slum Clearance Board, Tangedco and Metrowater were taken to task by MLAs and MPs who comprised the district development coordination and monitoring committee (DISHA) in Chennai. The meeting was held under the chairmanship of Chennai (Central) MP Dayanidhi Maran on Saturday. Sources said all MLAs and MPs had come well prepared and asked tough questions to officials regarding schemes funded by central government funds. For instance, due to overnight rains, there was water-logging in areas of North Chennai. The North Chennai MP, V Kalanidhi, and other MLAs raised questions about the fund allocation to North Chennai and poor infrastructure of drains and sewage system. “Only Rs 55 crore has been allocated to north Chennai works which is low compared to other parts of the city,” Kalanidhi said in the meeting, sources said. Dayanidhi Maran told TOI that he raised questions about implementation of the desalination plant which would be providing drinking water to the city and the slow pace of work. “It has been ongoing for 3-4 years now. Chennai does not have paucity of water currently, but we need to plan for the future,” he said. Mylapore MLA Dha Velu told TOI that he raised questions about slum clearance board tenements and other works not having taken environment clearance. Dr N Ezhilan, MLA representing Thousand Lights constituency, said all MLAs came well prepared despite being given just two days’ notice. “We asked for at least 10 days’ notice for such meetings so that we would inspect specific projects prior to the meeting,” he said. Dr Ezhilan said he raised issues about the lack of coordination between officials of GCC, TNSCB and CMWSSB as far as civic issues are concerned. Other issues like the MRTS extension project and integration with Chennai Metro Rail were also taken up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/mps-mlas-in-chennai-take-babus-to-task/articleshow/85528616.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar
---||World||The Haqqani network: Afghanistan's most feared militants||KABUL: Some of the Taliban's top leaders are gathering in Kabul to discuss the formation of a new Afghan government -- including a representative from the Haqqani network, the country's most feared militants. The Haqqanis have been blamed for some of the deadliest attacks in recent years, claiming the lives of civilians, government officials and foreign forces. Despite their reputation, they are expected to be powerful players in the new regime following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan last week. The shadowy group was formed by Jalaluddin Haqqani, who gained prominence in the 1980s as a hero of the anti-Soviet jihad. At the time, he was a valuable CIA asset as the United States and its allies such as Pakistan funnelled arms and money to the mujahideen. During that conflict and following the Soviet withdrawal, Jalaluddin Haqqani fostered close ties with foreign jihadists -- including Osama bin Laden. He later allied with the Taliban who took over Afghanistan in 1996, serving as a minister for the Islamist regime until it was toppled by US-led forces in 2001. Jalaluddin Haqqani's death after a long illness was announced by the Taliban in 2018, and his son Sirajuddin formally became the network's chief. Thanks to their financial and military strength -- and a reputation for ruthlessness -- the Haqqani network is considered semi-autonomous while remaining within the Taliban fold. Mainly based in eastern Afghanistan -- with alleged bases across the border in Pakistan's northwest -- the group became more visible in the Taliban leadership in recent years, and Sirajuddin Haqqani was appointed deputy leader in 2015. His younger brother Anas, once imprisoned and sentenced to death by the previous Afghan government, has held talks with former president Hamid Karzai and ex-chief executive Abdullah Abdullah since the fall of Kabul last weekend. The Haqqani network is blamed for some of the deadliest and most shocking attacks in Afghanistan during the last two decades. They have been designated a foreign terrorist group by the United States, and are also under United Nations sanctions. The Haqqanis have a reputation for frequently using suicide bombers -- including drivers in cars and trucks packed with huge amounts of explosives -- and have demonstrated the ability to carry out complex, high-casualty assaults on major targets including military installations and embassies. In October 2013, Afghan forces intercepted a Haqqani truck in eastern Afghanistan that contained nearly 28 tonnes (61,500 pounds) of explosives, according to the US National Counterterrorism Center. The Haqqanis have been accused of assassinations -- including an attempt against then-president Karzai in 2008 -- and kidnappings of officials and Western citizens, for ransom and forcing prisoner exchanges. They have also long been suspected of links with the Pakistani military establishment -- US Admiral Mike Mullen described them as a "veritable arm" of Islamabad's intelligence in 2011. Pakistan denies the allegation. The Haqqanis have also hugely contributed to the Taliban's fighting ranks, and are the group's "most combat-ready forces", UN monitors said in a June report. The monitors also described the network as the "primary liaison" between the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. The Haqqanis have emerged as serious players in the Taliban's political project with at least two of their leaders in Kabul as talks begin on forming the next government. Sirajuddin Haqqani's formal elevation to the deputy leader position six years ago cemented that role, analysts say. And the release of his brother Anas from Afghan custody in 2019 was seen as a move to help kickstart the direct US-Taliban talks that eventually led to the troop withdrawal. Sirajuddin Haqqani even wrote an op-ed in The New York Times last year, outlining the Taliban's position on the US talks and the conflict in Afghanistan -- though in diplomatic tones that belied the network's violent reputation. While Anas Haqqani has held talks with Karzai, his uncle Khalil Haqqani was seen leading prayers in Kabul on Friday. Sirajuddin and Khalil are both still listed as wanted by the United States, with millions of dollars in bounties on offer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/the-haqqani-network-afghanistans-most-feared-militants/articleshow/85528635.cms||---

The government will not do injustice to buyers and due process will be followed to declare their rights, Sawant said at a special meeting with around 200 Uguem villagers. The government recently deleted the Sociedade’s name and included itself as occupant along with farmers, based on a 1966 official gazette notification, triggering strong opposition from the farmers. Will delete govt’s name after legal process ends: CMReplying to a question, Pramod Sawant said that his government would delete the government’s name after completing the legal process. On behalf of Uguem locals, former sarpanch Sanjay Parwar brought it to Sawant’s notice that locals were furious about the sudden changes made by the Sanguem mamlatdar in form I&XIV records by including the government as co-owner of the property without sending any notices. Sawant promised the aggrieved locals that the government would not take away the land of those who had earlier purchased it from the sociedade, as also those whose names are in the other rights and tenants column. He warned locals not to encroach on government land. If anyone tries to encroach or construct huts or houses, the government will demolish them, he said. Sawant requested the locals to submit an application to the deputy collector of Sanguem, along with their sale deeds or any other documents, showing that they are in possession of the land. The chief minister requested the Uguem locals to constitute a five-member committee to follow up with the deputy collector. Without mentioning the IIT, the chief minister said that some people are creating a “wrong atmosphere” among the people that something is coming up on the land. The government will do whatever is good for the people of Uguem, he claimed. “I know who is responsible for not deleting the Sociedade’s name from survey records,” he said. “The court told us to maintain status quo, but I promise you that it will not take long to finish off the matter in favour of the government.” Meanwhile, the farmers, reacting to the chief minister’s statement, decided not to submit their documents to the deputy collector office. “We don’t have faith in the chief minister’s words, we will submit our documents only after the high court disposes of the case,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/single-occupants-rights-will-be-protected-says-goa-cm-pramod-sawant/articleshow/85528611.cms||Johnny M

---||Chennai||Madras University to end UG admissions by September 30||CHENNAI: University of Madras directed all affiliated colleges to wind up first year undergraduate admissions before September 30 for the 2021-22 academic year. Online admissions to arts and science colleges began on July 26. “...Colleges should submit a statement showing the number of candidates admitted according to reservation rules immediately after admissions are over,” said N Mathivanan, registrar (incharge), Madras university, in a circular to principals of all affiliated colleges. The university plans to start a new academic year for first year students by October 1. “The circular was issued based on the UGC’s academic calendar. Colleges will need at least 90 days to complete a semester. The university is planning to conduct semester exams for first year students in January,” an official from the university said. Meanwhile, many city colleges said they will end admissions well before the deadline. “Admissions are almost over. There are a few seats left in science courses. We will complete the admission process in the coming week,” said S Santhosh Baboo, principal of DG Vaishnav College. “We have released two lists of selected candidates and we are verifying certificates. The admissions will be over in one or two weeks,” said M G Raghunathan, principal of Guru Nanak College. The directorate of collegiate education (DCE) asked 143 government arts and science colleges to begin counselling for admissions on August 23. “The first two rounds of counselling should be completed before September 3. The candidates should be informed through email and mobile phone,” a circular from C Pooranachandran, director of collegiate education said. Colleges were asked to conduct the counselling in online or offline mode. “The colleges may prepare a selection list and waiting lists based on the marks and community roster for every course,” the circular added. There are 1,00,102 seats available in 143 government arts and science colleges. “As many as 3,04,537 candidates registered online applications. Of them, 2,29,309 students made the payments and they alone will be considered for admissions. The number of students participating in the admission process has increased by 5%,” a higher education department source said.

---||World||ISIS threat forces US changes to evacuations at Kabul airport||KABUL: Potential Islamic State threats against Americans in Afghanistan are forcing the US military to develop new ways to get evacuees to the airport in Kabul, a senior US official said Saturday, adding a new complication to the already chaotic efforts to get people out of the country after its swift fall to the Taliban. The official said that small groups of Americans and possibly other civilians will be given specific instructions on what to do, including movement to transit points where they can be gathered up by the military. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. The changes come as the US Embassy issued a new security warning Saturday telling citizens not to travel to the Kabul airport without individual instruction from a US government representative. Officials declined to provide more specifics about the IS threat but described it as significant. They said there have beenno confirmed attacks as yet. Time is running out ahead of President Joe Biden's Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw most remaining US troops. In his remarks on the situation Friday, he did not commit to extending it, though he did issue a new pledge to evacuate not only all Americans in Afghanistan, but also the tens of thousands of Afghans who have aided the war effort since Sept. 11, 2001. That promise would dramatically expand the number of people the US evacuates. Biden faces growing criticism as videos depict pandemonium and occasional violence outside the airport, and as vulnerable Afghans who fear the Taliban's retaliation send desperate pleas not to be left behind. The Islamic State group - which has long declared a desire to attack America and US interests abroad - has been active in Afghanistan for a number of years, carrying out waves of horrific attacks, mostly on the Shiite minority. The group has been repeatedly targeted by U.S. airstrikes in recent years, as well as Taliban attacks. But officials say fragments of the group are still active in Afghanistan, and the US is concerned about it reconstituting in a larger way as the country comes under divisive Taliban rule. Despite the U.S. Embassy warning, crowds remain outside the Kabul airport's concrete barriers, clutching documents and sometimes stunned-looking children, blocked from flight by coils of razor wire. Meanwhile, the Taliban's top political leader arrived in Kabul for talks on forming a new government. The presence of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who returned to Kandahar earlier this week from Qatar, was confirmed by a Taliban official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the news media. Baradar negotiated the religious movement's 2020 peace deal with the U.S., and he is now expected to play a key role in negotiations between the Taliban and officials from the Afghan government that the militant group deposed. Afghan officials familiar with talks held in the capital say the Taliban have said they will not make announcements on their government until the Aug. 31 deadline for the troop withdrawal passes. Abdullah Abdullah, a senior official in the ousted government, tweeted that he and ex-President Hamid Karzai met Saturday with Taliban's acting governor for Kabul, who ``assured us that he would do everything possible for the security of the people'' of the city. Evacuations continued, though some outgoing flights were far from full because of the airport chaos. The German military said in a tweet that one plane left Kabul on Saturday with 205 evacuees, while a second aircraft carried only 20. The Italian Defense Ministry announced the evacuation Saturday of 211 Afghans, which it said brought to 2,100 the number of Afghan workers at Italian missions and their families who have been safely evacuated. On Friday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said around 1,000 people a day were being evacuated amid a ``stabilization'' at the airport. But on Saturday, a former Royal Marine-turned charity director in Afghanistan said the situation was getting worse, not better. ``We can't leave the country because we can't get into the airport without putting our lives at risk,'' Paul Farthing told BBC radio. Army Maj. Gen. Hank Taylor, Joint Staff deputy director for regional operations, told Pentagon reporters Saturday that the U.S. has evacuated 17,000 people through the Kabul airport since Aug. 15. About 2,500 have been Americans, he said. U.S. officials have estimated there are as many as 15,000 Americans in Afghanistan, but acknowledge they don't have solid numbers. In the past day, about 3,800 civilians were evacuated from Afghanistan through a combination of U.S. military and charter flights, Taylor said. Three flights of Afghan evacuees have arrived at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C. The evacuations have been hampered by screening and logistical strains at way stations such as al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar. U.S. officials said they have limited numbers of screeners, and they are struggling to work through glitches in the vetting systems. Taylor said that the Kabul airport remains open, and that Americans continue to be processed if they get to the gates, but he and Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the threat picture changes by the hour. ``We know that we're fighting against both time and space,'' Kirby said. ``That's the race we're in right now.'' The Biden administration was considering calling on U.S. commercial airlines to provide planes and crews to assist in transporting Afghan refugees once they were evacuated from their country by military aircraft. Under the voluntary Civil Reserve Air Fleet program, civilian airlines add to military aircraft capability during a crisis related to national defense. The U.S. Transportation Command said Saturday it had issued a warning order to US carriers Friday night on the possible activation of the program. If called upon, commercial airlines would transport evacuees from way stations outside Afghanistan to another country or from Virginia's Dulles International Airport to U.S. military bases. So far, 13 countries have agreed to host at-risk Afghans at least temporarily, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Another 12 have agreed to serve as transit points for evacuees, including Americans and others. ``We are tired. We are happy. We are now in a safe country,'' one Afghan man said upon arrival in Italy with 79 fellow citizens, speaking in a video distributed by that country's defense ministry. But the growing question for many other Afghans is, where will they finally call home? Already, European leaders who fear a repeat of the 2015 migration crisis are signaling that fleeing Afghans who didn't help Western forces during the war should stay in neighboring countries instead. Remaining in Afghanistan means adapting to life under the Taliban, who say they seek an ``inclusive, Islamic'' government, will offer full amnesty to those who worked for the U.S. and the Western-backed government and have become more moderate since they last held power from 1996 to 2001. They also have said _ without elaborating _ that they will honor women's rights within the norms of Islamic law. But many Afghans fear a return to the Taliban's harsh rule in the late 1990s, when the group barred women from attending school or working outside the home, banned television and music, chopped off the hands of suspected thieves and held public executions. ``Today, some of my friends went to work at the court and the Taliban didn't let them into their offices. They showed their guns and said, `You're not eligible to work in this government if you worked in the past one,''' one women's activist in Kabul told The Associated Press on Saturday. She spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. With a Turkish visa but no way to safely reach the airport, the activist described the gap between the Taliban's words and actions ``very alarming.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/isis-threat-forces-us-changes-to-evacuations-at-kabul-airport/articleshow/85528689.cms||---
---||Noida||‘Extreme weather to be more common, Delhi-NCR must invest in waterbodies’||Extreme weather conditions that manifest in longer heat waves and phases of high-intensity rainfall, which are uncharacteristic of our seasons but have become more familiar in recent years, will become an increasingly common occurrence in Delhi-NCR, say two Indian scientists who contributed to the latest and most exhaustive evidence-based Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that warns of a 1.5 degrees Celsius rise in global temperatures in 20 years. The IPCC had on August 9 come out with its sixth assessment report, which was based on the review of over 14,000 published papers by 234 scientists from across the world. “Delhi-NCR will witness severity of heat waves and extreme rainfall,” Prof Govindasamy Bala, professor at the Indian Institute of Science (IISC) in Bengaluru, told TOI. “Urban flooding (which the region is already witnessing, particularly in Gurgaon) will also be a common feature because of high concentration of rainfall in a short duration. The existing system cannot precipitate the excess rainfall in such a short time period. These are all impacts of climate change,” he added. Speaking to TOI separately, Dr N H Ravindranath agreed with Prof Bala’s analysis. “Rainfall and temperature are determined by global factors. Delhi-NCR will witness both direct and indirect impacts of climate change. The direct impact will be severe heat waves and high-intensity rainfall. The indirect impact will be increased cases of dengue, malaria and migration of people from different parts of India to Delhi and its neighbouring districts for work,” said Dr Ravindranath, professor (retd) of IISc’s Centre for Sustainable Technologies. Prof Bala underlined the need for more waterbodies to help mitigate air pollution, the biggest environmental challenge for the capital and its densely populated satellite cities like Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida and Ghaziabad, and the effects of extreme weather in the region. “The answers to these problems are simple. The region needs more waterbodies that can act as a heat sink. The runoff water from the excess rain can also be pushed towards these reservoirs to avert flooding,” he said. The only way, he added, to tackle air pollution in the region is to reduce diesel emissions. “Pollutants don’t stay in the atmosphere for long. They get dispersed and washed out over a period of two weeks. Air pollution is a local problem, and it must be dealt with locally,” he said. The IPCC report, which for the first time was unequivocal about human activity being the cause of the climate crisis, has called for a drastic cut in greenhouse emissions. “The speed of climatic change has increased. Though the average global temperature shows a rise of only 1.1 degrees Celsius, it can be tricky. As the average rise in temperature is calculated over a period of 10 years globally, the outliers, such as extremes in temperatures, are hidden. It is possible that in some areas, the temperature may have increased by 10 degrees Celsius,” Prof Bala said. Delhi-NCR is already witnessing erratic weather, very harsh summers and winters and moody monsoons end in rain deficit but precipitate episodes of waterlogging due rainfall happening in bursts. So, can we go back from here? “No, we can’t. Some changes are irreversible in our lifetime. Take, for instance, the melting of glaciers. It takes 100 years to respond, and we cannot also predict when a huge chunk of the ice sheet will fall into the sea and raise the water level. Climate change is a problem that we are creating for our future generations,” the IISc professor warned. “Unless carbon emissions are drastically reduced, limiting warming to 1.5 degree Celsius will be beyond reach. India has so far not indicated a roadmap for peak and net zero in carbon emissions,” he added. In Delhi-NCR, urban planning for the future, and consequently the environment strategy, will have to factor in tides of migration into the region. Dr Ravindranath said, “People from other parts of India will migrate to Delhi-NCR more. As flooding and drought continues to play havoc in different parts of the country, people will migrate to Delhi. This will also have a drastic impact on food production. These are all indirect impacts of climate change that the region will witness.” On measures governments should take to limit climate change effects, he added, “Haryana should plant more trees, which can help the region create barriers against dust from the desert. Increasing green cover will also decrease soil erosion. To limit the urban heat island phenomenon, the governments can paint the rooftops of every building white. It will reduce heat. Delhi-NCR should ensure stormwater drains are not choked. This will help limit urban flooding.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/extreme-weather-to-be-more-common-delhi-ncr-must-invest-in-waterbodies/articleshow/85525898.cms||Ipsita Pati

Bank officials are already facing a probe for the alleged leak of customer data. Praveen Mittal, the mastermind, allegedly cheated a farmer in the city of the amount in 2019. Mittal managed to get the mobile number linked to the farmer’s bank account changed. Apart from the former loan agent, six of Mittal's accomplices who allegedly supplied SIM cards to him without the required documents have been arrested so far. An FIR, the second in the case, was filed under sections 419 (cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery) and 471 (using forged documents) of the IPC at Sector 37 police station on Saturday. In June 2019, an FIR had been lodged at the same police station after the fraud came to light. Saturday’s FIR states that the six men allegedly procured 500 SIM cards illegally in connivance with Airtel officials and other individuals in violation of norms laid down by the department of telecommunications and sold them to various people. Police are expected to name more people in the FIR as the investigation progresses. One of the SIM cards was used by Mittal to cheat the farmer. Apart from some Airtel officials, police are also investigating the role of Dinesh Sharma, who allegedly prepared fake papers of a recruitment company in Gurgaon and helped the racket procure the SIM cards. “The SIM cards could have been used for anti-national activities,” said a police officer. An Airtel spokesperson told TOI that they were cooperating with the police. “As a law-abiding corporate, we have extended full cooperation to the authorities and will continue to assist them. Since the matter is subjudice, we are unable to comment further,” the spokesperson said. The second FIR comes after the Punjab and Haryana high court ordered Gurgaon police to file a separate case to investigate how many SIM cards have been fraudulently issued. The matter was raised in a hearing on August 16 in which bank officials under probe for their roles in the fraud had sought anticipatory bail from the high court. “We found that the accused illegally procured around 500 SIM cards. The details of the investigation were presented before the high court in the hearing,” said ACP (DLF) Karan Goel, head of the special investigation team constituted to investigate the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/bank-fraud-how-did-6-men-get-500-sim-cards/articleshow/85525904.cms||Bagish Jha

Uday Bhan, police said, had just returned from work and parked his car outside his rented house last Tuesday when a few neighbours asked him to remove the vehicle. They allegedly told Uday that their tenants too needed space to park their cars and he should take his vehicle somewhere else. Uday refused to remove his car, saying he had sought permission from the owner of the house in Rajinder Park to park his vehicle outside the building. The group of residents allegedly threatened him with dire consequences. “They wanted me to remove my car so that their tenants could park their vehicles. But that is not my concern. I had taken permission from my landlord to park the car outside the house,” the constable said. Soon after Uday had entered his house after parking his car, the group of neighbours, including women, barged in. The constable was allegedly punched in the face and stomach several times. A few other residents of the area intervened and rescued Uday. However, before leaving, Uday’s attackers allegedly issued a threat. “They said ‘if you stay here, we will kill you’,” he said. Sources said Uday, who is from Jhajjar, had shifted to this one-room apartment after his transfer to Rajinder Park police station. Although he was attacked on Tuesday, Uday lodged a complaint at Rajinder Park police station two days later. An FIR was filed against unknown persons under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 452 (trespassing) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/neighbours-thrash-cop-after-row-over-parking/articleshow/85525907.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Not just cases, second wave surged biomed waste too in Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: The debilitating second wave of Covid that pummelled the city with a surge in infections and deaths had caused another uptick — that of biomedical waste generation. During its peak in April when active cases had once crossed 6,900 mark, a total of 1,52,098 kg of waste was produced. This number dwarfed the 74.124 kg of waste generated in the same month last year — a time when the pandemic was just settling in with around 15-20 active cases. May was not much different. While the figure for the month last year that had a high of 150 active cases was 1,02,875 kg, it was 1,65,729 kg in the same period when active cases had crossed 8,600. An average of 5,346 kg per day of biomedical waste was generated in the month. The figures were culled out from a report compiled by Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) for 16 months (April 2020 to July 2021) and sent to the Centre on the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). In total, the city had generated 22,77,627 kg of biomedical waste in the 16 months. October 2020 recorded the highest generation of waste at 1,70,604 kg. That was a time when almost all hospitals and medical facilities had resumed facilities for non-Covid patients and the city was limping back to some kind of normalcy. Chandigarh has 890 health care facilities, including 49-bedded and 841 nonbedded, the report said. Ensured proper disposal of biomed waste, says DalaiCovid biomedical waste was produced from top three medical institutes — PGI, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and Government Multispecialty Hospital, Sector 16 — and other civil hospitals, quarantine centres and the municipal corporation. Debendra Dalai, UT director environment-cum-member secretary, CPCC, said the committee ensured registration and proper disposal of biomedical waste in the city, which helped UT in securing top position in the country. In the last year’s order, the NGT had observed that dumping Covid-19 waste in general bins or sewerage without safeguards was hazardous. It had recommended using best practices and new ideas under supervision, besides compiling data from all sources to prevent accidental spill and aid strategic planning. The order asked for educating waste handlers, staff, and citizens about the precautions they must take, and demanded a local model plan. The green court told the Central Pollution Control Board to coordinate with the media and central and state departments for the purpose. The NGT had also directed the UT administration to ensure scientific storage, transport, handling, management, and disposal of Covid-19 waste and submit a report on its compliance with the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016. Last year, Haryana State Pollution Control Board had agreed to help the UT administration in disposal of Covid-19 related biomedical waste, if an emergency situation occurs like breakdown of Biomedical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility (BWTF) of Chandigarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-19-not-just-cases-second-wave-surged-biomed-waste-too-in-chandigarh/articleshow/85528693.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The civic body on Saturday said eligible beneficiaries can contact personnel on 044-25384520 and 044-46122300 to arrange a home vaccination. Similar targeted drives were conducted to get beneficiaries their second dose of Covaxin. Meanwhile, eight of the 15 city zones reported a spike in active Covid-19 cases over the past week, Greater Chennai corporation data revealed. However, the city’s total active case tally has declined by about 24 cases from August 13 to August 20. Manali, Tondiarpet, Royapuram, Ambattur, Anna Nagar, Teynampet, Adyar and Perungudi recorded an increase in active infections with Anna Nagar reporting the steepest rise from 249 on August 13 to 330 on August 20. Anna Nagar is also the sole zone with more than 300 active cases. Kodambakkam is the only other zone with more than 200 cases. However active cases here decreased from 260 to 218 in the same period. All zones in the northern region have less than 100 active cases with Manali reporting just 25 active cases. The civic body is conducting intense contact tracing to identify clusters. On Friday, about 29,000 city residents got their shots. Kodambakkam zone (3,060) topped in the maximum shots administered while the lowest was in Manali (920). Corporation sources said there has been a good response to vaccination whenever stocks of Covishield are available. The corporation also started a targeted vaccination drive in slum clearance board tenements. It held 315 such special camps over the past week covering 24,000 people, a statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-residents-over-the-age-of-80-years-can-get-vaccination-at-home/articleshow/85528707.cms||---
---||World||Winds threaten to fan destructive California wildfire||PLACERVILLE, California: Crews were digging in and burning out fire lines amid another round of high winds Saturday contributed to the fury to a Northern California wildfire. ``We have a firefight ahead of us and the wind today is going to make it very challenging,`` said Keith Wade, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. The Caldor Fire in the northern Sierra Nevada already destroyed dozens of homes, and authorities on Friday closed down a 46-mile (74-kilometer) stretch of Interstate 50, the main route between the state capital of Sacramento and Lake Tahoe on the Nevada state line. The highway was closed after debris from the blaze fell onto the roadway and because of red flag warnings for 20- to 30-mph (32- to 48-kph) winds that by Saturday evening ``combined with continued extremely dry fuels will result in critical fire weather conditions in the vicinity of the Caldor Fire,'' the National Weather Service said. The winds could gust to 40 mph (65 kph) Saturday. The road is a key checkpoint as crews struggle against the fire, which erupted earlier this week and grew to 10 times its size in a few days, fueled by winds. ``We're going to invest everything we can into holding the fire south`` of the road, said Eric Schwab, an operations section chief with Cal Fire. Firefighters made progress on the fire's western side and burned vegetation to starve it of fuel and prevent the flames from heading into the evacuated community of Pollock Pines. On the northeast side, crews were protecting cabins in the dense forest area, fire officials said. The Caldor Fire had now devoured about 130 square miles (310 square kilometers) as of Saturday and more than 1,500 firefighters were battling it amid heavy timber and rugged terrain. The blaze was one of about a dozen large California wildfires that have scorched Northern California, incinerating at least 700 homes alone in and around the Sierra Nevada communities of Greenville and Grizzly Flats. The fires, mainly in the northern part of the state, have burned nearly 1.5 million acres, or roughly 2,300 square miles (6,000 square kilometers) and have sent smoke as far as the East Coast. They were burning in grass, brush and forest that is exceptionally dry from two years of drought likely exacerbated by climate change. Thousands of homes remained under threat in communities tucked away in scenic forests and tens of thousands of people remain under evacuation orders. Nine national forests in the region have been closed because of the fire threat. To the northwest of the Caldor Fire, the massive Dixie Fire kept expanding and new evacuations were ordered, including the tiny hamlet of Taylorsville. In five weeks, the fire about 175 miles (282 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco has become the second-largest in state history and blackened an area twice the size of Los Angeles. Weather forecasts call for a storm system that will bring winds but little rain through Northern California into early next week. With it will come increased risks of fires. Dozens have erupted in recent days but were quickly stamped out. An exception was the Cache Fire, a small but fast-moving grass blaze that ravaged at least 56 homes and virtually annihilated a mobile home park. Some of those forced to flee the flames had to leave their pets behind. Emily Crum, an animal control officer with North Bay Animal Services, got a surprise as she searched for abandoned pets in the Clearlake area. She spotted a black dog in a charred lot. ``I saw her laying there. I thought she was dead,'' Crum said. ``Then she started wagging her tail.'' Despite being chained to a boat trailer, the mutt named Sammy had not been injured, Crum said. Cats, goats and chickens also were rescued. California is one of a dozen mostly Western states where 99 large, active fires were burning as of Friday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Fires have intensified across the entire West, creating a nearly year-round season that has taxed firefighters. Fire patterns used to migrate in seasons from the Southwest to the Rockies, to the Pacific Northwest and then California, allowing fire crews to move from one place to the next, said Anthony Scardina, deputy regional forester for the U.S. Forest Service. ``But the problem is all of those seasons are starting to overlap,'' Scardina said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/winds-threaten-to-fan-destructive-california-wildfire/articleshow/85528748.cms||---

On Saturday, a total of 22,353 people got inoculated at 130 session sites set up at the government and private health care institutions. Of them, 18,394 people in the age group of 18 to 44 years were inoculated; 3,010 aged above 45 were vaccinated; 144 healthcare workers and 805 frontline workers got the jab. Moreover, 11,459 received their first dose and 10,894 received their second dose. While the coverage at government centres was 8,688, it was 13,665 at private facilities on Saturday. Dr Singh said that the department has sufficient stock of vaccines. “Currently, we have 25,000 doses of Covishield and 10,000 doses of Covaxin,” added Dr Singh. Meanwhile, Gurugram reported six cases of Covid on Saturday, taking the tally to 1,81,017. With this, the active cases stand at 79.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/no-vaccination-drive-at-government-sites-on-rakhi/articleshow/85525955.cms||---
---||Indore||Indore on top in implementing family planning measures||INDORE: Indore district - a Covid-19 hotspot despite suffering hugely due to pandemic in April and May has remained on top in performing vasectomy and tubectomy as part of the family planning measures in the state. The district with around 3956 such surgeries cumulatively in females and males secured first spot in all the districts of state during a review meeting held after August 16 to oversee performance in the first four and a half months of this financial year. District health officer-2 Dr Santosh Sisodia, who supervises the family planning programme said, “In the review meeting held around a couple of days back to review performance of districts, Indore remained on top in measures taken including surgeries done so far.” Of those 3956 sterilisations, vasectomy (male sterilisation) was less than half percent with only 12 males undergoing such surgeries as part of family planning measures. Dr Sisodia on the lesser number of male sterilisations said, “There are a couple of reasons for this including the burden of family related issues are more on females than on males in our society.” The misconception about issues post male sterilisation also demotivates this and females put them in front to undergo tubectomy, said Dr Sisodia. This happens despite the male sterilisation is simple and without any side effects. This led to continuous decline in vasectomy for the last couple of years, said Dr Sisodia. The state government is required to run a special awareness programme to reduce this misconception and other things among people, added Dr Sisodia. The black wise bifurcation of record further showed that of those 3956-sterilisation procedures in the district around two-thirds were performed in two blocks including Nanda Nagar and Hukumchand polyclinic only. These two are the urban facilities and the district as a whole has around 70% of population living in urban parts. This remained as a major reason behind this difference in case load, added Dr Sisodia. The district has to perform a total of 20664 sterilisation surgeries till March 20220 to achieve their target including 548 males undergoing vasectomy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/indore-on-top-in-implementing-family-planning-measures/articleshow/85528763.cms||Antriksh Singh
---||Bengaluru||Fake passport cases dip from 29 in 2019 to 3 in Bengaluru airport||BENGALURU: Cases of miscreants using fake passports to fly out of the country have reduced at Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru. While 29 instances of fake passport usage were detected in 2019, the number fell to 10 in 2020 and three this year (till August 18), according to data with KIA police station. Fake passport cases detected by immigration officials at KIA are registered as complaints with the airport police station. Police sources in touch with immigration officials said the number of such cases has come down mainly because international flights are not back to pre-Covid levels due to pandemic curbs.  A senior police officer, on condition of anonymity, said advanced technology adopted by governments in issuing or renewing passports is the prime reason for the sharp decline. “Producing fake passport is too difficult for miscreants now. Fraudsters in Mumbai and Chennai were known for their expertise in making fake passports. They were active in 1990s and early 2000s. But now, with the introduction of new technologies, most of them have stopped producing the bogus documents,” he said. He, however, added: “The pandemic too contributed to the decline. As many countries are strictly following lockdown guidelines and restrictions on entry of foreign nationals, getting visa is not an easy job now.” Notwithstanding the tech strides and pandemic restrictions, there are desperate people who have their own reasons to leave the country, whatever it takes, sources said. In January 2020, a 49-year-old man boarding a Mumbai-bound flight from KIA was arrested on charges of holding a fake passport. It came to light that he used one because there was a lookout notice against his name issued by Mumbai police in a criminal case. Further investigation revealed the accused had availed the fake passport from Greece. In December 2019, immigration officials at KIA detained two men from Bangladesh on charges of using fake passports to travel abroad. Probe revealed the passports were produced by a miscreant in Kolkata and the duo had paid around Rs 1 lakh each to get them. The two were detained before boarding a flight to Malaysia, where they had got jobs as electricians. Police officers said most of the fake passport cases detected at KIA pertain to outbound passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/fake-passport-cases-dip-from-29-in-2019-to-3/articleshow/85525644.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
