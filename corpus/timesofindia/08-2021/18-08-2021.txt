It was recently recognised as the Green Champion for Bengaluru Urban District and has bagged other laurels for its eco-friendly initiatives, too. Speaking about the college's consistent efforts, Dr Helen Rosalene, associate professor and head, Department of Environmental Science that is also involved in the green audit says, "Since it is a zero-waste college, we are trying to manage our solid waste and waste water management. The college has an internal environment auditing process and a dedicated environmental policy with clear objectives in place." Here's how the college is making its campus greener... Recycling and minimising non-recyclable refuseFrom rainwater harvesting, saying no to plastic bottled water on campus to sewage treatment plants, the college is consciously trying to amp its efforts in being a zero-waste college. "We wanted to be a zero waste institution and we were looking at how to re-use our waste water. We have sewage treatment plants (capacity 150 kilo litres per day) that treat the entire college water which is used for tertiary purposes such as landscaping, toilet flushing, driveway cleaning etc.," informs Dr Rosalene. A canteen that minimises wasteThe college has set up a token system where the student has to pay for the plate in advance and when they return the plate, they get their money back. "Food cannot be taken out from the canteen and we do not sell bottled water. This has reduced plastic waste and the issue of canteen waste as well," informs Dr Rosalene. To promote the RO water tanks, the quality of the water is monitored and checked by the in-house testing lab and displayed for everyone. Spreading awareness among studentsIn a bid to create awareness and get students to think about the environment, the college has been conducting activities round the year. "The department conducts seed-ball making activities, outreach programs, webinars and awareness projects," says Vaishnavi Anand who adds that one such competition inspired her recent research work done on affordable organic sanitary napkin. "Named Twacha, it has qualified in the top 127 projects in the national innovation contest conducted by MHRD and NIC. I have also applied for provisional specification of the patent," adds Vaishnavi. Putting waste to good use...The college has vermicomposting maintained by Life Science department and has invested in a thermophillic organic waste converter, too. Dr Rosalene says, "The solid waste generated on campus is segregated. During the peak time, the campus generates about 75 kg to 125 kg of food waste received from the canteen, hostel and other eateries and leaf litter from the campus amounts to around 50-150 kg. The food waste is checked for hard bones or plastic spoons, which is added into the Thermophilic organic waste convertor along with these leaves (which are washed to remove the grit) to the solid waste convertor and the compost is ready in 48 hours. The organic content is tested in the environmental science laboratory and later on packed and sold at Rs. 25 per kg to the students, staff and public. Organic compost is used for the campus and for the vegetable garden behind the campus. The remaining is sent to different organisations." At Mount Carmel College (Autonomous)...- Department of Environmental science and electronics have a collection point for e-waste. - The institution avoids using posters for campaign of election. - College culturals ban the use of styrofoam and other plastic packaging material.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/students-work-towards-a-greener-future-at-this-city-college/articleshow/85398606.cms||Joyeeta Chakravorty

At a function held at the Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram, on Tuesday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the distribution of financial assistance, at the presence of Pillai. Of the eight recipients at the function, two were selected through the Norka-Roots - Arya Mohan and Archana Madhusoodan, children of NRKs died of Covid received an aid of Rs 1 lakh each. The six others, selected by RP Foundation are facing severe health issues and financial strain. The aid is given mainly to children whose parents had died of COVID, families whose income streams had dried up due to the pandemic, and widows. Assistance will also be given for covering marriage expenses of women from underprivileged families. What prompted Pillai to set up a Covid-relief fund was the requests for financial assistance he was getting since the pandemic worsened. “We noticed that many businesses and factories had to shut down during this period and many lost jobs due to this. And many didn’t even have the money for food. When Covid initially hit the Middle East in a severe way than India, there were many Indian workers who couldn’t go back home due to financial strain. Hence, we gave air tickets to more than a thousand of them and continued supporting for their sustenance back home,” he said. “Then we started receiving more requests from people asking for help in the difficult times and I believe that one should help others when they are in dire situations, with circumstances beyond their control. That is how I set up Rs 15 crore fund, a decision which was well-supported by my family. However, when we announced this, we saw a flow of applications. Till July 5th, when we closed the applications, we had received 2.5 lakh applications and still we are getting more,” Pillai said. It took 200 data entry operators worked day and night for 45 days to document the applications before the selection process, which was done online. “We are expecting to disburse the funds to 15,000 people this month itself. Distribution to the rest of the selected applicants will be done through Dhanlaxmi Bank and it might be over by October,” Pillai said. Of the total assistance, the recipients for Rs 5 crore is being selected by Norka-Roots. Overall, 40,000 people will be benefitted by the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ravi-pillai-increases-covid-relief-fund-to-rs-17-crore/articleshow/85411102.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Business||Study suggests novel approach to achieve seafood sustainability||KOCHI: A study by a team of researchers from Ashoka University, InSeason Fish and Foundation for Ecological Research, Advocacy and Learning (FERAL), has found that urban seafood consumers in India are important contributors to unsustainable seafood trade. The main reason for this according to the study is that urban seafood consumers, which is the main market paying high prices for seafood in India reject diverse options and choose only few select seafood options. Urban seafood consumption focuses on only 6 species groups on average through the year despite marine fisheries in India producing highly diverse and seasonal seafood catch consisting of at least 200 edible species. Due to this mismatch between seafood harvest and consumption, sustainable fishing in India is being eroded. In such circumstances, the researchers suggest that fisheries in India can be sustained only if all parts of the seafood supply chain are supportive. To ensure this, they suggest a novel, holistic approach, called the seafood commons, where fishers, traders and seafood eaters work together to support sustainable fisheries. According to the study, creating more seafood commons could be the best way to achieve lasting seafood sustainability in India. In terms of policy, researchers recommend that regulations move beyond those on fishing, and encompass the entire supply chain. The researchers believe building a community interested in creating larger structural change in seafood supplies is the need of the hour, particularly with respect to transparency and visibility of people at both ends of the supply chain. The findings of the study have key implications for how fisheries and seafood sustainability policies should be implemented in India which is now the third largest harvester of marine captured seafood in the world, following China and Indonesia. Further, India's fisheries are also highly integrated into globalised seafood supplies. It is critical to develop a form of management that can work in India because its marine fishing resources have begun showing symptoms of decline. Funded by the Wipro Foundation through the Wipro Sustainability Seeding Fellowship, the study was conducted among seafood eaters in New Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chennai. The research was initiated by gathering evidence from semi-structured interviews with 40 key informants which included 10 informants from each of the four cities. This was followed by a survey of 531 seafood eaters from the 4 cities. Data on seafood restaurants was collected independently of survey data using an online database of restaurants and food services. Divya Karnad, the lead author of the study and Assistant Professor at Ashoka University, says, “Seafood is a common ingredient in many people’s diet, but it is also the last wild food regularly eaten in the civilised world. As a result, most people don’t think of seafood as wildlife, which has deep consequences for sustainable fisheries. Managing fisheries alone is not resulting in global seafood sustainability. Instead, globalised seafood supplies allow for some places to have sustainable fisheries at the cost of others, which have to make up the deficit. The only way forward is to bring the demand for seafood in sync with sustainable seafood supplies”. According to the study, on average respondents ate 6 species and were willing to try 2.5 additional species. Further, a few respondents (4.52%) identified that there were<10 edible species, 25.42% identified between 51 and 100 species and 17.51% mentioned there were more than 200. According to researchers, the lack of knowledge about species diversity limits the choices that a seafood eater will make. The study suggests that awareness and education might be the first step towards encouraging seafood eaters to utilise the diversity of seafood available. Chaitanya Krishna, co-author of the study says, “In addition to other fisheries governance and trade regulation mechanisms, the paper outlines the role that seafood consumers can play in our collective quest for ocean health and sustainable seas”. Dhruv Gangadharan, a co-author of the study adds, “We all eat seafood, and have a lot in common. Our kitchens are connected to the oceans. To eat sustainable seafood, we need to support our local fish markets, learn from fishers, listen to their stories and come together as a community”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/study-suggests-novel-approach-to-achieve-seafood-sustainability/articleshow/85411192.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||India||Movement of the Indian ambassador and the embassy staff from Kabul to India was a difficult and complicated exercise: S. Jaishankar||NEW DELHI: The drive from the Indian embassy in Kabul to the airport doesn’t take more than 20 minutes on a good day. But on the night of the 16th it took the convoy of 14 bulletproof vehicles carrying the Indian ambassador Rudrendra Tandon and other officials almost an hour, every minute a heart stopping suspense. The threat to the Indians was very real and very high. The Taliban had created roadblocks all over the city, making movement almost impossible. Foreign minister S. Jaishankar tweeted, “Movement of the Indian Ambassador and the Embassy staff from Kabul to India was a difficult and complicated exercise.” Movement of the Indian Ambassador and the Embassy staff from Kabul to India was a difficult and complicated exercis… https://t.co/M6Wbv2Kf2Q— Dr. S. Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar) 1629205114000When the first groups of Taliban arrived at the outskirts of Kabul on the 14th, it appeared they might mount a siege on the city, work out a deal and then thrash out some kind of an interim power sharing arrangement. But the Taliban were following a different script — they entered the city from all sides, which gave in without resistance. When Ashraf Ghani and his coterie fled on 15th evening, all bets were off. All police and security vanished, according to sources. Evacuation became imperative, but in the prevailing circumstances, fraught with danger. The security of the Indian officials was the primary concern for the government. PM Modi and the leadership were very clear on this. Modi, NSA Ajit Doval and foreign minister S. Jaishankar were in the lead, while the operations were led by JP Singh, joint secretary MEA, while Indian ambassador Rudrendra Tandon was holding up the Kabul end of things. Kabul airport was functional on the 15th, when the last Air India flight brought back 129 people. But watching pictures of crowds storm aircraft in Kabul, India decided to hold back civilian flights. It was also decided to divide the evacuation into two stages. The logistics planning involved two stages — transfer from embassy to airport, and airport to India. The second was relatively easier. The first became the problem. The Taliban roadblocks outside the Indian embassy were bad enough. What was worse was that there was no armed escort for the Indians to travel safely to the airport. Intelligence suggested that the 15 check posts erected between the embassy and airport were filled with all manner of people — Taliban, LeT and Haqqani (ISI-sponsored) operatives, some even suspected to be Daesh. Indians are anyway vulnerable, having sustained numerous attacks, particularly by the LeT and Haqqanis. Travelling unescorted was not an option. The Americans would not help, citing their own evacuation responsibilities. Finally, the Indian security agencies gathered a group of “local assets” who could negotiate with the men manning the check posts and get to the airport. The plan was highly risky, though in the circumstances, the best that could have been done. On Sunday night, the government moved the first batch of 45 officials in a convoy at night to the airport. A C-17 aircraft had taken off at night from India and picked them up on 16th morning, bringing them back by the afternoon. But things deteriorated and became volatile on the 16th. Ordinary Afghans stormed the airport, and the world saw heart-rending scenes of people climbing on top of aircraft, crowding into US Air Force aircraft to get out. Armed Taliban were all over the city, roads were jammed. The Indians had to wait for nightfall. By then, many Indian citizens in Kabul, who hadn’t obeyed government travel advisories in time turned up at the embassy. They could not be turned away. A convoy of 14 vehicles, bookended by armed ITBP personnel and the “local” escort set off for the airport late at night. By then all documents had been shredded and the embassy pared down to the minimum. India hasn’t officially closed the embassy, with Afghan staff continuing to man it. It has been evacuated in view of the prevailing situation. A second C-17 took off from Hindon on 16th night and parked in Dushanbe, ready to hop over to Kabul. The Americans, who had, by then, taken control of Kabul airport, gave the Indian aircraft a three-hour window. But first they had to get the officials and other Indian nationals to the airport safely. The midnight drive was nothing short of hair-raising. At every checkpost, the local escort “negotiated” movement. Back in New Delhi, Modi and Doval and other top officials stayed up late at night, following the convoy through Kabul’s streets until they were safely through the gates of the airport. Jaishankar was monitoring from the plane that he was travelling in to the US. At one point, it needed high level intervention to get the Americans to facilitate the Indian movement. The Indians had to wait for daybreak, when the C-17 arrived from Dushanbe. The return home was over Iranian airspace, avoiding Pakistan, landing first at Jamnagar for fuel and food, before arriving at Hindon. There are still many Indians left behind in Afghanistan, who want to return. The government is waiting for commercial civilian aircraft to resume operations from Kabul before facilitating their return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/movement-of-the-indian-ambassador-and-the-embassy-staff-from-kabul-to-india-was-a-difficult-and-complicated-exercise-s-jaishankar/articleshow/85408770.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||World||EU says it will work with Taliban only if human rights respected||BRUSSELS: The EU will only cooperate with the Taliban if they respect fundamental rights, including those of women, and prevent the use of Afghanistan's territory by terrorists, the bloc's foreign policy chief said on Tuesday.  Josep Borrell outlined the EU's stance in a statement after an emergency meeting of European Union foreign ministers to discuss the Taliban's quick seizure of the Afghan capital Kabul.  "I haven't said that we are going to recognise the Taliban," Borrell told a news conference. "I just said that we have to talk with them for everything, even to try to protect women and girls. Even for that, you have to get in touch with them."  The Taliban, in their first official news briefing since the seizure of Kabul, said they wanted peaceful relations with other countries and would respect the rights of women within the framework of Islamic law.  Their announcement, short on details but suggesting a softer line than during their rule 20 years ago, was made as the United States and Western allies evacuated diplomats and civilians the day after scenes of chaos at Kabul airport as Afghans thronged the airfield.  Borrell said the EU's priority was to evacuate EU staff and Afghan helpers from Kabul. He put the number of locals who have been working for the EU at almost 400, their families included.  Spain has offered to act as a hub to receive these people before they are sent on to EU countries that have offered them shelter, he said.  Humanitarian aid for Afghans must be maintained and even increased, but assistance will only go to the Afghan government if conditions are met, Borrell said.  Starting a dialogue soon is needed to avert a potential migratory disaster and a humanitarian crisis, he added.  "We have to get in touch with authorities in Kabul the Taliban have won the war, so we will have to talk to them."  Borrell ranked the fall of Kabul to the Taliban the most important geopolitical event since the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014.  "It will have an impact on the geopolitical balance of the world," he said, meaning the EU would have to work more closely with countries such as Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Russia and China.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/eu-says-it-will-work-with-taliban-only-if-human-rights-respected/articleshow/85411262.cms||---
---||Business||Kerala start-up to set up premium roadside restrooms||KOCHI: Travlounge, a startup promoted by Kozhikode-based Beacon group which has got investments in IT and sports, will set up an innovative project of premium roadside restrooms across highways in south India. P T Safeer, Managing Director, Travlounge, said the company has already attracted US$1 million investment from Dubai-based Azcco Global Ventures, as the first restroom unit of the start-up is already under construction at Walayar in Palakkad. Explaining the uniqueness of the service model, Safeer said the restroom units Travlounge setting up would include a premium coffee shop, paid toilet facilities, sleeping boards for a few with hourly charges, a minimart, carwash among others. "The concept is prevalent in the West and we want to replicate the lounge experience of an air traveller to the roadside. It will be an app-based service model with users paying affordable annual subscriptions for unlimited usage. Non-app users and other walk-in customers will be charged per use," he added. The first of such units, coming up at 80 cents of leased land in Walayar, Palakkad with newly-built 8,000 sq ft facilities, will be operational by the year-end. "We would be adding five more units immediately in Kerala including the ones between Alappuzha and Kochi; Thrissur, Wayanad. In 5 years' time, we are aiming at 50 units across south India and 1 million subscribers through the app," Safeer said. Safeer also said it's been really encouraging to have an additional investment of US$1 million even before the first unit is operational, from a reputed NRI group like Azcco Global Ventures based in Dubai which is into retail, manufacturing, import and export. Speaking on the development, Abdul Azis, Chairman, Azcco group said what attracted him to invest in the venture is the hygiene and cleanliness it will bring about to our roads. “It will also help the safety of the travellers by being there between long, lone highways and will ultimately contribute to our tourism prospects,” he added. Safeer said, once operational, each Travlounge unit can generate direct employment opportunities for at least 30-40 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kerala-start-up-to-set-up-premium-roadside-restrooms/articleshow/85411388.cms||Shenoy Karun

The fatal attack on Javeed Ahmad Dar took place outside his residence in the Barzloo Jageer area of south Kashmir's Kulgam, taking the number of political functionaries and workers killed since August 2019 to over 40. BJP has suffered the highest number of 20 casualties in terror attacks during this period. BJP spokesperson Altaf Thakur termed Javeed's killing "barbaric". National Conference vice-president and former CM Omar Abdullah and People's Conference chief Sajad Lone took to Twitter to condemn the latest political killing in the Valley. "Terrible news from Kulgam. Javved Ahmed was gunned down in cold blood. I unreservedly condemn this terror attack.." Omar wrote, without mentioning the party to which the victim belonged. On August 9, sarpanch Ghulam Rasool Dar of Kulgam's Redwani panchayat and his wife and colleague Jawahira Begum were in their rented Anantnag home without their personal security officer when a Lashkar duo shot them dead. They had been living in a secure government-provided hotel until recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/bjp-constituency-in-charge-killed-in-jk-second-terror-hit-on-party-in-10-days/articleshow/85411988.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Serbian president challenges Twitter: 'Delete my account!'||BELGRADE: Serbia's autocratic leader Aleksandar Vucic challenged Twitter on Tuesday to close his account like it did with Donald Trump's, after several media outlets under his control were labeled state-affiliated by the social media site. "I can't wait for them (Twitter) to close my account so I become another Trump in the world,'' Vucic said. Twitter in January deleted the account of the former US president because of the risk of further incitement of violence after his supporters stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6 after he lost the presidential election. Twitter has defined state-affiliated media as "outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution.'' "Who should they cooperate with, tycoons, thieves and criminals?'' Vucic asked. "It is most normal that they cooperate with the government.'' He said the Twitter label is nothing but "censorship.'' Vucic, a former ultranationalist, has kept a tight grip on Serbia's mass media since he came to power 10 years ago. Serbia's pro-government outlets, including the state TV, regularly blast the few remaining independent media in Serbia, claiming they are controlled by corrupt opposition figures or Western embassies. Vucic congratulated all the media that have received such a Twitter label on their accounts, saying they are "spreading the freedom-loving ideas.'' Besides Serbia, the labels also appear on numerous Twitter accounts around the world, including the US, China, France, Russia, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/serbian-president-challenges-twitter-delete-my-account/articleshow/85411355.cms||---
---||World||White House: Taliban agree to allow civilian 'safe passage'||WASHINGTON: The Taliban have agreed to allow "safe passage" from Afghanistan for civilians hoping to join a US-directed airlift from the capital, President Joe Biden's national security adviser said Tuesday, although a timetable for completing the evacuation of Americans, Afghan allies and possibly other civilians has yet to be worked out with the country's new rulers.  Jake Sullivan acknowledged reports that some civilians were encountering resistance - "being turned away or pushed back or even beaten" - as they tried to reach the Kabul international airport. He said "very large numbers" were reaching the airport and the problem of others was being taken up with the Taliban, whose stunningly swift takeover of the country on Sunday plunged the US evacuation effort into chaos, confusion and violence. Pentagon officials said that after interruptions on Monday, the airlift was back on track and being accelerated despite weather problems, amid regular communication with Taliban leaders. Additional US troops arrived and more were on the way, with a total of more than 6,000 expected to be involved in securing the airport in coming days.  Pentagon spokesman John Kirby disclosed that US commanders are speaking with Taliban commanders "multiple times a day" about avoiding conflict at the airport. This suggested that the new rulers of Afghanistan, who swept to power after 20 years of war against the US-supported Kabul government, plan not to disrupt the evacuation. Kirby would not discuss details of the Taliban arrangement, and Sullivan said the question of how much time the Taliban will give the evacuation is still being negotiated.  Biden has said he wants the evacuation completed by Aug. 31. Sullivan declined to say whether that deadline would hold.  Sullivan said US officials are engaged in an "hour by hour" process of holding the Taliban to their commitment to allow safe passage for civilians wishing to leave the country. Asked whether the Biden administration recognizes the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, Sullivan said it was too soon to say and that the Taliban's record of adhering to international human rights standards "has not been good."  Overnight at the airport, nine Air Force C-17 transport planes arrived with equipment and about 1,000 troops, and seven C-17s took off with 700-800 civilian evacuees, including 165 Americans, Army Maj. Gen. William Taylor told a Pentagon news conference. The total included Afghans who have applied for Special Immigrant Visas and third-country nationals, he said.  The goal is to ramp up to one evacuation flight per hour by Wednesday, with potentially a total of 5,000 to 9,000 evacuees leaving per day, Taylor and Kirby said. Taylor said that more than 4,000 US troops are now at the airport. That number is expected to top 6,000 in coming days, with airport security to be headed by an 82nd Airborne commander.  On Monday the airlift had been temporarily suspended when Afghans desperate to escape the country breached security and rushed onto the tarmac. Seven people died in several incidents.  Kirby, said US commanders at the airport are in direct communication with Taliban commanders outside the airport to avoid security incidents. He indicated this communication was in line with an arrangement made on Sunday by the head of US Central Command, Gen. Frank McKenzie, when he met with Taliban leaders in Qatar and won an agreement to "deconflict" forces and allow a safe US evacuation.  Kirby said there have been no hostile actions by the Taliban, and that several hundred members of the now-defeated Afghan army are at the airport assisting in the evacuation.  Kirby said during television interviews that plans were being made to house up to 22,000 evacuated Afghans and their families at three U.S. Army installations in the continental United States. Those locations are Camp McCoy, Wisconsin; Fort Bliss, Texas, and Fort Lee, Virginia.  On Monday, a defiant Biden rejected blame for chaotic scenes of Afghans clinging to US military planes in Kabul in a desperate bid to flee their home country after the Taliban's easy victory over an Afghan military that America and NATO allies had spent two decades trying to build.  Biden called the anguish of trapped Afghan civilians "gut-wrenching" and conceded the Taliban had achieved a much faster takeover of the country than his administration had expected. The US rushed in troops to protect its own evacuating diplomats and others at the Kabul airport.  But the president expressed no second thoughts about his decision to stick by the US commitment, formulated during the Trump administration, to end America's longest war, no matter what.  "I stand squarely behind my decision" to finally withdraw US combat forces, Biden said, while acknowledging the Afghan collapse played out far more quickly than the most pessimistic public forecasts of his administration. "This did unfold more quickly than we anticipated," he said.  Despite declaring "the buck stops with me," Biden placed almost all blame on Afghans for the shockingly rapid Taliban conquest.  His grim comments were his first in-person to the world since the biggest foreign policy crisis of his still-young presidency. Emboldened by the US withdrawal, Taliban fighters swept across the country last week and captured the capital, Kabul, on Sunday, sending US-backed Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fleeing the country.  Biden said he had warned Ghani - who was appointed Afghanistan's president in a US-negotiated agreement - to be prepared to fight a civil war with the Taliban after US forces left. "They failed to do any of that," he said.  At home, it all sparked sharp criticism, even from members of Biden's own political party, who implored the White House to do more to rescue fleeing Afghans, especially those who had aided the two-decade American military effort.  "We didn't need to be seeing the scenes that we're seeing at Kabul airport with our Afghan friends climbing aboard C-17s," said Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat and Iraq and Afghanistan military veteran.  He said that is why he and others called for the evacuations to start months ago. "It could have been done deliberately and methodically," Crow said. "And we think that that was a missed opportunity."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/white-house-taliban-agree-to-allow-civilian-safe-passage/articleshow/85412866.cms||---
---||India||Give CBI autonomy like EC, CAG: Madras HC to Centre||MADURAI: The Madras high court issued a slew of directives to the Centre on Tuesday to “release the caged parrot” that the CBI has supposedly become, including bringing an Act granting statutory status with more powers and greater jurisdiction to the agency so that it becomes “more independent” like the Election Commission and Comptroller and Auditor-General of India. “There is always a clamour for a CBI investigation whenever any sensitive, heinous crimes are committed and there is no proper investigation by local police...such is the trust and faith of the people,” the division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran and B Pugalendhi said while considering a CBI plea that it has been working under constraints such as shortage of manpower. “...Very sadly, the CBI is dragging its feet, whenever there is a demand for (an) inquiry, on the ground that resources and manpower available with it are restricted and, therefore, it cannot conduct investigations. This is the usual stereotypical defence of the CBI before courts.” The bench passed the order while refusing to grant relief in a PIL filed by the Ramanathapuram District Pathikkapattor Sangam, seeking a CBI probe into a chit fund scam. The judges recommended a separate budgetary allocation for CBI and stressed granting the director of the agency powers equivalent to that of a secretary to the government. The CBI chief shall directly report to the minister concerned or the PM, they said. The high court bench directed the CBI director to send a detailed proposal seeking further increase in divisions and wings along with staff strength within six weeks. On receipt of the proposal, the Centre shall pass appropriate orders on the same within three months, it said. The Supreme Court was the first to call the CBI a “caged parrot speaking in its master’s voice” back in 2013, when it censured the then UPA government for its handling of the agency after it was tasked with probing the coal block allocations case. Noting that that an aura of reverence was attached to the CBI, the high court bench said the only way to ensure autonomy befitting that stature was to give it statutory status. The agency should also have a dedicated cadre of officers instead of relying on deputation, it observed. On perusal of a detailed report on the queries raised by the court regarding the resources, manpower, investigating skills, infrastructural facilities and status of cases being investigated by CBI, the judges took note of the fact that the agency has been functioning under multiple constraints such as funding and facilities at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL). The judges observed that delay in receiving opinion from forensic experts was one of the reasons for CBI’s inability to close cases quickly. The laboratory should have facilities on a par with those available to FBI in the US and UK’s Scotland Yard, they said. The Centre should establish at least one CFSL in the south, east and west zones within a year, the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/give-cbi-autonomy-like-ec-cag-madras-hc-to-centre/articleshow/85412824.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The statements by Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid were part of a publicity exercise to reassure a very nervous population and to convince world powers that things would be different from the last time round. The Taliban seem to be distancing themselves from atrocities, human rights abuses and war crimes that their fighters had committed in certain provinces before their march on Kabul. "We assure you that nobody will go to their doors to ask why they helped," he added after saying no vengeance would be sought. He said he wanted private media to "remain independent" but added that journalists must not work "against national values." Earlier in the day, the Taliban declared "a general amnesty" across Afghanistan and urged government officials and women to return to work without fear of recrimination as talks for an "inclusive" government between Afghan and Taliban representatives continued in Kabul. "…so you should start your routine life with full confidence," read a statement issued by Enamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban’s cultural commission. "The Islamic Emirate doesn’t want women to be victims. They should be in government structure according to Shariah law," Samangani said. "The structure of government is not fully clear, but based on experience, there should be a fully Islamic leadership and all sides should join," he added. The mayor of Kabul and the acting minister of public health were among those who had returned to their jobs on Tuesday. Samangani’s statement was followed by a voice message from the head of the group’s military commission, Mullah Yaqoob, son of the slain Mullah Umar, the founder of the Taliban movement, declaring that no one was allowed to enter anyone’s house, especially in the city of Kabul. The statement came in response to reports that the Taliban had entered the homes of people in the capital. In negotiations for a new setup in the country, the Taliban team in Kabul is headed by Amir Khan Muttaqi, who was higher education minister during the previous Taliban regime, while former president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, who once led the country’s negotiating council, are representing the country’s political leadership. The talks, which had started soon after President Ashraf Ghani’s departure, both sides confirmed, are aimed at bringing other non-Taliban leaders into the government, described by the Doha-base Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen as an "inclusive Afghan government". According to Taliban sources, the group’s deputy chief, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who left Doha for Kandahar along with his aides, will leave for Kabul to join the negotiators. Baradar, a co-founder of the Taliban, is the highest-ranking Taliban leader to appear in public since it took back control of Afghanistan. He had spent most of the past decade under arrest in Pakistan. The US, according to sources, had lobbied for his release before starting talks with the Taliban. At the helm of the group’s political office in Doha, Baradar had led talks with the US, which culminated in a deal to end America’s engagement in the 20-year war and their withdrawal from the war-ravaged country. Meanwhile, the Tehreek Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has congratulated the Afghan Taliban on taking control of Afghanistan. "It is a victory for the whole Islamic world," read a statement issued by TTP spokesman Mohammad Khorasani. He reiterated the group’s "allegiance to the Afghan Taliban leadership" and pledged to "support and strengthen the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan". The TTP has long operated from Afghanistan and has been found involved in some of the worst terrorist attacks in Pakistan. Dozens of TTP fighter and key commanders, including Maulana Faqir Mohammad, the outfit’s former deputy chief, were freed from jails in Afghanistan recently by the Taliban along with other inmates. Pakistan interior minister Sheikh Rasheed said, "We have taken the Taliban on board over the TTP issue and told them that Pakistan will not allow its soil to be used against Afghanistan, and that it hopes Afghanistan won’t allow its soil to be used against Pakistan." He added: "Previously, Pakistan was supporting the US, due to which TTP and the Taliban were on the same page. That is not the case now," the minister noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/taliban-vow-to-respect-womens-rights-within-sharia-and-to-seek-no-vengeance/articleshow/85412890.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||Taliban vow to respect women’s rights within Sharia, and to seek no vengeance||ISLAMABAD: The Taliban vowed on Tuesday that they would respect women’s rights within the boundaries of Sharia law and would not seek revenge against those it had fought or against those that had worked with Western powers or the earlier government. The statements by Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid were part of a publicity exercise to reassure a very nervous population and to convince world powers that things would be different from the last time round. The Taliban seem to be distancing themselves from atrocities, human rights abuses and war crimes that their fighters had committed in certain provinces before their march on Kabul. "We assure you that nobody will go to their doors to ask why they helped," he added after saying no vengeance would be sought. He said he wanted private media to "remain independent" but added that journalists must not work "against national values." Earlier in the day, the Taliban declared "a general amnesty" across Afghanistan and urged government officials and women to return to work without fear of recrimination as talks for an "inclusive" government between Afghan and Taliban representatives continued in Kabul. "…so you should start your routine life with full confidence," read a statement issued by Enamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban’s cultural commission. "The Islamic Emirate doesn’t want women to be victims. They should be in government structure according to Shariah law," Samangani said. "The structure of government is not fully clear, but based on experience, there should be a fully Islamic leadership and all sides should join," he added. The mayor of Kabul and the acting minister of public health were among those who had returned to their jobs on Tuesday.

The government announced on Sunday that the Caribbean island’s main oxygen plant had broken down in the midst of a Delta variant-driven coronavirus surge that has resulted in record numbers of cases and deaths, swamping some provincial health systems. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel toured a military unit producing and transporting sparse oxygen to Covid-19 patients, state-run media reported on Tuesday. Diaz-Canel was seen on television inspecting three mobile military plants, including a recently donated Russian one, that produce oxygen and talking to military helicopter pilots ferrying the product to hospitals in various western and central provinces, presumably in the nick of time to save patients gasping for air. "Your work is decisive," he said. Last week similar scenes from eastern Cuba were broadcast, featuring smaller oxygen-producing equipment on military trucks and the filled oxygen tanks transported by various types of vehicles to hospitals, but without the president. Cuba reported 9,800 cases and 68 deaths on Monday. Over the last 15 days there have been an average of 8,891 cases per days and 82 deaths. As of Monday Cuba had reported a total of 536,609 cases and 4,023 deaths since the pandemic began. The Cuban leader, who is also head of the Communist Party, was accompanied on Monday by the head of the armed forces, Alvaro Lopez Miera, who was recently sanctioned by the United States for what it charged was his role in putting down protests more than a month ago in the country. The health crisis, on top of economic woes, has resulted in a scarcity of consumer goods and frayed nerves in the Communist-run country. On July 11 tens of thousands took to the streets in protest, the most serious unrest since the early days of the 1959 Revolution. Cuba's gross domestic product contracted by a rate of 10.9% last year, and by an additional 2% through June compared with the same period last year. Some residents and medical staff have taken to social media complaining of treatment in a land that prides itself on the quality of its free health system. As the country struggles to cope with the surge it is also engaged in a campaign to inoculate the entire 11.2 million population with two locally produced vaccines, Abdala and Soberana 2, which it claims have efficacy rates above 90%. The country has fully vaccinated more than 3.2 million residents with another 2 million expected to get a final shot before September and more than 95% of the entire country before the end of the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/cuba-struggles-to-get-oxygen-to-the-sick-vaccines-to-the-healthy/articleshow/85413207.cms||---

The Lahore police said that the suspect, identified as Rizwan, was arrested hours after he damaged the statue. The police confirmed he was a follower of the banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), an ultra-conservative Islamic group known for massive protests in opposition to any change to Pakistan’s blasphemy law. "The accused damaged the statue with a hammer, which has been recovered from him," said senior Lahore police officer Ghulam Muhammad Dogar, adding that stern action would be taken. New Delhi condemned the vandalisation. "Incidents of violence against minority communities, including attacks on their places of worship, their cultural heritage, as well as their private property, are increasing at an alarming rate. It was only 12 days ago that a mob attacked and desecrated a Hindu temple in Rahim Yar Khan in Pakistan," the MEA spokesperson said in New Delhi, adding, "The Pakistani state has completely failed in its duty to prevent such attacks. This is creating a climate of fear for the minority communities to practice their faith." Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri tweeted, "Vandalism in Lahore of the statue of Maharaja Ranjit Singh Ji, the great unifier of India, has to be strongly condemned.

In December 2020, a young man had broken the arm of the Maharaja’s statue, while two men had attacked it with wooden rods in August 2019. The Sikh Heritage Foundation, headed by Sikh historian, writer and filmmaker Bobby Singh Bansal, had funded the project. The statue was sculpted by local artists under the aegis of the Fakir Khana Museum.

---||India||On recognising Taliban regime, India to align itself with democratic bloc of countries||NEW DELHI: India will align itself with the responses of the democratic bloc of countries on whether the incoming Taliban regime can be recognised, and much depends on the conduct of the new masters of Afghanistan in the weeks ahead. Unlike in the past when India — as most other nations — did not recognise the Taliban regime led by Mullah Omer, fresh considerations may be at work in the current situation. “We will not be the first to recognise them, but will work with the democratic bloc to assess and take a call on the Taliban,” said a source. These countries could be western democracies, associations like the Quad, as well as Asian partners India has worked with in pursuing shared goals such as acting against terrorism and a rule-bound approach to international relations. The current situation is seen to be still unfolding as the Taliban leadership is yet to formally claim leadership of Afghanistan and begin the process of formalising structures of governance, though it is clear that a new Islamic Emirate is on the cards, one that is close to India and will enjoy control over a state. A key determinant will be Taliban’s response to concerns expressed by most nations over Afghanistan becoming a fount of terrorism and the likely treatment of citizens — whether the group will re-impose a harsh version of Islamic law and if incidents of violence and lawlessness will abound. The role of Pakistan, and its likely leverage with the new occupants of Kabul is also being weighed, and it is felt apprehensions that Islamabad is set to gain a big advantage may need more evidence. Much depends on how the Taliban identify their priorities and how much they will cater to Pakistan's interests. It is pointed out that this time around, the Taliban seem a stronger and more confident force, emboldened by their takeover of Kabul on their own might. Pakistan’s ability to manipulate the regime could clash with Taliban seeing themselves as the new centre of the Islamic world rather than a “partner” of ISI. Yet, Pakistan does have strong allies in the Haqqani network and it would look to ensure they occupy important portfolios in the new government. Pakistan was crucial in providing Taliban safe harbours but allies like Sirajuddin Haqqani also have a reputation for wanton bloodshed that can deter international recognition. Sources said a negotiated takeover where Pakistan had a clear role would have helped Islamabad’s cause. As things turned out, theTaliban faced almost no resistance. It also remains to be seen if the group will make space for non-Pashtun communities or hog power. Also, whether the new leader or Emir, will be imposed right away or there will be a loya jirga process that may enhance his legitimacy. Perhaps in recognition that Afghanistan has changed in the last 20 years, the Taliban have so far tread carefully. There is a significant Afghan population that has been exposed to progress, education and foreign travel, and a policy of outright suppression may not work well despite fear of torture and punishment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/on-recognising-taliban-regime-india-to-align-itself-with-democratic-bloc-of-countries/articleshow/85413072.cms||Rajeev Deshpande
---||Varanasi||Brahmins are being targetted after Kanpur incident: BSP leader||VARANASI: In a bid to arouse Brahmin sentiments ahead of 2022 assembly elections, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Mishra, in an apparent indirect reference to the Bikru ambush, has said that “the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh (UP) government has started targeting Brahmins after the Kanpur incident”. Slain gangster Vikas Dubey and his aides had shot dead eight policemen in an ambush in Bikru, Kanpur on July 2, 2020. “After the Kanpur incident, the BJP has been targeting the entire Brahmin fraternity and hundreds of Brahmins have been killed. Instead of the rule of law, the state is governed on the will of the BJP government,” Mishra said while addressing BSP’s ‘Prabuddh Sammelan’ at Ramashrey Vatika here on Tuesday. Mishra added, “If 16% Brahmins and 24% Dalits come together, they are capable of forming the next government in the state.” He also urged the Brahmins to remain united, alleging that the BJP government was trying to acquire all prominent temples by depriving priests of their rights. Further targeting BJP on the issue of Ayodhya and Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) project, Mishra said: “The time has come when the Brahmin fraternity should become alert against those involved in scrapping the cultural heritage of these two holy places.” “BJP is looting and cheating people in the name of religion. Despite being cautioned by the Brahmins across the country to not perform ‘bhumipujan’ for Ram Mandir at Ayodhya on August 5, 2020 as it was not a suitable ‘muhurt’ (auspicious time), this ritual was performed. Even after a year of ‘bhumipujan’, no progress has been made in the construction of the temple at Ayodhya,” alleged Mishra. He added, “These people (BJP) are generating funds for Ram Mandir at Ayodhya since 1993 and collected several lakh crores of rupees, but even after ‘bhumipujan’ they garnered a fund of Rs 10,000 crore. Now, they are unable to tell what has happened to these funds.” Alleging that many temples, idols and hundreds years old trees were removed just for changing the shape of Kashi Vishwanath temple and routes of the temples were obstructed, Mishra asked why the Brahmins remain tight-lipped despite witnessing such a large-scale destruction of temples. He said that if the Brahmins will not stop being afraid of BJP, they will not be called the heir of Bhagwan Parshuram. Mishra also alleged that the KVT trust had a fund of Rs 90 crores but now only Rs 6 crores are left in its account and nobody knows where such a huge amount of the temple was spent. “It is unfortunate to see that all these developments took place in Kashi where Bharat Ratna late Pt Madan Mohan Malviya constructed the Banaras Hindu University to give direction to the world. The time has come when the Brahmins should stop getting misled by the BJP,” he added. Claiming that 16% Brahmins and 24% Dalits will become 40% votes if they get united, Mishra said that this percentage is sufficient to form the government in the state. He asked the people to “start questioning the BJP about its lies”. When BSP was in power, it had given maximum berths to the Brahmins in the state cabinet, but Brahmins could not reach the top positions in BJP government, he said adding that BJP believes in causing differences among people while BSP protects the rights of all sections of the society. Mishra appealed to the Brahmins to stand solidly behind the BSP so that it could form the next government in the state. Earlier, Mishra visited KVT, Annapurna and Sankat Mochan temples with his family and offered prayers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/brahmins-are-being-targetted-after-kanpur-incident-mishra/articleshow/85413286.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||India||SC insists Centre file response affidavit to PILs seeking probe into Pegasus ‘snooping’||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday compelled a reluctant Centre to file a response affidavit to PILs seeking inquiry into alleged misuse of military-grade spyware Pegasus to snoop on phones of journalists, politicians and activists despite the government's vehement reiteration of its readiness to divulge everything to a technical expert committee for scrutiny. Spurning the court's suggestion that it file a detailed affidavit to avoid issuance of a formal notice, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose that the Centre's two-page affidavit covered the issues raised by the PIL petitioners. The government would never risk national security by filing an affidavit, which would come into the public domain, revealing the nature of software used to intercept communications by terrorist organisations with sleeper cells and other enemies of the country, he said. The bench said it too would never want the government affidavit to contain any information that could even remotely compromise national security. "None of us would want to know the mechanism which the defence ministry or any other ministry has devised for the defence of the nation. We will not ask the government to disclose any such thing, irrespective of any petitioner wanting or not," it said. "It is a limited issue before the court. There are some individuals and civilians, some of whom are eminent, who are alleging snooping/interception of their telephones. Telephones can be legitimately intercepted with the permission of a competent authority. What is the problem if that competent authority files an affidavit in the court saying whether or not the interception was done (by the government, with its knowledge and authorisation or illegally)?" the CJI-led bench said. The SG kept reiterating the Centre's stand, sprinkled with examples about designs of terror organisations, that it was ready and willing to place all facts relating to the Pegasus software before a technical committee comprising neutral and independent experts who, in turn, could give a report to the SC. The CJI said, "We are not compelling you to file an affidavit giving this or that detail. We are simply issuing notice for you to file a response. What affidavit you want to file is your choice." The bench gave the Centre 10 days to file its response. Issuance of notice would indicate that the SC is prima facie satisfied about the merits in the issues raised by the petitioners and is, hence, seeking a response through an affidavit. "Please take it from us, we do not want a word in that affidavit regarding defence or national security of the country. Those issues are beyond the domain of the court. We are reluctant even to know about it and we do not want the public to know about it," the bench said. The SC said that depending on the affidavit filed by the government, it will decide whether it would be required to appoint a technical expert committee or devise other methods (to inquire into the issues). The SG gave a detailed explanation on the Centre's reluctance to make Pegasus and its use an issue for public debate. He said the government uses varied software to intercept communication to track terrorist activities and conspiracies by the enemies of the nation. "The nature of the software cannot be divulged as it would prove detrimental to national security," he said. "For national security purposes and combating terrorism, various softwares are used. The petitioners want the government to divulge which software is used and which is not used. The moment this information is divulged, the terror networks may take preemptive or corrective steps. The government has nothing to hide. We cannot hide information from the court or some experts who are conducting an inquiry under the SC monitoring. We will place everything before that committee. This cannot be a subject matter of affidavits and public debate," the SG said. He further said: "Tomorrow a narrative could be built by a web portal that military equipment and intelligence are being used for some illegitimate purpose and a PIL is filed in the SC seeking a direction to the military to reveal which software or equipment are used. If I (as SG) advise the government to divulge these details through an affidavit and make it an issue of public debate, I will be failing in my duties." Mehta said, "I don't think anyone, much less the petitioners, should insist on that information. The government is ready to place all facts before a technical committee of neutral and independent experts. That committee can examine everything and give a report to the court on all issues — Whether we are using, what we are using and for what purpose are we using, if at all we have used. Everything will be before the committee." "Would the SC as the highest constitutional court of the country expect the central government to divulge such details in an affidavit? The petitioners' plea is to inquire into the controversy. The government's affidavit answers that and says it has no difficulty in that. We will constitute a committee which will file its report before the court. It is a sensitive matter which needs to be taken sensitively. If we want to sensationalise it. If there is illegitimate use, no court can countenance it", Mehta asked. With the SC vehemently clarifying that it does not even want to know the national security issues, the SG said, "Each terrorist organisation is aware that there will be some interception by the security agencies of every country. Suppose the government of any country says that Pegasus was not used. There are technologies which we are completely unaware of... The government is ready to divulge everything before a technical expert committee whose report will come before the SC." "The terrorist organisations use several kinds of equipment to communicate with their sleeper cells. The moment any government of any country says they are using a particular software for interception purposes, the terrorist organisation will immediately change or modulate its communication software to such an extent that it is not compatible with the software the government is using for interception purposes," he said. "The moment the government says Pegasus is being used, all apparatus which the enemies of the nation are using, I am told, can be reset to make their equipment non-compatible to Pegasus. These are the issues on which the government will place all facts before the technical committee and the government has no problem if the committee records everything and gives input to the court," Mehta said. On behalf of petitioners, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said, "The security of the state is as important to the citizens of this country as it is to the government. We do not want the state to give us any information about any security aspects in respect of use of any device. That is not our intention." The CJI said, "We are also on the same page." As parting argument, the SG requested the SC to permit the Centre to constitute a technical committee comprising neutral experts to examine the issue and that a report would be placed before the court. The CJI said, "We are not averse to appointing a committee. These are all later issues. We thought the government would file a detailed counter-affidavit. Let us see, we will also think about how to go about the issue. Whether to appoint a committee or not and what kind of committee, we will take a call."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-insists-centre-file-response-affidavit-to-pils-seeking-probe-into-pegasus-snooping/articleshow/85413705.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||Biden has not spoken to other world leaders since Kabul fall: White House||WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has not spoken with any of his fellow world leaders since Kabul fell to the Taliban, the White House said on Tuesday.  "He has not yet spoken with any other world leaders," National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters.  "Myself, Secretary (Antony) Blinken, several other senior members of the team have been engaged on a regular basis with foreign counterparts and we intend to do so in the coming days," he added.  The sudden scramble to get foreigners out of Afghanistan after the Taliban victory caught the White House unprepared and sparked concern in Europe over a potential for mass refugee arrivals.  White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that the administration's focus was currently on the tense evacuation process for thousands of Americans and Afghan allies from Kabul, which is under full Taliban control.  That means "coordination at a lower level than leaders and heads of state," she said.  "If there is a benefit in the president picking up the phone and calling world leaders, he will certainly do that and I expect he'll do that in the coming days."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-has-not-spoken-to-other-world-leaders-since-kabul-fall-white-house/articleshow/85413873.cms||---
---||India||Mumbai, Chennai & 10 other cities to see sea levels rise in 30 years: Nasa||NEW DELHI: Indian coastal areas will face a sea level rise of 0.1 metre to 0.3 metre in the next two to three decades due to global warming, with Bhavnagar in Gujarat facing a rise of 0.22 metres that may submerge vast low-lying areas, a projection by Nasa has said. The sea-level rise and its impact will be experienced in varying degrees in other coastal cities and ports such as Kochi, Mormugao, Mumbai, Mangaluru, Chennai, Vizag and Paradip during the period, shows an online visualisation tool of the US space agency using projections from the latest report of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It features 12 Indian cities, with Bhavnagar hit by 2040 followed by Kochi (0.15 m), Mormugao, Kandla and Okha (0.13m at each location) and Mumbai (0.12m) among coastal cities and towns in the present global greenhouse gas emission cut scenario from the current (1995-2014 baseline) level. Bhavnagar, in fact, shows a higher rise than the global average, which points at a sea-level rise of 0.14 metre by 2040 and 0.2 metre by 2050 from the current level in the present emission cut scenario. Interestingly, the tool shows a decline (0.05m) in sea level at Kidderpore (near Kolkata) by 2040 and this minor fall can be attributed to a shift in ocean water circulation and other climatological factors due to warming. Even in the best-case scenario (net-zero emission by mid-2050), the extent and order of sea-level change remains more or less the same in these cities with a minor change in the level of rise by 2050 compared to 2040. The rise is higher in the long-term (by 2100) but it can be balanced if the world takes deep emission cuts beyond mid-century. Information through Nasa’s online tool that assessed location-based projections can be used by policymakers in taking critical decisions about economic and public policy to protect local communities from the potentially devastating effects of sea-level rise in coastal areas. It will help in taking different adaptation measures, including setting up disaster-resilient infrastructure in coastal cities, taking in view the future sea-level rise scenarios.

The pro-Damascus Lebanese Mayadeen television channel said that Israeli missiles struck an area near the Druze frontier town of Hadr, a particularly sensitive zone as it lies next to the Golan Heights that Israel captured from Syria in 1967. "We don't comment on foreign reports," an Israeli military spokesperson said. The area near where UN peacekeepers maintain a longstanding ceasefire between Israel and Syria has a strong presence of Iranian-backed militias led by the Lebanese Hezbollah group. Israel has over the last two years dramatically expanded air strikes on suspected Iranian targets in Syria to repel what it sees as a stealthy military encroachment by its regional arch-enemy. Israel says it will not allow Iran and its militias to establish a permanent military presence along its borders that would allow Hezbollah to pose a major threat to its security.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/explosions-heard-in-quneitra-province-in-southwestern-syria-state-media/articleshow/85413659.cms||---

According to sources, the CCS was briefed in detail on the current and evolving security and political situation in Afghanistan. The evacuations of Indian embassy officials and some members of the Indian community, as well as some members of the Indian media, were carried out. Modi instructed officials to undertake all necessary measures to ensure safe evacuation of Indian nationals from Afghanistan in the coming days. Sikh and Hindu minorities who want to come to India should be protected and help extended to Afghan nationals, the Prime Minister said. The meeting was attended by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is in the US and hence could not attend the meeting. The meeting was also attended by senior officials, including Principal Secretary to PM P K Mishra, NSA Ajit Doval and Cabinet Secretary Rajeev Gauba. Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Ambassador Rudrendra Tandon were also present. Ambassador Tandon was on the evacuation flight from Kabul that landed in Jamnagar earlier on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-must-help-all-afghans-provide-refuge-to-hindu-and-sikh-minorities-pm-to-ccs/articleshow/85414055.cms||---
---||World||Tropical storm feeds growing anger in quake-stricken Haiti||LES CAYES: Heavy rain from Tropical Storm Grace forced a temporary halt Tuesday to the Haitian government's response to the deadly weekend earthquake, feeding the growing anger and frustration among thousands who were left homeless.  Grace battered southwestern Haiti, which was hit hardest by Saturday's quake, and officials warned some areas could get 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain before the storm moved on. Intermittent rain fell in the earthquake-damaged city of Les Caves and in the capital of Port-au-Prince.  The storm hit late Monday, the same day that Haiti's Civil Protection Agency raised the death toll from the earthquake to 1,419 and the number of injured to 6,000, many of whom have had to wait for medical help lying outside in wilting heat.  Patience was running out in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation. Haitians already were struggling with the coronavirus, gang violence, worsening poverty and the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moise when the quake hit.  Bodies continued to be pulled from the rubble, and the smell of death hung heavily over a pancaked, three-story apartment building. A simple bed sheet covered the body of a three-year-old girl that firefighters had found an hour earlier.  Neighbor Joseph Boyer, 53, said he knew the girl's family.  "The mother and father are in the hospital, but all three kids died," he said. The bodies of the other two siblings were found earlier.  Illustrating the lack of government presence, volunteer firefighters from the nearby city of Cap-Hatien had left the body out in the rain because police have to be present before it could be taken away.  Another neighbor, James Luxama, 24, repeated a popular rumor at many disaster scenes, saying that someone was sending text messages for help from inside the rubble. But Luxama had not personally seen or received such a message.  A throng of angry, shouting men gathered in front of the collapsed building, a sign that patience was running out for people who have waited days for help from the government.  "The photographers come through, the press, but we have no tarps for our roofs," said one man, who refused to give his name. The head of Haiti's office of civil protection Jerry Chandler acknowledged the situation.  Earthquake assessments had to be paused because of the heavy rain, "and people are getting aggressive," Chandler said Tuesday.  Some children were orphaned in the quake and some youngsters were starting to go hungry, said Carl-Henry Petit-Frere, a field manager for Save the Children, which said in a statement that it was distributing what it could to people living on the streets without protection from the wind and rain.  "I see children crying on the street, people asking us for food, but we are low on food ourselves as well," Petit-Frere said, adding that children were warned not to go into houses because they could collapse. "The organizations that are here are doing what they can, but we need more supplies. Food, clean water and shelter are needed most, and we need them fast."  About 20 soldiers finally showed up to help rescuers at the collapsed apartment building.  The lack of adequate aid was made more apparent by the fact that the only help that arrived was from poorly equipped volunteers.  "All we have are sledgehammers and hands. That's the plan," said Canadian volunteer Randy Lodder, director of the Adoration Christian School in Haiti.  Sarah Charles, assistant administrator for the US Agency for International Development's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, said its disaster response teams were forced to suspend operations as the storm arrived Monday, but members were back Tuesday to assess its impact and continue helping.  "We do not anticipate that the death toll related to this earthquake will be anywhere near the 2010 earthquake, where more than 200,000 people were killed," Charles told reporters.  The scale of the damage also was not as severe as that earthquake, she said, adding: "That's not what we're seeing on the ground right now."  In a statement, the US military's Southern Command said it was moving eight helicopters from Honduras to Haiti and that seven US Coast Guard cutters were en route to support the USAID team. Two cutters already are there along with two Coast Guard helicopters and US Navy P-8 Poseidon aircraft that are taking aerial images of earthquake devastated areas, the statement said.  The effort was being mounted "to provide the kind of emergency response that is necessary in a human tragedy and catastrophe like this," U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House.  John Morrison, public information officer for the Fairfax Co. (Virginia) Urban Search and Rescue, said its team was still trying to find survivors. Two US Coast Guard helicopters had ferried searchers to six stricken communities on Monday.  "The team reports that food, health care services, safe drinking water, hygiene and sanitation and shelter are all priority needs," Morrison said. He also noted, "we have not yet found any signs of persons alive trapped in buildings."  The rain and wind raised the threat of mudslides and flash flooding as Grace slowly passed over southwestern Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula before heading toward Jamaica and southeastern Cuba. Forecasters said it could become a hurricane before hitting Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.  Officials said the magnitude 7.2 earthquake destroyed more than 7,000 homes and damaged nearly 5,000, leaving about 30,000 families homeless. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches also were demolished or badly damaged.  In Jeremie, Police Commissioner Paul Menard denied a social media report of looting after the quake.  "If it were going to happen, it would have been on the first or second night," Menard said.  Structural engineers from Miyamoto International, a global earthquake and structural engineering firm, visited hard-hit areas Monday to help with damage assessment and search-and-rescue efforts. Chief among their duties was inspecting government water towers and the damaged offices of charities in the region, said Kit Miyamoto, the company's CEO and president.  Miyamoto said he has seen places struck by earthquakes build back stronger. He said the destruction in Port-au-Prince from the devastating 2010 earthquake led masons and others to improve building practices. People there felt the Saturday morning quake, centered about 75 miles (121 kilometers) to the west, and rushed into the streets, but there were no reports of damage in the capital.  "Port-au-Prince building is much better than it was in 2010 - I know that," Miyamoto said. "It's a huge difference, but that knowledge is not widespread. The focus is definitely on Port-au-Prince."  But Etzer Emile, a Haitian economist and professor at Quisqueya University, a private institution in Port-au-Prince, said the earthquake's impact will almost certainly result in more long-term poverty for Haiti's struggling southwestern region.  Political instability and gang criminality along the southern roads into the region have particularly hobbled economic activity in recent years.  "The earthquake has just given a fatal blow to a regional economy already on its knees for about 2 1/2 years" Emile said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/tropical-storm-feeds-growing-anger-in-quake-stricken-haiti/articleshow/85414091.cms||---

A boat carrying 54 people left Laayoune in Western Sahara around August 3 before the engine failed, according to the testimony of seven survivors who were picked up by the Mauritanian coastguard. "We are working with the Mauritanian authorities to search for the bodies of those migrants who died en route to the Canary Islands," said Boubacar Seybou, an IOM spokesman. Fuerteventura, the closest of the Canary Islands to the African coast, lies around 100 km (60 miles) away from Laayoune. From January 1 to July 31, at least 7,531 people reached Spain's Canary Islands from Western Africa, according to Spanish government figures, a 136% rise compared with the same period in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/dozens-of-migrants-lost-at-sea-off-mauritanian-coast/articleshow/85414157.cms||---
---||India||Can’t file rape case at drop of hat to settle scores: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: False allegations of rape and molestation made at the drop of a hat, in a “very casual manner”, not only trivialise serious offences but also leave the accused stigmatised for life, Delhi High Court said while emphasising that such cases needed to be dealt with an iron hand “due to the serious nature of the offences”. The court made the strongly worded order after it found that two warring couples had registered cross-cases of rape against each other. “People who make such false allegations of rape cannot be permitted to go scot-free. This court is pained to note that there is an alarming increase of false cases of rape and offences under Section 354, 354A, 354B, 354C & 354D (IPC) only to arm-twist the accused and make them succumb to the demands of the complainant” out of fear or shame, Justice Subramonium Prasad observed. “The accused in a false case of rape loses his honour, cannot face his family and is stigmatised for life. Allegations regarding offences such as one under Section 376 IPC cannot be made at the drop of a hat — in order to settle personal scores,” he said. The court further noted that “unless wrongdoers are not made to face the consequences of their actions, it would be difficult to prevent such frivolous litigations”. Taking note of the involvement of two lawyers in the matter before it, the court said it was “tragic to note that practising advocates belonging to the legal fraternity are trivialising the offence of rape. Rape is not merely a physical assault; it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. The act of rape has the ability to scar the mental psyche of the victim and this trauma can persist for years”. It pointed out that time spent by police in investigating false cases hindered them from investigating serious offences. “As a result, it leads to faulty investigations and the accused end up going scot-free. Valuable judicial time is also spent in hearing cases where false allegations are made and (it) is consequently an abuse of the process of law.” The court added that the problem of false allegations could be solved, or at least minimised, to a certain extent, if exemplary cost was imposed on the litigants. Refusing to quash the FIR in the present case, the court said that while it was not commenting on the merits of the allegations, if it was found that the allegations were not true, action should be taken against the prosecutrix and others who were instrumental.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-file-rape-case-at-drop-of-hat-to-settle-scores-delhi-hc/articleshow/85414187.cms||Abhinav Garg

The vessel sank in 1989 in Womens Bay, "and it's been resting there since," Jade Gamble, the state's on-scene spill coordinator, told CoastAlaska.  The first reports of an oil sheen came in a week after the July 28 earthquake, the largest in the US in the past half-century.  It's not clear how much diesel fuel or other contaminants remain on the Saint Patrick  The 138-foot (42-meter) former scallop boat was hit by a rogue wave in November 1981 near Marmot Island. The crew of 12 abandoned ship; only two survived. The vessel eventually was towed to Womens Bay, where it later sank.  "They've been able to minimize the leak," Gamble said. "Our main goal is to ensure we don't have some type of catastrophic release."  An official at the Alaska Earthquake Center said it's not clear if the quake is responsible for the ship's leak, however. The epicenter was about 260 miles (420 kilometers) southwest of Womens Bay.  Despite its size, the quake didn't cause serious damage or produce a major tsunami.  "Kodiak didn't experience anything significant," seismologist Natalia Ruppert said. "And this shipwreck being even farther away from the earthquake source, I guess it's possible."  There have been other major earthquakes that were much closer to Womens Bay that would have produced stronger ground shaking, Ruppert said.  "Maybe it was a cumulative effect of these multiple earthquakes that over the years kind of reached a critical stage - it's just hard to tell," she said.  The Coast Guard confirmed the sheen in an Aug. 6 flyover, and said a contractor is on scene assisting with the containment.  The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund has been activated since the Saint Patrick doesn't appear to have an owner, the Coast Guard said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/massive-alaska-quake-eyed-as-cause-for-sunken-ships-leak/articleshow/85414190.cms||---

Deshmukh, who has been asked to appear on Wednesday, has been absconding for the last few months ever since searches were conducted on his premises in June. His two personal assistants have already been arrested in the same case and have substantiated claims of the alleged bribery. Deshmukh has not been traceable since then despite the agency repeatedly raiding his suspected hideouts in Mumbai and Nagpur. The former Maharashtra home minister is wanted in an extortion and money laundering case. The agency has already attached his properties and those in the name of his family members worth over Rs 4 crore, accusing Deshmukh of misusing the office of the home minister while he held the post. Deshmukh, according to the ED, had asked senior police officers to extort money from orchestra bar owners in Mumbai. He had allegedly set them a target of Rs 100 crore for such illegal collections, former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh had accused in a letter to the chief minister. Deshmukh did not appear for questioning on four past summonses saying he has approached the SC and is waiting for its response. Soon after raids were conducted on his Nagpur premises last month, Deshmukh had released a video message saying he would appear before the ED after the apex court’s decision on his petition. “I had received ED’s summons after which I filed a petition in the Supreme Court. I will go to the ED to record my statement after the SC’s decision,” Deshmukh had then said. Senior ED officials say the ex-home minister has exhausted all his options and has been evading the law which is criminal in nature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/day-after-sc-nixed-deshmukh-plea-ed-serves-new-summons/articleshow/85414350.cms||---

The arrests came on a day when the mother of a Kerala girl, who along with her husband had moved to Afghanistan and was lodged in a Kabul prison after the husband was killed in an US airstrike raid on an IS base, said her daughter had been freed by the Taliban. Another woman, also mother of a similarly widowed girl in Afghanistan, said she had no information. So far the government has been wary about the return of the radicalised women. It is not clear if this opinion will be revised in view of the current situation in Afghanistan. The arrests of the two women — Mizha Siddeeque and Shifa Haris — on Tuesday came in the IS Kerala module case registered by NIA this year. The case pertains to terrorist activities of Mohammed Ameen alias Abu Yahya who, along with his associates, has been running various IS propaganda channels on different social media platforms such as Telegram, Hoop and Instagram in order to radicalise and recruit new members. It was on the instructions of Ameen that Mizha Siddeeque, who was affiliated with IS and had even travelled to Tehran in Syria, had created a page on Instagram to propagate and motivate Muslim youths for the outfit. She had also radicalised an accused in the case, her cousin Mus’Hab Anwar and Shifa Harris — both arrested accused in the case — and was motivating them to join IS. Shifa Haris @ Ayesha on the directions of accused Mus’Hab Anwar and Mizha, transferred funds to Mohammad Waqar Lone to support IS activities. Lone was among the four arrested on August 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nia-arrests-2-kerala-women-says-linked-to-is-terror-module/articleshow/85414468.cms||---
---||World||YouTube says it does not allow Taliban-affiliated accounts||Alphabet Inc's YouTube said on Tuesday it has a long held policy of not allowing accounts believed to be operated by the Taliban on its site, as social media companies faced questions about how they would handle the group that fast gained control of Afghanistan.  The Taliban's return to power for the first time in 20 years has raised fears of a crackdown on freedom of speech and human rights, especially women's rights, and concerns that the country could again become a hotspot for global terrorism.  Separately, the Financial Times reported that Facebook Inc's WhatsApp messaging service has shut down a complaints helpline for Afghans to contact the Taliban, set up by the group after it took control of Kabul on Sunday.  A WhatsApp spokesperson declined to comment on the action, but said the service was obligated by US sanctions laws to ban accounts that appear to represent themselves as official accounts of the Taliban.  The complaints number that was an emergency hotline for civilians to report violence, looting or other problems was blocked by Facebook on Tuesday, along with other official Taliban channels, the report said.  Facebook had on Monday said it designates the Taliban a terrorist group and bans it and content supporting it from its platforms.  A Taliban spokesman accused Facebook of censorship at a news conference on Tuesday, according to a translation of his remarks in a video clip.  YouTube, when asked if it banned the Taliban on Monday, declined to comment. But it said on Tuesday that its prohibition of the group was a long-standing approach.  The Taliban's rapid takeover of Afghanistan poses challenges for multiple major social media and messaging platforms on what and who should be allowed on their platforms.  Asked if it would allow the Taliban to operate official Afghan government Facebook pages or accounts, Facebook pointed to a statement in which it said it respects the authority of the international community in making determinations on recognized governments. Twitter Inc, which is reviewing its rules for world leaders on the platform, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the same question.  Taliban spokesmen with hundreds of thousands of followers have tweeted updates during the country's takeover. A Twitter spokesperson said in a statement that the network would review content that may violate its rules, specifically against the glorification of violence or platform manipulation, but did not answer questions on whether it has any particular restrictions on the Taliban as a group or how it classifies violent organizations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/youtube-says-it-does-not-allow-taliban-affiliated-accounts/articleshow/85414501.cms||---

While the rise in daily vaccination is largely driven by those initiating their first dose, there is also a slight week on week increase in recipients of second dose. So far, nearly 47% of the adult population has received at least one dose, whereas more than 13% of them got both shots of anti-Covid vaccines. The government aims to cover all of the adult population by end of this year. A total of nearly 56 crore doses were administered till 9pm on Tuesday, which includes over 43.58 crore first doses and over 12.36 crore second shots. The rise in daily vaccinations is mainly driven by improved supplies and efforts by the Centre as well as various state governments to expand the coverage and outreach, mainly in areas that are remote and still vulnerable to infection. The government is also making aggressive efforts to ensure the elderly population is covered on priority with both the doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-reaches-new-peak-of-88l-vaccinations-in-a-day/articleshow/85414572.cms||---

Unlike the Islamic State terror group, which was located much further away in Iraq-Syria, the Taliban have returned in India’s immediate neighbourhood with Pakistan-based terror groups like Lashkar and Jaish already detected in Afghanistan, working loosely with armed militias. Sources expressed confidence in dealing with increased pressure in Jammu & Kashmir in the wake of Pakistan-based groups utilising new bases and recruits for the jihad against India. They said that the security situation will factor additional challenges though Taliban have yet to speak specifically on Kashmir.

---||World||UN Human Rights Council to discuss Afghanistan on August 24||GENEVA: The United Nations Human Rights Council announced Tuesday it will hold a special session on Afghanistan on August 24 to address the "serious human rights concerns" following the Taliban takeover. The meeting in Geneva is being convened following an official request jointly submitted by the representatives of Pakistan - coordinator of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation - and Afghanistan, the UN's top rights body said in a statement. The submission has been supported by 89 countries so far. Calling a special session outside of the thrice-yearly regular meetings requires the backing of at least a third of the 47 members of the council - 16 states. The request has thus far been supported by 29 of the 47, including Argentina, Britain, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico and Afghanistan's neighbours Pakistan and Uzbekistan. Several other countries have so far backed the move, including Algeria, Belgium, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and the United Arab Emirates. The Taliban took effective control of Afghanistan on Sunday when president Ashraf Ghani fled and the insurgents walked into Kabul with no opposition. It capped a staggeringly fast rout of Afghanistan's major cities following two decades of war that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Tens of thousands of people have tried to flee the country to escape the hardline Islamist rule expected under the Taliban, or fearing direct retribution for siding with the US-backed government that ruled for the past two decades. The Human Rights Council meeting will be held in a hybrid virtual format due to Covid-19 measures, meaning the majority of interventions are expected to be delivered online. The meeting will be webcast live in the six UN languages. The Council will convene an organisational meeting on Monday at which further details will be announced. The gathering will be the 31th extraordinary meeting of the UN's top rights body since its creation 15 years ago. The last special session, on May 27, was called to address the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, following deadly violence between Israel and armed Palestinian groups in Gaza. The meeting triggered an open-ended commission of inquiry into "systematic" abuses in Israel and the Palestinian territories, and their "root causes" in the decades-long conflict. A COI is the highest-level investigation the council can order. The commissioners were mandated to get to the facts and circumstances surrounding violations and identify those responsible "with a view to ensuring that perpetrators of violations are held accountable".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/un-human-rights-council-to-discuss-afghanistan-on-august-24/articleshow/85414418.cms||---

CBI’s Thiruvananthapuram unit registered FIRs against former Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy, AICC general secretary KC Venugopal, Congress MPs Hibi Eden and Adoor Prakash, MLA AP Anilkumar and Abdullakutty. Earlier, the woman, who was accused in a series of financial frauds, had petitioned the police about sexual abuse by these leaders. While the FIR against five of them was submitted at the CJM court here, the one against Anilkumar is learnt to have been filed at Ernakulam CJM court. The FIRs were registered on the basis of places of occurrence of crime as claimed in the petition by the woman. The complaint said in 2012, when the UDF government led by Chandy was in power, the accused molested the woman at various places, including ministerial bungalows. While Venugopal was an MP representing Alappuzha then, Anilkumar and Prakash were ministers. Abdullakutty, who was in Congress then, was an MLA representing Kannur constituency, while Hibi Eden was the MLA representing Ernakulam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-files-cases-against-5-cong-netas-bjp-v-p-in-solar-scam/articleshow/85414689.cms||---
---||World||Judge won't close hearings in Florida school shooting case||ST. PETERSBURG: A Florida judge refused Tuesday to close pretrial hearings to the media and public in the case of the man accused of killing 17 people in a 2018 high school mass shooting.  Broward County Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer rejected a motion by defendant Nikolas Cruz's lawyers claiming that intense media coverage jeopardizes his right to a fair trial.  Scherer did not elaborate on her reasons for denial, saying she would detail them in a written order later. But Dana McElroy, attorney for The Associated Press, said it was the correct decision.  "It allows access to all of the hearings and filings in this case of great public concern, which is both contemplated and required by the Constitution," McElroy said after the hearing.  Several media outlets, including the AP, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News and CNN had challenged the closure motion. Cruz's lawyers contended that open hearings might publicly reveal inadmissible evidence that will never be heard at trial and that news coverage could otherwise create bias among jurors.  The Florida Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that pretrial hearings are presumed to be open in most circumstances and can be closed only when there are no alternatives available except moving the trial elsewhere in the state. Prosecutors insist the trial must take place in Broward County.  Cruz, 22, faces the death penalty if convicted in the Valentine's Day 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Seventeen people were slain and 17 others wounded in that shooting.  Cruz's lawyers have said he would plead guilty in exchange for a life prison sentence, but prosecutors are insisting that his fate be decided by a jury trial.  A trial date has not yet been scheduled amid delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the sheer scale of the case, which includes interviews by lawyers of several hundred potential witnesses.  Scherer set a series of hearings beginning next week for defense and prosecution motions to be considered. She also said Cruz's attorneys should disclose soon whether they intend to pursue an insanity defense.  "If you are, that needs to be filed forthwith," the judge said.  Defense lawyers said all but one of their mental health experts has examined Cruz but no announcement was made on the insanity issue. Cruz, a former Stoneman Douglas student, had a well-documented history of mental problems prior to the shooting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/judge-wont-close-hearings-in-florida-school-shooting-case/articleshow/85414783.cms||---

Safoora’s cousin, who worked with the ousted government of Ashraf Ghani, has been missing for two days, and she fears she will be on the Taliban’s hit list if she returns. “We don’t know if he is keeping low or if we have lost him. My parents were waiting to fly to Canada, which looks tough now. I haven’t slept since I heard about my cousin,” she says. She’s not alone. Several Afghan students in the city are worried about the safety of their loved ones back home. According to city police, 202 students from Afghanistan are studying in various colleges in Bengaluru.  Nadeem (name changed), who had come to India to complete his MBA and dreamt of becoming a professor, says the first words he heard from his family when he called them were: “Son, we are safe and at home; you just don’t come to Afghanistan.” Another student in the city, who is a father of four, says his biggest worry is the safety of his wife and children, who are in a province adjoining Kabul. “My youngest son and daughter just joined school. They might not be able to get even a basic education. We are worried for our homeland,” he says. Fatima (name changed), 25, says years of struggles and sacrifices made by women and girls of her country for their rights will be undone now. “My school was far from home. I used to go by foot, and it would take 45 minutes one way. I did so for 12 years and started my bachelor’s degree with few facilities. I really don’t want to stop pursuing my goals and be at home without any freedom,” says Fatima, who is pursuing a masters’ degree here. Though it is her dream to complete her education, return to Afghanistan and work for her country, she says if she finds herself in danger, she will find a way and leave Afghanistan. Fatima says they are unable to focus on their upcoming exams. “We are only physically in Bengaluru, but our mind and heart are in Afghanistan,” she says, adding everyone should raise their voice for the people of Afghanistan. “The least you can do is ask your governments not to recognise the Taliban regime. The Taliban can rule Afghanistan only when they recognise human values, human rights and individual and civil liberties,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/afghan-students-worried-about-kin-fear-dreams-may-be-crushed/articleshow/85415227.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Pictures and videos have shown the Taliban with firearms and vehicles that Pentagon troops used or provided to the Afghan national security forces, as well as advanced UH-60 Black Hawk attack helicopters and other equipment at the Kandahar airport.  "We don't have a complete picture, obviously, of where every article of defense materials has gone. But certainly, a fair amount of it has fallen into the hands of the Taliban," said White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.  "Obviously, we don't have a sense that they are going to readily hand it over to us," he said.  Sullivan said losing control of millions of dollars worth of military supplies to an enemy is an example of "the difficult choices a president faces ... in the context of the end of a 20-year war."  He noted that the Black Hawks had been supplied to Afghan government forces to help battle the Taliban insurgency.  But the government forces succumbed to the Islamist insurgents quickly, and gave up control of large stores of weaponry and their helicopters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/taliban-gained-fair-amount-of-us-defense-equipment-white-house/articleshow/85415252.cms||---

The national opinion poll, conducted on Monday, found that 46% of American adults approved of Biden's performance in office, the lowest recorded in weekly polls that started when Biden took office in January.  It is also down from the 53% who felt the same way in a similar Reuters/Ipsos poll that ran on Friday.  Biden's popularity dropped as the Taliban brushed aside Afghan forces and entered the capital, Kabul, wiping away two decades of U.S. military presence that cost trillions of taxpayer dollars and thousands of American lives.  A separate Ipsos snap poll, also conducted on Monday, found that less than half of Americans liked the way Biden has steered the U.S. military and diplomatic effort in Afghanistan this year. The president, who just last month praised Afghan forces for being "as well-equipped as any in the world," was rated worse than the other three presidents who presided over the United States' longest war.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-approval-drops-to-lowest-level-this-year-after-taliban-takeover/articleshow/85415371.cms||---

---||World||Colorado governor voids 1864 order to kill Native Americans||DENVER: Colorado governor Jared Polis on Tuesday rescinded a 19th century proclamation that called for citizens to kill Native Americans and take their property, in what he hopes can begin to make amends for "sins of the past.'' The 1864 order by Colorado's second territorial governor, John Evans, would eventually lead to the Sand Creek massacre, one of Colorado's darkest and most fraught historic moments. The brutal assault left more than 200 Arapaho and Cheyenne people - mostly women, children and elderly - dead. Evans' proclamation was never lawful because it established treaty rights and federal Indian law, Polis said at the signing of his executive order on the Capitol steps. "It also directly contradicted the Colorado Constitution, the United States Constitution and Colorado criminal codes at the time," the Democratic governor said to whoops from the crowd. Polis stood alongside citizens of the Southern Ute, Ute Mountain, Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, many dressed in traditional regalia. Some held signs reading "Recognize Indigenous knowledge, people, land'' and "Decolonize to survive.'' Ernest House Jr, who served as executive director of the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs under former governor John Hickenlooper, said Polis' order is important to the state's government-to-government relations with tribes, the acknowledgment of history, and a movement toward reconciliation. "I think there's oftentimes the general community think of American Indians as the vanishing race, the vanishing people. And I think it starts with things like this," said House, a citizen of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe. "It gives us a place that we were important and that our lives were important.'' A broader push for reconciliation and racial reckoning has occurred across the US in the wake of George Floyd's death at the hands of police, including efforts to remove Confederate monuments and statues of slave traders, colonizers, conquerors and others. Some states, including Colorado, have banned Native American mascots in schools. That movement coupled with renewed attention to Evans' history also prompted Polis to create an advisory board to recommend name changes for the highest peak in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, known as "Mount Evans.'' Discussions are taking place within the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs to choose "more culturally sensitive names,'' said Alston Turtle, a councilman with the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe. Evans governed the territory of Colorado during three years of the Civil War, from 1862 to 1865. He resigned after the Sand Creek massacre happened under his order. Colonel John Chivington led the November 29, 1864, slaughter. He and his soldiers then headed to Denver, where they displayed some of the victims' remains. The massacre is one of several long-ago terrible events that many Americans don't know about, such as the Snake River attack in Oregon in 1887, where as many as 34 Chinese gold miners were killed. Others occurred within the lifetimes of many Americans living today, like the 1985 bombing by Philadelphia police of the house that headquartered the Black organization MOVE, killing 11 people. Rick Williams, a Lakota and Cheyenne descendant who studies Native American history, found the original Evans' order while researching the aftermath of the Fort Wise Treaty of 1861, in which US government representatives met with Cheyenne and Arapaho leaders to establish a reservation along the Arkansas River in eastern Colorado. Williams said only 10 people signed the agreement. "The next two years, it was hell for Indians because they didn't sign the treaty, and they tried to kill as many of them as they could. And when that didn't work, (Evans) issued an order to declare war,'' Williams said. One of Evans' orders deemed Native Americans "enemies of the state,'' and the second called for Colorado citizens to kill and steal from them, Williams said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/colorado-governor-voids-1864-order-to-kill-native-americans/articleshow/85415443.cms||---

Guna, 40, hanged herself at their Chitrapura home early Tuesday morning and soon after, her husband, 45-year-old Ramesh Kumar, followed suit. While police rushed to their residence within 25 minutes of receiving Ramesh’s desperate call, it proved to be too late. The couple suspected they were Covid-positive as they had symptoms. Both tested negative during postmortem. Guna left a suicide note before hanging herself from a ceiling hook in their apartment. Ramesh called Mangaluru city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar and sent him voice messages too. While dissuading Ramesh, the commissioner had the number traced to near Baikampady and police personnel rushed to the apartment. Police found Rs 1 lakh with suicide noteAround 6.45am, I got a call from Ramesh. He said his wife had taken pills at night to end her life but was not successful and had hanged herself in the morning. He said he was going to hang himself too,” said Shashi Kumar. “The couple suspected they were Covid-positive. They were in trauma as they did not have kids and suffered from other health issues as well. I tried to convince him not to take the step and he dropped the call.” The commissioner tried to contact him but Ramesh did not respond. “Immediately, I posted the phone number in various groups, including the police technical group, to trace it. Police managed to reach his doorstep at 7.10am and broke open the door only to find both had died by suicide. We tried our best but failed to stop them,” he rued. In his voice message, Ramesh, who ran a transport business, said: “We are having Covid-19 symptoms for the past few days. My wife is scared of the disease as she suffers from diabetes... I have kept Rs 1 lakh for our final rites.” The suicide note mentioned that the couple married in 2000. In 2002, Guna delivered a baby boy but he died 12 days later. She was diagnosed with diabetes during the pregnancy. She became pregnant again in 2005 but suffered a miscarriage and was unable to conceive thereafter despite trying medication. The note said the couple dreaded coronavirus and since both had symptoms, decided to end their lives. Police said the couple wanted their apartment to be “given to poor people”. Police said they found Rs 1 lakh with the suicide note. The money will be handed over to the family after probe, they said. Health minister K Sudhakar said, “It is unfortunate that Covid-infected persons have committed suicide in Mangaluru. People should not panic if they are infected. Covid is curable and lakhs of people have recovered.” Vishwa Hindu Parishad conducted final rites of the couple at Nandigudde crematorium in the presence of relatives, as per the couple’s wishes mentioned in the note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/fearing-covid-couple-end-lives-in-mangaluru/articleshow/85415863.cms||---

These plants are designed for a combined flow rate of 1.07 lakh litres per minute. While 104 plants are expected to be commissioned by the end of August, the remaining plants will be ready by September 15. The Andhra Pradesh government on its own is installing 92 plants, whereas the Union government will fund 28 plants. The remaining 20 plants will be procured with the donations received from various quarters, funds devised under the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme, etc. According to the health officials, these plants are being set up at the teaching, district and community hospitals having a bed capacity of 50 and above. These plants are proposed to cater to 100% ICU beds and about 50% non-ICU beds. For instance, eight hospitals in Visakhapatnam are getting three 500 LPM plants and eight 1,000 LPM plants. The works on the plants at the hospitals in Aganampudi, Araku, and Paderu are likely to be completed by August 25. Similarly, the plant(s) at the CSR Block, King George Hospital, Visakhapatnam will be ready by September 15. Meanwhile, as many as 6,150 extra beds would be added at 146 hospitals in preparation for the third wave, including 1,550 ICU beds and 4,601 oxygen beds. Works have already been completed at 20 hospitals. The remaining works will be finished by September 10. Apart from the oxygen plants, the health department has procured 23,000 oxygen concentrators and 27,000 D-type cylinders. Oxygen supply, storage and movement became crucial components of the Covid-19 management during the peak of the ongoing second wave in April, May and June in Andhra Pradesh. Even though hypoxia-related complaints had surfaced even during the first wave, the second wave management completely revolved around the then scarce liquid medical oxygen. The consumption had peaked to 640 metric tonnes a day in the second wave from the first wave’s peak of 260 tonnes. The state had to set up an oxygen war room in every district apart from the central one in the state capital after instances of technical glitches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/over-6k-hospital-beds-140-oxygen-plants-to-come-up-in-ap-by-sept-15/articleshow/85408753.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

It is only a media presumption. Had he any issue with anybody, he would have expressed it,” Tejashwi told the media after a closed-door meeting with some senior RJD leaders at the party headquarters before leaving for his assembly constituency Raghopur in Vaishali district to take stock of the flood situation there. Jagadanand, who used to visit RJD office as the party’s state president everyday religiously, has not been coming since Tej Pratap, the elder brother of Tejashwi and son of Lalu Prasad, compared him with Hitler at a Chhatra RJD function organized there on August 7. Jagadanand did not come to office even for flag hoisting on the Independence Day on Sunday. Sources in the RJD said Tej Pratap was exerting pressure on the top leadership to give him more important assignments in the party. It was not for the first time when he made ‘unsavoury’ remarks against Jagadanand. The ruling NDA, however, grabbed the opportunity to attack its main political rival in the state. BJP leader and revenue and land reforms department minister Ram Surat Kumar offered Jagadanand to join his party. “BJP will give him due honour and respect if he joins the party. He is facing humiliation in the RJD for a long time despite being a founding member of the party,” the minister said on the sidelines of ‘Sahyog programme’ held at the party office. Another NDA partner and union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras invited Jagadanand to join his LJP. A similar offer was given to the state RJD chief by the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-denies-rift-in-rjd-over-tejs-remark-against-jagadanand/articleshow/85409537.cms||Ramashankar

Global VPN provider AtlasVPN’s analysis showed that in the first half of 2021, VPN installs in India touched 348.7 million representing a growth of 671% over 2020, thereby pushing India to the top slot as the country with the highest rate of growth in VPN use globally. Overall India is at fourth place after Qatar, UAE and Singapore. “Prior to 2021, the VPN penetration rate in India hovered around 3%, which is near the bottom of the list globally. Yet, by far, the most significant growth in the number of downloads in H1-2021 was in India,” AtlasVPN said. “The increase can be attributed to the rapidly evolving digital ecosystem in India. From 2015 through 2020, India’s internet user base grew at a rate of 24% each year on average, according to our estimations,” Edward Garb, cyber security researcher at Atlas VPN, said. AtlasVPN estimates that India’s internet penetration rate hit 50% in 2020 compared to 2015 when just 19% of Indians actively utilized the internet. Internet shutdowns also prompted use of VPN services to log on to the web. “This year [2021] alone, various regions in India have seen 21 internet shutdowns. India also holds the record for the longest internet shutdown in a democracy, which extended from August 4, 2019, to March 4, 2020,” Garb said. The pandemic year also brought in new use cases as people needed to log in to business VPNs to connect to company servers. Increased time spent on entertainment streaming services while at home also led to the surge. “With many companies seeking to protect their data and employees from possible cyber attacks, VPNs demand increased by 44% over the second half of March 2020, and remains 22% higher than pre-pandemic levels...At the moment, there are 142 million VPN users in the US alone. And the demand is growing every year”, Daniel Markuson, a digital privacy expert at NordVPN, said in a note. Research firm TOP 10 VPN pegs Indonesia and India to be the biggest markets for VPN usage globally at 61% and 45% penetration respectively. Recording instances of specific surges noted in 2021, analysts at Top10VPN found that spikes in VPN usage coincided with local lockdowns in various states. For instance VPN demand surged by 53% in Delhi on April 17, when the region saw a new lockdown being imposed due to a new wave of coronavirus infections. Similarly demand for VPN services almost doubled on March 31 in the Uttar Pradesh when the decision to extend the lockdown was taken. Similar surges were noted by Top10VPN in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in the months of March-April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vpn-use-in-india-grows-over-600-in-h121-report/articleshow/85412089.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Speaking at the launch of one such training centre at the city khadi mall, he said the women who lost their husbands and parents in the Covid-19 pandemic would be given preference in the training to be imparted by the Bihar State Khadi Gramodyog Board. The minister said more khadi malls like the one at Patna would come up in Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur and Gaya to make khadi products more popular and create job opportunities in the state. He said the industries department would lay emphasis on promoting the traditional industries such as khadi and handloom in the state as well. “The demand of trained workers in khadi and handloom sectors will be higher in the days to come,” he asserted. Shahnawaz said the industries department is contemplating setting up exhibition-cum-sale centres of khadi and handloom products at the railway stations outside the state to benefit the workers associated with the traditional industries. The minister said the department would leave no stone unturned to provide benefits to the weavers and related workers during the 75th anniversary of the country’s freedom, which is being celebrated as ‘Amritmahotsav’. To promote khadi products, the state would participate in the 75 ‘hoonar haats’ organized by the Centre. He revealed that the exhibition would be organised in and outside the state in October if the Covid remained under control. The Bihar State Khadi Gramodyog Board has already been sanctioned Rs1 crore for the purpose. In addition, Rs1.25 crore has been sanctioned for imparting training to women and girls during 2021-22 fiscal, Hussain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/43-spinning-weaving-training-centres-for-women-soon-bihar-industries-minister/articleshow/85409448.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Pace of building activity slows as sand reaches remain closed||VIJAYAWADA: The rapid rise in price of sand is hurting the construction industry across the state. The cost of sand increased to Rs 720 per metric tonne in Krishna district on Tuesday, an almost two-fold rise since July 2021. Though large quantities of sand are available at the river basins of the Krishna and Godavari, the industry continues to face a shortage. With continuous floods in the Krishna river, all sand reaches in the district were closed. Officials dumped huge quantities of sand at stock points but opened Chevitikallu sand reach, which led to 132 trucks being washed away. After the incident, mining authorities and a private agency started sand sales at stock points. Sand usually costs Rs 425 per metric tonne at reaches and river bunds on normal days but is now sold at Rs 720 per metric tonne at stock points. A sand truck carrying 18 metric tonnes of the material from Ibrahimpatnam stock point is selling at Rs 32,000 in Vijayawada city. With prices of sand determining the cost of a project, many builders have stalled constructions. Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credia), AP unit urged the state government to reduce the sand price immediately to revive construction activity. “Lakhs of labourers are dependent on the construction industry. Sudden increase in sand price has hampered their lives. We are not in a position to continue constructions at this price. Government should revise the price,” said R V Swamy, media secretary of Credai, AP unit. Trade unions and political parties have also raised the issue of price rise. “The government is adding a huge burden on the common man who wishes to own a house. Earlier, builders used to buy sand in the black market at an exorbitant price. But the government officially permitted a private agency to sell sand at double the price. We will continue our fight till the government revises the sand policy,” said K Rama Krishna, CPI state secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pace-of-building-activity-slows-as-sand-reaches-remain-closed/articleshow/85409192.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Patna||CNLU students oppose hike in tuition fee||PATNA: The students of Chanakya National Law University (CNLU) are up in arms over the recent decision to raise their tuition fee from the current academic session. The agitated students termed the decision to increase their fee during the pandemic as “arbitrary and unjustified”. They appealed to the authorities concerned to save them from any additional financial burden at the present critical juncture. The students further pointed out that they have been charged a sum of Rs16,000 per annum for the last two years as ‘facilities fee’ for using gym, Wi-Fi, water cooler, etc even though they have not availed of any such facility owing to the online classes during the pandemic. And, to add to their financial problem, the university administration has decided to raise the fee by Rs12,000 this year. They would have to pay a sum of Rs1.39 lakh. The fee has reportedly been enhanced for infrastructural development, student welfare and development activities, they said. The students said they have met the vice-chancellor and other officials of the university several times, but the authorities did not pay any heed to their genuine grievances. CNLU registrar M P Srivastava, when contacted, told the newspaper that the university has received a representation from the students and it is under consideration of the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cnlu-students-oppose-hike-in-tuition-fee/articleshow/85409014.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bihar: Four more die as floods affect over 32 lakh people in 16 districts||PATNA: Four more persons died while over 32 lakh people remained affected by floods in 96 blocks of 16 districts in the state on Tuesday. Several trains were either cancelled or diverted on Jamalpur-Sahibganj and Jamalpur-Bhagalpur routes under the Malda division of Eastern Railway (ER) due to heavy rain and waterlogging on the rail tracks. According to Bihar Disaster Management Department, 16 persons have died in the floods this year so far in the affected districts of Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Khagaria, Saharsa, Patna, Vaishali, Bhojpur, Lakhisarai, Bhagalpur, Saran, Buxar, Begusarai, Katihar, Munger, Samastipur and Purnia. Fourteen teams of NDRF and 12 of SDRF have been deployed for relief and rescue operations. Though the floodwaters from the Ganga started receding from Patna and its adjoining areas on Tuesday and the pace of the increase in the water level also slowed down from Munger onwards up to Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur district, a Central Water Commission (CWC) bulletin said the Ganga water level will increase at Munger by 2cm on Wednesday, followed by 6cm each at Bhagalpur and Kahalgaon. However, it said the water level will fall 63cm at Buxar and by 44cm at Digha, 43cm at Gandhi Ghat in Patna as well as by 21cm at Hathidah. The floodwaters have already damaged the railway track near Bariarpur on the Bhagalpur-Jamalpur section of the East Central Railway, while vehicular traffic along the National Highway (NH)-80 has also been disrupted. The Ismailpur-Bind Tola bund was breached and the floodwaters entered Nugachhia town, besides causing damage in Gopalpur, Naugachhia, Rangda and Bihpur blocks in Bhagalpur district. The CWC bulletin said the Sone near Maner on the western outskirts of Patna was flowing 96cm above the danger level, but the water level will fall by 55cm on Wednesday. Similarly, river Punpun was flowing 61cm above the danger level at Sripalpur on the eastern outskirts of Patna, but will fall by 71cm on Wednesday. The trend has brought huge relief to people at Patna and its adjoining areas between Buxar and Hathidah, but the burden on the people is unlikely to ease dramatically in at least five districts of Samastipur, Begusarai, Munger, Bhagalpur and Katihar along both the banks of the eastern stretch of the river. Meanwhile, the water discharge through Kosi and Gandak have come down to 1.71 lakh cusecs and 1.41 lakh cusecs, respectively. However, both Bagmati and Kamla rivers were flowing above the danger level at several points, causing persistent unease in Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Muzaffarpur and Madhubani districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/four-more-die-as-floods-affect-over-32l-people-in-16-districts/articleshow/85410304.cms||---

The ban on launch of new digital offerings will continue for now. The RBI has also asked the bank’s board to certify compliance of commitments made by HDFC Bank. According to sources, the bank received the notice regarding the ban late on Tuesday and is expected to intimate the same to the bourses. Although the announcement came late for Indian markets, the HDFC Bank American depositary receipts (ADRs) were up by nearly 1% in the US stock exchanges at 9pm IST. The bank had earlier said that it was in a state of readiness to issue cards as soon as the ban was lifted. The relaxation comes just in time for HDFC Bank as a large chunk of credit card spending happens during the festive season from September to December. Retailers also announce special offers during this period to boost sales. HDFC Bank had lost over 1% market share in business following the ban, but still accounts for nearly a fourth of credit card transactions. SBI Card, ICICI Bank and Axis bank had made headway in this period. In an interaction with the media last month, Parag Rao, a senior executive at HDFC Bank, said that the bank largely issued cards to customers who had an account with it. As against five crore customers, the bank has issued 1.5 crore credit cards. He said that while the gap would remain because of the bank’s credit policy, there has been a big jump in the customer base, creating a pent-up demand. The RBI had imposed a ban on HDFC Bank after repeated outages on its internet banking and mobile banking platforms. Since then, the bank informed shareholders that it has taken special initiatives for scaling up infrastructure, disaster recovery and enhancing security. In his interaction, Rao said that the bank has used the period since the ban to reinforce salesforce and other channels. “We have used the time to de-bottleneck our processes, quicken our software updates, identify points of failures with partners and put a framework to replace systems before there are any issues.” In addition to the immediate fixes under the short-term plan, the bank has also submitted to the RBI a medium-term plan where it will completely rework its digital platform that will enable the bank to manage future growth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-can-issue-credit-cards/articleshow/85415506.cms||---

The poor attendance of students at corporate and private schools is an indication that many are worried about sending their children for in-person instruction. Government schools, however, have started distribution of school uniforms and books to students under Jagananna Vidya Kanuka. Schools reopened on Monday after a gap of five months and started functioning with half the strength on alternate days. The education department is monitoring sanitation at schools and ensuring that Covid-19 guidelines are followed. But parents worry that a third wave may be imminent. “We have seen the rapid spread of Covid-19 during the second wave in April. We are not confident that schools will be able to follow all Covid-19 guidelines as kids usually play with each other and it is tough to control them,” said N Yashwanth, a parent. Corporate schools are conducting surveys of parents to gauge their willingness to send children back to school. “Many parents are not willing to send their kids to school. We conducted a survey in which around 65% opined that they will go with online classes and not take risks by sending children to schools,” said K V Murthy, a representative of AP Private Schools and Tutorials Association. Meanwhile, government and municipal schools have been registering an 80% attendance. “Students are very enthusiastic to attend classes. As per instructions we are permitting only 20 students per classroom. We have started regular classes for classes IX and X. We are ensuring that there is no crowding in classrooms. Many parents are sending children to take Vidya Deevena kits which is increasing congestion. We will ensure that every student receives the kits,” said K V R R Raju, deputy education officer and circle-2 zonal commissioner of Vijayawada Municipal Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pvt-schools-reopen-with-low-attendance/articleshow/85408947.cms||Venu Lanka

The Union government has clarified in its affidavit that there are no pending dues under MGREGS and all funds were released on time. The state government is yet to spend Rs 1,900 crore already given to it for works to be carried out under the scheme, stated the Union government in the affidavit. The high court asked the state government to clarify on the funds that it has received from the Union government and where they have been spent. Justice Battu Devanand asked the state government to come up with actual situation explaining where the money that was given by the Union government was spent if not payed to those who have carried out the works. He also asked that when the funds are intended for the payment of works carried out under the scheme, why those who have done the works did not receive the payments yet. As the Union government stated that payments towards material component were not pending and excess amount has been paid, the high court asked the state government why the payments were not made when the Union government released funds. The high court asked the state government to clarify whether the funds were utilised or diverted for any other purpose. The high court directed the state government to submit a detailed report on the funds received, works done, payments made and the pending dues by August 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/gave-rs-1900cr-to-ap-under-nregs-centre-tells-hc/articleshow/85408816.cms||Srikanth Aluri

He also inspected the flood relief camps at Ramdhari High School at Pakra and the Makanpur High School in Naugachia subdivision of Bhagalpur and Bharatkhand High School in Parbatta block of Khagaria besides a community kitchen in Matihani block of Begusarai district. He also interacted with people at the relief camps. Nitish told the officials that there should be no slackness in flood relief operations. He also directed the civil administration and health department officials to take special care of pregnant women, elderly and children affected by the floods. The CM asked Bhagalpur DM Subrat Kumar Sen to increase the number of relief camps in his district. “I saw that a large number of people have been affected by the floods. As per the requirements, increase the number of relief camps in the district so that the flood-affected people do not face any difficulty,” Nitish told the Bhagalpur DM. On his return to Patna, Nitish said many areas have been affected by the floods and several relief camps were opened in the affected areas. “I spoke to many persons at relief camps and issued necessary instructions to the officials concerned,” Nitish told reporters at Patna airport. Nitish also said though the Ganga water level was decreasing, people who faced damages due to the floodwaters would be provided necessary relief and help. He said though the highest water level in the Ganga this year was slightly lower than in 2016, the floodwaters caused damages at several places like in 2016. The flood situation in Bhagalpur has been grim as hundreds of villages in majority of the panchayats in Naugachia, Bihpur, Gopalpur, Kahalgaon, Sabour, Sultanganj, Akbarnagar and other blocks in the district have been flooded for a week. Classes at several government primary and secondary schools under Naugachia, Ismailpur, Nathnagar, Gopalpur, Sabour and Kahalgaon have been disrupted following inundation of the school premises.

---||Business||Financial inclusion grew 24% across FY17-21: RBI||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that there was a 24% improvement in financial inclusion (FI) as measured by RBI’s FI-Index between March 2017 and March 2021. The FI-Index incorporates details of banking, investments, insurance, postal as well as the pension sector in consultation with government and respective sectoral regulators. In April this year, the RBI had announced that it would launch the FI-Index to capture the extent of financial inclusion. On Tuesday, the RBI announced the first numbers of the FI-Index, and will henceforth publish the data once a year in July. The highest weightage in the index (45%) is given to the usage of various financial services, followed by access (35%) and quality (20%). The index captures information on various aspects of financial inclusion in a single value, ranging between 0 and 100, where 0 represents complete financial exclusion and 100 indicates full financial inclusion. One of the biggest drivers of financial inclusion in the country has been the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY). There are about 42.6 crore PMJDY account holders with more than 55% being women. While the JDY was launched in 2014, the usage of the accounts picked up with the increase in direct benefit transfers (DBTs), which were facilitated by digital platforms and Aadhaar. The impact of the digital payment in DBT can be discerned from the fact that Rs 5.5 lakh crore was transferred digitally across 319 government schemes spread over 54 ministries during 2020-21. Since the pandemic, financial inclusion got a boost due to the increased usage of digital platform by small merchants and peer-to-peer payments. “Lessons from the past and experiences gained during the Covid pandemic clearly indicate that financial inclusion and inclusive growth reinforce financial stability,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said, speaking at the financial inclusion summit. “As of March 2021, banks have achieved a digital coverage of 95.9% of individuals, while the achievement for businesses stood at 89.8%,” Das said in the summit. The rise of the fintech’s have also supported financial inclusion as they innovated to simplify and promote digital payments like the UPI (Unified Payments Interface). According to a report by Macquarie, while the retail payments (by value) have grown at an 18% CAGR over FY15 to ’21, UPI has grown at a CAGR of around 400% over FY17-21 and now forms 10% of overall retail payments (excluding RTGS) from 2% seen couple of years ago. “Despite being a late entrant, UPI’s FY21 annual throughput value of around Rs lakh crore was almost 2.8x that of credit and debit card (at POS) combined largely,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/financial-inclusion-grew-24-across-fy17-21-rbi/articleshow/85415519.cms||---
---||Patna||Air quality monitoring station at Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University soon: VC||BHAGALPUR: An air quality monitoring station (AQMS) is likely to be established in the postgraduate department of physics at Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) soon. The station, once established, will monitor the concentration of air pollutants and give details of the climate. This AQMS is part of the modelling air pollution and networking (MAPAN) project and was supposed to become functional in 2017. However, it missed the deadline because of several obstacles like non-availability of space and three-phase electricity connection. TMBU vice-chancellor Neelima Gupta on Friday said these glitches have now been sorted. “We have taken a proactive approach for the revival of the project and it may soon become a reality. Once started, it will benefit people of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and adjoining Nepal,” she said. Physics department head at TMBU, Jagdhar Mandal, said the AQMS would be equipped with the devices and gas sensors to detect carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ozone. “It will also have dust particle sensors for detecting PM10 and PM2.5 suspended particulate matters in air. The AQMS will also have devices and sensors for measuring temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure. “Ultra-violet index sensors will help in accurate measurement and analysis of pollution parameters,” Mandal added. A memorandum of understanding was signed between TMBU and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Pune, in February 2017. The aim is to carry on scientific researches in the fields of air pollution, climate monitoring as well as weather forecast. Sources in the university said the AQMS was to be established in 2017 with an expenditure of Rs 1 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/air-quality-monitoring-stn-at-tmbu-soon-vc/articleshow/85410770.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The accused was identified as Shaik Karimulla. Addressing the media, Prakasam district SP Malika Garg said the two rare idols—one a Vishnumurthi and the other a Satyabama—were found in Karimulla’s possession during a vehicle check. Cops said Karimulla tried to flee the moment he spotted the police, but was nabbed. Upon verifying the contents of a gunny bag with him, police recovered both idols, 10 electrical detonators and gelatin sticks, altogether worth Rs 50 lakh. Upon further inquiry, Karimulla confessed that he received the idols from a friend, one Mendu Natarajan Sanjay Nadh (35), who claimed to be a treasure hunter. The two used to meet at a tea shop in Martur village. In 2018, Karimulla received the gunny bag with the idols and explosive materials from Sanjay, who asked him to keep them safe till he returned to collect them. Sanjay had also informed Karimulla that the idols were stolen from two temples. However, after falling out of touch with Sanjay for the next three years, Karimulla decided to sell the idols himself and ended up getting caught by Addanki police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/panchaloha-idols-and-explosives-worth-rs-50l-recovered-in-prakasam/articleshow/85409060.cms||---
---||Business||PFRDA is wary of pension fund investment in startups||MUMBAI/DELHI: The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) is unlikely to rush into allowing fund managers to invest in startups, a top official said on Tuesday. The authority had recently permitted fund managers to participate in initial public offerings (IPOs) of companies with minimum issue size of Rs 500 crore. Additionally, the post-IPO valuation should place them among the top 200 listed companies. “The biggest challenge for us is that we need daily NAV (net asset value) on all investments, like mutual funds, and that may not be possible with startups. Besides, there are challenges related to valuation,” said PFRDA chairman Supratim Bandyopadhyay in a media briefing. On Monday, the government had suggested that LIC and the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation may invest in startups, a plan for which a section of EPFO is not fully on board. While the PFRDA chief did not rule out the possibility, he suggested caution. The relaxation on IPOs comes at a time when the market is flush with offerings and the National Pension Scheme (NPS) has recorded a milestone of 30 lakh non-government retail accounts with Rs 97,000 crore assets under management. Including the government accounts, the PFRDA has assets under management of Rs 6.4 lakh crore — an increase of 31% over Rs 4.9 lakh crore last year. Bandyopadhyay said that the regulator would not go into the valuation of companies going for IPO and investing would be entirely the call of the fund managers. He said that the current headroom for investment under the qualified institutional bidders is enough as only 14% of government employees’ corpus is invested in equities. The pension regulator said that in the last 12 years, the equity investment of the PFRDA has generated a compounded annual growth rate of 12.9% as against 9.9% for corporate bonds and 9.4% for government securities. However, the return on full-life annuities by life insurance companies range between 5.25% and 6% and are subject to change. Bandyopadhyay said that the insurance regulator is in discussions to allow inflation-linked annuity products and this would make pensions more attractive. The PFRDA has floated a request for proposals from consultants to help design a minimum assured return scheme under NPS. The regulator has decided to extend the last date as bidders have said that it was difficult to meet the condition requiring experience in designing similar products for India.The PFRDA is also in talks to increase the points of presence (PoPs) that are entitled to distribute the NPS products. “We now have fintechs like Banyan Tree, ETMoney, Paytm and Zerodha who can provide an end-to-end digital channel for pension. For the semi-urban customers, we are allowing individuals to be registered as PoPs under existing PoPs as last-mile connectivity is very important,” said Bandyopadhyay. ETMoney is part of the Times Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pfrda-is-wary-of-pension-fund-investment-in-startups/articleshow/85415557.cms||---

All the three accused—Amit Kumar (20) of Videshi Tola in Thave, Mohammad Kahim (36) of West Bengal and Vikash Upadhayay (26)— of Madhopur under Rasulpur police station area in Saran, who were allegedly involved in the killing, have been sent to jail on Monday. “Police will move the court within a week to seek the trio’s remand for detailed interrogation. Thereafter we will file a chargesheet and will to put up the case for speedy trial,” the SP added. Arjun’s body was found with his throat slit open buried near a village road at Chetitola under the Thawe police station area in the district on August 11. He was a native of Chitwan in Nepal and was a part of Bihar Special Armed Police (BSAP) company erstwhile known as Bihar Military Police (BMP), deployed for guarding the famous Thawe temple in Gopalganj. The company was scheduled to move to Bagaha on August 11 before which he was stabbed to death. Dayal had gone to attend a birthday party with the trio organised in a guest house near the temple. “An altercation broke out after some comments from the constable. Probably all were in a drunken state. While Vikas first stabbed the constable, Kahim and Amit strangulated Dayal to death. They also slit his throat and stabbed him a few more times. They then carried the body on a bike and fled towards the town after dumping it,” the SP said.  “Police have recovered the knife and bike used in the killing and a missing shoe of Dayal on trio’s confession. The postmortem report is awaited,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/constable-killed-following-altercation-in-birthday-party-gopalganj-sp/articleshow/85410553.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Spokesperson of LJP’s Paras faction Shravan Kumar Agarwal said the minister would leave for Hajipur soon after arriving at Patna airport on August 20. The functionaries and workers of the party will receive him at the airport. According to the sources in the party, Paras would meet flood victims in Hajipur and provide them assistance. It would be the minister’s second visit to the state after being elected from the seat in 2019. His visit to Hajipur assumed significance in the wake of recent tour of some flood affected villages under Raghopur block by his nephew and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan. Chirag, son of former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan, who formed the LJP, had launched his ‘ashirvad yatra’ from Hajipur on July 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/paras-to-visit-flood-hit-hajipur-on-august-20/articleshow/85410496.cms||Ramashankar

But back home in port town Gandhidham, Upendra Goswami’s garden of cats, spread across 500 square yards, has its own history to meow about. The custom house agent has been running his feline garden in Gandhidham with 200 cats since 2017 but it has roots in Goswami’s firm belief that his elder sister Meena, who died at the age of 18 in late 1990s and loved cats, had come back to the family. A cat came to his house in 2015 and its activities convinced him and the entire family that it was his sister who had come back to them. In order to maintain the cat lineage, he started the garden to help the felines thrive. “I started feeling that my dead sister came back to my home as a cat and when I started to believe the cat which did not allow to touch anybody came and sat in my lap,” Goswami told TOI.  Pooh-poohing beliefs, he said: “I was peon in the firm in which I am currently a business partner. The happiness and growth they brought into our lives is unimaginable.” At the garden, it’s all about one big cat family — some sitting on cottages, others watching cartoons (mouse) in a mini theatre, while some more busy in cat business — sans human or dog interference. The cat family grew with time and in three years there were around 125 cats playing in Goswami’s house. So, in 2017, Goswami brought a plot in Gandhidham near his house to create a cat garden to accommodate the huge family. While his cat is a 200-member clan, there are a total 600 cats residing in the park premises for the past three years. Some have even died. Goswami also owns 28 Persian cats and one of them had reached Mundra port by mistake in a container from Dubai. It survived without food for 15 days before the custom officials contacted Goswami. He named the white cat, Mahalakshmi and also found her male partner from a family of Adipur. Eventually, Mahalakshmi died and her daughter gave birth to a cat two days ago, which was spitting images of her mum. Goswamis have named it Akhand Mahalakashmi. Goswami and his wife Pooja look after their 200 cats every day. A principal in a school, Pooja said “I have to get up at 5am in the morning to feed the cats and also after I return home at 1.30pm. We take care of their food, their health and everything.” For all their medical needs, the cats, most of which are street cats, are even taken to Ahmedabad to consult specialists. The family opens the special garden for visitors for four hours on Sunday only for a nominal fee. “I spend Rs 1.5 lakh every month and 90 percent of that money is from my pocket,” Goswami added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gandhidham-cats-get-recreational-park/articleshow/85414166.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Patna||A month on, fuel prices still at an all-time high in Bihar||PATNA: Fuel prices remained unchanged at an all-time high across the state for the 31st consecutive day on Tuesday despite fall in international crude oil rates. Petrol prices were steady at Rs 104.45 per litre and diesel at Rs 95.7 per litre in the state capital as per the price notification of oil marketing companies. Experts said high fuel rates might lead to a prolonged inflation period as they impact the prices of many other commodities, including essential ones. D M Diwakar, an economist and former director of A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, said rise in fuel prices has a cascading effect on all commodities and the government is trying to cover up all the loses by using public money. “The high fuel rates will have a serious impact on other commodities because of transportation cost. The growth rate is constant, but the price is going up. This not a good sign for the economy as may lead to economic stagnation (a prolonged period of slow economic growth, usually accompanied by high unemployment). The unemployment rate has also increased in the country as the demand for the commodities has declined due to high prices, causing recession,” Diwakar said. Sudhanshu Kumar, an economist at the Centre for Economic Policy and Public Finance, Patna, said taxes are major components of the fuel prices in India and there has not been any change in the taxes on petroleum products in the last few months. “High fuel prices will hit the economy and lead to inflation,” he added. Covid pandemic and fuel price rise have been a double blow to the poor and middle class people. Sandeep Suman, a resident of Kadamkuan, said prices of petrol and diesel have been increasing at a rapid rate since May last year. “I have been forced to cut additional expenses so that essential needs can be fulfilled. The government should do something to reduce prices of fuel,” he said. Jyotsna Singh, a resident of Rajeev Nagar, said one has to think twice before spending money on non-essential items due to high inflation. “To balance the home budget, we buy only cost-efficient vegetables and grains,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/a-month-on-fuel-prices-still-at-an-all-time-high-in-bihar/articleshow/85408867.cms||Faryal Rumi

IGIMS director Dr N R Biswas was also present. IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the cafeteria, built in an area of 3000 square feet with an expenditure of Rs 4.5 crore, has a sitting capacity of 300 people. The ground floor of the cafeteria is marked for the attendants of patients admitted in the hospital and the first and second floors for the students and doctors, respectively. The inauguration of sophisticated equipment at the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology of IGIMS has come as a major relief for eye patients. Dr Bibhuti P Singh, head of the hospital’s eye department, said one of the new equipment, optical cohesive topography A, would be highly useful in scanning retina and its deep layers. “It is a non-invasive technique to detect the diseases developing in deeper layers of retina,” he said. Another equipment, C3R (Colegen cross linkage) will be helpful in strengthening the cornea. The specular microscope, on the other hand, will reveal the histology of the corneal endothelium. Dr Bibhuti said other equipment like high-end microscope, vitrectomy and phacoemulsification system were equally important in the treatment process. On an average, 300 patients from different parts of Bihar and Nepal visit the eye unit of IGIMS per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-health-minister-opens-cafeteria-oxygen-plants-at-igims/articleshow/85408932.cms||VK Tripathi

However, the government failed to submit a detailed technical report in the court and advocate general Lalit Kishore sought three-week time for it. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing a PIL filed by one Bharat Prasad Singh, didn’t agree to his request and fixed the matter for hearing again on August 21. Counsels P K Shahi and Satyam Shivam Sundaram represented the petitioner and D K Sinha appeared for railways. It was due to non-submission of detailed technical report that the court had come down heavily on the state government during the last hearing on August 10. The court had then fixed August 17 as the next date of hearing. Kishore, along with additional advocate general P N Shahi, told the court that the first feasible project is to connect the junction with AIIMS-Digha elevated road at an expenditure of around Rs 96 crore. Second feasible option is providing road connectivity with NTPC road which connects Ashiana-Digha road by three inner roads. Kishore submitted that state would require to acquire a land strip of 600 metres in length and 22 metres in width to give final connectivity up to junction and the project would cost around Rs 76 crore. Last feasible option is building foot overbridges and other infrastructures to connect the junction with Rupaspur canal road from Danapur side and it would cost around Rs 12 crore. The court observed that all these details be brought on record through the detailed technical report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patliputra-jn-connectivity-govt-outlines-three-plans/articleshow/85410697.cms||Debashish Karmakar

If all goes well, the recreational lake-cum-park would be thrown open for the visitors by month-end or September first week, Patna Smart City Ltd (PSCL) authorities said. Patna municipal commissioner-cum-MD of PSCL, Himanshu Sharma, inspected the site and said it will be ready within a week as the beautification work has been completed and the workers are giving the finishing touches. “Laser and water projection show has been added to the project this year. Besides, a children’s corner would be a big draw for the visitors,” he said. The estimated cost of Adalatganj Lake Area Redevelopment Project is Rs10.5 crore. It will be the second project under PSCL to be launched after the mega screen project in September 2020. Sanjay Kumar, owner of a private firm selected for the Adalatganj pond construction work, said the trial run of musical fountain, laser and water projection show is being done every day for the last few days. “Apart from adding laser show, the area of open theatre has also been increased to accommodate up to 150 people at a time. The project got delayed as several things have been added and modified after the commencement of the work,” he told this newspaper. The pond was dewatered to increase the depth of the lake by 10 feet. Six pedal boats will be added in the lake area for the visitors, a PSCL official said. Harshita, public relations officer of PSCL and Patna civic body, told this newspaper on Tuesday that for the water projection show, the machine has come from Japan and the trial run has been going on. “We are randomly screening the shows on water display. Water screen is a new technique to display laser light shows and project movies. It is something new for the Patnaites. Once the pond is opened for the visitors, we will run theme-based laser shows, including Bihar heritage and social messages,” Harshita said. Open air theatre with seating space along the pond, lights-musical fountain, fun zone, children’s corner, pathway, water pond, security room, food kiosks, restroom and landscaping are all parts of the project. Ghat area and the temple plaza near the water body would be the major attraction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/trial-run-of-laser-show-and-musical-fountain-begins-at-adalatganj-pond/articleshow/85409226.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||Three companies in fray for Reliance Naval||MUMBAI: Three companies including APM Terminals, a unit of Danish transport and logistics giant AP Moller-Maersk Group, have submitted final bids for the debt-laden Reliance Naval and Engineering, once owned by former billionaire Anil Ambani. The other two parties that submitted final bids for Reliance Naval are Jindal Steel & Power, and a grouping comprising Turkey’s Besiktas Shipyard and Dubai’s GMS. Though 12 companies showed interest in acquiring Reliance Naval, only three submitted final bids. The deadline to submit the final bids was August 15. Reliance Naval has a debt of Rs 11,000 crore and its lenders have transferred the entire debt to the National Asset Reconstruction Company, a newly incorporated entity by public sector banks to manage and recover dud assets. For APM Terminals, Reliance Naval will add to its India portfolio and will bring positive synergy effects with its Gujarat Pipavav Port operations. APM owns 44% in the listed Gujarat Pipavav Port, whose facility is adjacent to Reliance Naval’s shipyard on the Gujarat water margin. Reliance Naval’s creditors are expected to meet this week, possibly Wednesday, to open and evaluate the bids. For Jindal Steel, the fourth-largest metal maker in terms of market value, Reliance Naval can be a captive unit for its hot-rolled steel, which is used for building ships. Not much is known about Besiktas Shipyard and GMS’s plans for Reliance Naval. Besiktas is a ship builder and repairer, whereas GMS is a ship recycler. Reliance Naval, originally Pipavav Shipyard, was founded by Nikhil Gandhi in 1997. Eighteen years later, the company was acquired by Ambani for over Rs 800 crore.Now again, the company’s ownership will change hands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/3-cos-in-fray-for-reliance-naval/articleshow/85415510.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Sub-inspector Prahlad Dongale from the Cantonment police told TOI that one of the two men, Devendra Shamsher Shinde (52) of NIBM Road, suffered injuries to his shoulder, back and hands. The other, Santosh Shamrao Kambol (40), a casual worker from Koregaon Bhima, was injured on his hands and legs.“Shinde is undergoing treatment at Sassoon General Hospital, while Kambol was treated and discharged from the same hospital around 7pm on Tuesday,” Dongale said. Fortunately, nobody was passing by on the pedestrian path in front of the structure, police said. The path for pedestrians falls under Pune Cantonment Board (PCB), while the carriageway in front comes within Pune Municipal Corporation’s ambit. Consequently, there was no immediate clarity as to which body should be held responsible for the maintenance of the structure. Dongale, who is investigating the case, cited an inspection of the spot and said, “The steel bars supporting the structure from behind were worn and damaged by corrosion due to years of neglect. We have taken photographs as evidence and will verify all details before assigning responsibility and registering a case over the incident. For now, we have registered an accident case,” he said. Police have also asked Pune cantonment officials to conduct a structural audit of all civic bus shelters in its limits and submit a report in a week. “We have asked Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited to do the same in PMC limits,” Dongale further said. A senior PMPML official told TOI that the bus shelter was installed around 20 years ago on a ‘build-operate-transfer’ basis. “The revenue from advertisements on the bus shelter go to PCB, so the board is responsible for the shelter’s upkeep,” the official said. “Our officials visited have Sassoon hospital to check on the injured. We are looking into the matter,” the official further said.

Sources said CID has found that the counter-case lodged by the DSP against his wife for assaulting and injuring him was false. Patna police had already submitted chargesheet against Tanuja in the case. Tanuja had lodged an FIR against the DSP and his nine family members with Rupaspur police station on February 10 last year, accusing them of assaulting and attempting to kill her. “DSP’s two brothers – Omrakash Prasad (48) and Radheshyam Prasad (44) – were arrested from Chandrapura village under the Bramhapur police station area in Buxar on August 12. More arrests will take place in the case,” he said. In addition, CID has got another FIR registered against the DSP with Gopalganj’s SC/ST police station for wrongfully restraining one Surendra Gor inside his office, voluntarily hurting him and making him sign on a blank paper. This FIR was registered on June 30 this year. The DSP, who is evading arrest in the rape case, was posted in Gopalganj in 2014. The FIR for raping the minor girl was registered with Women’s police station in Gaya on May 27 this year. The DSP was accused of raping the girl in his official quarter on Dussehra in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/trouble-mounts-for-rape-accused-dsp/articleshow/85409613.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The mastermind of the theft Kushal Shah, a resident of Pal in Surat, and the receiver of goods Pankajkumar Khatik, were nabbed while Shah’s father Shivlal, truck driver Ramesh Patel and cleaner Salman are absconding. Sources in the local crime branch of Vadodara rural police said an e-commerce major had dispatched products from Bhiwandi in Maharashtra for Farrukhnagar in Haryana on July 31 through a logistics company. The company’s driver Patel and attendant Salman unloaded the products including sportswear of a popular brand, 485 smart phones, 827 bluetooth earphones, 35 laptops, 135 cameras, kitchenware and appliances and clothes at a godown near Diamondnagar in Surat. Later, they parked their truck outside a hotel near Karjan on national highway-48. “When the hotel’s owner contacted the truck owner, the theft came to light and they registered a complaint,” said a police official. When police checked CCTV footage of the hotel and of other places where the truck had stopped, involvement of Shah, Shivlal and Khatik came to light. “Since the truck had a GPS device, we checked godowns in Surat where the truck had stopped for a long time. During the search, we found goods worth Rs 1.5 crore in one of the godowns and we could reach the kingpin,” said the police official. Shah was picked up from his house and he admitted involvement of his father and Khatik too. While Shivlal was not found, a team of cops nabbed Khatik from his house in Saraspur in Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-caught-for-theft-of-e-com-firm-goods/articleshow/85411399.cms||---

The procession will comprise seven trucks carrying five tazias (replica of mausoleum of Imam Hussain) with 15 persons on each truck and shall not exceed 100. They will have to be dual vaccinated and completed 14 days after the second dose. Only 25 of them will enter the cemetery. No crowds will be permitted at any point of the procession. It will be the only procession in representative capacity on behalf of the Shia community in the state. The direction by a bench of Justices K K Tated and Prithviraj Chavan came on a petition by All-India Idaara-e-Tahafuz-Hussainiyat that said the August 9 unlock guidelines disallows processions and asks Muslims to observe Moharrum at home. In August 2020, HC had allowed only one tazia with five persons on a truck. Senior advocate Rajendra Shirodkar, for the NGO, said it is seeking a similar order with more persons only on August 20 (holy day of Ashura). “Since the situation was grave last year, limited persons were permitted. This year, there are relaxations by the government,” he added. Government pleader Poornima Kantharia said the latest guidelines do not permit religious processions and it will be difficult for police to control crowds. Justice Tated said, “Today’s position is you have relaxed all other things.” Shirodkar said last year the procession did not breach HC’s order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/one-moharrum-procession-on-aug-20-with-curbs-in-state-bombay-hc/articleshow/85413782.cms||---
---||Business||Drop ‘boss should decide’ legacy to boost innovation||By Tapan SinghelA few days ago, we had an important meeting to discuss an issue that was hampering the progress of a particular project. All of us were racking our brains to come up with a solution that could be a win-win for all the stakeholders involved. One colleague, who was at least 20 years younger than me, shared an alternative, which he thought — if executed properly — could certainly be helpful. My only question to him was, what does he need and how can I be of help? I firmly believe that it’s important to empower your employees to drive what they believe in. You need to eradicate the thought that ‘boss should decide’ and, more importantly, don’t let age/experience become a barrier for you to accept an idea. This approach gives a boost to your employees to come up with ideas and give voice to them, rather than being reluctant in sharing their thoughts. While we do hear about an open-door policy in many organisations, I feel there needs to be an open-minded culture that should be cultivated. Unless the culture of employee empowerment is institutionalised, it remains limited to an academic discussion. Another important aspect that’s linked to freedom of thought is the freedom to fail. It’s not right to always expect wonders from people in their first shot. There’s a learning curve — you fail for the first time, second time and then you learn and succeed in your third attempt. There’s a possibility that you may not succeed at all. What do you do then? Just let people brood over their failure or encourage them to gather their bearings and try a different approach? There have been times when a particular deal didn’t go the way I expected it to, sometimes I couldn’t meet the targets given to me for various reasons. I didn’t just sit there worrying: What now? Instead, I thought it’s ok to fail as that’s how you learn. This attitude needs to be imbibed in the organisation. Otherwise, the sheer pressure of not failing will prevent people from thinking differently. It’s great to do things differently to achieve your goals, but it is also important to do different things. Additionally, an organisation needs to enable this culture of open mindedness and experimentation with relevant opportunities. While people do come up with innovative thoughts in sectors where their expertise lies, in order to expand their horizon, organisations need to increase their exposure to various other facets that are linked to what they do. Today, we see people working in silos, minding their own business, and are supremely limited to just their scope of work. This stems from stagnation, insecurity and a false sense of power only created by one’s closed mindset. Doing your work consistently and well is not wrong, but it does to some extent limit a person’s thinking. Hence, I feel that a project culture needs to be encouraged where people from various profiles come together to solve a common problem statement. Expanding horizons of not just skill sets but bringing in collaborative and social skills is critical. Today, employees want to know more and learn beyond their normal scope of work to grow in their career. Tapping this need, we introduced an internal gig working called ‘Project Economy’ to encourage new thought process and an innovative mindset among the employees. Under this, cross-functional teams come together to work on a live business project and get recognised and rewarded, based on the business outcome. This approach enables to build a workplace where ambitions are powered by collective imagination. Why just limit it to projects? Nowadays progressive, fast-paced and forward-thinking organisations look at collaborations at a mass scale — both internally and with external startups — by organising ‘Hackathons’ to solve their most pressing issues or hack the next hockey stick growth. As the employees get attuned to the culture of innovation, it’s equally important for the organisation as an entity to also be prepared for the transformation. It needs to destroy its conventional approaches, if required, to make room for innovations that are in line with the organisation’s vision and mission. Bring in the spirit of youngness, and I don’t mean just age, but freshness of thought and a go-getter attitude among your employees to foster innovations that not just transform your organisation, but also make a difference to the industry and society as a whole.

---||Delhi||IIT-Delhi extends lifeline to Afghan students||NEW DELHI: Abdul Gaffar, a doctorate scholar in civil engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, swears he is lucky to have reached Delhi nine days ago. With his home city, Herat in Afghanistan, caught in violence and uncertainty, he thought it more prudent to return to the campus with his wife and children. Luckily, his visa was valid and he made a timely exit. Gaffar is one of the 16 Afghans pursuing studies at IIT-D and the only one who is now in Delhi. Given the escalation in the political situation in Afghanistan, the institution has quickly created a helpline number and email ID to facilitate the return of the other students. Times ViewThousands of Afghan students studying in various institutions across the country are suddenly stuck in a difficult situation for reasons beyond their control. Like IIT, other educational institutions too should come forward with scholarships and other schemes to help them tide over the crisis.Taha Aawar has been in touch with the IIT officials, having reached Kabul from Herat. He took admission in IIT-D in 2020. He submitted his passport to the Indian embassy on August 11, but the situation has completely changed now. He has now applied for an e-visa and hopes to catch an Indian evacuation flight. Describing what is happening in Kabul, 31-year-old Aawar told TOI, “People are scared. I am in a hotel and cannot see a single woman in the streets. There are Taliban men everywhere, at all checkposts. I was scared even to look at them.” Aawar was thankful to IIT-D director V Ramagopal Rao, who told him, “Please spread word among the IIT students and prospective students that we will do everything possible with the help of the Indian government for your return to campus.” Naveen Garg, dean of alumni affairs and international programme, told TOI, “We see the human cost of what is happening there and want to help more students. We want Afghan students to apply to IIT-D so that they can get the necessary documents to apply for visas. They can study under our fully funded PhD programmes.” Garg added, “We have the emails from our Afghan students and our office is establishing contact with them. Five have got admission this year and we have given them the papers necessary for visas, but the Indian embassy in Kabul is now closed.” Gaffar narrated how uncertain being in Afghanistan was. “The condition in Herat was bad and it was obvious it would worsen. So, I decided to leave for Delhi,” he said. “When I travelled from Herat to Kabul, I had my eyes closed with anxiety. The highway is always under threat. I had a lot of certificates from IIT, so was wondering what would happen to me if I was caught.” He now worries about his two sisters who were keen on joining university this year. “But now, I don’t know if they can. I will see if I can bring them to Delhi,” Gaffar told TOI. Sharing his experiences about the earlier Taliban regime, Gaffar said, “As an eight-year-old schoolboy, I was forced to wear a 4-metre turban. The texts we read in school were mostly religious. And there were no schools for girls. The Taliban are unlikely to have changed since then.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iit-extends-lifeline-to-afghan-students/articleshow/85413770.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Lucknow||‘Crying, praying & hiding’: An Afghan’s flight to safety||Lucknow: The sun shone bright even at 8am on Monday morning and the sounds of gunshots were loud and clear. As Abdul Ghafoor, 34, stood in front of a giant US military aircraft, heavily guarded by US marines, at the military base in Kabul airport, the sight was no different from any apocalyptic movie. For this young man, who had been helping people return to Afghanistan from other countries since 2014, living under the Taliban regime was not safe. Fortunately, with a German network to fall back on, Abdul was evacuated from Kabul on Monday night and transported to Tashkent in Uzbekistan. After hours of hiding, crying and praying on Tuesday, Abdul is set to land in Germany for a safer future. However, he will now have to live with the fact that he would never be able to return to Afghanistan. “Before Sunday, all of us in Kabul were busy with our regular work. Taliban had struck a deal that they would not enter Kabul but then they started entering the capital and fanned out all over within hours. Immediately, there was chaos and confusion. People started running for kilometres, not knowing where they were going and what they would do,” Abdul told TOI from Tashkent airport on Tuesday. Abdul is the founder and director of Afghanistan Migrants Advice and Support Organisation and has helped over 3,000 Afghan returnees since 2014. He started this work after he was not granted asylum by Norway leading to his deportation in 2013. “The first thing I did was to burn all the sensitive documents and identity cards I had in my office. I went into hiding immediately. Though my network of activists, colleagues and friends in Germany sent me an email informing about the possible evacuation on Sunday itself, I could not take it up that day fearing Taliban influx into the city,” he said. Not being able to reach his home to wind up from Afghanistan forever, it was only on Monday morning that Abdul picked up his laptop and a small backpack of belongings to leave the city. “I have no possessions. I wasn’t even able to withdraw money from my bank account. Safety was the priority,” he said. Overwhelmed by the magnitude of destruction in his country, Abdul said he broke down several times since Sunday. “When I reached the military tarmac on Monday morning, there were thousands of people trying to flee. Two Talibani men, in a futile attempt to disperse the crowd, opened fire in the air causing further chaos. Since it was close to the US base, US Marines retaliated and gunned down the two Talibanis in front of my eyes,” he said. Abdul finally got a seat in the military aircraft around 1am on Tuesday. “We waited all those hours knowing well what dangers lay on the other side of the airport. I couldn’t have gone back since the Taliban had started forcing its way into the houses of activists, journalists and the likes searching for documents and identities to target. I was anyway a target for the Taliban as I had helped returnees who had converted to other religions, infidels and atheists, a completely unacceptable and dangerous job under them,” Abdul added. “It was truly unbelievable when I stood in front of a US aircraft, praying every second for safe evacuation from a troubled land. Many of my friends are still stuck there and seeking help. I am doing everything to guide them. Who knows when all of this will end,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/crying-praying-hiding-an-afghans-flight-to-safety/articleshow/85415101.cms||Yusra Husain

As per that GR, schools in urban areas (for class VIII-XII) and rural areas (class V-VII) were to reopen Tuesday, but many institutions were unsure as no official orders had come from authorities. Speaking exclusively to TOI, Gaikwad said, “After we issued the GR, there were some concerns over reopening and that’s why it (the GR) was put on hold. We have not cancelled the GR at all. A final decision will be taken in a few days as views from other stakeholders are being taken.” Though Gaikwad did not mention it, there were reports that the Covid-19 task force members were not happy with the decision to issue such a GR. The same unconfirmed reports suggested that it was their intervention which led to the GR not being implemented. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad did not comment on this speculation, but said that she too expressed her concerns over the delay in the GR’s implementation. “I spoke to the chief secretary (S Kunte) today, who told me another meeting on this issue will be held soon. This meeting will involve the additional chief secretary and other stakeholders, so we can expect a decision soon. I have told them to act fast as already a few days have passed since we issued the GR,” said Gaikwad. Even if the GR is brought back into play, the final decision on school reopening shall be taken by a committee headed by the municipal commissioner. In Mumbai, the BMC commissioner has already allowed some foreign schools for children of diplomatic staff to reopen on condition that all Covid-19 protocols will be followed and that staff will be fully vaccinated. In rural areas, classes VIIIXII are already open, while the latest GR could pave the way for classes V-VII to also reopen for in-person learning. A private unaided school principal said there is an unofficial consensus among many schools that physical reopening must happen now. “Every school will take its own call after seeing how many parents are willing to send their children, but many of us feel that at least for Std X and XII, classes must begin now,” said the principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/school-reopening-gr-on-hold-but-not-cancelled-edu-minister/articleshow/85413822.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Akash Jadhav held in rioting case now||MUMBAI: Tardeo police on Tuesday secured custody of Akash Jadhav, a minor when convicted in Shakti Mill gangrape case, in connection with a criminal intimidation, rioting and threatening case. In 2013, Jadhav was 17 and was arrested with another minor and four adults. In July 2014, the juvenile justice board sent Jadhav and the other minor to Nashik Borstal School for three years. Since his release in 2017, Jadhav has been involved in seven cases of attempt to murder, rioting and assault. Early this month, Jadhav was arrested by Antop Hill police in an extortion and rioting case and sent to judicial custody. With court permission, Tardeo police took him into custody. Jadhav and his associates threatened the complainant with a knife in June. Besides sections of rioting and criminal intimidation, police booked Jadhav and others under Arms Act. Inspector Rajendra Godse, API Pravin Jadhav and sub-inspector Bajrang Jagtap are probing the case, said an officer. Tareo police arrested Suresh Parab (27), ShaunVera (27) and Siddharth Patil (23) in the case. Two minors have also been named in the case.

He also interacted with patients and got first hand information about the facilities. Secretary to governor, Atul Dwivedi was also present on the occasion. The governor said that infrastructural facilities in Mother Teresa Saket Orthopaedic Hospital would be upgraded to provide better medical facilities related to bone, joints and physiotherapy to patients. Dattatreya also directed hospital authorities to start an online registration facility for patients. Through advance registration, he said, patients would not only be able to avail better health facilities but would also be able to save time. For the convenience of senior citizens, he directed officials concerned to fix OPD timings for them from 3pm to 5pm. The governor called for special emphasis on OPDs for women and children. Dattatreya stressed on the need to expand the surgery OPD and physiotherapy facility in the hospital. He said proper seating arrangements should be made for patients visiting the hospital and the number of physiotherapists in the hospital should be increased to provide better physiotherapy facilities to patients. Besides, he said, there was the need to expand the operation theatre, laboratory and X-ray room in the hospital. Instructing officials concerned to provide free treatment to the poor, he said eligible patients were getting the benefit of free treatment under the Ayushman Bharat scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-governor-visits-saket-hospital-calls-for-free-treatment-for-poor/articleshow/85411064.cms||---

---||Pune||Police book family from Aundh under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act||PUNE: The city police on Monday night invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against the members of an Aundh-based family, which was allegedly involved in illegal money lending, land grabbing, issuing threats and other cases. The family runs various businesses in Aundh and Sangvi. City police commissioner Amitabh Gupta issued the orders in this regard on Monday night. However, the police were yet to arrest the family members. These cases were registered with the Chatushrungi and other police stations in the city. The Pimpri Chinchwad police had invoked MCOCA against members of the family around two weeks ago. A police officer said that the family was running a money lending business and was also involved in land grabbing by forcing people to sign on sale agreements using fire arms, and other body offense cses. Recently, the police had booked the family members in a domestic violence case. Police had also arrested a ‘guruji’ who had misled the family and told them to ill-treat and torture their daughter-in-law, by telling them she had brought bad luck to the family and its businesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-book-family-from-aundh-under-mcoca/articleshow/85411107.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Don’t want to complete my studies, just want to see my family alive’||PANAJI: It has been a week since Mahdia Hussaini has heard from any member of her family back in Bamyan, Afghanistan. When she arrived in Goa on March 4 to pursue her masters in sociology, it was under completely different circumstances. Mahdia recollects her happiness at having bagged a seat in the place of her preference, Goa. But today, her only feelings are those of despondency. As the Taliban takes control of her home country, the fate of her family remains uncertain. “I am depressed as I think of my family. Before this, I had hope and dreams to study and go back to my country. But now, all my hopes and dreams are lost,” she said. Her mother, three sisters, two brothers, a young niece and brother-in-law were all cooped up in her house in Bamyan when she last got in touch with them. As a toddler, Mahdia recollects escaping from the Taliban as they took control of parts of Afghanistan, and knows only too well what the coming days could bring for her family. “I remember running from home with my sisters to escape the Taliban in the harsh winter. I was very young and falling over, and I can still hear my sisters telling me to rush: ‘The Taliban is coming’,” she recalled. Mahdia isn’t the only one concerned about their family back in Afghanistan. In March, Fayeza Askary arrived from the town of Balkh on an ICCR scholarship to pursue her masters in business administration. “Till now I am in contact with my family, but I don’t know what will happen to them one hour later,” said Askary, braving the feelings of dejection. Married, she has two families to worry about. “After joining the programme in March, I had returned to Afghanistan and flew back to India just 20 days ago. Until that time, the fighting was only in the border regions. Balkh is one of the biggest cities, and we are living in the city centre. We never imagined that the Taliban could have control of even the city,” she said. All Fayeza prays for now is to see her family alive. “Now, I don’t want to continue education, I don’t want anything. I just want to see my family alive,” said the 25-year-old. Fayeza too has memories of the Taliban’s rule in her childhood, and said that she never imagined her toddler nephew would experience the same. “The Taliban are not Muslim. They are working to destroy the Afghan people. Girls cannot study beyond Class VI. Women cannot go out alone. These are not the rules of Islam. When I was born, the Taliban was in control of the country. My whole family had to go to Iran,” she said. The students said that the entire country has plunged into a state of shock right now, and with no hope of any return to normalcy. “The Taliban has been telling the people that if you follow our regulation, we will be kind to you and you will be safe. But the Taliban cannot be trusted. But our people are stuck, there is no way to get out,” said Fayeza, not knowing what news tomorrow will bring.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-want-to-complete-my-studies-just-want-to-see-my-family-alive/articleshow/85413786.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Chandigarh||Private colleges reopen in Chandigarh for vaccinated students||CHANDIGARH: On Chandigarh administration orders, colleges began physical classes from August 11, nearly a year after they were closed due to the Covid surge. While the higher education department of Chandigarh had previously announced that it would reopen colleges from August 11 in view of reduction in Covid cases, many colleges in the city decided to open their campuses from August 16. Most students welcomed reopening of colleges. “It is a great feeling to be back in college. Offline lectures are better than online classes,” a student of Guru Gobind Singh College said. For now, classes have not entirely shifted to offline mode. An order issued by the directorate of higher education, Chandigarh Administration said, “The hybrid mode (online and offline) of teaching can be adopted by the head of the institute, wherever required.” “It has been decided to open institutions of higher education for the ongoing classes on or after August 11, as per their academic calendar,” the order stated. It added that only those students who have received at least one dose of vaccine, at least two weeks ago, would be allowed to attend physical classes. All higher education institutes were directed to follow Covid appropriate behaviour and use a hybrid model of teaching (offline and online), taking into consideration the academic requirements, circumstances and infrastructure of the institution, said the notice. Still, there are many colleges in the city which are not yet ready to start offline classes. Principal, SD College Dr Ajay Sharma said, “We are not yet ready to open the campus as we are making a proper timetable and we need time. Most probably, we will take a decision after August 20.” Government colleges across the city are also getting good response with students turning up for classes. At MCM DAV College for Women, Sector 36A, physical classes for second-year students of the ongoing undergraduate and postgraduate batches have started from August 16. These received a mixed response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/colleges-reopen-in-chandigarh-only-vaccinated-students-allowed-to-attend/articleshow/85411125.cms||---

Suspecting it to be a murder case, his father has approached a local court, seeking orders to lodge an FIR. The court may issue an order in this connection on Wednesday. Shiv Prasad’s father, a retired army man, claims that his son had called him a few days before he died to inform that he might be murdered or implicated in a criminal case. “Until a case is registered, I will not perform the last rites of my son. Till then his body will be preserved in a deep freezer,” he told TOI. Shivank’s younger brother Eshank, who works with railways and is posted in Lucknow, told TOI that the Delhi Police had not lodged any FIR in connection with his brother’s death. They had also not provided a copy of the post-mortem report, he said. “My sister-in-law Gurleen Kaur called my sister Poonam Mishra, who stays in Motinagar area of Delhi, and informed her that Shivank had fainted and turned pale,” Eshank said, adding that “they waited for several minutes before taking my brother to a government hospital where doctors declared him dead.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/suspecting-foul-play-behind-sons-death-up-man-preserves-his-body-in-deep-freeze/articleshow/85415123.cms||---
---||Goa||As dengue surges in Vasco, authorities seek municipality’s help to curb health menace||Vasco: As dengue cases have seen a rise in Vasco, specifically in Baina, the health authorities have sought the cooperation of the Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC) to tackle the health situation. “There is an increase in the number of dengue cases in Baina, Gandhinagar and near the KTC bus stand, among other areas. Moreover, three to four wards of Baina have been found to have breeding grounds,” deputy director, vector borne diseases, directorate of health services, Kalpana Mahatme said. Health officials held a meeting with stakeholders on Tuesday at Ravindra Bhavan, Baina. Mahatme asked MMC councillors to help health officials in conducting routine checks in localities and to persuade people to avoid storing water in open vessels and to maintain cleanliness. She said that they have found breeding sites where Gammon India Pvt Ltd has stored its material. In July, 102 confirmed dengue cases were recorded in the state, of which 65 were in South Goa. The chart showed 24 cases in Cortalim, while 41 were recorded in Vasco alone. Mahatme said that earlier they would try to persuade people to take precautions, but now they have been told to take punitive measures. “We can even fine and ask the electricity and water department to cut off connections of the offending parties. We should not be forced to take such actions. Councillors said garages and isolated places yards in unoccupied houses might have breeding grounds. The health department has asked them to note the addresses of such places and that they will take action. Dr Rashmi Khandeparkar said that at the last bus stop in Baina, fishing canoe and their material at Baina beach, private constructions near the KTC bus stand have multiple breeding grounds. “Vasco has no 24-hour water supply, which is the biggest reason for the rise in dengue cases here. People store water in barrels.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-dengue-surges-in-vasco-authorities-seek-municipalitys-help-to-curb-health-menace/articleshow/85414100.cms||Ruvina Khan

He also said that the government would soon be establishing School of Specialised Excellence for Sports along with the Delhi Sports University. Dahiya was a student of a government school in Adarsh Nagar. Sisodia felicitated Olympian Ravi Dahiya and said that through his hard work, a student of a Delhi government school had now become a youth icon for the nation. Under its Mission Excellence scheme, Delhi government had assisted Ravi Dahiya with training, coaches and other sports equipment. The scheme functions at three levels. At the first level, sportspersons up to the age of 14 years are given financial assistance of maximum Rs 2 lakh. At the second level, sportspersons of up to 17 years are given financial assistance of maximum Rs 3 lakh. Players above the age of 17 years are given assistance of up to Rs 16 lakh. “A large portrait of Ravi Dahiya will also be installed in this school so that young children are inspired and motivated to have an Olympic dream and bring glory to our great nation. Delhi government is committed to promoting sports in Delhi at every level. The government is soon going to set up School of Specialised Excellence for Sports along with Delhi Sports University. The idea is to recognise young talent in sports and continuously support them throughout their sporting journey. Admissions to this school will start from the next academic session,” said Sisodia. Dahiya said, “Delhi government had started to support me during the training days even before I was chosen for the Olympics. With the government’s constant support, I hope I will be able to get a gold next time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-to-rename-school-after-olympian/articleshow/85413828.cms||---

The notice further said that the notifying authority reserved the right to subsequently cancel the notification in public interest. No permanent/semi-permanent structure and water, electricity and telephone connections will be allowed on these sites, the notification added. Some of the 24 locations are in Wazirabad, Shastri Park, ISBT, Anand Vihar, Najafgarh Road, Punjabi Bagh, Mayapuri Ring Road, Uttam Nagar, Vasant Vihar, Kalkaji, Mehrauli-Badarpur Road and Kalindi Kunj. According to the notice, the road-maintaining agency concerned would erect the signboards indicating the halt-and-go points for the autos at the locations specified in the schedule annexed with this notification for the guidance and convenience of road users and the general public. This order will also be published in the official gazette for the information of the general public and copies will also be fixed on the notice boards of the office of all districts deputy commissioners of police and police stations in Delhi. Usually three wheelers in the city park outside Delhi Metro stations or remain close to the bus stands, causing obstructions in the smooth movement of traffic. With the designated spots for them to halt and the number of the autos thus controlled, traffic movement may be streamlined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traffic-cops-identify-24-locations-where-autos-can-legally-halt-and-park-on-roads/articleshow/85413910.cms||---

If they want they can now approach the NGT and refer to the new vehicle scrapping policy for seeking review of the decision.”Sources said a review petition filed by the Union road transport ministry a few years back is still pending.Gadkari said the Supreme Court and other courts have been showing concern about the air pollution across different cities and there is a need to put checks on all types of pollution that are posing greater challenges for sustainability. “I don’t need to tell anyone about air pollution to people living in Delhi. The vehicle scrapping policy will help clean our air,” the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-up-to-delhi-govt-to-move-sc/ngt-over-ban-on-old-vehicles/articleshow/85413866.cms||---
---||Mumbai||85,000 self-test kits used in Maharashtra since June: Officials||PUNE: Maharashtra health officials say nearly 85,010 self-test kits have been used in the state from June to mid-August for the confirmation of Covid positivity. The data on the use of the Mylab test kits (Coviself) were uploaded on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) web portal, as the company was considered as a laboratory and mandated the task of records update, like other laboratories. “Of the people who used the self-test kits in the state, 3,656 users (4.2%) tested Covid positive and the local authorities took follow-up actions through the ICMR portal,” a senior state health official said on Tuesday. As the number of Covid has started declining in the state, the demand for the self-test kits has also come down from what it was in June, a public health department official said. The state public health portal has marked self-test kits under the “laboratory” segment. “The onus is on the company to upload the test data on the ICMR portal that gets segregated state and district-wise data,” the official said. A Mylab official said response to the self-test kits was encouraging across the country. An ICMR official three such kits — CoviSelf from Maharashtra-based Mylab, Panbio Covid-19 test from US-based Abbott and Gujarat-based Meril Diagnostics’s CoviFind self-test kit — have so far been approved and more are in the pipeline. “The response to such kits may be a little low now, as the number of Covid cases are low. But these kits are handy when the laboratories are overwhelmed, particularly when the Covid cases surge. Each state has been told to keep a tab on the use of the self-test kits and uploading of the data on the portal,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/officials-85k-self-test-kits-used-in-maharashtra-since-june/articleshow/85413936.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The stretch, with features like bicycle tracks, greenery, selfie points and statues, was inspected by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on August 14. PWD plans to replicate the redevelopment in 11 corridors with an approximate 540km length. Jain and Sisodia held discussions with officials regarding how the redevelopment model could be replicated across Delhi. A government official said Delhi government was undertaking projects for streetscaping and beautification of 540km roads around Delhi in phase one to bring them on par with European models. “We will change the face of the national capital,” Jain said. “This beautiful stretch will now serve as an example, which will be replicated across Delhi. High quality, beautiful roads, and public spaces are the essences of a world-class city,” Sisodia said, adding that PWD had done an admirable work on this stretch and now should work on implementing the same across the city with innovative and unique redesigning. PWD officials said there was sufficient room for planters, while two statues of Bhagat Singh and Rani Laxmi Bai had been installed on the roadside. In addition, two fountains, artwork on the fob, 10 sandstone benches, marble Buddha statue, information boards, and sandstone artwork had been incorporated in the pilot project. A cycle track and footpath have also been built on one side of the road. An official said 11,000 litres irrigation tanks had been developed along the stretch to maintain the three-tier greenery, while seating arrangements had been provided at regular intervals to make it pedestrian-friendly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chirag-dilli-model-stretch-on-fast-track-sisodia-and-jain-take-stock/articleshow/85413895.cms||---

As per the FIR lodged with the police on Monday, the complainant, who owns a shop at Shagun Chowk in Pimpri, paid the suspect varying amounts between June and July for 183 mobile phones and also gave him his credit card. According to the police, the suspect in December last year visited the complainant’s shop claiming to be the authorised representative of mobile phone manufacturing companies. “The complainant placed an order for 184 smartphones for a total of Rs 14.2 lakh of which he paid Rs 4.2lakh,” said the officer. When the suspect demanded the remaining amount, the shopowner gave him his credit card. “The suspect used the credit card to purchases of Rs 10 lakh from mobile phone dealers in Aurangabad,” the officer said.  “The complainant gave him Rs 6.15 lakh more for ‘consignment’ and other charges,” the officer said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bring back LPG subsidy, say pandemic-hit poor||MUMBAI: Low-income group families in Mumbai are suffering in the absence of LPG subsidy amid the Covid-19 pandemic for over a year. Members of many of these families work as maids, cooks, peons and drivers, and they are finding it difficult to make ends meet. Some have lost jobs and switched to selling vegetables while others have faced pay cuts in their jobs, and the removal of gas subsidy has come as a jolt to them. The cost of a 14.2kg gas cylinder in Mumbai on Tuesday was Rs 834.50. Lata Mahendra, who works as a maid in Chembur, said: “It is frustrating that in these trying times, I am not getting the subsidy amount credited to my bank account. I have to pay full price for an LPG cylinder which is essential for cooking at home.” Many like her have started conserving gas to extend the use of a single cylinder to two to three months instead of one. Some have stopped taking LPG and moved to kerosene stoves. Sangita Surve, who works as a cook, said: “We have expenses mounting during the pandemic and the subsidy helped us save at least Rs 400-500 per cylinder every month. The transportation costs went up as local trains were shut and many like us had to spend a lot on public transport to reach our workplace.” Her husband is unemployed while her son works in a private firm but does not earn much. Another maid working in Mulund, requesting anonymity, said that the government should have considered the plight of the low-income groups in cities on “humanitarian grounds” and continued the subsidy. According to sources in oil marketing companies, the subsidies were discontinued by the government in metro and major cities but are being given only in a few remote and interior areas in the country. The sources said that since June 2020, the government has not been depositing the subsidy in bank accounts. This is because of fluctuations in global oil prices last year, due to which the price of gas without subsidy was almost close to the price at which the subsidy was given, said sources. Citizens pointed out that prices had increased drastically in a year, from crossing Rs 600 mark in November to over Rs 700 in February and crossing Rs 800 mark in May. It was heading towards the Rs 1000 mark, and so there was an urgent need for subsidy, said many people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bring-back-lpg-subsidy-say-pandemic-hit-poor/articleshow/85415642.cms||Somit Sen

Some of you may treasure it and retain it forever, but most of you would probably discard it in a couple of days. How about a rakhi that sprouts to new life after Raksha Bandhan? While kitschy rakhis and those bearing cartoons have always been a hit, a number of sellers are now promoting eco-friendly rakhis that spring to life after their time on the wrist is over. Though more expensive than a regular rakhi, a green one is made by weaving threads around seeds that can be planted after use. 21Fools.com, one of many platforms promoting these innovative rakhis, said these festive adornments have been made from organic cotton grown by farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and then naturally dyed. “Over 35 craftswomen handmade these rakhis by crocheting the dyed yarn and then embedding live seeds in them. Once the festival is over, these can be sown and grown,” explained Divyanshu Asopa, founder, 21Fools.com. Asopa said the to-be-discarded rakhi should be soaked in water first and then buried in shallow soil, taking care not to bury it too deep. “In the soil, and watered carefully, it will be a week before the seeds germinate,” added Asopa. “The rakhis are also packaged using recycled cardboard and handmade paper, making them completely biodegradable.” The adornments cost Rs 349 on the 21Fools website. IGP.com, another multi-gifting website, too has introduced seed rakhis. Fabricated in over 2,000 designs, they are priced between Rs 575 and Rs 725. Tarun Joshi, founder, IGP, said, “These are beautiful, handcrafted rakhis made from natural cotton threads with a seed incorporated in the dial of the rakhi. These plantable rakhis are the perfect way to celebrate your bond with your siblings and to celebrate Mother Nature.” Sonu Singh, a street vendor in west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar, said the eco-friendly options had been gradually gaining popularity over the years despite their higher cost. “We don’t get too many pieces, but they still sell out.” Singh said. “We have started ordering more of them because people enquire about such types of rachis. They typically sell for around Rs 250.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-ties-that-bind-seed-rakhis-an-idea-thats-growing/articleshow/85413907.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The facility has to be advertised more. Information on the ‘Parivahan’ portal is not enough, and more steps are needed,” said a department official. Officials at the Pune RTO said that while the number of people coming to take the test has reduced, but it has not stopped completely. “One of the aims was to reduce the crowd at the RTO during the pandemic. Though it is difficult to give Pune-centric figures, around 50% people are still visiting the RTO to give the test,” said an official. Transport department officials said that internet connectivity was also a big concern. “In many cases, the examinee refuses to link his/her Aadhaar card to the test. In such cases, the candidate must take the exam by coming to the office. Internet connectivity is also a major reason and many people from rural and suburban areas have no choice but to come to the RTO or camps for the tests,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/learners-licence-test-at-rtos-remains-popular/articleshow/85411221.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Madurai||Get Madurai AIIMS ready in 3 yrs: HC to Centre||Madurai: Taking into account that no substantial progress has been made for the establishment of the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) in Madurai, the Madras high court on Tuesday observed that it expects the Centre to take appropriate steps to establish it at the earliest, preferably within 36 months. A division bench of justice N Kirubakaran and Justice B Pugalendhi observed that progress with regard to establishment of AIIMS in Madurai is not going on at an expected speed. While the other proposals for establishments of AIIMS in various places are progressing well, substantial progress has not been made with regard to establishing AIIMS in Madurai though it was stated that the construction would be completed within 45 months. The court passed the order while disposing of a public interest litigation filed by K K Ramesh, a litigant appearing as party-in-person from Madurai seeking for a direction to the Centre to allocate sufficient funds and to speed up the construction works for the establishment of AIIMS at Madurai. The judges observed that as rightly pointed out by the petitioner, for each and every step, he (the petitioner) has to approach the court for obtaining suitable orders for establishment of AIIMS in Madurai. The judges observed that the court expects that the Centre, without waiting for court orders, would take steps to establish AIIMS at Madurai at the earliest. The judges also directed the Centre to expedite the process of appointment of project consultant for establishment of AIIMS at the earliest. Meanwhile, assistant solicitor general L Victoria Gowri appearing for the Centre, on Tuesday, informed the court that the state had earlier assured to extend support to admission of 50 students on a temporary campus in government medical colleges in Theni or Sivaganga districts. Since the state sought a specific proposal from AIIMS in this regard, AIIMS Madurai executive director Dr Mangu Hanumantha Rao had sent a communication dated August 6 to the state health secretary. The court was hearing a PIL to establish a temporary campus and to commence MBBS courses. In the communication, the executive director had stated that they would be ready to commence MBBS admissions for AIIMS Madurai, if the state provides all the required infrastructure such as academic, accommodation, recreational facilities and administrative block in either one of the suggested temporary campus, keeping in mind that the Neet exam for MBBS is to be held on September 12. Senior counsel Veera Kathiravan, appearing for the state, sought time to get the government’s response in this regard. A division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice K Murali Shankar directed the Centre to file a counter before the court on the communication sent by the executive director and also directed the state to file its response. The case was adjourned to September 13 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/get-madurai-aiims-ready-in-3-yrs-hc-to-centre/articleshow/85411206.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Chandigarh||Polling for 2 constituencies today, graduates struggle to get a date||Poviet Kaur Chandigarh: Polling for constituencies of both heads and teachers of affiliated arts colleges will be held on August 18 (Wednesday) across Chandigarh and Punjab. Eight members will be elected to the Senate from each of these constituencies. While 11 candidates are in the fray from the constituency of heads of arts colleges, 15 are contesting from the constituency of teachers. Different groups have fielded their candidates from both the constituencies while some are contesting independently. Election for the graduate constituency was also supposed to take place on August 11 but the varsity deferred the elections citing unviability of polling booths and permissions from various state governments. Polling started with the constituencies of principals and staff of technical and professional colleges on August 3, followed by the staff of technical and professional colleges, professors of university teaching departments, associate/assistant professors of teaching departments, heads of affiliated art colleges and professors of affiliated art colleges, which concluded on Thursday with the announcement of results. Registered graduates constituency, which has the maximum of 3,61,869 eligible voters, was to go to polls next. Ravinder Singh Dhaliwal, one of the contestants from the registered graduates said, “The administration has always tried its best not to hold elections. It is always their agenda but we will fight to get the election done.” ‘Pol agenda behind poll delay, closed campus’ Poviet Kaur Chandigarh: Students and former senators of Panjab University have gathered in front of the VC office and are demanding that the campus be opened and elections of the Graduate Constituency be conducted. Students also pressed the demand for opening of the campus canteen, student center and hostel. Students accused the VC and DSW of making arbitrary decisions and said, “For one and a half years, the campus has been closed for students and Senate elections have been deferred three times in the past one year. While schools, colleges, other universities, cinemas and elections have been opened without restrictions across the country, the decision to shut down the PU campus and postpone Senate elections is completely baseless.” Amandeep, a member of PSU (Lalkaar), said, “the actual reason behind keeping the university closed for all students is the political agenda of RSS-BJP to centralise the university by abolishing the Senate and implementing the National Education Policy 2020, which clearly states that all decision-making bodies in universities be replaced with Board of Governance, whose members will be appointed by the Central government. This is why Senate elections are being postponed again and again.” The students also said that the governance reforms committee, which was illegally constituted, suggested that graduate constituency seats in the senate be reduced and the number of nominated members be increased, which clearly shows their agenda of either reforming the Senate to maximise BJP-RSS minded people or completely abolish it. The speakers unanimously called for announcement of a date for Senate elections of graduate constituency and reopening of the University. A memorandum was submitted by Punjab Students Union (Lalkaar) to a representative sent by University authorities on August 16. The demands included reopening of PU Campus immediately for students from all courses, reopening of hostels for all students and reopening of all canteens, Student Centre, and PU gate number 1. The protest by by graduate constituency candidates has entered the third day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/polling-for-2-constituencies-today-graduates-struggle-to-get-a-date/articleshow/85411224.cms||---

The child’s parents in their complaint submitted to the senior district health authorities on Monday, alleged that their one-day-old child was burnt on the heating pad of a warmer machine at the sick newborn care unit (SNCU) due to negligence of the health staff on duty. Chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the district hospital, Manjhanpur, Dr. Deepak Seth told TOI on Tuesday that a probe has been initiated into the allegation. “A comprehensive probe has been launched into the allegation of the parents of the child and action would be initiated against whoever is found guilty. We are recording the statements of staff on duty at the time of the incident,” he added. Reports said that Fatehpur resident Javed Ahmad had admitted his wife Mahelika for delivery at the district hospital, Manjhanpur on August 13. After the woman gave birth to a male child the same day, the doctors on duty advised the parents to keep the newborn at the warmer at the child care unit. The child was shifted to the warmer machine but died on August 15. Following the death of the child, his family members created ruckus on the hospital campus and the hospital authorities were compelled to summon police. Deputy SP (Manjhanpur) Dr. Krishna Gopal on Tuesday said, “A team of Manjhanpur police had gone to the district hospital on August 15 after the deceased child’s family members created ruckus on the hospital campus.” He added, “The family members of the newborn, however, have not submitted any complaint with the police station concerned. They have taken up the matter with the senior district hospital authorities.” Father of the deceased, Javed, has alleged that health staff on duty was negligent towards his son’s treatment and failed to maintain the temperature of the warmer, resulting in his death, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/newborn-dies-at-kaushambi-dist-hospital-probe-ordered/articleshow/85413968.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mass free vaccination drive breaks Guinness world record||MUMBAI: Although the daily Covid vaccination drive has been erratic due to shortage of doses, a mass free vaccination effort in the city funded through corporate social responsibility has found its way into the Guinness World Records. As part of the record-making effort that took around seven days (August 7-14), General insurance Co, ICICI Lombard, and Surana group of hospitals got 30,467 people to sign pledges to get vaccinated. In the same time they vaccinated 32,000 people in slums of Dharavi and Worli. Dr Prince Surana from the hospital group said, “We also vaccinated 50,000 people free of cost in Koliwada, BDD Chawl and the entire Dharavi as a part of this joint initiative,” he said. They have totally given out four lakh vaccine doses so far, he added. Due to erratic vaccine supply from the Centre, BMC’s free vaccination drive has been disrupted on many days. BMC has hence told corporate houses and hospitals to take up free vaccination drives in slum pockets to accelerate the vaccination process. BMC had estimated that the private sector in Mumbai has over 10 lakh vaccine doses that were being used up slowly due to the cost involved. The effort had 60 people, including verifiers, nurses, doctors and paramedical staff. ICICI Lombard General Insurance’s Sanjeev Mantri said, “We are deeply encouraged to have got the opportunity to vaccinate more than 32,000 deserving individuals, giving them added protection against the virus. It is humbling for us that we broke the Guinness World Record milestone in the process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mass-free-vax-drive-breaks-guinness-world-record/articleshow/85413983.cms||---

A division bench of justice N Kirubakaran and justice B Pugalendhi observed that though the state government claims that several DPCs have been established across the state and lakhs of metric tonnes of paddy are procured from the farmers during the harvest seasons, the problems faced by the farmers during the process of procurement are not redressed properly. Hence, the judges directed the state to establish sufficient number of DPCs wherever and whenever necessary with sufficient space of storing the paddy. The government should ensure that the auto-generated token system for procuring paddy should be strictly followed. The judges directed the government to ensure that the paddy brought to DPCs are procured the same day without any delay. Steps should be taken to sensitize the farmers about the procedures followed in the DPCs for procurement of paddy. The judges directed that surprise inspections should be conducted at the DPCs periodically. Departmental and criminal actions should be initiated against the erring officials. The judges also further directed to prominently exhibit the details of the authorities to whom complaints should be made at all the DPCs. Immediate action should be taken on complaints which are received from the farmers. The involvement of local traders and merchants in any manner at the DPCs should be prevented, said the judges. The court passed the order while disposing of a public interest litigation filed by advocate A P Suryaprakasam of Chennai and other connected petitions seeking to establish sufficient DPCs across the state and to take action against the erring officials who are involved in malpractices at the DPCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ensure-no-bribes-are-demanded-at-dpcs-hc-to-state/articleshow/85411677.cms||---

Times ViewNon-payment of salaries for several months in 12 DU colleges is a matter of concern. Payment of salaries should be a priority for any government.The second instalment of the grants-in-aid released on Tuesday, he claimed, is highly insufficient. “DUTA finds it is extremely unfortunate that it takes protests to get salaries. All dues of employees remain pending, including against medical bills and salaries of ad hoc teachers,” he added. In the online protest meeting organised from 11am to 2pm, teachers shared how employees are forced to take loans constantly because of these delays and are living in constant stress. They demanded that the 12 college should be taken over by University Grants Commission to end this repeated crisis. The negligent attitude of the Delhi government towards timely release of grants has had a detrimental effect on the academic functioning and has caused immense hardship in these difficult times of the pandemic, said Ray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-day-duta-stir-over-dues-to-12-colleges/articleshow/85413945.cms||---

At least a dozen students from the city have applied for the admission to various undergraduate courses at the University. While a number of them have already left for US to pursue an undergraduate course of their choice, many students have opted to join the university in January. Not just good academic environment, Arizona offers availability of Indian restaurants and worship places, said a student claiming he was looking forward to a home-like environment away from home. Bachelor in Computer Science and Biological Science are amongst the most preferred courses at the university. “A majority of students prefer Arizona University as it offers generous scholarships, figures in top universities offering bachelor courses, especially in engineering, medical sciences and computer sciences,” said Ishan Rai who will be joining the University in the spring semester (semester starts in January and ends in May) on January 10. “There were three reasons why I opted for Arizona. First it is amongst the top institutions offering computers sciences. Secondly, they offer generous scholarship and lastly the weather conditions there are favourable to Indians. I had also made it to Toronto University but Canada’s chilling weather conditions is a complete contrast to the Indian weather conditions,” said Anand Krishna Mishra, who has reached the US to pursue Bachelor in Computer Science. “For Indian students it is the most preferred university as quality education is imparted at an affordable price here,” said Vansh who has opted for Bachelor in Computer Science. He said one can easily get Indian food with a number of restaurants available. It also offers great cultural exchange as students from across the globe study at the same place. Another Lucknow resident, Priyanshi Kishore has also opted to study Bachelor in Medical Sciences at the university and has already left the country to join the course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/for-city-students-with-study-abroad-dream-arizona-univ-is-the-top-choice/articleshow/85415154.cms||---

His works are an inspiration for me,” said Munde, a real estate worker. The 6ft x 2.5ft x 7.5 ft roadside temple been built in a “private place and with private funds” has been drawing the attention of passers-by. Around Rs1.5 lakh has been spent on the initiative. The temple material – red stone and marble -- was brought from Jaipur. Toughened glass had been fitted to the structure for its security, Munde said. The opposition parties criticised the move. “It is a height of fanaticism. On the one hand, BJP is removing names of former Prime Ministers from schemes and on the other, its workers are building temples of its leaders,” said Congress spokesperson Anant Gadgil. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) also expressed its displeasure over the project. “Every individual has the right to follow his/her school of thoughts. But this type of initiatives of building temple of individual leaders will give a wrong message to society. The socio-cultural tradition of Pune city has never tolerated such undue glorification of individuals,” said Prashant Jagtap, the city unit chief of NCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bjp-workers-modi-temple-draws-flak-from-opposition-parties/articleshow/85411275.cms||Shyam Sonar

Additional director general of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar, said that ATS and STF were in an expansion mood in the state. “We have been allotted 2000 square meter land by the Uttar Pradesh Small Industries Corporation Limited (UPSIC) in Deoband for setting up of the unit,” said Kumar. Kumar further added that the ATS unit was planned in Deoband because of its strategic location -- it falls in the border area of the state. “It will also increase depth, operational capability, and strength in the areas of West UP,” ADG said. The officer also said that another unit will come up near the proposed Noida International Airport. The selection of location for ATS units is being done on the areas which are strategically important, he added. Inspector General of ATS, Gajendra Kumar Goswamy, said that a new unit of the ATS will come up in Deoband. “We have set up similar units recently in Bahraich and Shravasti districts of the state,” he said. A unit of Special Police Operation Team (SPOT) of the ATS will be deployed in the unit along with a small unit for intelligence gathering and carrying out small operations. The officer also said that UP ATS already has a training centre in Anora area of Sarojininagar. He also said that efforts are also underway to have one unit each in Varanasi, MIrzapur, Azamgarh and Kheri districts. Another officer privy to the development said that the unit at Deoband will comprise a dog squad, a bomb-disposal squad, and a wireless trapping unit along with a group of combat units. They also disclosed that the project in Deoband was approved two years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-ats-to-set-up-its-elite-commando-unit-in-deoband/articleshow/85415177.cms||---

Last week, ED filed a chargesheet against Patil and Karnala Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd (KNSBL), Panvel, in the Rs 500-crore money-laundering case. Patil is also an exchairman of KNSBL. ED alleged that these funds were used for Karnala Charitable Trust and Karnala Sports Academy for construction of properties such as a sports complex, college and schools and for personal gain, using proceeds of crime and projecting it as untainted. ED stated that Patil of Peasants and Workers Party defrauded bank money in the name of 67 fictitious accounts. The money would mostly get withdrawn in cash from the accounts and then get deposited into 12 accounts associated with Patil. Patil would use the money for creating assets. Afterwards, he would get it redeposited into those 67 accounts before the year-end to ensure that they did not become NPAs. Patil was operating these 67 accounts on behalf of individuals and entities without their consent or agreement. The loans were granted without collateral in violation of banking rules. ED initiated an investigation based on an FIR registered by police in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-ed-seizes-rs-234cr-assets-of-neta-in-a-case-of-laundering/articleshow/85414027.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Mumbai||Opposition slams BMC over Rs 168 crore seaside cycling track project||MUMBAI: With the BMC floating a Rs 168-crore tender for constructing a walkway-cum-cycle track along the sea coast from the Bandra Fort to Mahim Fort, corporators from the opposition have slammed the municipal body for spending money on “fancy projects”, while holding back core issues like road works and civic school upgrade project citing lack of funds. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh accused the BMC of going ahead with projects without any priority list. “At a time when its finances are in the doldrums, the BMC must halt such fancy projects; it must recollect the fate of the much-hyped Tansa pipeline cycle track which has failed. The BMC has put on hold road works of Rs 1,200 crore and civic school upgrade projects worth Rs 150 crore due to lack of funds and now wants to make these cycling tracks,” Shaikh said. He has written to BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal in this regard. Last week, the BMC cleared the walkway-cum-cycle track along the sea coast from the Bandra Fort to Mahim Fort and on Saturday floated tenders for the project. According to civic officials, the walkway-cum-cycle track from Bandra Fort to Mahim Fort will be 6m wide. “The cycle track will be 2.5m wide and the remaining space will be for pedestrians. The site track will be on single monolithic poles erected on a pile foundation with interconnecting primary and secondary beams. The boardwalk will be of composite wooden material,” said a senior civic official. With the ambitious Tansa cycle track project turning out to be unviable in its current format, the BMC had made major changes to its size and construction. Initially pegged at Rs 331 crore, the BMC cut its budget to around Rs 200 crore and also reduced the length for the three routes in March. “Just like the Tansa cycle track project, this project too may turn into a white elephant... The BMC must seriously review the viability and usability of the project. Mumbaikar’s need better roads and schools, and not just cycle tracks,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. In its budget this year, the BMC decided to dip into its fixed deposits and withdraw Rs 10,564 crore as loan to meet its increasing expenditure. The 2020-21 estimated expenditure was Rs 33,441 crore, which was increased to Rs, 39,039 (17%) for the current financial year. Instead of raising money from the market through bonds, the administration took an internal interest-free loan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-oppn-slams-bmc-over-rs-168cr-seaside-cycling-track-project/articleshow/85415686.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The clarification came from sources among Pune malls after an official statement by the SCAI on Tuesday announced closure of the facilities in Maharashtra till their staffers were fully vaccinated. The SCAI said in the statement that due to the Maharashtra government’s modified guidelines on the restraining mall staffers from returning to workplace unless they were fully vaccinated (a gap 14 days after the second dose), malls across the state have decided to close down. “With the prevailing restrictions, the malls will not be able to open and operate as it would be at least a month (tentatively September-end) before a sizeable number of our staff gets their second dose and meets the criteria, provided the vaccine is available and there is no shortage,” the SCAI said in the statement. Two days after resuming operations, most major malls in Mumbai downed shutters on Tuesday over their inability to comply with the mandate to use fully vaccinated staff. Representative of a topPune-based mall told TOI, “Pune malls have so far not received any communication from SCAI and will continue operations till further notice. The SCAI’s announcement is only applicable to Mumbai malls, where as, other districts like Aurangabad, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik have reported no such issues.” The representative of another major mall in Pune, told TOI, “We are open as of now. Until we officially hear something from the association, we cannot take a call on closure. As far as we know, all malls will be operational in the city.” Another source from a mall in the city said, “In Pune, most malls are likely to be operational.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-malls-unlikely-to-take-part-in-closure-call-for-now/articleshow/85411428.cms||Neha Madaan

The aircraft brought home Indian diplomats including Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, Rudrendra Tandon, who expressed his immense relief at being able to return home safe. “You can’t imagine how great it’s to be back home,” said Tandon, while talking to media persons and added that all efforts are on to bring every Indian citizen back home safely. He also said that the India is also concerned about the welfare of Afghanistan. Talking to TOI, district collector Jamnagar. P S Zamsingh said, “There were para military force staff, diplomats, civilans including employees of PSUs in the aircraft that landed at around 11.15am. Passengers from two different aircraft flew to Delhi at around 4pm. We welcomed them with food and beverages.” The passengers were garlanded by officials of local administration and politicians while onlookers chanted ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’. During his stopover in Jamnagar, Tandon talked to media persons and said that the situation in Kabul is complex and “quite fluid”. He said that all 192 personnel of the mission including employees of the Indian embassy and Air India were evacuated from Afghanistan in the past three days in two phases. “Indian citizens residing in Afghanistan are in distress because of the fast changing situation.

Three wards have seen most cases of leptospirosis, while confirmed dengue cases have been reported from all over the city. Wards E (Byculla, Mazgaon), F north (Dharavi, Matunga) and K east (Andheri, Jogeshwari East) reported most leptospirosis cases, BMC said. Twenty-seven cases of leptospirosis were reported in the last 15 days. In July, there has been one death due to the bacterial disease that one can contract by wading through dirty water. Officials said the cases were most likely contained due to distribution of nearly 1.40 lakh capsules of doxycycline. BMC carried out three rounds of house-to-house surveys covering 44.80 lakh homes. Till August 15, there were 61 confirmed cases of dengue, a jump from 28 seen in all of July. Although dengue cases are less than the incidence prior to Covid, the mosquito-borne viral infection is more prevalent this year compared to 2020. A total of 129 cases were recorded in 2020, while 138 were reported this year. In 2019, there were 920 confirmed cases of dengue and three deaths. City ICUs are sporadically treating cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) arising from complications of dengue and leptospirosis. Intensivist Dr Rahul Sawalia, who consults with SevenHills Hospital, said they have treated at least seven cases of ARDS caused by dengue and leptospirosis. Nearly 400 cases of malaria have also been reported so far in August.

After a long series of failed auctions because of a higher reserve price, the LIT has come out with a new bidding model. The initial reserve price of Rs 197 crore made this building unattractive to the bidders for long. But even when the price was lowered to about Rs 157 crore, no one showed up to buy it. When LIT chairman Raman Balasubramanium joined in 2019, he even thought of moving his office there but an estimated renovation cost of Rs 3 to 4 crore forced the local bodies department to disapprove the proposal. It had no guarantee of a successful auction after spending so much money.Chairman Balasubramanium said: "We did not get a good response for this building in the past auctions, so after trying out several things, we have come to the conclusion that we could try leasing out the property, if we get a good interest. The government has approved this idea but we will also try giving away this building on rent and, if possible, sell it off."The building with double basement and 77 units for restaurants, banks, showrooms, shops, and penthouses is now a deserted place with broken window glasses, In the evening, street vendors take it over to sell eatables, while the visitors park outside. Among the many tricks that the LIT had tried, chairman Balasubramanium had proposed to even develop it as a basement parking for Ghumar Mandi but the plan could not take off. In April 2018, deputy commissioner Pardeep Agrawal, who then had the additional charge of LIT chairman, had inspected the building and planned to develop a jewellery market inside.In 2013, the income tax department was offered this site for office. A few years ago, the-then Punjab deputy chief minister, Sukhbir Badal, had proposed a downtown project, which was supposed to come up at the Ferozepur Road main office of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited after moving Powercom to this empty building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/lits-last-bid-to-get-buyer-for-rani-jhansi-road-property/articleshow/85409178.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi University’s South Campus skywalk back to drawing board||NEW DELHI: The 670m-long skywalk connecting Delhi University’s South Campus to Durgabai Deshmukh Metro Station near Benito Juarez Marg, which is a part of the RTR project, is likely to get delayed. PWD officials say the key infrastructure project will require redesigning. The construction of the overall RTR project, which includes the skywalk and an underpass, started in November 2014 to decongest Outer Ring Road between IIT and National Highway-8 to offer relief to people travelling to and from Indira Gandhi International Airport. A senior PWD official said the design of the skywalk was being changed slightly as prefabricated parts that were supposed to be mounted on pillars were expected to be built by a French company. “The pandemic and frequent lockdowns derailed these plans. We will not be able to import these prefabricated parts for assembly. We are in touch with a Chandigarh-based company for manufacturing the parts to complete the project. There hasn’t been much progress on the skywalk,” added the official. A Y-shaped 1.2km-long underpass is currently being constructed between Benito Juarez Marg and San Martin Marg to decongest Ring Road and the Dhaula Kuan stretch. As a part of the project, a skywalk starting from Benito Juarez Marg near Springdales School is also being constructed. All the pillars for the skywalk have been completed. Just like the skywalk at ITO, prefabricated parts would be mounted on the pillars. An official said the underpass was in the middle of Benito Juarez Marg, which made the existing single lanes on both sides of the approach roads narrower. “The skywalk will increase the safety of pedestrians, while keeping traffic uninterrupted,” added the official. South Campus and Satyaniketan are likely to benefit the most from the skywalk. “Once the parts are ready, it will take at least six months to assemble and weld them onto the pillars. Earlier, a coffee shop was planned along with the skywalk, but it seems unlikely considering the delay and cost escalation of the project,” said the official. PWD is currently focusing on completing the digging work under Ring Road for the underpass. The sixth deadline for the underpass was earlier announced to be August 31, which is likely to be breached.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/south-campus-skywalk-back-to-drawing-board/articleshow/85414154.cms||Paras Singh

---||Surat||Afghanistan chaos: Surat textile exporters fear losing Rs 400 crore pending dues||SURAT: The political uncertainty and chaos in Afghanistan after Taliban’s stunningly rapid takeover of the country is having repercussions in the textile hub of Surat. While losing business in the conflict-torn country looks imminent, exporters and brokers of textile products claim that payment of about Rs 400 crore has been stuck due to the unrest. They fear that the payments won’t be received soon given the scale of uncertanity there. Punjabi suits and dupattas made in Surat are in high demand in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Until three years ago, businessmen from Afghanistan used to visit the city frequently to buy finished garments for women. They used to select the products personally and make payments through their business associates in Delhi. It is estimated that garments worth at least Rs 100 crore were sent to Afghanistan via Pakistan or Dubai every month. Raju Bhatia, a broker working for multiple exporters, told TOI: “In the textile market, the credit period is up to three months and in goods supplied to Afghanistan via Pakistan or Dubai, the payment is received in three to four months. However, payment of around Rs 400 crore of many exporters is stuck due to the unrest. The export through Pakistan or Dubai is also impacted due to disturbance. “The Punjabi suit and dupatta manufactured in the city are high in demand in Pakistan and Afghanistan due to its quality and variety. Importers want these products but due to irregular supply chains, no one wants to take any risk in the current situation to export,” said Gurpal Singh, a garment manufacturer and exporter. “More than Rs 100 crore worth textile products are exported monthly to Afghanistan through multiple routes. But it has stopped in the current scenario,” said Singh. Ravi Jain, a garment manufacturer, added, “Many exporters have suffered heavy losses and no one knows when the situation will improve. I have discontinued doing business with Afghanistan in the past few months as the situation started going out of control. I am yet to receive payment for the last couple of orders and I am not sure when I will get it.” Narendra Saboo, president of Surat Mercantile Association (SMA), said, “The situation is unpredictable and the impact on city’s textile business to Afghanistan can be bad. We can only hope for fast improvement in the situation so as to get business,” said (Few names have been changed on request)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-textile-exporters-fear-losing-rs-400cr-pending-dues/articleshow/85411497.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Climate change, insects hit coconut farmers hard||Rajkot: Thanks to the health benefits it provided, the raw coconut juice and its meat were in high demand during the second wave of Covid. One nut used to fetch around Rs 60-80 in the retail market. The farmers of Gir Somnath and Junagadh districts, the major suppliers of the crop, made a windfall as they got almost Rs 30 per coconut. But things have changed a lot since then. The farmers are now suffering huge losses. Not just the drop in demand, they have been hit by multiple factors. The damage caused by cyclone Tauktae, whitefly infesting the crop and climate change causing fruits to drop prematurely have added to the coconut-growing farmers’ cup of woes. All these factors have resulted in income of an average farmer going down by almost 90%.According to scientists and farmers, cyclone Tauktae caused huge damage in areas like Rajula, Jafrabad, Una and Diu. But at other places such as Veraval, Sutrapada, Talala and Mangrol the loss was much less — around 5%. D K Varu head of department of fruit science at Junagadh Agriculture University (JAU) pegged the average loss in coconut production to be around 30%. “There are several reasons for that, one being the damage caused by the cyclone in certain pockets. The spiraling whitefly too damaged the crop in the last one year and the third is climate change. “The fruit setting percentage has declined since the last few years because of climate change. For example, Chorwad is the most suitable place for coconut trees but even there we got complaints of fruit dropping,” Varu said. Arjan Barad, a coconut farmer in Gir Somnath district, said that the whitefly infection has resulted in huge production losses. “There is no program of mass sprinkling of pesticides by the government. The price of nuts has gone down and production is also down, what I earn by selling nuts is not enough to even recover the cost of pesticide, electricity bill or labour cost,” Barad said. Earlier, Barad was harvesting 1,500 nuts per month which has gone down to just 300 nuts now. He used to get Rs 30 per nut during the second wave of Covid and was earning Rs 45,000 per month. His monthly earning now is just Rs 3,000. The Covid was an exceptional situation, Barad said adding, “Normally, throughout the year farmers get Rs 20 per nut.”Vija Naran, an agent who buys coconuts on behalf of traders, further explained the reason for the price drop. He said, “The diesel price is skyrocketing and the transportation cost is very high. The traders can’t afford to send coconut to other states so they are not buying it from farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/climate-change-insects-hit-coconut-farmers-hard/articleshow/85411550.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Ludhiana||Taliban wrap city industry in a shawl of uncertainty||Ludhiana: Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan is giving sleepless nights to the city-based garment industry. Businessmen, who export sweaters and shawls there, have suspended the production of the orders that they had received. No payments of the Ludhiana industry are stuck in Afghanistan. The businessmen have instead received advance payments from their customers, which is a usual practice. They are, however, panicking over the future of trade with Afghanistan. The importers, meanwhile, are cautioning that the situation in Afghanistan will lead to a hike in the rates of dry fruits.Vinod Thapar, president of Knitwear and Shawl Club, said, “There is a good market of Ludhiana-made products in Afghanistan, and sweaters and shawls worth several crores are exported there. But after the Taliban took control, there was panic among exporters. As of now we have suspended the processing of the recent orders received from Afghanistan, as first we need to see how things unfold there in coming days. There is a high chance that rules and regulations related to international trade will be changed by the Taliban and if the civil war breaks out, shops and businesses will shut down.”Thapar said they were keeping a close watch on the situation and were in constant touch with the buyers, who, too, have asked to wait for a few days. “Majority of our customers are of the view that the situation will normalise and trade will resume without any problems once the Taliban appoints all ministers and government officials,” he added. Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of Knitwear Club, said, “This situation reminds us of 1996 when Taliban took control of Afghanistan and exports remained suspended for months, as several of our buyers went incommunicado. Eventually, trade was restored and export of textile from India started. This time there is a slight change as we are in contact with our customers as communication channels are still active. Afghanistan might not be the biggest market for Ludhiana’s textile and garment industry, but accounts for sizeable exports. This fiscal, there has been an export of jerseys and other allied products of synthetic fibres of about Rs 125 crore and of sweaters and cardigans of over Rs 33 crore.”Asserting that Afghanistan was among the best countries to deal with as traders there paid advance against every order and also made full payment at the time of shipping, Kairpal said, “Even now advance payments of several crores of Afghanistan traders are lying with the Ludhiana industry. We are under its burden and we either process their orders or return their money.” Dry fruits will become dearerAccording to Rohit Gupta, president of Importer Exporter Club of Punjab, “The situation in Afghanistan will have a huge impact on the import of dry fruits like figs, pistachio, dried apricots, dried prunes and even almonds. Amritsar and Ludhiana are among the biggest markets of dry fruits after Delhi and Indore, and the rates of stuff imported from Afghanistan will certainly register a hike, as their supply will remain suspended for some time. Exporters from Afghanistan have already conveyed their inability to send consignments until a new government is formed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/taliban-wrap-city-industry-in-a-shawl-of-uncertainty/articleshow/85409243.cms||Mohit Behl

Concerned police officials are harassing him and his family members by continuously visiting his residence as well as his office because he is a social worker and running a social welfare organisation for the welfare of the society under the name and style of Hindu Raksha Dal… Opponents want to tarnish the reputation of the applicant, and to take revenge they were involving him in this false FIR,” Chaudhary’s anticipatory bail plea stated. The plea further claimed that he had not organised any protest as alleged in the FIR and did not give any hate speech nor was he present in the alleged hate speech video. “The applicant was invited as a guest and due to this reason he visited the programme. He stayed at the spot till 12.30pm and thereafter he left due to heavy rain,” the plea claimed, adding that he was not present at the spot when the alleged hate speech took place. Chaudhary stated that his custodial interrogation was not required and he was ready to join the probe as and when required by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/communal-slogans-key-accused-says-attempt-to-tarnish-his-image/articleshow/85414197.cms||Usha Das

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Pick administrators from housing society members to check shady activities’||MUMBAI: At a time when a detailed investigation has been ordered into the appointment of administrators to around 500 housing societies in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and the suspected irregularities committed by them, cooperative housing society associations have appealed to the state government to appoint anyone from among the residents of housing societies as the administrator rather than imposing the authority of a person from outside or through an independent panel prepared by registrars. Housing sector experts say even the law supports such an arrangement. If appointments that are made are from within the housing society, then no administrator and registrar can act in connivance with contractors to earn kickbacks, said the experts. Vinod Sampat, president of the Cooperative Societies Residents Users Association (CSRUA), in his recommendations that he sent to chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and cooperatives commissioner Anil Kawde said that there have been several instances where authorised officers or administrators have come from outside and virtually looted societies. “Why can’t a rule be framed that any such officer or administrator should be from among the residents?” Sampat said. MahaSewa president Ramesh Prabhu said that such an arrangement is the actual provision in the law. “As per Section 77 A of the Cooperative Act, in case there is no committee or no election then a registrar can give notice to the existing committee to confirm the vacuum in the society administration. Once that is done, he can again issue a public notice asking anyone from the residents to come forward to create an administrative board. If no one comes up, then he can appoint an outsider,” Prabhu said. Even the payment to such a resident member appointed by the society can be unanimously decided by the general body of the cooperative housing society. “Why cannot a simple thing like work done by an authorised officer and his attendance be compiled in a booklet form and shared with members?” Sampat said. He said that a weekly scrutiny of administrator’s performance must be done by the government department. “Also, payment towards contracts should be cleared by the members appointed by the general body and not by the authorised officer,” Sampat said. The directive to investigate the appointment of administrators and their work has been given against the backdrop of certain information that during the tenure of these administrators some housing societies had taken major financial decisions such as redevelopment through new builders. It is well-established that no administrator has legal powers to interfere in such big decisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pick-admins-from-hsg-society-members-to-check-shady-activities/articleshow/85414183.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

To begin with, 250 vehicles have been selected. This will allow their tracking at command and control centre at Zone D office of MC.The vehicles against whom there are several complaints, especially the fogging ones, will be the first to get the system. Last year, mayor Balkar Sandhu had caught employees red-handed while stealing fuel. An MC official said, “There have been several complaints against some employees who instead of performing their duties in office remain outside. Through GPS, the officials will be able to keep a check on the movement of vehicles. On Tuesday, the mayor held a meeting with officials to check the progress of work.” Recently, the MC had started fogging in the city with big machines to curb dengue. However, several complaints were received against improper fogging being done the MC employees. There are many employees in the civic body and it is difficult to keep a check on them while they work in field. GPS will help officials track them. MC superintending engineer of operation and maintenance cell Rajinder Singh said, “Around five to six years ago too they had installed GPS in the MC vehicles, but those did not function properly. Now, these will be installed again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-to-install-gps-in-all-its-vehicles/articleshow/85409248.cms||---

Another BJP member and communications advisor to chief minister Yogi Adityanath also raked up “Taliban’s barbarism” while broadcasting the decision on Twitter. Deoband is home to Darul Uloom, one of the largest Islamic seminaries in Asia. Opposition parties were quick to slam both the move and the comments made by BJP leaders, calling it “communal and divisive”. The state government has already allocated 2,000 square meters of land for construction of the centre. At present, the UP ATS has units in 17 districts of the state. Two recent additions have been made in Bahraich and Shravasti districts. Deoband will be the 18th unit. A top police officer also said that another unit is likely to come up near the proposed Noida International Airport. On Tuesday morning, Shalabh Mani Tripathi, communications advisor to the UP CM, took to Twitter to say: “Amidst Taliban’s barbarism, listen to (some) UP news, that Yogiji has decided to open an ATS Commando Centre in Deoband with immediate effect for which work has started on a war footing. In all, 18 bright ATS officers selected from all over the state will be posted here (sic)” A few hours later, UP’s IT cell head Sanjay Rai, who also holds a ministerial rank according to his Twitter account, said, “It's high time that we learned from history. Seeing the Taliban’s brutality, Yogiji has decided to open the ATS commando centre in Deoband. Only Yogiji can have such a vision.” When contacted, UP’s ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said that the move to open the ATS centre was taken due to its strategic location at the border. “Opening of new ATS centres should be seen as part of our expansion plan and we have selected a few strategic places for this. For instance, one is at the Indo-Nepal border while the other is in Deoband for which we have already acquired land. Deoband town is in Saharanpur which shares borders with Haryana and Uttarakhand. So it is a sensitive zone. We will have more centers as and when we get the required land.” The seminary refused to comment on the development. Prominent cleric and Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind chief Maulana Arshad Madni said, “It’s the government's decision to open a centre on government land. Why should we be worried? Our organization is involved in the uplift of the weaker sections of society.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/taliban-brutality-reason-for-new-ats-centre-in-deoband-bjp-netas/articleshow/85409256.cms||Sandeep Rai

According to data from the CoWin portal (updated till 7 pm), the total number of doses extended in Uttar Pradesh reached 6.05 crore which is nearly 11% of the total 55.91 crore doses administered in the country. Maharashtra, UP’s nearest contender stands at 5.07 crore doses. In terms of people, 5.10 crore people have taken at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, while 94.77 lakh are fully vaccinated. This translates into an achievement of 35% and 6.8% in the two categories. Data from the CoWin portal showed that 5.31 crore doses of Covishield have been given in the state, while 73.44 lakh doses of covaxin have been administered. Sputnik also forms a small proportion of doses given here. In terms of age group, 3.07 crore people in the 18-44 age group have taken at least one dose. This is followed by 1.83 crore doses in the 45 to 60 age bracket. The remaining 1.14 crore doses went to the elderly category. The gender gap in Covid-19 vaccination remains a cause of concern with the total beneficiaries including 3.38 crore males and 2.66 crore females. An estimated 16,000 persons in the third gender category have also taken the vaccine. Experts are of the view that UP needs to boost administration of the second dose in the state. UP ranked third in the country on the count while Maharashtra and Gujarat lead the chart. Among districts, Lucknow tops the list, while Chitrakoot figures last. Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Gorakhpur, Meerut and Prayagraj have administered more than 15 lakh doses. Meanwhile, 27 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours.

As per the latest state government order on Covid prevention, compulsory vaccination is required for all restaurant and bar employees, including chefs, waiters, managers and cleaning staff . Only employees and managers who have completed 14 days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine are allowed to work in a restaurant or bar. Though the rush-hour footfall at restaurants has doubled following the recent relaxations in the curbs, many facilities in the city are now operating at 20-50% staff strength due to the full vaccination rider. Ganesh Shetty, president of he Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association, told TOI, “Only those restaurants that have not fully vaccinated their staff are having an issue with home deliveries. This is particularly happening with the resurants that rely on their own delivery personnel and do not have tie-ups with the food delivery apps.” The owner of a restaurant on Satara road said, “We recently stopped home deliveries due to staff crunch. We cannot call a staff who is not fully vaccinated. Free-of-cost jabs are also not available easily. We are working at 20% staff strength.” Another restaurateur in Koregaon Park said, “We have called back our staff and most have been administered the first dose of Covishield. Many of them fall in the 18-44 age group. Vaccination for this group started from May 1 and free-of-cost shots were diffucult to find for days. It is difficult to get a good strength of fully vaccinated staff in current circumstances. The restaurant had to close a section that catered to about 50 people due to the staff crunch.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/restos-halt-home-delivery-due-to-shortage-of-fully-vaxxed-staff/articleshow/85411563.cms||Neha Madaan

Ericsson Global Services India MD Amitabh Ray told TOI: “We will continue with the current hybrid model with very few employees working from office.” Many IT firms in Salt Lake Sector V and New Town, following government’s latest notice, are reviewing the situation. “As an industry, we are stressing on vaccination of all employees. Also, we will need to ensure that in spite of vaccination, social distancing norms are maintained. The hybrid model of work will continue but flexibility will increase, and we will be able to make decisions more easily,” said Sector V Stakeholders’ Association vice president Kalyan Kar. With over 18 months of nearly 100% work-from-home (WFH) operations, IT firms as well as their employees seem to have found a feasibility in the current mode of work. “The relaxation comes as a relief. Although we have become habituated with the WFH format for quite some time. Now, it would be up to the companies to decide on the same,” said Kaustav De, a senior IT executive at a Sector V firm. Pradip Chanda, CEO, Elogix Software, said: “We have not asked employees to come to the office as yet. Our plan is to review the situation by mid of September 2021 and then bring in people to office in phases.

Many of the officers have been given additional charge, while nearly a dozen officers are waiting for postings. While some officers have been waiting for a posting for the last nine months, some officers have been made to wait for over two months. For instance, the government had shifted Medchal Malkajgiri district collector Vasam Venkateshwarlu and Bhupalpally district collector Abdul Azeem in November 2020. They have not been given any posting till now. Similarly, Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district collector Anitha Ramachandran was shifted in June and she is waiting for a posting. Until recently, Swetha Mohanty held collector posts of both Hyderabad and Medchal districts. After she was shifted last week, Medak district collector has been asked to look after Medchal, while Nagarkurnool collector L Sharman has been posted as Hyderabad district collector. Bhadradri Kothagudem collector post has been given to junior officer Anudeep Durishetty after the retirement of MV Reddy two-and-a-half months ago. “New districts were created five years ago for better administration. Now, collectors have been given many additional responsibilities such as granting layout permissions. By giving additional charge to the collectors, the very purpose of smaller districts is defeated,” an IAS officer said. Apart from this, the state government has not appointed full-fledged heads for important departments like higher education, agriculture and Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority till today. Interestingly, the state government, on several occasions, has said it requires at least 250 IAS officers as against the present strength of 130 officers. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allocate more officers to the state. Official sources said while the allocated posts for the state are 208 officers, only 136 IAS officers are working in different capacities. Many of the officers have been given additional charge, while nearly a dozen officers are waiting for postings. While some officers have been waiting for a posting for the last nine months, some officers have been made to wait for over two months||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-cries-for-more-ias-officerssome-still-waiting-for-posting/articleshow/85414234.cms||Koride Mahesh

On Tuesday, at least four traffic officials were deployed near the flyover to inform and guide people to take the road under the flyover to avoid the slow-moving traffic on it. According to the advisory, the repair of the expansion joints of the flyover, from Dhaula Kuan to AIIMS, began on Tuesday and will go on for the next three weeks. “There are no diversions or alternate routes that have been suggested as the flyover and the road under it lead to the same way. It’s not a long flyover, is barely 100 metres. Most importantly, the traffic will ply on one half of the carriageway of the flyover, whereas the other half will remain closed. The traffic will ply under the flyover as usual,” a senior traffic official said. During the repair, traffic will be affected and remain relatively heavy on this stretch of Ring Road. Commuters have been advised to avoid the stretch and take alternate routes to reach their destination. Traffic is already heavy after the Barapullah elevated road for commuters who wish to take a left to AIIMS due to the ongoing work. Even during non-rush hours on Tuesday, one had to stand for at least 20-30 minutes after the Barapullah to head left towards AIIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/repair-of-key-ring-road-flyover-will-take-3-weeks-cops-issue-advisory/articleshow/85414237.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Of the total 128 petrol and diesel-run cars, it is the first official vehicle of the civic administration to be converted into CNG, confirmed an official from the NMC’s workshop department. The move comes almost 28 months after the NMC launched the first Aapli bus converted into CNG from diesel in March 2019. “As compared to petrol which costs Rs107.38 per litre, CNG costs Rs83 per kg. In one litre petrol, the car used to run an average 10km. With conversion into CNG, the vehicle will run an average 25km per kg. RTO has also certified the CNG conversion,” Kukde said. The CNG fuel capacity of the tank installed in Kukde’s official car is 14kg. “If filled completely, the car will easily run almost 350km,” he said. The cost of the kit installed to convert petrol fuel into CNG is around Rs48,500. Now, the car has dual fuel system — petrol and CNG. “The move will not only save taxpayers money but also increase the life of the four-wheeler by seven years,” said Kaustubh Gupta, CEO of Rawmatt Industries Private Ltd, which installed the CNG kit in Kukde’s car. The firm has been entrusted to convert diesel-run standard Aapli buses into CNG. Kukde said currently, NMC is plying 83 CNG-converted buses and by December end, remaining 117 standard buses too will start running on the eco-friendly fuel. Data obtained from the civic body’s workshop department revealed that the NMC’s expenditure on fuel has increased by almost 25%. Earlier, it used to spend Rs50 lakh per month for fuelling a fleet of 128 four-wheelers comprising 24 petrol and 104 diesel vehicles. With hike in fuel prices, the civic body’s monthly expenditure too increased to Rs72 lakh. Gupta said CNG kit can only be installed in petrol-run four-wheelers. So, NMC can only install the kits in its 24 cars. If it moves ahead, it can still save a lot of money which could be otherwise used for the city’s development. Rawmatt Industries Private Ltd will also hand over a CNG-fuelled tractor to NMC on Wednesday. This tractor, donated by Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, will be specifically used for transporting treated sewage water from Shankar Nagar mini STP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-transport-panel-chiefs-car-to-run-on-cng-now/articleshow/85411624.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

They are already under stress as they have their families in Afghanistan, where it may be tough to live under the Taliban.“Now I don’t want to go back to Afghanistan. We are comfortable here. We request the government of India and the Indian Council of Agriculture Research to extend our visas and scholarships,” said Ahmad Mubasher of Baghlan province in northern Afghanistan, who is pursuing PG from the agricultural extension department of PAU. He said things might become difficult for women who worked in the government and private sector there as they have been rendered jobless after the Taliban took over. Ahmad, who has eight siblings, has been finding it challenging to contact his family there because of network issues. Abdul Mubin Nadim, 24, of Kabul is pursuing MBA from a private college in Ludhiana district. He has a visa till February 2022, but because of Covid his course will be completed by September 2022. “We want our visas extended by two to three years as the situation in Afghanistan is not good. After that we can go to Canada, as it is allowing us,” said Mubin, adding that even as his family members are fine, he is worried for them. Mubin’s friend from Kabul, Abdullah Ali Shangi, who studies in Ludhiana and has previously worked in the Taliban-controlled province of Laghman, said he also wants his visa extended. Abdullah's family comprises his doctor father, mother, three sisters and four brothers, who are in Kabul.A student of Afghanistan at PAU, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We are adopting a wait-and-watch policy before thinking of going to our country. We will come to know about the behaviour of the Taliban with the people in some time. If they continue with barbarity, we may not return home.”There are at least 11 Afghan students at PAU and two in a private college of the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/afghan-students-studying-in-ludhiana-want-visas-extended/articleshow/85409355.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Pune||Central team tells Maharashtra to increase contact tracing to 30 per Covid case||PUNE: The central government officials have told the state to step up contact tracing and track 30 contacts for every positive case against the backdrop of 76 Delta-Plus variant Covid cases registered in Maharashtra. “The contact tracing has to pick up in all the states. The Centre has directed the states to ensure maximum contact tracing and guidelines have been issued in the wake of the Delta-Plus variant cases. States should not be slipping on this front,” said a senior official of Union government’s health department. Currently, the average contact tracing in Maharashtra is 16. In many districts, it is as low as 3-4 per Covid positive patient. According to the data, only six high-risk and 10 low-risk patients are being tracked in the state on an average against each positive case of Covid-19. Pune, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur are still registering higher weekly positivity rate than the state average. The contact tracing is low in some of these districts. State surveillance expert Dr Pradeep Awate said there was laxity in contact tracing in some districts and they had been issued a fresh directive to step up tracking against the backdrop of the possibility of a third wave. “Early detection, testing and immediate isolation are important, and every district has to trace as many contacts as possible for every case,” he told TOI. CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) director Dr Anurag Agarwal said, “The Delta-Plus variant is still not a public health threat, but we shall have to continuously track the cases, in case something changes. For this, contact tracing by states is very important.” One of the central health team members said sometimes the unwillingness of the patient concerned to reveal contacts posed hurdle to contact tracing. “They do not want to give names, and this becomes an issue,” he said. Dr Subhash Salukhe, technical advisor to the state government, said contact tracing was still off the mark despite repeatedly stressing on it. “It is not just the state, the contact tracing is very poor across the country. There is a need to strengthen the syndromic surveillance and sentinel surveillance now, when the cases are low,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/central-team-tells-state-to-increase-contact-tracing-to-30-per-covid-case/articleshow/85411649.cms||Nisha Nambiar

During the first visit, a warning is being issued and action will be taken on the second. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI that the NDS is starting with inspection of malls. “Most of the staff at VR Mall, Empress Mall, Big Bazaar at Sitabuldi, Poonam Mall, Central Mall, Ginger Mall, Fortune Mall and Vishal Mega Mart had not taken the second dose. They were warned,” he said. Joshi said a few shops too were inspected. “Offices, restaurants etc will be covered in a phased manner,” he said. The NMC held a meeting with representatives of malls on Tuesday. “They said most staff have taken the first dose and are awaiting due date after the rule change. I suggested that those who have not taken even a single shot should get Covaxin or Sputnik V as the gap between two doses is less,” he said. Joshi also said directives have been given to all malls not to allow staff who yet to complete 14 days from second dose. “We will have to implement whatever directives came from the government.” The government had allowed almost all commercial activities and increased timings to 10pm from August 15 with a rider that those vaccinated should have completed 14 days from the second dose. Despite the new norms, there is no increase in the number of beneficiaries. 15,941 people took the jab in the city on Tuesday — 15,313 in NMC’s centres and 628 in private. The inoculation rate was around 20,000-30,000 per day between June 23 (when vaccination resumed for 18-44 years age group) and August 14, excluding a few days. The NMC was expecting a rise in the number. Meanwhile, the civic body has continued inoculation of bedridden people with 280 vaccinated till Tuesday. The civic chief on Tuesday issued an order allowing people below 18 years entry into malls with age proof. The government had relaxed the new norm for below 18 as they are yet to be made eligible for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-malls-warned-for-allowing-un-vaxxed-staff/articleshow/85411721.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Kanpur||Kanpur: 65-year-old man gets 18-year jail for physically assaulting minor||KANPUR: Special judge, Pocso Act court, Rajveer Singh on Tuesday convicted accused Banwari Lal to 18 years rigorous imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs 30,00 for physically exploiting a minor girl. The court in its order observed that if the accused failed to pay the fine, then he would have to suffer another jail term of three months. Out of the fine amount, Rs 15000 be given to the victim for her rehabilitation. The period which the accused had passed in jail so far would be adjusted in the term of the sentence, the court observed. According to Onkar Nath Verma, additional district government counsel (ADGC), the incident had taken place in 2013 when the victim was just ten years old and the accused was 65 years old. The report of the incident was lodged by the victim’s mother on July 27, 2013. She stated in the report that on July 27, 2013 at around 8 pm suddenly it started raining due to which most of the residents of the Rakhi Mandi locality went inside their houses. The accused who used to run a grocery shop had caught and dragged her daughter to a dilapidated building and physically exploited her, the complainant alleged. Hearing her daughter’s shrieks, she and her neighbours rushed to the spot. When accused Banwari Lal saw them approaching towards him, he ran away from the spot, she said. The accused in his defence stated that as he was a member of the slum development committee, he had falsely been implicated in the case. But when the court examined his documents, it was found that he was not a member of the committee, and he had only given a memorandum to the committee and suggested some work. On the quantum of sentence, the accused pleaded that since it was his first offence, and has responsibility to support his family. As he was 65 years old and had passed a term of more than three years in jail, therefore, the court should take a lenient view and award him lesser punishment, the accused pleaded. On the other hand, the prosecution argued that due to his act the future of a minor girl had become dark, therefore, he should be awarded severe punishment. The court, after going through the evidence and on the basis of arguments, convicted the accused accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/65-year-old-man-gets-18-year-jail-for-physically-assaulting-minor/articleshow/85414351.cms||Anant Shekher Misra
---||Pune||Bleeding piles complain on the rise in corona cured||PUNE: Bleeding piles is turning out to be another fallout of combined and extensive use of blood thinner, as well as steroid, among patients recovering from moderate and severe Covid-19 infection, with a majority of them requiring minimally invasive day-care surgery to cure them of the condition. Having said that, a majority of the cases of constipation-induced anal fissures recorded during the pandemic stemmed out of the excessive consumption of ‘kadha’, antibiotics and vitamin pills, experts said. “There has been a threefold rise in post-Covid cases of bleeding piles this year. Almost 82% of these patients needed surgery, indicating the severity of the condition,” Pune-based proctologist Ashwin Porwal of the Healing Hands Clinic (HHC) said. HHC is a dedicated proctology unit primarily treating various anal conditions. Last year, the HHC had registered 230 cases of bleeding piles between April-June. Of them, 155 cases were found in non-Covid patients, while 76 were found in Covid recovered cases. “This year, we have recorded 421 cases of bleeding piles during the same period (April-June). Of them, the highest 233 cases were in Covid recovered, who were put on prolonged steroid-blood thinners combination. The remaining (188) cases of bleeding piles were seen in non-Covid patients. Most of these patients are still undergoing treatment,” Porwal said. The commonest age group complaining of the condition was 40-50 years. Some of them had associated cardiac illnesses like hypertension and coronary artery disease. They were already on blood thinners. Patients who present with bleeding due to faulty lifestyles usually have associated fissures along with piles and a history of hard stools or excessive straining while passing stool. “A majority of them respond to medications and lifestyle modifications in two weeks. Only those with grade 3 and grade 4 piles will need surgery. But in post-Covid, with a history of taking blood thinners and steroids, the primary symptom is only bleeding. Their response to medications is very poor. That’s why most of them needed surgery,” Porwal said. Hyderabad-based endoscopist and proctologist Anuj Patel as well as Bengaluru-based proctologist Vishwanathan Venkatesan confirmed the trend. “Few conditions like arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease associated with cardiac illness warrants the blood thinners and steroid to be used in combination,” Porwal said. Surgeon Deepak Kulkarni said, “I am seeing an average of 3-4 such patients per day with a history of Covid. I follow the grade-wise treatment protocol.” Aniket (name changed), a patient with bleeding piles following Covid recovery, said, “I started experiencing bleeding in stools within two weeks after discharge from the Covid hospital. My haemoglobin dropped from 13 to 8. I was advised to undergo laser surgery to fix the issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bleeding-piles-complain-on-the-rise-in-corona-cured/articleshow/85411714.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Those clearing the BPSC preliminary test will get Rs50,000 each and Rs1 lakh will be paid to those who pass the UPSC preliminary examinations. The state’s proposal was approved to pay from its own resources for post-matric scholarship to the backward caste and extremely backward caste students from time to time. It will be valid for those who are not covered by the Centre’s scholarship for the OBC students with the approved family income limits.

---||Hyderabad||Motorists fume as agents rule in RTA||Warangal: A drive to the road transport authority (RTA) office here is turning into a hellish ride for many, with agents calling the shots and officials allegedly playing along. Be it a driving licence or fitness renewal, most coming to the RTA office in Rangashaipet area on Warangal-Khammam highway area have a similar allegation of being kept hanging and then shaken for extra cash to get the job done. The RTA complex here caters to residents of both Warangal and Hanamkonda. Most allege queues and rules were only for the public, while agents got the job done without driving/fitness tests. Booking online slots also barely helped, as many are turned away by officials citing ‘errors’ in paperwork, allege motorists, adding that there was a rate for all services which was collected through agents. “Everyday by 1.30pm online services are shut and we are indirectly made to go to agents. When I went through an agent, my work got done very fast. But I had to shell out more to pay the agent over the online charges for renewal of licence. This is the RTA business through agents,” said P Srinivas Charry, a resident of Naimnagar in Hanamkonda. Pogaku Raju, a resident of Neerukulla in Warangal, said that while government talks about utilising online services and avoiding agents, in reality it was just the opposite at the RTA office. Countering the allegations, deputy transport commissioner (DTC) Purushottam said that agents were in fact being encouraged by people who didn’t want to visit the RTA office personally to save their time. “Government is not responsible for that and we are not allowing agents. Only those who have online slots are being allowed,” he said. “For senior citizens, physically challenged and VVIPs, we even have a camera to take photo in my room to help them avoid the general queue.” Urging people to approach him directly to resolve problems, use online services and avoid agents, the DTC said: “People should come to me if they have a complaint against any official. We are rendering services equally to all.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/motorists-fume-as-agents-rule-in-rta/articleshow/85414333.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

However, it was clarified that a detailed verdict would be pronounced after hearing all sides and further submissions. The NGT asked the KRMB to file the report once again in accordance with rules by August 27. The bench also directed the AP government to submit its objections towards the report at its next hearing. The NGT bench sought the petitioner G Srinivas’s counsel Sravan Kumar to let the tribunal know if there are any precedents that would send officials to prison for committing contempt of court on such matters. The contempt petition alleged that the state government violated NGT’s orders that stayed the construction of Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project till it received an appropriate environmental clearance. The State has submitted a Detailed Project Report with the union environment ministry seeking an environmental clearance to go ahead with the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/violations-seem-to-have-taken-place-on-rlip-says-ngt/articleshow/85414538.cms||---

---||Pune||85,010 self-test kits used in Maharashtra since June: Officials||PUNE: Maharashtra health officials say nearly 85,010 self-test kits have been used in the state from June to mid-August for the confirmation of Covid positivity. The data on the use of the Mylab test kits (Coviself) were uploaded on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) web portal, as the company was considered as a laboratory and mandated the task of records update, like other laboratories. “Of the people who used the self-test kits in the state, 3,656 users (4.2%) tested Covid positive and the local authorities took follow-up actions through the ICMR portal,” a senior state health official said on Tuesday. As the number of Covid has started declining in the state, the demand for the self-test kits has also come down from what it was in June, a public health department official said. The state public health portal has marked self-test kits under the “laboratory” segment. “The onus is on the company to upload the test data on the ICMR portal that gets segregated state and district-wise data,” the official said. A Mylab official said response to the self-test kits was encouraging across the country. An ICMR official three such kits — CoviSelf from Maharashtra-based Mylab, Panbio Covid-19 test from US-based Abbott and Gujarat-based Meril Diagnostics’s CoviFind self-test kit — have so far been approved and more are in the pipeline. “The response to such kits may be a little low now, as the number of Covid cases are low. But these kits are handy when the laboratories are overwhelmed, particularly when the Covid cases surge. Each state has been told to keep a tab on the use of the self-test kits and uploading of the data on the portal,” the official said. The total caseload of the state on Tuesday crossed the 64 lakh-mark and the deaths stood at 1,35,255. The state government official is targeting an increase in vaccinations in districts, which largely depend on public vaccination centres and the vaccine numbers are low.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/85k-self-test-kits-used-in-maha-since-june-officials/articleshow/85411782.cms||Nisha Nambiar

If the government does not want to open temples, it must offer compensation to these people,” he said. Fadnavis said many more people visited bars and liquor shops than temples and yet these have been kept open maintaining Covid protocols. “The government is completely missing the point of the economy the temples support. For us Hindus, wherever we are our God is there,” he said. Fadnavis has raised the issue of shut shrines several times earlier. This time his attack is sharper as the government recently allowed bars, pubs and restaurants to stay open longer, till 10pm, after the owners made several representations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/temples-help-many-earn-compensate-them-in-mumbai-fadnavis/articleshow/85415791.cms||---

Instead of informing higher authorities, the staff and policemen deputed there tried to keep the development under wraps and wasted vital hours in trying to find the escapees themselves. It was only on Monday evening that the escape came to light and police teams were deployed to trace them. By Tuesday afternoon, two of the runaway boys were nabbed while three others are still at large. Soon after the news of the escape spread, DM of Bulandshahr Ravindra Kumar and SSP Santosh Singh rushed to the home. After checking CCTV footage, three constables on duty at the home at that time --Subhash Dhama, Rahul Bansal and Sachin Kumar -- were suspended for dereliction of duty. Akhilesh Tripathi, SHO at Bulandshahr Kotwali, said, “Three of the escaped juveniles are from Bulandshahr -- Dibai, Shikarpur and Ahmadgarh. One is a resident of Hapur. We have so far arrested two of them.” The DM directed police to file an FIR against the three constables and in charge of the home. Besides, the Commandant of the homeguard division has also been requested to take action against three other security guards. According to SSP Santosh Kumar, several teams have been deployed to trace the boys on the run. “An FIR has been filed against three policemen and the home administrator under IPC section 223 (escape from confinement or custody negligently suffered by public servant) and 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) against the five juveniles,” said SHO Tripathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/5-juveniles-escape-from-reformatory-home-two-nabbed-3-cops-suspended/articleshow/85409518.cms||Sandeep Rai

A PMC official, who will be part of the team, told TOI that staff will be trained on issuing passes. “There will be two shifts —7am to 1pm and 1pm to 7pm. People can come and get passes,” said the PMC official. Pune railway division officials said citizens will have to show the passes at ticket counters where they will be issued a monthly season pass. Upon verification, the help desk will put a special stamp on the documents. “No daily tickets will be given. The passes will have a QR code which will be scanned and verified before issuing the season pass. As of now, some trains to Lonavla and Daund are operational for those working in essential services. If the corporation starts giving passes from Wednesday, they will be valid from the same day,” said the railway official. According to sources, some people came to the Pune railway station on Tuesday looking for the help desks. “They claimed to be fully vaccinated,” said the source. A senior official at the Pune station said the PMC told them a team would be sent on Tuesday but no one turned up. “We were told similar help desks will be set up at the Chinchwad and Talegaon stations too,” the official said. No information was available regarding more help desks. Middle-aged Dilip Holkar, a resident of Khedgaon, who has been travelling to Pune on his two-wheeler for over year expressed frustration at the delay. “Are authorities waiting for cases to increase so that the restrictions are imposed again?” he said. Fully vaccinated citizens were allowed to travel in local trains in Mumbai starting August 15. The BMC facilitated issuance of seasonal monthly passes after verification of passengers’ documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/help-desks-at-pune-shivajinagar-stations-from-today-for-travel-passes/articleshow/85411807.cms||Joy Sengupta

The police, after getting information, rushed to the spot and admitted the seriously injured old woman to a nearby hospital, besides they dispatched the body of elderly man to the district hospital for autopsy. The police during further investigations came to know from the neighbours that the old man was reeling under some kind of psychological disorder and undergoing treatment in the city. Ghaseetey (65) set his wife Sugni Devi (62) on fire by pouring inflammable substance at around 4 am. After that he hanged himself. The man died while Sugni Devi’s condition is critical. She is admitted to a private hospital in Gujaini. ACP Kalyanpur Dinesh Shukla said that Ghaseetey was mentally ill. It is suspected that this is the reason why he committed the crime. Further investigations are on. Ghaseetey Lal used to live in Singhpur Kachar area of Gopalpur in Panki, with his wife Sugni Devi and three sons Sanjay Paswan, Amarnath and Raj Bahadur. “Sanjay and Raj Bahadur live separately with their family in a house located in Patarsa village, while Amarnath lives with parents in Singhpur Kachar,” said the police. Father Ghaseetey Lal was undergoing psychiatric treatment in Kanpur for a long time, police said further. According to son Amarnath, his father apparently woke up at around 4:00 am on Tuesday. “On seeing his mother sleeping on a cot, his father apparently doused her with an inflammable substance and set her on fire. Thereafter, he too ended his life by hanging himself from a bamboo ladder kept in the verandah of the house. He died later,” he said. Inspector Panki Dadhibal Tiwari said that the reason behind the incident was that the old man was suffering from mental illness. “His wife has been admitted to a private hospital by family members, where we are in the process of recording her statement,” he said.

The statement submitted by his lawyer said: “...there is not cause to show notice and initiate proceedings against him [the witness]. It is clear from his testimony that the investigating officer had submitted a typed statement to the magistrate and the respondent did not have a chance to freely depose before the magistrate.” It added that earlier, he had been summoned multiple times by the investigating officer. “He was under immense pressure and threat.” The witness said that if one compares both his statements, they are identical. The statement iterated that he had disclosed before the magistrate that he did not have knowledge about two to three points mentioned in the statement. “The contents of the statement were typed in Marathi and were explained to me in Hindi. The contents were not true and correct. I had put my signature on the statement,” the witness had said. In September 2012, ATS had arrested five men in connection with an arms haul in Nanded. The NIA took over the probe in 2013. In June, the court had issued a notice to the hostile witness, who was to depose on a conspiracy meeting between the accused, for allegedly deposing falsely. The notice came in a judgment where the court found Mohammed Muzammil Gani (37), Mohammed Akram (30) and Mohammed Sadiq (35) guilty under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act for plotting terror attacks across the country at the behest of terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and sentenced them to 10 years’ RI. Additionally, Gani was convicted under the Arms Act. Two others were acquitted.  The prosecution had submitted that when the statement of the witness was recorded by the investigators and the magistrate, he had claimed that he heard Akram asking the co-accused to exact revenge against those who carried out blasts at Purna, Parbhani and Jalna. During trial, the witness denied saying this. He also denied saying that Akram used to tell him that he wanted to do “extraordinary work” in Hyderabad and Nanded and he would get LeT’s help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2012-arms-haul-gave-statement-under-pressure-claims-witness-in-mumbai/articleshow/85415327.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Pune||60% of eligible population got first dose in Pune Metropolitan Region, 21% fully vaccinated||PUNE: About 60% of the eligible 18-plus population in the Pune Metropolitan Region have received the first dose of the Covid vaccine, but the vaccination percentage comes to 21% when the completion of the second dose is taken into consideration. “The Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR)’s total population is 1.17 crore. Of this, 87.42 lakh residents are above 18 years, who are eligible to get the Covid vaccine. Among this, 60% population have received the first dose of the Covid vaccine. However, the completion of vaccination with both doses has so far been achieved in 21% of the population in the region,” said public health expert Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director of health services, Pune region. For reaching the herd immunity stage, the region needs to achieve vaccination of its 60% population with both the doses, experts said. Deshmukh underlined the importance of vaccinating 60% of the region’s population with both doses to achieve the herd immunity stage. Herd immunity, also known as “population immunity”, is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through the previous infection. “The World Health Organisation (WHO) supports achieving ‘herd immunity’ through vaccination because the immunity acquired through natural Covid infection may taper down faster than vaccine-induced immunity,” Deshmukh said. Prioritising vaccination of those who did not suffer from the natural Covid infection previously would enable achievement of herd immunity faster in view of the shortage of vaccine doses, experts stressed. “We are facing crises of vaccine supplies. Natural infection gives robust immunity, whatever some experts (without evidence) may say. Excluding those who have antibodies to Covid-19 or have had a positive RT-PCR test in the past from the first round of vaccination will save a lot of resources and enable vaccination of all those who are vulnerable,” said senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/60-of-eligible-population-got-first-dose-in-region-21-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/85411844.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The woman tried to speed away but was allegedly stopped by the man who parked his bike ahead of her scooter. As the woman applied the brake, her scooter skidded and she fell down and screamed for help. Four employees from a nearby petrol pump rushed to their rescue when the biker fled away. The traumatised woman sustained injuries and was stuck under the scooter while her brother was left with bleeding on his legs. “We have been living here for 12 years but have never had such an experience. The incident has left my daughter traumatised and she is yet to recover from the shock. We suddenly feel helpless in our own neighbourhood,” said the woman’s mother who runs a café near New Town School. The incident happened on the service road between New Town police station and Greenfield Heights Complex — where the woman lived — around 10.15pm on Monday. The woman was returning home from their café. “I was riding at a moderate speed while chatting with my brother riding pillion. I realised that someone was trailing me on a bike. Within moments the man was next to us, teasing me and calling me by names. He asked me in Bengali if I wished to smoke ganja with him. As I tried to speed away, he threatened me, saying that I would not be able to escape as he was on a bike and he would catch me,” the traumatised 18-year-old told TOI. The woman had initially ignored the accused and tried to move as fast as she could. But the man allegedly started driving very close to her and even made advances to touch her from the side. There were not many people on the road, which does not have proper illumination, during that time, she said. Helped by the men at the petrol pump, the teenagers reached home. The victim’s parents lodged a complaint with New Town police station. “Cops checked the CCTV footage and spotted the man but they could not identify him,” said the woman. A senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate said that they had received a complaint and started a probe to trace the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/biker-harasses-woman-on-new-town-road/articleshow/85411830.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Nagpur||Discom staff cross flooded river to ensure power to 2 consumers||Chandrapur: Showing great commitment towards customer service, MSEDCL employees rowed an electric transformer through a flooded river to provide power supply to an agriculture consumer. Technical employees of Ballarpur sub-division office of MSEDCL risked their lives to cross the flooded river with the heavy transformer in two boats tied together on August 13. Official sources informed that power supply to two agriculture connections in village Tok (Gangapur) at the furthest end of Pombhurna tehsil was snapped following breakdown in power transformer. The two consumers — Shantabai Dayle and Teklu Kasture — had recently cleared their pending power bills collectively amounting to Rs11,730 and were entitled for regular and uninterrupted power supply. Assistant engineer Kunal Patil took up the issue and arranged a spare transformer for Tok (Gangapur) village. However, the main hurdle was that there was no proper road to take the transformer to its destination. There is a 30km long dilapidated kuccha road from Pombhurna up to Jungaon, the nearest place to Tok (Gangapur) with approachable road. It was thus decided to transport the heavy 25 KVA transformer on wooden boats across the Vainganga river flowing in spate. MSEDCL technician Santosh Wadhai and one Raut shouldered the responsibility to row the transformer in the boats at the risk of their lives. The duo loaded the transformer in the boat and transported it with the help of local boatman up to Tok (Gangapur), and replaced the one that had malfunctioned. Officials claimed that restoration of power supply saved the farmers by allowing them to get the necessary water for re-plantation of paddy in their farms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/discom-staff-cross-flooded-river-to-ensure-power-to-2-consumers/articleshow/85411906.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Iconic skywalk to make way for flyover on Avinashi Road||COIMBATORE: The iconic steel arch skywalk that helped thousands of students of PSG Institute to cross the busy Avinashi Road for close to 15 years is all set to be dismantled in a few weeks. The skywalk will make way for Avinashi Road flyover, which is touted to be the longest in the state. The skywalk at Peelamedu was designed and executed by civil engineering students of PSG College of Technology in 2007, following a failed bid by to create a concrete structure at the same place. The bridge, which was featured in many videos on Coimbatore, is considered by many as one of the landmarks of the city. For many students of the PSG Institute, it is an emotion.  “Watching vehicles passing under the bridge on a rainy day and taking a walk on the bridge as the sun sets are some of my memorable moments,” says C Pavithra, an alumnus of both PSG College of Technology and PSG Institute of Management. Pavithra, who lives in a nearby area, also recalled the utility of the skywalk in her student days. “Without the bridge, it would be a nightmare to cross Avinashi Road during peak hours. I still remember how I used to run on the skywalk without worrying about the traffic to reach classrooms during exam times after studying till the last minute.” More than day-scholars, hostelers frequently used the skywalk as they went to and fro from PSG College of Technology to their hostels behind PSG Institute of Management on the other side of the road. Usha Parathasarathy, 47, an entrepreneur and alumni of PSG Institute of Management, says the bridge will get more visitors in the coming days. Her daughter, who passed out of PSG College of Technology last year, had spent some time with her friends on the bridge on Sunday after they learnt about the plan to bring it down. The bridge is so close to the institution that students had named their online magazine as ‘The Bridge’, with its image in the backdrop. The idea of a skywalk came to prevent students from falling victim to road accidents on the busy Avinashi Road. Dismantling the bridge is inevitable, as it comes in the way of the flyover project, says a senior official with the highways department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/iconic-skywalk-to-make-way-for-flyover-on-avinashi-road/articleshow/85411879.cms||Sampath Kumar

PM Modi spoke to Jyoti as part of his interaction with 54 para-athletes contingent which will take part in the games. In his brief video conversation with Jyoti, PM Modi asked her about the problems she faced and hailed her achievements in the sports. Jyoti, 25, a resident of Goyla village in Muzaffarnagar, was a child when a wrong injection administered by a quack left her one leg paralysed. Her father, a marginal farmer, didn’t lose confidence in her daughter -- who always wanted to be a sports person. He encouraged her to take up archery. When she turned 13, Devendra Singh Balyan, the father, purchased an archery kit for her that cost him whopping Rs 3lakh. He took a loan for it. Jyoti hasn’t looked back since then. She participated in several state and national events and bagged scores of medals. But, in between, her father died in an accident while working in his field about five years ago. The Prime Minister commended Jyoti’s perseverance and wished her luck for the games. PM Modi also asked what dish she would ask her mother to prepare once she returns after winning the medal. Jyoti said she liked ‘bhindi’ (okra) and chapati. Being trained by Kuldeep Kumar Vaidwan in Panipat, Jyoti is scheduled to fly to Tokyo on August 23. Later, speaking to TOI about the interaction with the PM, Jyoti said, “I was very excited. It was the best day of my life. I am feeling good and energetic. I will try my best to get gold for the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/pm-hails-muzaffarnagar-archer-asks-her-to-bring-gold-from-paralympic-games-in-tokyo/articleshow/85409625.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Kolkata||Manja menace: Cops seek wire mesh, nets on flyovers||Kolkata: After three accidents related to kite threads on Vidyasagar Setu this year, Kolkata traffic cops are focussing on the installation of road furniture like welded wire mesh and wire nets to stop such incidents on bridges in the city.  Cops are planning to send two separate letters to the KMDA and the HRBC — the custodians of Maa flyover and Vidyasagar Setu — in this regard. In the letters drafted by DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha, cops have asked for the installation of welded wire mesh and wire nettings on both the flanks of a bridge to stop the Chinese manja from reaching the carriageway. Cops have also requested them to arrange for sufficient illumination, especially at night, pointing that some high mast lights have stopped functioning for a long time. “More red blinkers should be used on lanes, curves and bifurcations to alert drivers in advance,” said the police in their letter to the HRBC. The kite thread accidents — where the Chinese Manja cuts through the nose or neck of bikers, often throwing them off the two-wheelers and forcing them to undergo multiple stitches — are not a headache for cops only on Maa flyover. The city’s first Manja death had taken place on the AJC Bose Road flyover last year. On Independence Day alone, two bikers received injuries due to kite threads on both Vidyasagar Setu and AJC Bose Road. Sources said that a similar proposal is being readied regarding the AJC Bose Road flyover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/manja-menace-cops-seek-wire-mesh-nets-on-flyovers/articleshow/85411917.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

According to police, her family had lodged a missing complaint in July. The girl, who was recently spotted with her friend at her house in Shahbad, said that she left her home “willingly” as she wanted to stay with her friend as they both like each other. Since both the girls are above 18 years and one of them willingly left her home, the duo were presented before an executive magistrate who granted them permission to live together, police said. Speaking to TOI, Swar circle officer Dharam Singh Marchal said, “After the girl was recovered by the police team, she revealed that she left home by choice as she wanted to live with her “friend” and not with her family. The girl’s family had earlier told police that the girl is a minor. However, she was found to be in her 20s. The girls showed their high school certificates. One of them is in her early 20s while the other one is a postgraduate student.” “Soon after the girl was recovered, the duo and their families sat together and long counselling sessions were given to them.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Private eye, wife seek to keep extortion trial in abeyance||MUMBAI: The defence moved the special court on Tuesday seeking to be kept in abeyance the trial against Satish Mangle, a private detective from Dombivli, and his wife, both arrested in 2017 for extorting money from IAS officer Radheshyam Mopalwar. The plea submitted through advocate Y P Singh said that the trial should be halted till the Special Investigation Team (SIT) completes its investigations in another case related to gangster Ravi Pujari and former police officer Pradeep Sharma. The plea claimed that the modus operandi in both cases were similar. While Pujari was accused of making the alleged extortion calls in the case involving Mangle, Sharma was one of the officers investigating the case. Both Pujari and Sharma are in jail in other cases. Earlier this month, the Thane police had formed an SIT to probe an extortion case against former police commissioner Param Bir Singh and 27 others registered with the Thane nagar police station. The plea submitted on Tuesday said that this was a similar case where Pujari was allegedly being used by the police to frame people in an extortion case. “The accused submits that in her case also the modus operandi is identical and, inter alia, the conspirators are common, namely, Pradeep Sharma and Ravi Pujari,” the plea submitted on behalf of Mangle’s wife, Shraddha Mangle said. “…. [T]he outcome of one case would have a profound bearing on the other case,” the plea said. The plea said that as per a scheme hatched for framing her, Sharma, then without any evidence and without any legal jurisdiction to investigate, charged her, a lactating mother for being a member of Pujari’s gang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pvt-eye-wife-seek-to-keep-extortion-trial-in-abeyance/articleshow/85415921.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Fire-ravaged Bagree block opens after Rs 20 crore revamp||KOLKATA: The portion of Bagree market that was gutted in September 2018 was thrown open for business on Tuesday after a total revamp, including a complete overhaul of the fire-fighting system, new amenities and electrical wiring. Traders pooled in resources and roped in engineers from IIT Roorkee for the overhaul of block A with over 200 shops. “This is Bagree Market’s second birth after the fire in 2018. It sets an example that if the business community decides to follow fire safety norms, anything is possible. Bagree has become the lifeline of Burrabazar,” said transport minister and former mayor Firhad Hakim. Fire minister Sujit Bose said there was a need for robust fire safety measures in Burrabazar. “It is for the safety of owners and their businesses. Please do not neglect fire safety. It can destroy everything,” said Bose in the presence of Jorasanko MLA Vivek Gupta. When the inferno raged for 100 hours in September 2018, gutting Bagree Market’s block A completely, the shopkeepers were devastated. Md Qasim, who owned the largest store in the block and had sustained the biggest loss, had thanked God for saving his life. Three years later, he thanked God once again on Tuesday. Qasim stood in his 4,000 sq ft cosmetics and costume jewellery store on the second floor, beaming with pride. Of the Rs 20 crore that the shop owners’ association has spent on revamping the market, Rs 15 crore went into reconstructing the 3 lakh sq ft in block A. The concrete was stripped from the pillars, beams and ceilings; steel jacketing was done and repair was carried out with micro-concrete that is 10-times stronger than the reinforced cement concrete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fire-ravaged-bagree-block-opens-after-rs-20cr-revamp/articleshow/85412026.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) will construct the bridge as part of the Smart City Mission in Panaji at an estimated cost of Rs 6.7 crore. GSIDC floated a tender for the pedestrian bridge on Tuesday, which is proposed to be built next to the unique mangrove boardwalk behind the Central Library at Patto and over the Rua de Ourem creek. The bridge, said GSIDC officials, will have a ramp to enable persons with disabilities to use the bridge without any hassles. “No piling will be done in the water and thus no obstruction to the waterway and freeboard is 3.5m,” said a GSIDC official. The 99-meter long bridge will be supported by 18 steel cables with steel railings and illumination also being installed. “This bridge will solve the logistic problems and make a new tourist attraction centre,” GSIDC officials said. There are three vehicular bridges over Rio De Ourem creek while a single pedestrian bridge connects the old town of Panaji with the EDC patto complex. The cable-stayed footbridge along with completion of the cycling track along the Mandovi promenade from Youth Hostel to Children’s Park at Campal received the nod at IPSCDL’s board meeting held on June 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rs-6-7cr-cable-stayed-footbridge-to-link-patto-with-mala/articleshow/85414646.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||SRA to embark on Mumbai slum survey 6 years after GIS mapping||MUMBAI: The Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) has been authorised by the state government to conduct a survey of all slums in Mumbai and Thane. As per a gazette notification issued last Thursday, the SRA will now appoint officers for various zones across the city to carry out the survey and issue eligibility certificates to slum dwellers for free housing. A slum survey will be carried out afresh in Dharavi too, where the Dharavi Redevelopment Project has failed to take off in 17 years despite it being declared as a vital infrastructure project. Satish Lokhande, chief executive officer, SRA, said bringing the survey of all slums under the ambit of the SRA will reduce delay. A comprehensive data map that will be available online will ensure there is no manipulation, he said. The SRA has written to electricity distribution companies to provide bills issued to hutment dwellers. “We carried out GIS mapping of slum clusters in 2015. Now we have appointed four agencies that will go door-to-door, record every hut, every inhabitant of the hut, collect details of Aadhaar and voter ID cards. We shall link all these details for every hutment dweller — the location will be mapped through GIS, photographs of the dwellers, along with their various proofs, will all be put together and this will help us put data in one place, making it easy to issue annexure II,” he said. Annexure II is an important document that lists the names of slum dwellers who are eligible for free housing. This is normally prepared by the collector’s office or the local BMC ward after a slum redevelopment scheme is announced. There have been allegations of massive corruption and manipulation in the preparation of the list. Lokhande said that to avoid these conflicts, now on only the SRA will prepare annexure II for all slums and the data will be uploaded on an auto annexure for anyone to download. “Once the data is ready, we shall invite objections/suggestions from the public to correct any anomalies,” he said. The exercise will begin across the island city and suburbs simultaneously next month. Shweta Tambe, director, Habitat and Livelihood Welfare Association, said GIS mapping was faulty to start with and door-to-door survey in Jogeshwari did not follow protocol. “The data collected is not retrievable and cannot be used. Slum dwellers cannot access the data. And what happens to already announced projects?” she asked. As per the last survey, the habitable area of Greater Mumbai totals 34,000 acres. The habitable area excludes land under rivers, nullahs, mangroves, forests, parks, grounds and so on, according to a senior SRA official. Urban planners say the area under slums has not spread over the years since slums have seen a vertical growth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sra-to-embark-on-mumbai-slum-survey-6-yrs-after-gis-mapping/articleshow/85415347.cms||Clara Lewis

However, since Dr Krishnan left before the committee was made full-fledged — he did not select a governor nominee as member — the MKU Faculty Association (MUFA) has called upon the government to take steps to resolve the issue at earliest. MUFA general secretary Dr K Sadasivam said that the former VC did not fulfil his duties before his departure. “The institution now remains headless. This is affecting the functioning of the university and hence the convener committee must be made functional with appointment of a governor nominee as convener committee member as soon as possible,” he said. During the syndicate meeting convened by the former VC on August 4, the syndicate was supposed to select three members to the convener committee. However, sources said that only two members, one, the principal secretary to government (higher education department), D Karthikeyan as convener, and the other a senior university faculty, A Meshach Ponraj, associate professor, department of computer science, were finalized. “The third member is supposed to be a governor nominee, who had to be either S Theenathayalan, head of department of Economics in Madura College, or R Lakshmipathy, editor and publisher of Dinamalar. However, according to the draft minutes of the meeting, the third member selected is said to be the director of collegiate education, Dr C Pooranachandran,” said a source. According to reliable sources, the two probables for governor nominee have objected to this and written to the governor, principal secretary and registrar (in charge) of MKU seeking justice. The last date for observation of the draft minutes was Monday. The university registrar (in charge) is expected to address the matter on Wednesday or in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/post-guvs-nominee-on-panel-to-run-mku-faculty-urges-govt/articleshow/85412063.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kochi||River council gives suggestions to govt||Kochi: Chalakudy River protection council has asked the government to take steps to avoid/reduce the chances of flood in the river basin. In its letter, the council suggested that KSEB could opt for power generation at Kerala Sholayar powerhouse immediately to bring down the storage level to 85% from 89%. In case of a warning for very heavy rain (over 11cm), controlled release of water can be done to create an additional flood cushion. “Water level at Tamil Nadu Sholayar basin is above its full reservoir level (FRL) for nearly four weeks. It is diverting entire inflows, including that from Upper Nirar Weir and Lower Nirar dam to Parambikulam reservoir. It cannot store even a single drop in case of moderate-to-heavy rain,” said council secretary SP Ravi. Kerala Sholayar reservoir has a storage space of 16 million Cu m and this is likely to be filled up soon. It was possible to maintain the storage below 75% had KSEB scheduled full power generation from the reservoirs at the station, as is being done at Idukki and Sabarigiri. But, power generation was kept below 10% of the capacity for over two weeks since July 25 when generation was restarted after rain on previous days. Now, power generation is 50% of the available capacity, he added. Chalakudy River has six dams including Thunakkadavu, Peruvarippallam, Parambikulam, Kerala Sholayar, TN Sholayar and Peringalkuthu. Any discharge from Parambikulam, Kerala Sholayar and Thunakkadavu flows into Peringalkuthu reservoir Peringalkuthu reservoir, which receives water from upper Sholayar, is vulnerable too. “There was a need to reduce the water level at Peringalkuthu to 413m by operating one sluice so that some flood moderation would be possible, if need arose. Water at Peringalkuthu is consistently maintained above the upper rule level of 419.4m (MSL) and often it goes above 420m. On two occasions, this season, one of the river sluices had to be opened when the reservoir was releasing water at over 300 cumecs. It is unfortunate that dam authorities don’t release water earlier to reduce water level to keep flood discharge at moderate levels. It was sheer luck that rains reduced, despite yellow alert and the basin was saved from a moderate flood,” said the council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/river-council-gives-suggestions-to-govt/articleshow/85409760.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

She also claimed that 15 other co-workers of her husband -- all Indians-- were also stuck there and their passports were in possession of the factory owner. Sheela Devi said that she and her three children haven’t slept properly for the last several days. Her husband, Mukesh Kumar Baghel, 41, had left for Kabul in December last year to work as a technician in the factory. “I appeal to PM Modi and CM Yogi to help me get my husband back,” Sheela, a resident of Gangagarh village of Bulandshahr, said. She spoke to her husband on Tuesday morning. She also claimed that there were at least 15 Indians stuck along with her husband. “Some are from Ghaziabad and Delhi,” she added.

---||Mangaluru||Woman, boyfriend get life for husband’s murder||Mangaluru: The third additional district and sessions court sentenced a woman and her boyfriend to life imprisonment, for killing her husband in 2016, on Tuesday . Judge Basappa Balappa Jakati held Ashwini and her boyfriend Ananda Mera guilty of the crime, and awarded the punishment. The incident took place on September 13, 2016. In 2014, Ashwini had married Jayaraj and they were staying in a rented home in Moodabidri. In 2016, Ashwin delivered a baby girl. Meanwhile, Jayaraj learnt about Ashwini’s affair with Ananda, and there was a fight between them. On September 13, when Ashwini was at her maternal house in Moodukonaje in Moodbidri, she called her husband Jayaraj to her home on the pretext of giving some money. She had hatched a plan to murder Jayaraj with the help of Ananda. When Jayaraj entered the house, Ananda hit him with an iron rod and killed him. They later dumped the body in an empty well and sprayed chemicals. After three days, Ashwini in order to mislead the police, filed a missing complaint at Moodabidri police station. Ananda tried to mislead the police and claimed that he had abducted Jayaraj. Using Jayaraj’s phone number, he called Jayaraj’s mother and told her that Jayaraj owed Rs 62,000 to abductors. On September 22, Jayaraj’s brother Girish filed a case of abduction, and the subsequent investigation revealed that it was a murder. Moodabidri police inspector Ramachandra Nayak filed the chargesheet. A total 36 witnesses were examined. Public prosecutor Narayana Sherigar represented the victim. Ashwini and Ananda have each been fined Rs 5,000. Apart from this, a two year of jail term for destruction of evidence and Rs 2,000 fine was also imposed. A total of Rs 10,000 will be given to Jayaraj’s mother, and his daughter will also receive some money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/woman-boyfriend-get-life-for-husbands-murder/articleshow/85407946.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Three Mumbai foreign schools open gates to students||MUMBAI: Most schools in Mumbai have not reopened since the March 2020 lockdown, but the foreign-run ones have begun to welcome students back into the physical classroom. The American School of Bombay at BKC on Monday welcomed grade 4 and 5 students to the campus. It was the first in the city to get permission for in-person learning in January. Two others—Deutsche Schule Bombay, a German school with campuses at Breach Candy and Lower Parel, and Lycée Francais International de Mumbai, a French school in Lower Parel—have also got approvals from the BMC for physical classrooms. Educationists have been demanding reopening of all schools in a phased manner, citing the limitations of online teaching. The 45-odd Cambridge International board schools, which have maximum classroom strength of 20, have been vocal on the issue. The state, however, is reluctant due to fears of a third wave. ASB on Monday tweeted pictures of students being welcomed to the campus. Students were in masks and were checked for temperature before entering the premises. BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said schools for children of diplomatic staff were granted permission in January 2021. "Not a single positive case has been reported from these schools. We have informed them that all Covid norms must be strictly followed," said Chahal. The state had last week issued a government resolution to reopen schools in urban areas for classes 8-12. But schools in Mumbai were told to continue online education till November due to the threat of a third wave. The GR has been put on hold. ASB’s website said all Covid-19 protocols were being followed for the reopening, while teachers, other staff and older students had been vaccinated. The younger lot had to produce a negative report to be physically present in the classroom. ASB head Johnson Craig did not respond to calls and messages. In Mumbai, schools have been shut since the March 2020 lockdown. The state cancelled SSC and HSC exams this year due to the second wave. Questioning its reluctance to allow more latitude to their institutions, the principal of a Cambridge International school said, “There has to be fairness in reopening schools. Why should only a handful of schools have physical classes?” Over 45 Cambridge schools in Mumbai had written to BMC for permission to resume in-person teaching in January. While the request was turned down, Cambridge schools did get permission to conduct offline exams for classes 9 to 12 in February-March. “The board exams were held by following all Covid protocols. We are ready with our plan for physical school too. Online learning is not working beyond a point,” said Dr Hanif Kanjer, director, Rustomjee Cambridge International School, Dahisar. Students are missing out on key aspects like practical training and social learning, which is not possible in digital education, said Kavita Chatterjee, Principal, Orchids The International School, Kurla. They should be allowed the hybrid model of offline-online classes for the next few months by adhering to Covid protocols, she said. While aided schools have a class strength of more than 40-50 students, international schools have a maximum of 20 per class, which allows them to enforce social distancing more effectively.  A senior officer in the BMC education department argued that foreign schools have ensured their teachers and support staff are vaccinated. International schools, however, contend that over 80% of their staff are also vaccinated. In state board schools, barely 50% staff are vaccinated. Of the three schools reopening in the city, LFIM opens its gates on September 1. The students have been on summer vacation since June 26. Prior to that, the school held physical classes. DSB International school principal Howard Gee did not comment on the reopening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-city-foreign-schools-open-gates-to-students/articleshow/85415356.cms||Sandhya Nair

They also demanded the officials to drop charges against the farmer. P Kandasamy, state general secretary, Vivasayigal Sangam (non-political, non-communal and non-religious) said the farmer, K Gopalsamy, 38, of Gobirasipuram, was booked under the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (prevention of atrocities) Act, which he said, was misused in this case. He was also booked for not allowing the government staff to perform their duties. “He was booked without conducting a proper inquiry by police and revenue department officials. Village assistant Muthusamy, 56, had slapped Gopalsamy before he was made to prostrate. The person who took video of the entire incident and circulated on social media in two different parts seems to have an intention to create tension. But police haven’t taken any action against that person,” Kandasamy said. The protesters also demanded police to register a case against the VAO, Kalaiselvi, 32, and Muthusamy. They said a bandh would be conducted at Annur taluk on Thursday to condemn the attack on the farmer. Both Kalaiselvi and Muthusamy were placed under suspension on Monday for furnishing false information before the inquiry committee that was constituted by district collector G S Sameeran to probe the charges against Gopalsamy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dismiss-vao-assistant-farmers-tell-dist-admin/articleshow/85412070.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The SEZ here will provide a tax-free landing to a Hawker 800 XP aircraft set to be delivered to the lessee at Delhi. The transaction is being dubbed to be the first its kind in the country. Here is how the chain of events will take place. The plane is being imported from UK by Jetsetgo Fleet Management Services Private Limited. This is an entity under the GIFT City IFSC, near Ahmedabad. The IFSC is a deemed-foreign area and part of multi-service SEZ. The IFSC framework allows leasing companies to operate from its jurisdiction. Jetsetgo is the first leasing company based in India to import an aircraft. Even as the import would be tax-free, GIFT City IFSC does not have an airport of its own. Taxes would apply if the aircraft lands at a regular airport, including the one at Ahmedabad. Here is where Mihan-SEZ comes into play. Mihan is connected to the airport through the taxiway connecting Air India’s maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) depot. Being a SEZ, any imported item entering Mihan will not attract any duty. After landing at Nagpur airport, the aircraft will be towed inside the MRO. The customs clearance will happen at Mihan. From here, the plane will further take off for Delhi to be delivered to the lessee — Indo Pacific Aviation, which is an arm of Jetsetgo. The duty will be attracted only when the plane is moved out of the SEZ to be delivered to the lessee, as per rates applicable to non-scheduled operator. There are only two SEZs linked to an airport. One is Mihan and the other of GMR at Hyderabad. Even as Jetsetgo will be the first Indian leasing company to directly import an aircraft, Air India MRO also sees an opportunity in providing parking and warehousing services for such aircraft imports. Clearance to the aircraft is expected to be completed within two days. So far aircraft are imported into India by leasing companies through their foreign subsidiaries in countries where taxes are low. Jetsetgo will do it directly. The arrangement has been facilitated by Moon SEZ Consultants Private Limited. “As of now aircraft are imported to India on lease from other foreign jurisdictions, especially Ireland, because of low taxes. Now Jetsetgo, an Indian company and an entity under GIFT City IFSC, will directly import the aircraft. Mihan SEZ will work as an extension of the GIFT City IFSC’s aircraft leasing ecosystem. The aircraft will be imported in the name of IFSC entity and the warehousing and parking will be at Mihan to fulfil SEZ requirements,” said Ashish Jhagarawat, director and CEO of Moon Consultants. Now, since the aircraft will be directly imported by an Indian company at GIFT City IFSC, the lease rent will directly come to India, bringing foreign exchange to the country. Development commissioner of Mihan-SEZ Sraman Vasireddy said Mihan had to compete with GMR in Hyderabad to bag the deal. It has been ensured that the clearance will happen in two days. More such arrangements are expected to be worked out in coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mihan-to-provide-smooth-landing-to-countrys-directly-imported-lease-aircraft/articleshow/85412150.cms||Shishir Arya

This had led to inquiries by the GST authorities and ultimately a fine was imposed on the hotel as fruits do not attract GST. But, and there is a big but involved, if fruits have been sliced and diced and served to customers in sealed bowls, they will attract GST at 5%. The Karnataka Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR), which passed this ruling, did not deal with an instance of fruits served in a hotel, but fruits supplied by Juzi Fruits, a private company in Bengaluru. This company is engaged in the purchase and subsequent supply of fresh fruits in bowls (with or without the addition of dry fruits & nuts). The process involves washing, cleaning, peeling and dicing (if needed) of the fruits and packaging them in sealed bowls for ready consumption. No preservatives or additives are added. Only excess oxygen in the bowl is removed to extend the life of the fruits, and the bowl is covered in transparent film. While edible fruits and nuts do not attract GST, the AAR bench held that these bowls of fruit, which are sold under a brand name, would attract GST at the rate of 5% under Entry Number 59 of Schedule 1. If the fresh fruits were sold with dry fruits & nuts, then it would be a mixed supply and attract GST at the higher rate applicable to either the fruits or the dry fruits & nuts. In the absence of specific details of dry fruits & nuts used, the AAR bench declined to specify the GST rate. The bench added that Juzi Fruits would be entitled to input tax credit for the GST borne by it against its purchases and related expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/branded-bowl-of-fresh-fruits-to-face-5-gst/articleshow/85443057.cms||---

He said that while it may sound a bit over-ambitious to achieve zero pendency given the current judge strength, it is his mission to achieve zero pendency in all categories of cases in Goa. Zero pendency status has already been achieved in criminal appeals where the sentence exceeds 10 years, he said, adding that several tax matters have been disposed of and “we are confident of achieving zero pendency status in this area as well, shortly”. Dutta said since he took over in April 2020, HC has seen 15 judges retire, and three more are on verge of retirement. “During this time, only four new judges have been elevated. These bottlenecks notwithstanding, there has been no slip in administration of justice according to the oath the judges have taken.” “Once the functional strength improves, it will provide me with the opportunity to send more judges to Goa to reduce the pendency,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-hc-functioning-with-66-of-its-sanctioned-judge-strength/articleshow/85415984.cms||---

My aim is to keep myself fit. All of us have realized that fit people can face Covid-19 better,” he said. As Covid has taken a long pause, it seems people have now learned their lessons to maintain a healthy lifestyle. There are more takers for Yoga, Ayurvedic medicines and fitness-oriented lifestyle. Ayurveda experts, fitness trainers, physiotherapists are busy these days. “Visitors to my OPD are asking for an ideal Ayurveda lifestyle which ensures sound health in the long run. I ask them to follow the ideal body clock. Wake up early, go to bed early, maintain meal timings and avoid eating a few things at a particular time of the day. Many follow this advice quite seriously nowadays,” said Vaidya Swanand Joshi, who practices pure Ayurveda. As medical treatments are allowed following the Covid protocol, a large number of people are visiting the Ayurvedic Panchakarma centres for massage and detox treatment. Physical trainer Allan Morde said gyms are open since the last two weeks on a regular basis and fitness freaks are serious about following their exercise schedules. “We are still to get the desired number of admissions in gyms but those who have enrolled are regulars and follow the schedule sincerely,” he said. As morning walks, evening walks and even indoor sports are now allowed, a visible rush can be seen at popular morning walk points. “People have realized that good health is the best vaccine that can keep Covid away. Immunity boosters are still in demand,” said Ambarish Ghatate, who has been organising workshops for medicinal plant lovers during the rainy season. “People want to know about the importance of medicinal plants and many want to develop a home herbal garden by following a simple yet systematic path,” he said. The pandemic phase has also made many accept that psychological issues are real. “The hesitation is still there, but it has gone down for sure. Many visitors speak openly about what they feel these days,” said psychiatrist Dr Pradip Patil. Spending weekends with family, rejuvenation and recharge activities are also in demand and all for sound health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/yoga-morning-walks-lifestyle-modifications-lessons-learned-from-covid-19/articleshow/85412141.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Chandigarh||Appointment in Punjab mandi board challenged in high court||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has issued notice to the Punjab government on a plea challenging the appointment of Harpreet Singh Brar as technical adviser of Punjab State Agriculture Marketing Board (Punjab Mandi Board). Division bench comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli of the HC has issued the notice after taking cognizance of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Pritam Singh Korey, a retired district welfare officer and native of Ludhiana district, challenging the appointment of Brar. In his plea, Korey has alleged that chief minister Amarinder Singh cleared Brar’s appointment in the mandi board, ignoring the fact that an inquiry has been registered against him by the state vigilance bureau. The counsel for the petitioner argued that Brar had retired on July 31 July as engineerin-chief of Punjab Mandi Board. “Just a few days before his retirement, the state vigilance bureau had registered a vigilance inquiry against Brar on July 27 on allegation of acquiring assets disproportionate to his known income. However, the proposal to appoint him as technical adviser was approved by CM Punjab by overlooking the registration of vigilance inquiry against him,” the HC was informed. The counsel also submitted that there is no post of technical adviser in the Punjab State Agriculture Marketing Board (Group A) Service Rules, 1988. Likewise, there is no such post of technical adviser under the Act under which Punjab Mandi Board has been established. The terms and conditions of appointment of technical adviser were not framed before making this appointment. No applications were invited from other eligible candidates. Thus, the appointment to this coveted post has been made in a pick and choose manner, and the ultimate expenses of this post of technical adviser have to be borne by the state exchequer. “Otherwise too, the appointment of such a candidate, who is facing vigilance inquiry for possession of disproportionate assets, which is an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act1988, cannot be said to be in public interest,” the petitioner has submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/appointment-in-pb-mandi-board-challenged-in-hc/articleshow/85412163.cms||---

The participants made use of the abacus during the sessions and learnt/improved problem solving skills. The record has been officially recognized by the ‘Kalam’s book of world records’. This is the second time that the institution is attempting to create a world record in abacus. The attempt was organised by Brainy Bobs, an International Advance Abacus Institute. Around 40 franchises and 70 staff from Brainy Bobs co-ordinated and organized the event. As many as 2021 participants across age groups and different locations in India and globally, to mark the year 2021, took part in the rally which lasted for 35 hours (2021 minutes). “The idea was to hold a talkathon online with the aim of creating more awareness about abacus and how it helps activate both sides of the brain. While around 1,000 participants are studying in our institute, the rest were all from the general public and even from rural villages with little to no knowledge of abacus,” said Kathryn, who runs a franchisee of the institute in Madurai district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/virtual-abacus-rally-conducted-for-35-hours-to-set-world-record/articleshow/85412145.cms||---

The FIR has been registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act and sections of the IPC.BSP district president Vimal Verma, who was named in the FIR, said it is highly objectionable that local authorities see Covid protocol violations only in the opposition party’s programmes. He said he had photos of a recent meeting held by BJP national president JP Nadda in Agra, where Covid protocols were not followed. “Will police register an FIR against the BJP leaders,” he wondered.Senior BSP leader Gorelal Jatav, an organizer of the party meeting, said, “It is highly unfortunate that Covid-19 rules and regulations are being politicized. Such actions will only motivate BSP workers.” Mahesh Kumar, deputy superintendent of police, said, “Around 200 BSP workers had gathered in a marriage hall. The organizers were not able to show the permission to hold the programme. Covid-19 protocol was not followed. Based on video evidence, an FIR has been registered for violation of the CrPC section 144 and the Epidemic Diseases Act.

---||Dehradun||No hotels on Char Dham rd muck dumping sites, but toilets, dhabas: Min||Dehradun: Reacting to the move by the state government to develop 54 of the muck-dumping zones on Char Dham all-weather road project as “tourism spaces”, tourism minister Satpal Maharaj told TOI on Tuesday that there were no plans to build hotels on the sites, but added that toilets and restaurants for “convenience of devotees” would be built. “We have no plans to construct hotels on any of the 54 identified sites. For the convenience of the devotees and tourists, we have decided to set up toilets, dhabas and restaurants. We realised that routes leading to the Char Dham did not have proper washrooms or restaurants and pilgrims faced several problems while travelling long distances,” Maharaj said. There are about 350 muck disposal sites along the 900-km project. The minister also said that the land belongs to the forest department and a boundary wall was being built in each of the 54 sites to house the basic facilities. “The rest of the land would be handed over to the forest department,” he said. TOI had earlier reported, citing sources, that the Uttarakhand government was planning on building hotels and tourist facilities to “make use” of the muck-dumping zones, a move that had sparked anger among environmentalists. Many had raised concerns that construction could have disastrous consequences — the land could cave in any time and because most of these sites are in forest and riverbed areas, they would be in the direct line of impact if a landslide or flood hit. The state forest department officials had said that any new activity would be taken up “after proper clearances from the Centre.” Of the 54 dumping zones, 30 are between Tanakpur and Pithoragarh, 10 between Dharasu and Yamunotri, six between Rishikesh and Mana, five between Rudraprayag and Gaurikund, three between Rishikesh and Dharasu, and one from Dharasu to Gangotri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-hotels-on-char-dham-rd-muck-dumping-sites-but-toilets-dhabas-min/articleshow/85427317.cms||Kautilya Singh

Vijay Rangari, a resident of Khaparkheda, was admitted to New Era Hospital after severe intracranial haemorrhage on August 11. In spite of the treatment, his condition deteriorated neurologically and a team of doctors declared him brain dead on August 16. At New Era hospital, a leader in organ donation and transplant activities in Vidarbha, Dr Ashwini Choudhary counselled the family members of Rangari. His wife Roshani and daughter Mohini readily agreed to donate his organs. Doctors decided to donate his kidneys, liver and eyes to eligible recipients. “Despite a pandemic year, this was the 8th deceased organ donation of the year and 75th since 2013,” said Dr Vibhavari Dani, president of the zonal transplant coordination centre (ZTCC) Nagpur. One of the kidneys and liver were allotted to needy patients in the same New Era Hospital while another kidney was transplanted into a 51-year-old patient in Wockhardt Hospital. Eyes were donated to Madhav Netra Pedhi. Dr Sanjay Kolte, honorary secretary of ZTCC, Nagpur, said that awareness of family members was commendable. “The patient’s wife as well as his daughter readily agreed to donate his organs which is praiseworthy. The organ donation week is under way and we are happy to see such people who understand the importance of the noble work,” said Dr Kolte. New Era Hospital conducted an honour corridor to salute the donor and his family members and also provided a free ambulance to transport the mortal remains to his home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/braindead-man-gives-new-lease-of-life-to-3/articleshow/85412181.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Gandhidham cats get recreational park||RAJKOT: Nobody actually knows how smack in the middle of Lima, Peru, the world’s biggest park for cats, the Kennedy Park came into existence in downtown Miraflores three decades ago. But back home in port town Gandhidham, Upendra Goswami’s garden of cats, spread across 500 square yards, has its own history to meow about. The custom house agent has been running his feline garden in Gandhidham with 200 cats since 2017 but it has roots in Goswami’s firm belief that his elder sister Meena, who died at the age of 18 in late 1990s and loved cats, had come back to the family. A cat came to his house in 2015 and its activities convinced him and the entire family that it was his sister who had come back to them. In order to maintain the cat lineage, he started the garden to help the felines thrive. “I started feeling that my dead sister came back to my home as a cat and when I started to believe the cat which did not allow to touch anybody came and sat in my lap,” Goswami told TOI.  Pooh-poohing beliefs, he said: “I was peon in the firm in which I am currently a business partner. The happiness and growth they brought into our lives is unimaginable.” At the garden, it’s all about one big cat family — some sitting on cottages, others watching cartoons (mouse) in a mini theatre, while some more busy in cat business — sans human or dog interference. The cat family grew with time and in three years there were around 125 cats playing in Goswami’s house. So, in 2017, Goswami brought a plot in Gandhidham near his house to create a cat garden to accommodate the huge family. While his cat is a 200-member clan, there are a total 600 cats residing in the park premises for the past three years. Some have even died. Goswami also owns 28 Persian cats and one of them had reached Mundra port by mistake in a container from Dubai. It survived without food for 15 days before the custom officials contacted Goswami. He named the white cat, Mahalakshmi and also found her male partner from a family of Adipur. Eventually, Mahalakshmi died and her daughter gave birth to a cat two days ago, which was spitting images of her mum. Goswamis have named it Akhand Mahalakashmi. Goswami and his wife Pooja look after their 200 cats every day. A principal in a school, Pooja said “I have to get up at 5am in the morning to feed the cats and also after I return home at 1.30pm. We take care of their food, their health and everything.” For all their medical needs, the cats, most of which are street cats, are even taken to Ahmedabad to consult specialists. The family opens the special garden for visitors for four hours on Sunday only for a nominal fee. “I spend Rs 1.5 lakh every month and 90 percent of that money is from my pocket,” Goswami added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/gandhidham-cats-get-recreational-park/articleshow/85412154.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The incident also brought to fore that the ground-plus-3 storey building has no fire safety compliance certificate issued by the NMC’s fire and emergency services department. At around 1.20pm, the NMC’s control room received a call about fire in one of the offices on the second floor of the ZP building. “The fire started from a switch board and alert ZP staff doused it with the help of an extinguisher installed there,” a fire official told TOI. Before fire tender from the Civil Lines station reached there, the trained staff had doused the flame, said the official. “When the fire broke out, all staff and even many visitors were present in the building,” he added. A senior official from the NMC’s fire department confirmed that the civic body had conducted fire audit and submitted suggestions to the ZP in March 2018. “We had suggested a slew of measures including installing hose reel, hose box, wet riser, yard hydrant around the building, manually operated electric fire alarm system, underground static water storage tank, terrace tank with pumps, sign indicators for evacuation of occupants in case of an emergency, among others,” he said. But nothing has happened so far. ZP CEO Yogesh V Kumbhejkar confirmed this and claimed that after today’s incident, work to replace switch boards and regulators has been started. He said the work of installation of firefighting equipment like smoke detectors and sprinklers will also be taken up. Rs5L goods gutted at grocery store In another incident, electrical appliances including refrigerators, air conditioners and frozen food worth over Rs5 lakh were destroyed on Tuesday when a fire broke out at Purushottam Kirana Bazar near Hingna T-point. The fire department received a call from the store at around 9am. Soon a fire tender from Narendra Nagar station reached there and doused the flames. Short circuit had caused the fire, said a fire department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fire-breaks-out-in-zps-new-building/articleshow/85412217.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Among those landing highest packages of this year, 12 belong to computer science and engineering, three are from electronics and communication, and one from electrical and electronics. Total 161 from the BTech 2021-22 have so far been placed in the drive, where more than 50 companies registered for continued placement. More than 30 students have received offers worth more than Rs20 lakh per annum. The students received the job offers within 15 days of the drive, which is still underway. The previous 2020-21 batch had posted a record recruitment of 527 students from 800 eligible candidates. They were hired by more than 130 companies excluding off campus placements. The placement process for 20-21 batch was delayed due to the pandemic scenario. Around 150 students have opted for higher education in reputed national and international universities. PM Padole, director, VNIT, said, “Based on feedback from last few years, four activities — professional communication, programming languages, domain knowledge and other employability skills – were identified for training of students by respective departments.” The director added that a full-fledged artificial intelligence-based training and placement server is installed for automatic training, mock tests and mock interviews of students, and their automatic record maintenance by the institute. “This has immensely helped the 2021-22 batch, as seen in the placement records,” he said. The average package so far is around Rs16 lakh per annum. “This is a considerable rise in average package,” said KM Bhurchandi, associate dean (Training and Placements). Major employers conducting the campus placement drives for this year’s batch include Oracle, DEE SHAW, Morgan Sachs; while many PSUs like IOCL, C-DOT and international brands are in the pipeline, said Padole. The director has applauded the rigorous academic and training efforts taken by faculty coordinators Anupam Kher, Manasi Radke, Bhurchandi and the VNIT administration. VNIT was ranked 27th in NIRF 2020, which was four positions ahead of its 2019 ranking. VNIT is ranked at 11th and 25th positions among institutions of national importance and central universities by ARIIA (Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievement) respectively. It did well in other rankings and surveys for educational institutions including one done by the Times Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vnit-records-good-placement-drive-16-students-land-rs36-lakh-package-each/articleshow/85412234.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

He added that he also spoke to Sandeep (Sandhu) as he had also run the PPCC office in the past. “We have to work together as a team to restore the lost glory of Punjab. I came to this party four and a half years back and may not know everybody,” he said. Asked about Sandeep Sandhu, Pargat said he would take everybody along.

According to the source in the academy, the cadets are under strict watch “for their safety” and were called back from their training, which was taking place in the Uttarakhand forests. “All possible support is being given to them,” the source said, adding that the academy has also tweaked its protocol to enable the cadets to "check on their families back home". “Phones are not provided to cadets according to protocol. But since the crisis, the academy has given phones to each company with international calling facility for Afghan cadets to stay connected with their kin,” the source said. IMA public relations officer Lt Col Himani Pant said that the foreign cadets at the IMA “were following their routine”. “At present, IMA authorities are waiting for directions from the ministry of external affairs and the ministry of defence,” said Pant. The cadets, who were to join the Afghan army after graduating in December, face an uncertain future since the Taliban takeover of the country. Of the over 150 Afghan military personnel being trained in the country, majority are in IMA, followed by National Defence Academy (Khadakwasla) Pune and OTA (Chennai). Former chairman of Assocham National Council of Defence and Aerospace, Major General (rtd) Bishamber Dayal, told TOI that IMA is expected to extend its red alert, issued near Independence Day, as a precautionary measure. “To ensure safety of foreign cadets and the academy, staff provided to the cadets will also have to go through strict checks. There will be increased vigilance on whom the cadets are interacting with," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ima-puts-80-afghan-cadets-under-strict-watch-for-their-safety/articleshow/85427332.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Shimla||Himachal Pradesh: Major flaws in ULB handling of waste, no effective disposal, says CAG report||SHIMLA: The Comptroller and Auditor General of India in its report tabled in the Himachal assembly recently has pointed out that the management of solid waste by the urban local bodies (ULBs) of the state was not effective in controlling disposal of waste in a scientific manner and keeping the urban areas clean. The report said that Government of India had not released the performance grant of Rs 32.44 crore for the period 2016-20. It said that variation between the achievement reported by the ULBs and position observed during audit indicated that the ULBs were not acknowledging deficiencies in the various stages of the solid waste management process. It said that there were shortcomings in door-to-door waste collection, waste collection through community bins and modern under-ground bins in all 16 test-checked urban local bodies, resulting in overflow, littering and open dumping of waste. Approximately 342.35 metric tonnes of solid waste is generated per day in the urban areas of the state. The report said waste in segregated form was neither being collected from the waste generators nor there were any facilities for segregation at the secondary level or at the time of transport. Deficiencies in transportation of waste included lack of capacity to handle segregated waste in vehicles used for transporting waste, and 73% of the vehicles were uncovered in the 16 test-checked ULBs, it added. The CAG report said biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste processing plants had been constructed in only 11 ULBs and one urban local body, respectively; however, none of the facility was fully functional. Sanitary landfill facilities for safe disposal of solid waste had not been created in any of the 54 ULBs of the state, and mixed waste was being dumped in open dump sites. Entities responsible for monitoring of solid waste management were not discharging functions, resulting in non-adherence to rules. It said as a consequence of the serious deficiencies in collection, segregation, storage, processing and disposal of solid waste highlighted in this report, unsegregated and unprocessed solid waste was being littered and unscientifically dumped in open “dump sites”, an unsustainable practice posing risks to human health and the environment, it added. According to the report, data upkeep with respect to frequency and extent of solid waste collection and disposal was found deficient in some ULBs and completely lacking in others. Suggests mechanism for better infrastructure: The report has suggested putting in place a mechanism for regular collection of user charges for financing recurring as well as capital expenditure for strengthening infrastructure; strengthen waste collection system with reporting and monitoring regarding collection, segregation and disposal of solid waste; strengthening of waste segregation mechanism by collecting waste in segregated form, placing separate waste collection and storage bins for biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste and transporting biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste in segregated form or in separate vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/cag-report-points-out-major-flaws-in-waste-management-by-ulbs-in-hp/articleshow/85412183.cms||---

The number later went up to 37 with the nomination of YSRCP legislator Malladi Vishnu. The government named nine VIPs from Telangana, including My Home Group chairman Jupally Rameshwar Rao, Hetero Drugs chairman B Parthasaradhi Reddy and chairman and managing director of Kaveri Seeds Gundavaram Venkata Bhaskar Rao among others. Other states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka got five nominations each, Delhi and Maharashtra two each and Odisha one member. With the battle over Krishna river water between the two states intensifying, Telangana government and an activist from Telangana had approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) alleging violation of environment rules and contempt of court on the proposed Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS) that would double the off-take of Krishna water from Srisailam reservoir. Consequently, the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) had inspected the site and submitted a report to the NGT alleging works in excess of what was needed to prepare a detailed project report (DPR). The AP government earlier this month nominated the chairman to the trust board. It will soon nominate members. Former MP YV Subba Reddy, who is also an uncle of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, was renominated to the board. There was a bonhomie between AP and Telangana when the TTD board was last constituted and thus the sister Telugu state got the lion’s share of nine members - a whopping 25% of the board strength. This is against AP’s strength of 10, excluding the three ex-officio members. Now in the changed scenario, Telangana is unlikely to get the same preferential treatment that it got last time, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-wont-be-getting-same-treatment-in-ttd-board/articleshow/85414685.cms||---

The duo was spotted by passers-by in roadside bushes, who informed police. A forensic team reached the spot to investigate. Additional superintendent of police (ASP) Kashipur Pramod Kumar said that their throats had been slit using a sharp weapon. “Initial probe suggests the killings are the result of a family feud. However, we are exploring all angles. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem and a case has been registered under section 302 (murder) of the IPC against unknown assailants,” said ASP Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mother-daughter-duo-found-with-throats-slit-on-roadside-in-us-nagar/articleshow/85427360.cms||Aakash Ahuja
---||Delhi||No end in sight to waste problem, East Delhi Municipal Corporation now turns to private player||NEW DELHI: Facing difficulty in disposing of the inert generated every day after 20 trommel machines process legacy waste at the Ghazipur landfill, East Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to engage a private concessionaire for treating/processing and removing around 50 lakh tonnes of legacy waste in two years. Besides installing sufficient equipment to meet other requirements, the private party will also arrange for disposing of inert on a regular basis at suitable sites in Delhi-NCR as per norms and in an environment-friendly manner. The project will be placed before a standing committee meeting in 10 days, said an official. “Unlike the landfills with the north and south corporations, we have twice the amount of legacy waste lying at Ghazipur and space is limited. Since it will be a big project, we have set a target for processing and clearing one-third of the total waste in phase I,” said the official. The decision was taken after analysing the situation for three months. “Hiring a private agency will also reduce our burden of close coordination with multiple contractors and departments,” the official added. At present, 140 lakh tonnes of legacy waste is lying at the city landfills and around 3,000 tonnes of waste is processed every day. Inert is soil-like material left after separating construction and demolition waste and refuse derived fuel (RDF). “No space is left for dumping additional inert generated every day, which is 60-65% of the total processed waste,” said the official. “We manage to transport around 1,200 tonnes of the total 2,000 tonnes inert to multiple locations such as DDA’s site for an integrated project at Tuglaqabad, NTPC park, EDMC parks and low-lying areas in East Vinod Nagar. But the rest keeps on occupying space and it is now difficult to engage more trommel machines.” The north corporation, which is facing a similar issue, had issued a public circular inviting public agencies to take inert for free to fill low-lying areas. “Of the 6,000 tonnes of waste processed at Bhalswa every day, RDF is at least 800-1,200 tonnes. While the waste-to-energy plant at Bawana consumes 400-500 tonnes, some amount is taken by the approved companies under CSR initiatives for disposal as per norms. But the remaining amount is still occupying space,” said an official. The corporation is finalising a tender in 10-15 days to send the remaining RDF to a cement plant in Rajasthan for proper disposal, he added. Soon 24 more trommel machines will also be installed to double the amount of waste processed every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-end-in-sight-to-waste-problem-edmc-now-turns-to-private-player/articleshow/85441928.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Agra||Will Aligarh become Harigarh & Mainpuri Mayan Nagar?||AGRA: The BJP-led district councils of Aligarh and Mainpuri sent proposals to the state government to rename the two districts — Aligarh as Harigarh and Mainpuri as Mayan Nagar — to “restore” their ancient names. The proposals were passed on Monday, with no opposition in Aligarh — 50 of 72 members were present — and two opposers and 23 supporters in Mainpuri. “It is an ancient name which we want to reinstate. The state government has to approve it now,” Aligarh district council president Vijay Singh said. The demand goes back decades — in October 1989, riots had broken out when a Hindu right-wing group put up “Harigarh” banners in an Aligarh locality. In 2015, VHP had revived the demand, which was reiterated by BJP legislators in 2019. For Mainpuri, it is a mythical association with sage Mayan that the council based its decision on. “Sage Mayan founded what we now know as Mainpuri. A member proposed that Mainpuri be renamed as Mayan Nagar and it was passed in the first meeting after the council was set up,” president Archana Bhadoria said. Historians dismissed the presumptions based on which these decisions were taken. “There is no historical evidence to support the justification, that Aligarh used to be Harigarh or Mainpuri was founded by Mayan,” said senior AMU historian Prof Ali Nadeem Rezavi. “Before the 18th century, Aligarh used to be known as Kol or Koil, which referred to the entire district though the geographical boundaries kept changing. In the 18th century, the Mughal empire appointed Nazaf Ali Shah as a subedar in the area. His fortress was named Aligarh — Ali from the name of the subedar and ‘garh’ meaning fortress. By the 19th century, the entire area was called Aligarh. As for Mainpuri, there is no historical evidence to suggest the district was founded by a sage called Mayan.” Explaining how Mainpuri came to be formed, a senior history professor at the Agra University, who did not want to be named, said, “Mainpuri used to be a part of the kingdom of Kannauj. After its fall, it was divided into a number of petty principalities ... Mainpuri was taken over by the Mughals after Babur’s conquest in 1526 and, although temporarily wrested from them by the short-lived Afghan dynasty of Sher Shah, was reoccupied by them when Humayun was reinstated.” Towards the end of the 18th century, he added, Mainpuri passed on to the Mahrattas (Marathas) and eventually became a part of Oudh (Awadh). “When this was ceded to the British in 1801, Mainpuri town became the headquarters of the Etawah district. In 1856, it was divided into separate collectorates. There is no evidence that a sage named Mayan was the founder.” Earlier this month, Firozabad district council had suggested that it be renamed as Chandra Nagar. Proposals to rename Agra, Ghaziabad, Muzaffarnagar and Sultanpur have surfaced as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dist-councils-for-aligarh-to-be-called-harigarh-mainpuri-mayan-nagar/articleshow/85409936.cms||Deepak Lavania

Instead, they are demanding monetary compensation which adds up to around Rs19 crore.A senior official from NMC’s estate depaertment said this will further delay the project to construct a six-lane road in front of Nagpur railway station. Since there is provision in the current budget, the civic body cannot pay a single penny. In 2018, the NMC had decided to demolish the flyover and shops beneath it to pave way for MahaMetro to develop a six-lane road from Jaistambh to Loha Pul to decongest traffic.According to the official, if NMC wants to complete one of Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari’s pet projects, it will have to cut funds for various other works to fund Rs234 crore Jaisthamb Chowk traffic improvement plan, a Central Road Fund project comprising four components — Y-shaped flyover, railway underbridge (RUB) near Loha Pul, cement concrete road and multilevel parking plaza.The NMC had spent Rs16 crore to construct the station road flyover and 175 shops beneath in 2008. The corporation had signed a 30-year lease agreement and took around Rs 12 crore as desposit while alloting 162 shops.The official said that MahaMetro is constructing a commercial complex with 200 shops, which is a part of the six-lane project, and as per Gadkari’s directives, the NMC will have the ownership rights. Initially, few shopkeepers agreed to shift to the parking-cum-commercial plaza but later backed out. MahaMetro has constructed 70 shops for transit period.In hearings held recently, the civic body concluded that shopkeepers were not ready to relocate and want monetary compensation. “Gadkari has directed the civic body to complete the process without further delay,” said the official.NMC has calculated the compensation amount by deducting lease agreement money and other charges applicable, yet it is not sure whether it will work. The shopkeepers may end up demanding compensation as per land acquisition rights by following the ready reckoner rates. If this applies, the NMC will have to pay 2.5% more than the ready reckoner rate to shopkeepers, said the official.The civic administration will submit the proposal for providing compensation in the next general body meeting.

GU had begun the procedure to appoint a new VC and has scheduled interviews for the 23 shortlisted candidates on August 25. Since there is still time for the procedure of appointment of the new VC to be completed, an acting vice-chancellor will take over for the time being. Usually, the senior-most dean is expected to be appointed as the acting vice-chancellor. But as per GU statutes, the current VC can also continue in the post till the time his successor is appointed. A farewell for Sahni with limited attendees has been organised on his final day in office by GU, while the rest of the faculty and staff will watch the event online. In June, the Goa governor and chancellor of Goa University initiated the process of identifying a new candidate for the post of vice-chancellor by inviting applications from academicians who have over 10 years of experience. Goa governor had formed a three-member search panel of CSIR director general Dr Shekhar Mande, former NCERT director Jagmohan Singh Rajput and DRDO’s Dr G Satish Reddy, to shortlist candidates for the post held for a five-year term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sahnis-term-ends-today-gu-likely-to-appoint-acting-vc/articleshow/85414676.cms||---

In a letter to the civic chief, Wanve alleged irregularities in allocation of Rs 3 lakh for various development works by Dhawde. Urging the civic chief to intervene at the earliest, Wanve also demanded a departmental inquiry into the Rs 3 lakh sanctioned by the deputy mayor’s office. According to Wanve, split of works is being done allegedly with the deputy mayor’s fund. “This indicates that it is being done to avoid the tendering process by splitting the work into many parts. Even NMC engineers are involved in this scam,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/probe-funds-allocated-by-dy-mayor-dhawde/articleshow/85412315.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||SAD’s poll push: Gall Punjab Di||Chandigarh: SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday announced to undertake a 100-day tour across 100 constituencies starting from Wednesday from Zira to expose the ‘corrupt and scam ridden Congress government’. He also released a charge sheet against Congress and AAP leaders, besides launching a party campaign, ‘Gall Punjab Di’, including dedicated website www.GallPunjabDi.in. Sukhbir said he would hold 700 public meetings and address each and every section of society during his tour, during which SAD workers would go to each and every village and ward in the state. The purpose of this exercise is to expose the alleged corruption by chief minister Amarinder Singh’s government and to gather people’s feedback about their expectations from the next SAD-BSP government. The Ferozepur MP also released the party’s missed call number service with mobile number 96878 96878 to invite Punjabis to join SAD’s election campaign and share their aspirations with the party. Releasing the charge sheet against Congress and AAP leaders, Sukhbir said while the chief minister had a lot to answer vis-a-vis the Rs 6,500 crore excise scam, five of his ministerial colleagues were accused of corruption. He alleged while Sadhu Singh Dharamsot was involved in the scheduled castes post-matric scholarship scam, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa was involved in seed scam, Balbir Singh Sidhu in Covid procurement as well as de-addiction tablets scam, Bharat Bhushan Ashu in wheat scam and Sunder Sham Arora in JCT land scam. Sukhbir claimed that in his life he had only seen three leaders who had taken an oath and broken it without any qualms. “Capt Amarinder took an oath on the holy Gutka Sahib and broke it by not fulfilling his promise to eradicate drugs, ensure a complete Rs 90,000 crore loan waiver and provide jobs in each household.” AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal had also sworn not to have any truck with the Congress party, but broke it within days, he said. “Even Punjab AAP xonvener Bhagwant Mann swore on his mother to give up alcohol, but never honoured the same,” he added. Calling Kejriwal a master of deceit, the SAD president said that he wanted to implement a failed Delhi model in Punjab. “He is known to have taken opposing stands on the SYL issue in Punjab and outside the state. He has also taken an anti-Punjab stand on the issue of stubble burning besides filing a petition in the apex court demanding the closure of thermal plants of Punjab,” said Sukhbir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sads-poll-push-gall-punjab-di/articleshow/85412287.cms||---
---||Nagpur||221 more buildings to face criminal case for ignoring fire safety||NAGPUR: After filing criminal cases against five establishments for violating the Maharashtra Fire Prevention & Life Safety Measure Act (MFPLSMA), 2006, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has marked another 221 buildings which failed to comply with firefighting norms. Now, the fire and emergency services department will send the list of violators to the district court to initiate filing of criminal cases against owners of these buildings. Assistant law officer (NMC) Ajay Mate told TOI that four cases have already been filed in the court. TOI has already reported how big structures, especially hospitals and commercial buildings, ignore firefighting norms thereby putting the life of visiting people at risk. There are thousands of violators, said sources. After issuing several notices and reminders to owners of these properties, the department approached the Nagpur city police to initiate action against them. However the city police refused to file FIRs against the violators and instead advised the department to seek district court’s help. Data obtained from NMC’s fire and emergency services department revealed that it has shortlisted the list of 105 property owners, including residential, educational and hospitals, who were functioning without obtaining no-objection certificates. There are 116 property owners who had obtained NOCs but failed to comply with firefighting norms. These 226 properties have been shortlisted against whom criminal cases will be filed. Of both the lists of buildings with and without NOCs, industries comprise the highest number of violators. The data revealed that as many as 60 industries operating in NMC limits, followed by 56 educational institutions, had obtained provisional NOCs but did not comply with firefighting measures. Of the 226 properties, the department had already filed criminal cases against Sanjay Kukreja (director of Magic Food Court), Naresh Thakur (Popatlal Patel of M/s Kalka Enterprises), Harmindar Singh Khanduja (Hotel Heritage) and Lalitbhai Patel (M/s Hansumukbhai Patel) for not complying with fire fighting norms. The court had also issued summons against the owners and directors of these establishments. Therefore, NMC’s law department initiated the process to file criminal cases against them. If charges are proved, there is a provision of three years imprisonment and Rs50,000 fine, said NMC legal officer Venkatesh Kaple. Chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake said the move was initiated after big buildings, hotels, hospitals, industries and shops ignored the notices served by the department for violating sections 5, 6 and 8 of the Maharashtra Fire Prevention & Life Safety Measures Act. Despite several deadlines, the owners of such buildings gave no response, said Uchake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/221-more-buildings-to-face-criminal-case-for-ignoring-fire-safety/articleshow/85412277.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Now with Basavaraj Bommai at the helm, political equations have changed.Now, new minister Shankar Patil Munenakoppa, a confidant of the CM, will play a major role besides Hubballi-Dharwad Mahanagara Jilla BJP president Arvind Bellad and BJP state general secretary Mahesh Tenginkai. Shettar and Joshi will also have a say in ticket distribution.An aspirant from Central constituency said, “For us, former CM Jagadish Shettar’s word is final. However, since Shankar Patil Munenakoppa is a minister from a rural district, his opinion can be considered by the party. Hence we went to him and Mahesh Tenginakai and Arvind Bellad and requested him to give us tickets.”Mahesh Tenginkai said, “Many aspirants for the HDMC elections have approached me for a ticket. After hearing them I tell them that the core committee consisting of Jagadish Shettar, Pralhad Joshi and others will take a call on finalising candidates. I normally avoid meeting workers and aspirants personally at home and ask them to meet me in the office,” he added.Along with aspirants’ active participation in party activities, recommendation from district ministers, state-level party leaders, RSS senior office bearers and local leaders matters in getting a ticket, said an aspirant.Minister Shankar Patil Munenakoppa said, “Many have approached us for tickets. The district core committee of the party will take a call on this after discussing with senior leaders including Jagadish Shettar and Pralhad Joshi.”Besides, aspirants are also seeking help of celebrities and social organisations to get a ticket by sponsoring breakfast/lunch at social gatherings. Dr Abhay Matkar, former president, Indian Medical Association, Hubballi, said, “ A doctor has sought IMA’s help to get a ticket from a party. However, we are checking his contribution.”Amrut Ijari, convener, Mahadayi Kalasa Banduri Horata Samanvaya Samiti, said, “Many aspirants are seeking our help to get a ticket from political parties, particularly those who joined us in Kalasa-Banduri agitation. As a matter of courtesy, we are putting a word before their leaders. But we will not interfere or pressurise any party,” he added.Tickets will be given purely on merit: KateelNalin Kumar Kateel, state BJP chief, said that ticket aspirants need not make a beeline for leaders’ houses. Aspirants can submit their application to the mandal samiti president of the party and the core committee will give tickets based purely on merit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/change-of-guard-leaves-ticket-aspirants-confused/articleshow/85408131.cms||---

Modhera village and the Sun Temple are a protected archaeological site. The Gujarat government has spent around Rs 69 crore on the solar power project. The government allocated 12 hectares of land for the plant, which is 3km from the village. The 6MW solar power plant will be connected with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) for storage of solar power. It is from this BESS that Modhera village will receive solar power at night. In addition to the 6MW solar power plant connected to the BESS, village homes will also generate power from their rooftops. Prime Minister to inaugurate several other projectsThe PM is also likely to launch a few projects of the education department on September 5 in Gandhinagar, including the school of excellence project.

---||Nagpur||School reopening GR on hold, not withdrawn: Education minister Varsha Gaikwad||NAGPUR: State education minister Varsha Gaikwad said the school reopening government resolution (GR) issued on August 10 was put on hold and not withdrawn, as being rumoured. As per that GR, schools in urban area (Std VIII-XII) and rural area (Std V-VII) were to reopen from Tuesday, but many institutes were confused as no official orders had come from authorities yet. Speaking exclusively to TOI, Gaikwad said, “After we had issued the GR, there were some concerns over reopening and that’s why it (the GR) was put on hold. We have not cancelled the GR at all. A final decision will be taken in a few days as views from other stakeholders are being taken.” Though Gaikwad did not mention it, there were reports that Covid-19 task force members were not too happy with the school reopening GR. The same unconfirmed reports suggested that it was these members’ intervention which led to the GR not being implemented. Gaikwad did not comment on this speculation, but said that she too expressed her concerns over the delay in the GR’s implementation. “I spoke to the chief secretary (S Kunte) today, who told me another meeting on this issue will be held soon. This meeting will involve the additional chief secretary and other stakeholders, so we can expect a decision soon. I have told them to act fast as already a few days have passed since we issued the GR,” said Gaikwad. Even if the GR is brought back into play, the final decision on school reopening shall be taken by a committee headed by the municipal commissioner. Speaking to TOI earlier in the day, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) chief Radhakrishnan said the school reopening plan would be put in motion only with proper procedure. “We are collecting data from civic officials as well as the education department. Based on that input, a call on reopening will be taken,” said Radhakrishnan. While in rural area Std VIII-XII are already open, the latest GR would have paved the way for Std V-VII to also reopen in physical mode. Within city limits, schools are completely closed for physical classes. Though the final decision on reopening is pending, some schools have already expressed their opposition to start physical classes for non-Covid-19 reasons. Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Sanstha Mahamandal (MRSSM), an association which represents trusts/societies that operate grant-in-aid schools, has decided to keep its schools’ doors closed over pending issues. MRSSM office-bearer Ravindra Fadnavis said, “The government has not yet fulfilled our demands related to non-salary grants, restoration of non-teaching and teaching recruitment. In such a condition it is not possible for our schools to operate.” A private unaided school principal said there is an unofficial consensus among many schools that physical reopening must happen now. “Every school will take its own call after seeing how many parents are willing to send their children, but many of us feel that at least for Std X and XII, classes must begin now,” said the principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/school-reopening-gr-on-hold-not-withdrawn-edu-min-gaikwad/articleshow/85412357.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||Economy gains traction due to pent-up demand as 2nd wave ebbs: RBI||Mumbai: The retreat of the second Covid wave has released pent-up demand, which has been complemented by an improvement in the supply situation due to a normal monsoon, the Reserve Bank of India said in its monthly assessment of the economy. According to the state of the economy (SOE) report published by the central bank on Tuesday, the economy is gaining traction with gradual pick-up in manufacturing and moderation in the pace of contraction of services spurred by easy money. In one of its most positive SOE reports since the outbreak of the second wave, the RBI said rural unemployment is declining and so is the number of rural households demanding work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, indicating that the market for farm labour is tightening as agricultural activity gathers steam. “So, the first impulses of the recovery have arrived, riding on thunder and lightning as the monsoon intensifies,” the SOE report, authored by a team led by deputy governor Michael Patra said. The negative for consumers is that elevated input cost pressures are likely to persist in the second quarter of FY22. Firms expect to pass on the cost burden to consumers in Q2 by increasing selling prices, especially for services and infrastructure, the report said. According to the report, another sign of revitalisation of the economy was the resilience shown by corporate India in the face of the second wave compared to the first. “During the quarter ended in June 2021, net sales of these companies surged by 57% year-on-year (y-o-y) versus a decline of 34% in April-June 2020 when the first wave raged,” the report said. The upswing in the financial market, which has seen a surge in initial public offerings (IPOs), is also seen as adding to the growth impulses. “2021 could well turn out to be India’s year of the initial public offering (IPOs)… These IPOs of new-age companies arrive as bullishness about India mounts, especially around Indian tech,” the report said. The report quoted Credit Suisse, which forecasts 100 unicorns (start-ups with a valuation of $1 billion) in India. “Yet, this explosion of interest in these companies will only be sustained if they can convert innovative ideas into metrics such as breaking even at the level of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) level without expensing business development costs, followed by cash flows and profits,” according to the report. The SOE report, which has established a practice of using colourful language and quoting classical poets and playwrights to convey its reading of the economy has adapted Keats `To Autumn’ to highlight the onset of the monsoon. "Sravana 2021 is also a time of the year when the Reserve Bank connects with the transcendental calm within. Submersed in this inner stillness, it looked beyond the dilemmas and trade-offs in the here and now to contemplate the world of tomorrow," the SOE concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/economy-gains-traction-due-to-pent-up-demand-as-2nd-wave-ebbs-rbi/articleshow/85415416.cms||---
---||Delhi||Quality education, health taking Delhi on US growth path: Minister Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: Health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said that the Delhi government is bringing development in Delhi through the same path that countries like the United Kingdom and the US have taken by providing quality healthcare and quality education. “Delhi government is for the people and by the people and is the only government working to provide quality amenities to the underprivileged. With people’s support only the Arvind Kejriwal government got 90% seats in Delhi consecutively, which is historic in itself,” Jain said on Wednesday after inaugurating a multi-purpose community centre at Alipur Village in north Delhi’s Narela. आज नरेला विधानसभा क्षेत्र के अलीपुर गांव में विधायक श्री शरद कुमार चौहान जी की उपस्थिति में सामुदायिक समारोह भवन का… https://t.co/swFMaXUjhF— Satyendar Jain (@SatyendarJain) 1629266901000“We have fulfilled the chief minister’s promise to the people and our work speaks for itself,” he said, adding that he is looking forward to beautifying this centre, which will play a crucial role in the village’s development. Narela MLA Sharad Kumar Chauhan and senior officials of Delhi government were present during the inauguration. “The UK and the US developed only because of free quality education and healthcare. The AAP government is bringing the same kind of development to Delhi. This government has been the first one in the nation to take up the issue of quality amenities as a prime responsibility and we are making remarkable progress in healthcare and education with each passing day,” the minister said. Jain said that politicians are elected for taking the nation forward and they should be selfless and tireless in their service. “We as a government owe everything to the people and our people-oriented, corruption-free governance model has awakened people about their legitimate rights of quality education and healthcare,” he said. “Delhi government is accused of doing politics of ‘free services’ but we ask if we are judiciously using public money and giving it back to the people through free and quality services then what’s the harm? We have not introduced any new tax and we will continue to work tirelessly in finding innovative ways of delivering the most appropriate policies for the people,” he said. Will is the key to achieving anything and no task is impossible, but requires commitment, which Jain alleged previous governments didn’t show.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/quality-edu-health-taking-delhi-on-us-growth-path/articleshow/85442095.cms||---

Sources said Jaitu MLA Baldev Singh did not turn up for his hearing before the speaker on Tuesday and now has been called next week along with the other two MLAs — Nazar Singh Manshahia and Amarjit Singh Sandoa. Manshahia, Sandoa and Khaira had come for the hearing. The petitioners in these cases will also be present when the meet the speaker next time. Meanwhile, Khaira has asked for some documents from the speaker’s office and has now been called separately. While Manshahia and Khaira have joined the Congress, after winning the last 2017 assembly elections on an AAP ticket, Sandoa had returned to the AAP fold after switching to the Congress briefly. Baldev Singh too returned to AAP after unsuccessfully contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha election as a nominee of the Punjab Ekta Party floated by Khaira. Meanwhile, a petition was also filed against Khaira, Baldev Singh, Manshahia, Sandoa, Jagdev Singh and Pirmal Singh Dhaula in the Punjab and Haryana high court. It is alleged that the MLAs had incurred disqualification the day they joined another party as per rules against defection provided under Article l9l(2) and Clause 2(1)(a) of 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India. In July 2018, eight of AAP’s 20 MLAs in the state had come out against the decision to remove Khaira as the leader of opposition and had demanded that it be reviewed. Manshahia too had sided with Khaira, but he later switched to the Congress after resigning from AAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/speaker-calls-3-mlas-facing-defection-charges-khaira-seeks-documents/articleshow/85412367.cms||---

Most of these Afghan nationals are staying with a visa, or with a refugee status. In June, city police had detained an Afghan national after he had actively extended support to Taliban on social media. He was also found to have purchased some properties in Nagpur. Kumar said police were checking the Afghan nationals and their whereabouts as a precautionary measure, though there were no specific inputs on any possible development. "Some of the Afghan nationals were summoned by the branch concerned to ascertain their activities. We plan to look for every one of them," he said. Sources said most of the Afghan nationals earn their livelihood by selling carpets, garments and dry fruits in the city, and that they generally stay in clusters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/keeping-tab-on-afghan-nationals-cp/articleshow/85412394.cms||---

In a letter to KCR, he criticized the Telangana government’s stance on recent water disputes between the two states, saying the Krishna River Board Management (KRMB) visited the project and reported to the Centre that substantial work had been completed. He recalled that the BJP had cautioned the state government about the loss to Telangana, if AP completed this particular project, but the government did not pay attention to it. Sanjay slammed CM KCR saying that he joined hands with Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jaganmohan Reddy. “Both of you are working together to benefit the contractors. And because of your negligence, AP completed 90 percent of the project works and injustice is being meted out to Telangana.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad gets bronze for dust pollution||AHMEDABAD: The rapidly changing demographic profile of Ahmedabad is also turning the city into a major pollution centre among the urban areas of the state. When it comes to pollution due to dust and pollen, Ahmedabad ranks third after Dhanbad and Ghaziabad in India, according to a study published in Elsevier’s journal ‘Current Research in Environmental Sustainability’. The study says that daily, on average, 19 lakh Amdavadis travel to work in their private vehicles. A Gujarat Pollution Control Board report cited in the research paper suggests that the major contributors to the dust pollution in Ahmedabad are industrial smoke, dust, pollen and to a certain extent, vehicles. TimesViewSince 1965 all of Ahmedabad’s development plans had emphasized greening and creating more open spaces. Over the past four decades, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority have done precious little on this front. A number of town planning schemes are devoid of adequate trees and open spaces as mandated by the Gujarat Town Planning Act. The AMC should henceforth ensure participation of citizen bodies while earmarking open spaces within town planning schemes to help develop a sense of ownership and participationBut where did the city go wrong? Back in 1965, the AMC planners had foreseen this surging dust and pollution problem. They had insisted on the development of an 8.49 sq km green belt that includes today’s Pirana dump yard, which should have been the city’s densest green spot by 2021. But unfortunately, that space was converted into vacant land and now is part of 132 Feet Ring Road. “It is this massive neglect that has cost the city dear,” said a senior retired town planning AMC official. “After 1980s, the city’s only chance of developing a green shield was lost when Pirana was converted into the city’s most toxic dump yard.” A study by Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, in 2018-19 said that over two decades Ahmedabad’s tree cover plummeted to 24% from 46% and that it was likely to touch 3% by 2030. The AMC’s building byelaws also suggest a minimum of 10% open space irrespective of any population density. “Ahmedabad lacks tree cover to tackle dust pollution. Till 2019, there was no concept of green infrastructure in the city’s urban planning,” said a senior AMC official. The city usually suffers the most during a dust storm. A dust event, on April 27 this year, was studied for the first time by a team of scientists. They were from Physical Research Laboratory (PRL). The study was led by Dr Sourita Saha and included five of her colleagues from Space Applications Centre and National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting. The researchers found that the dust particulate levels rose by 118% during the storm. “An effective tree cover could have been a big protector for the city had the 1965 plan been adhered to,” added the AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abad-gets-bronze-for-dust-pollution/articleshow/85412615.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 9.5 lakh acres of land irrigated by 39 dams||GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government will keep enough water in 56 reservoirs of the state to supply drinking water requirements until September 30. The government announced on Tuesday that the remaining water from dams is being diverted for irrigating standing crops even as the state stares at the prospect of a deficient monsoon this year. Officials of the water resources department said on Tuesday in a statement that 9.5 lakh acres of land received irrigation water as the state government adopted drastic measures to save farmer’s crops. Of the 56 dams in which water is being stored for drinking purposes, 36 are in Saurashtra, while the remaining are in other regions of the state, a government statement said. In north Gujarat, Dharoi dam will provide both drinking water as well as water for irrigating over 37,000 acres of land in districts of north Gujarat. In central Gujarat, over 5 lakh acres of land will be irrigated with water from Kadana and other smaller dams like Panam, Karad, Wadhwana, Watrak, Meshwo, Hathmati, Karjan, Sukhi, Dev, Patadungari and Edalwada. Gujarat has been experiencing a shortfall of rain this monsoon and overall, dams are filled to less than half of their capacity in the state. Sources said levels in dams will deplete further with the decision to divert water for irrigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/9-5l-acres-of-land-irrigated-by-39-dams/articleshow/85412439.cms||---

While the young patients (below 60 years) died of inflammation, the older patients (above 60 years) died of thrombosis (blood clotting) related issues. The experts pointed out that the primary objective of study was to analyze gross and microscopic changes in lungs, heart and peripheral vessels with focus on thromboembolism and vascular disease. “Thrombosis (blood clotting) and thromboembolism (obstruction of blood vessel by clot) were very common among the deceased patients – both in forms of micro-thrombosis in lungs or heart, or deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) that generally emanates from calf muscles. It however became fatal in older patients with comorbidities,” said an expert. Among the younger patients, cardiac complications including pericarditis and myocarditis (inflammation of inner tissues and outer layer respectively) were found to be predominant reason for the deaths. About 24% of the patients also reported cardiomegaly (abnormal enlargement of heart), said experts. Out of 31 deceased patients, only three had got the first dose of vaccine, said experts, indicating that the vaccination would surely have protective effect against Covid infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/did-vaccine-prove-to-be-a-saviour/articleshow/85412395.cms||---

The yatra that commenced from Sri Mahalingeshwara Temple, culminated at the Kabaka GP office. General surgeon Dr M K Prasad, who flagged off the yatra, said Hindus will stay strong and united. “The Hindu community is capable of facing any anti-national challenge. The incident reported in Kabaka village should not be repeated. It was not Tipu Sultan, but Vinayak Damodar Savarkar who was the inspiration for Indian Independence,” he said. Heeding Prasad’s suggestion, the yatra participants followed the chariot till Kabaka in vehicles in the wake of Covid-19 regulations. Protests were also staged in front of police stations across the district. Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal and HJV activists staged a protest in front of Barke police station here. A memorandum was submitted to Mangaluru City South MLA D Vedavyas Kamath seeking action against SDPI members. Kamath said: “The government is committed to act against those who are engaged in anti-Constitutional activities. Those who have opposed the Independence Day programme in Kabaka are no different from those who are engaged in violence in Afghanistan. Those who breach the sovereignty of the country will be punished as per law,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/kabaka-incident-vedike-takes-out-veer-savarkar-rath-yatra/articleshow/85408257.cms||---

A delegation of AAP MLAs, led by leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, handed over a memorandum to Punjab assembly speaker Rana K P Singh. After meeting the speaker, AAP MLAs said that their party was opposed to more than one monthly pension for MLAs/former MLAs, who had become MLAs more than once as such financial gain in the name of increments was morally incorrect. Therefore, an MLA should be given the same pension as a government employee, they said. Cheema said the taxpayers have the right over the state exchequer. He said the Congress government had stopped the pensions of Punjab government employees in the name of reforms in 2004, which was strongly opposed by the employees and pensioners community. The AAP legislators demanded that in the forthcoming assembly session, the law should be passed with the consent of all the MLAs to abolish more than one pension rule and restore the old pension scheme for government employees.The delegation included Kultar Singh Sandhwan, Principal Budh Ram, Meet Hayer, Manjit Singh Bilaspur, Kulwant Pandori, Jai Singh Rodi and Amarjit Singh Sandoa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-wants-one-mla-one-pension-rule-in-punjab/articleshow/85412446.cms||---

At this point, the prosecution’s plea is not fit to be admitted. It stands dismissed,” the order by additional sessions judge Anil Kumar Pandey said.Kappan, 41, and three others — Ateeq-ur-Rehman, 28, Masood Ahmad, 28 and Mohammad Aalam, 37 — had been arrested on October 5 last year at Maant when they were on their way to meet the family of the Hathras gang-rape victim and charged with sedition and under the UAPA. On November 11, the STF said, it “found” incriminating literature of the banned outfit SIMI with a few notes on them. The handwriting, they alleged, was that of Kappan. The documents were sent to the forensic science laboratory in Agra on March 8 this year. On June 2, the forensic report found that the handwriting was not that of Kappan. “As the sample did not match, it is necessary to interrogate the accused, Kappan,” said the plea filed by DSP (STF) Vinod Singh Sirohi on August 2. “Apart from this, information will also be sought from Kappan about work assigned to him by PFI.” The four arrested men had been accused of being PFI members who were trying to “disrupt peace” in Hathras. While the 5,000-page chargesheet against them had been submitted on April 3, Kappan’s counsel Wills Mathews said they have not received a copy yet. “It has been 10 months since the FIR was registered and four since the chargesheet was filed. Not providing a copy of the chargesheet is a violation of the rights of the accused … And their demand to further interrogate him goes against the Criminal Procedure Code,” he added.Defence counsel of the other three accused in the case, Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, said further investigation cannot be conducted after a chargesheet has been submitted unless the court permits. He added, “The Allahabad high court had said a person can’t be interrogated in a case police have already filed a chargesheet in.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-court-no-to-stf-plea-to-question-journo-kappan-again/articleshow/85410034.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Goa||‘Deposits over Rs 5L in defunct coop banks a raw deal’||Panaji: Despite charging insurance premiums on the total bank deposits, the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) provides an insurance cover only up to Rs 5 lakh, which puts account holders with more than Rs 5 lakh in a bank at a disadvantage said the Goa Bank Depositors Welfare Association on Tuesday. Citing the example of The Mapusa Urban Co-operative Bank (MUCB), the association said that the claims of the depositors were settled from MUCB’s liquid funds and not from DICGC’s deposit insurance fund. The association claims that DICGC has Rs 110,380 crore in the deposit insurance fund but has settled claims to the tune of Rs 5,200 crore. At present DICGC charges 10 paise for every Rs 100 deposited with a cooperative bank and scheduled commercial bank. “We have observed that while settling the depositors’ claims of MUCB, DICGC has utilised Rs 7 crore from the liquid fund and not used their own money from the insurance fund. It has definitely done injustice to depositors holding more than Rs 5 lakh in the bank,” said joint convenor of the association Prasanna Utagi. The association claims that by using the bank’s liquid funds to pay the depositors, those account holders with more than Rs 5 lakh in their bank account get a raw deal as they are unable to get their funds back. “If insurance premium is charged on all the deposits, then why the insurance cover is for only deposits up to Rs 5 lakh. While huge insurance fund is available with DICGC owned by RBI, why utilise liquid funds of the bank under liquidation and deprive the rightful and legitimate claims of the depositors, who hold more than Rs 5 lakh deposits with the bank,” said Suresh Lotlikar, a co-convenor of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/deposits-over-rs-5l-in-defunct-coop-banks-a-raw-deal/articleshow/85414805.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In the Mughal annals, Jehangir says he had heard good things of the city. But when he arrived, he found the city covered in a “dust heap”. So annoyed was the emperor that he wanted to rename the city. “I have already called Ahmedabad ‘Gardabad’ (city full of dust),” he wrote. “Should I call it Samumistan (land of the diseased wind), Bimaristan (land of the ill), Zaqumzar (thorn patch), or Jahannamabad (place of hell).” Jehangir had even ordered an experiment to prove his point. He asked two sheep to be skinned and then hung up, one in Ahmedabad, the other few hundred kilometres east in Mahmudabad. Indeed, he was right. The sheep in Ahmedabad began to rot within eight hours, while that in Mahmudabad lasted for 14 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jehangir-gave-the-city-the-moniker-gardabad/articleshow/85412652.cms||---

Referring to a loan mentioned, it says that “from the gathered facts, it can be inferred that Rs 1 crore does not partake the character of loan taken by her but it is (her) own money and accordingly, the particular about the liability on this account disclosed in the affidavit filed by her is erroneous.” It is learnt that I-T may send a report to the Election Commission for Yamini’s disqualification as MLA for providing false details in the election affidavit. Yamini’s husband Yashwant Jadhav is the chairman of the BMC’s powerful Standing Committee that has final authority to approve all big financial proposals of the civic body. The BMC election is scheduled before March 2022. Yashwant denied all the allegations. “We have given accurate declarations in the affidavit with facts at that point of time. All explanations provided to the authorities concerned. These are false allegations made to defame us,” he said. I-T had taken up Yamini’s 2019 election affidavit for scrutiny, where she had declared assets worth Rs 7.5 crore, and her husband’s wealth as Rs 4.6 crore. She also mentioned the Rs 1 crore loan from Pradhan Dealers. I-T investigation found that Pradhan Dealers was controlled by Kolkata hawala operator Uday Shankar Mahawar, through two other companies: Skyline Commercial Ltd and Supersoft Suppliers Ltd. These companies had dummy directors. I-T said Mahawar collected cash from Jadhav, layered them through shell companies before transferring into the account of Pradhan Dealers. Then it was transferred as loan. In his statement to I-T, Mahawar admitted that he provided accommodation entries to several shell companies. The present director of Pradhan Dealers, Chandrashekhar Rane, and former director Priyesh Jain admitted they were dummy directors working on instructions Mahawar. They all admitted to indulging in illegal financial transactions and helping the Jadhav couple to legitimise their unaccounted for cash. Mahawar’s name had come up in the National Herald case, involving Congress’ Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-t-may-seek-to-disqualify-mla-over-false-affidavit/articleshow/85412509.cms||Vijay V Singh

She was creating history, on her way to becoming one of India’s first women to get medical degrees, along with Anandibai Joshi. Anandibai died before she could practise and Kadambini went on to become India’s first woman physician. Now, she is among six women historical figures Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) has decided to honour by naming their girls’ hostels after them. “The pioneers after whom the hostels have been named will continue to inspire generations of women who come to stay here,” said AMU vice chancellor Tariq Mansoor while inaugurating the newly-named hostels on Monday as part of the university's Independence Day celebrations. The hostels have been named after Kadambini, the face of women’s empowerment in postcolonial India Hamida Habibullah, the Nawab of Bhopal from 1860 to 1868 Sikandar Begum, the Begum of Awadh and one of India’s first women freedom fighters Hazrat Mahal, the first person to hoist an Indian flag on foreign soil Bhikaji Cama and the founder of Indian Home Rule League Annie Besant. “The names were shortlisted by a committee formed by vice chancellor Mansoor. The list of women who contributed to the progress of our nation is diverse. This is an attempt to pay tribute to them,” AMU public relations officer M Shafey Kidwai said. “Kadambini Ganguly’s name was suggested by the VC. As a surgeon himself, he takes great inspiration from her. There is a lot to learn from the struggles she overcame.” Kadambini was born in Bhagalpur to Brajakishore Bose, who started the first women’s rights organisation in India, Bhagalpur Mahila Samiti. He got her admitted to a school at a time it was uncommon for girls to get an education. She persisted, and became India’s first woman, along with Chandramukhi Basu, to enter university in 1878. Till 1883, Calcutta Medical College had been keeping women students out — until Kadambini fought her way in. She finally got her medical degree, inviting such strong resistance that a magazine in Bengal made an indirect reference to her as a “whore”, which she challenged in court and won. She then travelled to Edinburgh in 1893, got three medical certifications with a specialisation in gynaecology and came back to India as the country's first female medical practitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amu-names-hostel-after-kadambini-ganguly-indias-first-woman-physician/articleshow/85410048.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Ahmedabad||‘Covid hit business of 1 lakh Gujarat suppliers’||AHMEDABAD: Reflecting a decline in demand in the pandemic year, 1.06 lakh suppliers did not do business in 2020-21, suggests the data provided by Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN). The number of suppliers who generated e-way bills for goods during the pandemic year 2020-21 reduced from 27.47 lakh in 2019-20 to 26.40 lakh — down 4%. Regular churning of suppliers in various sectors coupled with a reduction in demand due to the pandemic caused a decline in the number of suppliers. “Certain small dealers keep fluctuating in various sectors such as ceramics and textiles,” said J P Gupta, state commercial tax commissioner. “At times manufacturers do not directly supply goods but do it through a network of various traders and distributors. This could be one reason for the decline in the number of suppliers.” Industry sources said that the reduction in demand is one of the biggest reasons for the decline in both e-way bills and the number of suppliers in the pandemic year. Pathik Patwari, honorary secretary, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), said: “Owing to the pandemic, demand was a major issue across all sectors including textiles, chemicals, real estate, ceramics, and engineering goods.” Patwari went on to say: “We almost lost five to six months to the pandemic as there was a lockdown and heavy restrictions during one part of the year and a slow revival of industrial production and demand during the remaining part.” Patwari said a number of traders at the bottom of the pyramid were forced to temporarily or permanently down shutters due to the pandemic as demand and supply-chain problems were grave. “The generation of e-way bills is directly proportional to the goods supplied and a decline clearly suggests lower supply,” Patwari added. During the pandemic year, the number of e-way bills generated declined from 7.87 crore in 2019-20 to 7.36 crore in 2020-21. Even the GST collection in Gujarat declined during the same period by 5.8%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-hit-biz-of-1l-state-suppliers/articleshow/85412562.cms||Niyati Parikh

Workers were telling me that Brar was saying that Sukhbir would be coming to his residence. But, Sukhbir told me not to care and continue working in the constituency. If he had taken the decision to induct Brar, he could have told me clearly, but he preferred to do things way which hurt me,” Makkar told TOI on Tuesday. “I again tried to speak to him on Sunday when Brar started calling up party workers informing that Badal would be coming to his place but neither he took my calls nor his aides told me about his schedule. If they can treat an old, trusted worker like this, they would face consequences across the state as other loyal workers would also feel ditched in the same way,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ignored-for-turncoat-makkar-cries-foul/articleshow/85412585.cms||IP Singh

Hundreds of tree saplings have been lined up at Pirana, where land was freed of garbage via bio-mining. AMC cleared legacy refuse from 25 acres of the 80 acres and has begun planting trees following the Japanese Miyawaki technique. The massive tree plantation drive was due since 1965 when Pirana was first earmarked as a green zone in AMC’s city development plan. Till a few weeks ago, AMC was aerating, then deodorizing the soil with harmless chemicals. “The sanitized soil has been sprayed with a non-hazardous mixture of mineral and herbal components to accelerate decomposition of organic waste matter in a controlled manner,” says a senior official of the AMC. Almost 55 varieties of trees and shrubs, including local and fruit-bearing trees that will attract birds and animals are being planted at the site. Amidst this green cloak, there will be walking paths to encourage citizens to take a stroll or exercise. The budget and deadline for the project has not been fixed yet, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/first-trees-being-planted-at-pirana-park/articleshow/85412645.cms||---

Since October 26, 2020, the HC had been livestreaming court proceedings but these used to be of the bench headed by the chief justice and the proceedings used to take place in virtual mode due to Covid-19 pandemic situation. With the reduction in Covid-19 cases, the HC decided to start courtrooms and lawyers began making submissions in-person and they were viewed live. Last month, the HC framed the High Court of Gujarat (Live Streaming of Court Proceedings) Rules, 2021 and on the same day, hearings that were taking place before all consenting benches were livestreamed. The ICT & eGovernance Committee of the high court and the Information Technology Cell implemented an in-house technical solution for live streaming of the court using using computer systems, web cameras, digital audio interface and public-address systems, said HC officials. For this, all courtrooms have been equipped with microphones and speakers for the bench and advocates. The live streaming is being done on the HC’s official YouTube channel, which is now touching a subscriber base of 75,000 and has 53 lakh views cumulatively. Feed from the chief justice’s court appeared to have suffered technical glitches because the sound was not properly audible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/now-courtroom-proceedings-to-be-livestreamed/articleshow/85412569.cms||---

Upon the instructions of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, principal secretary (Norka) K Ellangovan has written to the ministry of external affairs asking for its urgent intervention in the matter. “Upon the chief minister’s instructions, we have taken up the matter with the Centre as only the MEA is empowered to take up this matter. We have also shared the information with the MEA regarding the person who had contacted us,” Ellangovan said. Some of the messages to Norka said that the Taliban are verifying their documents and are taking away their passports and other important documents. The state has shared with the Centre the contact details of Deedil Rajeevan, who contacted Norka. Though it was initially said that there were 36 Keralites, the figures increased to 41 by Wednesday morning. The representatives of the Keralite group had emailed Norka Roots, based on which the state government initiated action. However, sources said that further details about the group are still unknown, including their whereabouts in the state. “All they informed us was that they are a group of 41 and they are employed in private companies there. We will have to check their whereabouts in the state, who is their employer and whether they have reached Afghanistan directly from India or via some other country where they were originally employed, etc. Their employers have a responsibility for the safety of their employees as well,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-seeks-centres-help-to-bring-back-keralites-in-af/articleshow/85412558.cms||---

This will be the first flight to depart from MIA to Dubai, almost four months after flights were banned by the UAE government from India. AIE’s direct flight to Dubai will be on Friday. Though the UAE permitted expatriates to fly from India from August 5, airlines could not operate from MIA, since the rapid RT-PCR test, one of the chief requirements for travellers to enter UAE, was not available here. Rapid RT-PCR testing started at the airport on Monday, and the UAE’s approval of the test was received by airlines on Tuesday. Airline sources said that AIE’s Wednesday flight to Dubai was planned in haste, and that they would be lucky to fly out with even half the capacity, as the passengers would be hard pressed to get RT-PCR test results by the time the flight departs at 2.45pm from MIA. Also, this being an additional flight, it’s a one-stop flight via Thiruvananthapuram, and will take 6.2 hours to reach Dubai. “Those expatriates who know of this flight may be able to make it, as the test has to be taken on Tuesday morning to get the results by evening,’’ said an airline official. On Thursday, AIE has a scheduled flight to Abu Dhabi at 3.50pm. Meanwhile, other airlines like Indigo and SpiceJet have opened up bookings from Friday to Sharjah and Dubai. The fares range from a minimum of Rs 19,000 for early bookings to Rs 35,000 to Rs 45,000 for latecomers. Only Indigo bookings show destinations as Sharjah, which will help expatriates having residence visas, other than Dubai and Abu Dhabi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/aie-to-operate-dubai-flight-today-other-airlines-start-bookings/articleshow/85408319.cms||Stanley Pinto

In a video that was shot at his press meet and which went viral on social media later, Barq was seen praising Taliban and comparing the move with that of India’s freedom struggle. He was also seen praising the Taliban for giving a tough competition to the powerful countries like the United States of America and Russia, as it prevented them from settling in. He later added that Afghanistan’s independence and Taliban taking over it is their internal matter. Condemning the statement made by the SP MP, Uttar Pradesh’s deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya targeted the opposition parties, including the SP, BSP and Congress, and accused them of doing appeasement politics. “If they give such kind of remarks, then what is the difference between them and the prime minister of Pakistan Imran Khan? The Samajwadi Party can say anything.” Even in the past, Barq, a five-term MP and a four-term MLA, has been in controversy over his statements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/91-year-old-sp-mp-defends-taliban-says-they-are-fighting-for-freedom-of-people/articleshow/85405303.cms||Maria Khan

However, she still needs the mercy of the central government to see her daughter once again and her grandchild, for the first time. Speaking to TOI, Bindu said that she was yet to receive any official confirmation in this regard. Regardless, she will continue her fight as always, sending mails to the Prime Minister and external affairs ministry seeking help in bringing back her daughter and 4-year-old grandchild back to India. She is yet to receive a positive reply for any of the countless mails she sent them. Yet, she is determined to continue doing what she has to do until she receives a positive reply. “I need to keep doing what I have to do as there is no one else to help me in this battle,” Bindu said. She added that she was really concerned about the safety of her daughter and granddaughter following the changed circumstances in Afghanistan. Bindu had been knocking on all doors to bring her daughter back to India ever since she received news that the latter had been captured in Kabul. She believes that if her daughter’s actions were against the interest of the nation, the government must bring her back and prosecute her here as she continued to be an Indian citizen. Bindu had earlier made it clear that the main aim of her fight was to provide a safe childhood to her innocent granddaughter, who was born after Nimisha joined IS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/worried-about-safety-of-daughter-and-grandkid/articleshow/85412669.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Jhingan completes move to Croatia, must wait for debut||Panaji: Sandesh Jhingan has completed his much-anticipated move to HNK Sibenik but will have to wait until at least next week before he is eligible for selection to play in Croatia’s top-tier league. Jhingan landed in Croatia on Sunday and watched his team’s 6-2 demolition of Hrvatski Dragovoljac from the stands. He has also started training under Spanish coach Mario Rosas, but registration and work permit formalities means it won’t be until next week that he can be considered for selection. The club said Jhingan has signed a contract till 2022 with an option for another year. “We hope Sandesh will continue to be an example for Indian footballers. He has demonstrated his ambition and competitiveness by wanting to get out of his comfort zone,” said Rosas. Jhingan, India’s footballer of the year, was comfortable at ATK Mohun Bagan. Among the best-paid footballers in the country, the defender had four more years left on his existing contract with the Kolkata giants. When news surfaced that the 28-year-old was wanted by European clubs – there was interest from Austria and Greece too – the club asked him whether he was sure of a move to Europe. Jhingan, 28, was never really in doubt. “I think I am in the stage of my career where I really want to test myself in the highest level possible and I think this is the perfect platform for me. As I have always said, it has been my desire to play in Europe and I have taken up this challenge,” Jhingan said after his move was made official by the Croatian club on Wednesday. HNK Sibenik are eighth in the 10-team Prva HNL, the top-tier league in Croatia. The club has won one of their first five games and will take on the might of Rijeka in the next game on Sunday. That game may have come too early for Jhingan, with the defender expected to be considered for selection for the home clash against Istra 1961 on August 28. “I cannot wait to get going and look forward to giving 100 percent at every given opportunity,” said Jhingan. The club said they were convinced of Jhingan’s abilities to play in Europe after watching several of his matches on different platforms. “Although we know the adaptation process might take him a few weeks, we are confident that with his quality and leadership, he will become an important member of the team,” said club CEO Francisco Cardona. Jhingan started his professional career with United Sikkim in 2011 but it was his six-year stint with Kerala Blasters in the Indian Super League that helped him attract attention. He mutually parted ways with the club in 2020 and joined hands with ATK Mohun Bagan, having sat out the previous season with injury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/jhingan-completes-move-to-croatia-must-wait-for-debut/articleshow/85440136.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

While some highrises in sectors 119 and 120 faced power cuts every 10 minutes through the night, in sectors 116, 128, 118 and 117, there was no power from 6 am to 10 am on Tuesday.Officials at the power department said damage in the main 132 KV line at Noida’s Sector 115 substation led to the problem. The fault was fixed on Tuesday morning.“There were intermittent power cuts for a few hours from 11 pm on Monday,” said a resident of Sector 120. “We were watching TV at that time and it kept getting switched off, along with the air conditioner.”In sectors 74 to 79, where about 2 lakh people stay in highrises, several residents were up for most of the night. “Many took a stroll inside their complex because it was too hot,” said local resident Brijesh Singh.In Sector 119, lifts in some housing complexes stopped working for some time. “As soon as the power back-up would kick in, the main line would trip again. This continued for more than an hour on Monday night,” said Sanjay Kumar from Sector 119. VN Singh, the chief zonal engineer, Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), Noida, said: “A conductor breakage was reported around 12.50 am. We tried to restore the supply through alternate lines in Bhangel and Sector 20 substations. But since the 132 KV substation in Sector 115 is the main supply line for Noida, the problem of outage continued.

---||Mumbai||Phone tap records not relevant to CBI probe, says Maharashtra govt||MUMBAI: Resisting the handing over of sensitive records, the Maharashtra home department in an affidavit has told Bombay high court that documents sought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which are linked to phone taps, are not relevant to the probe against former home minister of Maharashtra, Anil Deshmukh. The state on Tuesday informed the high court that it was “ready and willing to fully cooperate” with the CBI, provided it is done strictly in keeping with court orders. The HC had directed a preliminary enquiry against Deshmukh, which led to an FIR being filed against him by the central agency. The CBI said the state was stalling its probe into the corruption case filed against Deshmukh and others, for which it had sought call data records and a report on certain individuals including government staff involved in an alleged conspiracy to fix police postings and transfers. The report was submitted last August by former commissioner (state intelligence department) Rashmi Shukla. Denying that its refusal to share documents was hampering the probe against Deshmukh, the state said the CBI plea is “vague’’ and silent on the relevance of documents sought. On the contrary, CBI is interfering with its probe into the “leak” of Shukla’s report, the state said in an affidavit.  HC said it was reserving its comments and adjourned the matter to August 21. “The State Government has no intention, much less malafide intentions, to defy the directions,” said the state’s affidavit filed by a joint secretary of the home department on Tuesday. The state said CBI, however, seems to be seeking documents and information which are “not relevant’’ for the agency to continue its probe following the FIR filed against Deshmukh. The state said the HC’s April 5 order says it cannot be construed as giving unfettered authority to the CBI to inquire into the transfers and posting of policemen in general. The HC order doesn’t entitle CBI to seek information that have no links to the Prevention of Corruption Act offences alleged against Deshmukh, said the government. State said the CBI has no power to decide relevance or need of documents in possession of the state. The state also said its special leave petition against dismissal by HC of its quashing plea on two paras in the CBI FIR is pending before Supreme Court and sought an adjournment. The State said the CBI’s plea is not maintainable since the main petition already stands disposed of. Besides, the state said the commissioner (state intelligence department) has already on July 27 informed CBI that the digital and physical record has been given to the cyber police and devices sent for forensics. The April 5 order of HC directed a preliminary enquiry by CBI into allegations of ‘corrupt malpractice’ against Deshmukh made by former police chief Param Bir Singh in a letter to the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-phone-tap-records-not-relevant-to-cbi-probe-says-state/articleshow/85412633.cms||Swati Deshpande

The attached assets include agricultural land, commercial sites and plots, residential flat and fixed deposit. ED had initiated a money laundering investigation based on an FIR registered by the Vizag police against Vaddi Mahesh and others for fraudulently remitting huge foreign outward remittances to various front companies in Singapore, Hong Kong and China on the pretext of import of non-existent customised software. Investigation revealed that Mahesh had floated several shell firms in India and opened many accounts with banks in Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Then, based on the instructions of Bhimendra Kumar (BK) Goyal, he had remitted Rs 1,500 crore to around 40 foreign shell companies in Singapore, Hong Kong and China in the guise of payments for import of non-existent “customized software” and further revealed that BK Goyal was the mastermind behind the money laundering operation and supplied the funds.  “BK Goyal had also incorporated companies in Singapore and Hong Kong with his wife Shashi Goyal and son Rahul Goyal as directors and laundered part of the proceeds of crime to their companies,” ED said. Fund trail investigation of several bank accounts was done to trace the source of the domestic funds. ED trailed the funds back up to 3-4 layers and discovered cash infusion points . Also Rs 20 Lacs was received from Pragati Print Pack Pvt Ltd. bank account.

Last 45 days have seen a hike of Rs50 on LPG cylinders. While petrol is priced at Rs110.14 a litre in Bhopal, diesel is retailed at Rs98.67 a litre. Though rates of both fuels have been stable for the past 20 days, they have already touched a new high disturbing the household budget of the common man. In September last year, the price of an LPG cylinder was Rs600 in Bhopal. In the last one year, there has been a hike of Rs265, retailers said. Hike in the domestic gas cylinder prices has already moved the cooking gas beyond the reach of the common man. It’s not only the customer, but also the LPG retailer who is feeling the pinch. Increasing LPG prices have already led to a decline in its sale. “There has already been a 25% decline in sales. And the margin of profit has gone down,” said a LPG dealer. Every business has an element of growth, but the LPG retailing in Bhopal has already reached its peak and there is no business growth, but the establishment cost of running the business has been increasing, leading to decline in profitability, he said. Now, the gas pipelines being laid in Bhopal by a private company will further erode the business, both the retailers and oil companies would be affected. Roopa Rao, a homemaker who lives in Kolar locality, said: “As the price of a cooking gas cylinder goes up, I have started shifting to electric appliances like the hot plate.” “I try to strike a balance between the two so that the LPG cylinder lasts longer,” she said. Anjali Jacob, another housewife said, “On one hand the government stopped the subsidy, while on the other hand, the price continues to rise. Now it is going through the roof.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/rs-25-lpg-hike-takes-price-to-a-new-high/articleshow/85410054.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Waiting list of patients to receive kidney gets longer||Mysuru: Medical fraternity has appreciated chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s initiative to pledge organs and appeal to the public to save lives with similar gesture. This can help many recipients get organs quickly. The list of patients waiting to receive organs, including kidneys, is going up given the rise in the number of patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to a change in lifestyle, coupled with hypertension, diabetes and advanced ageing, more people are becoming prone to kidney diseases. N G Bhartheesha Reddy, vice-president of Apollo (Mysuru unit), welcomed the gesture of the CM to donate organs and felt this could make the job of healthcare providers easier in convincing donors and their family members. “Kidney requirement has gone up in the region due to various factors, including lifestyle. In the last one year, we have conducted 26 kidney harvest and transplants. Among them, 22 were from live donations. Still, 65 are in the waiting list. Five liver transplants have been done, while 14 are still waiting,” he said, adding: “Healthcare staff are facing challenges as not many are willing to donate organs. There are two types of donations — live donors and donations from brain-dead patients. Organs, if donated, could be useful to someone if their relatives come forward.” The government must come up with initiatives to encourage the public to donate organs and save lives, felt Bhartheesha. He also suggested that the government relax regulation in declaring patients dead on the lines of Tamil Nadu, where the numbers of organ harvest and transplant are highest in south India. Dr Manjunath S Shetty, head of nephrology department, JSS Hospital, said one of his patients has been waiting for five years to receive a kidney because the waiting list is big. “There is a huge demand for kidneys today as cases of kidney failure are more than liver and heart. Of late, many patients who are on dialysis are being added to the waiting list,” he said. Owing to the pandemic, there is a delay in the setting up fifth division of ‘Jeeva Sarthakathe’, the body constituted by Karnataka to oversee implementation of transplantation of human organs, in Mysuru. Presently, Karnataka has four zones — Bengaluru-Mysuru, Mangaluru-Manipal, Dharwad-Belagavi and Kalaburagi — that decides on organ harvest and transplants. Sources said around 4,000 are waiting for kidney and around 1,000 for liver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/waiting-list-of-patients-to-receive-kidney-gets-longer/articleshow/85408486.cms||Lawrence Milton
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED asks home minister Anil Deshmukh and son to appear today||MUMBAI: A day after the Supreme Court declined relief to former state home minister Anil Deshmukh in a money laundering case, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) issued its fifth summons, asking him and his son Hrishikesh to appear on Wednesday. If they fail, the ED is likely to approach a court requesting a non-bailable warrant against them. Earlier, Deshmukh had released a video message, saying he would appear before the ED once the SC decides on his plea. People close to him said the SC had refused interim relief, but Deshmukh’s writ raising a constitutional challenge to certain provisions of the PMLA Act and powers of the ED are still pending before the court. The ED has been looking for Deshmukh and Hrishikesh, but they have kept one step ahead since the agency began searching their premises in multiple cities. Two of Deshmukh’s assistants have been arrested. “The ED expects Deshmukh to explain the details of suspicious transactions into the account of his educational trust in Nagpur. He has been given enough time to appear for questioning but he has been avoiding the summons. ED officials are discussing with legal experts whether they can approach the court for issuing an NBW against Deshmukh and Hrishikesh if they fail to appear on Wednesday,” said a source in ED. On Monday, the SC refused to grant Deshmukh interim protection from arrest in the money laundering case, which follows from an extortion-bribery case, and said he should approach the appropriate forum for relief. The ED affidavit said Deshmukh’s family and his close associates are involved in “laundering the money by creating a complex web of structure of companies and their transactions”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-asks-deshmukh-and-son-to-appear-today/articleshow/85412673.cms||Vijay V Singh

AM/NS had approached the HC after a commercial court in Surat rejected its application on July 17 to shift the proceedings to the tribunal, which the HC constituted on July 9. The trial court dismissed the application on the ground that after instituting a case by the companies over the dispute the court heard the case at length and it had reserved its order to be pronounced on July 20. It said that AM/NS can withdraw its application with a view to filing application before the tribunal under section 17 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, but it cannot ask the court to transfer the proceedings to the tribunal. It termed the application misconceived. The application for transfer of the proceedings to the tribunal was objected by EBTL and it insisted that the court should pronounce its verdict, though the tribunal consisting three retired Supreme Court judges was formed with mutual understanding. While rejecting AM/NS’s application, the Surat court deferred its judgment for ten days saying that it was delaying since an issue of interpretation of law was involved. As the high court too rejected the demand and upheld the Surat court’s decision, AM/NS requested the HC to grant time to the company to approach the Supreme Court. The HC stayed the Surat court from pronouncing its final order till September 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-nixes-am/nss-plea-against-surat-court-order/articleshow/85412608.cms||---
---||Bhopal||After Hardeep Singh Dang, another MP minister demands mandatory cow rearing||BHOPAL: A day after minister Hardeep Singh Dang suggested that rearing of cows be made mandatory for contesting elections, state urban development minister Bhupendra Singh on Tuesday appealed to all his cabinet colleagues to rear cows and protect `gau mata’. “We all know that cows are revered in our culture. Cow’s milk is like ‘amrit’ (nectar). Cow rearing and cow protection is part of Indian culture. There are 33 crore gods and goddesses and ‘gau mata’ is one of them. I appeal to all ministers to rear cows and open cow shelters,” said Singh on Tuesday. The minister told TOI, “It was the BJP government that passed a law against cow slaughter and protection of the sacred ‘gau mata’. Congress could hardly do anything for cow protection except playing politics. I appeal to public to promote cow rearing. There is already a law in place for cow protection. If needed, a new law can also be passed.” Singh is the second minister who has advocated for cow rearing in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government. A day before, the minister for new and renewable energy and environment, Dang, suggested that rearing of cows be made mandatory for contesting elections. “This is my personal view and I would write to the Election Commission apart from raising the demand in the party forum. I also propose to collect Rs500 per month from the state government employees who are drawing a monthly salary of Rs25,000 and above for the protection of cows,” Dang had said on Monday. Congress MLA Arif Masood said he was ready to raise cows if the government provides him security. “I am afraid that if I keep a cow, the mob will attack me. If Dang guarantees to protect me against mob lynching, I will rear cows,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/after-dang-another-mp-minister-demands-mandatory-cow-rearing/articleshow/85410070.cms||Rajendra Sharma

The district magistrate has now asked officials to spend 75% of funds available under each head within a week and clear all pending bills. During a meeting held recently, it was found that till July this year Rs 11.9 crore had been spent against Rs 23.5 crore that was provided to the district under the NHM.In the first four months of the 2021-2022 fiscal, the department has not spent even a single rupee on many programs.

The department has not spent any money on the national leprosy programme and the healthcare programme related to the elderly as well.The amount spent on prevention and control of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and stroke is just Rs 7,935 out of Rs 36 lakh. Bills related to polio, Covid-19 and the National Rural Health Mission are pending with the health department.In a letter to the chief medical officer, district magistrate RK Singh has said: “It has been learned that the bills related to pulse polio campaign, Covid-19 and NRHM are pending for payment due to which the percentage of expenditure is less than the norm. It is clear from this that the assistants concerned and you are not taking interest in this important scheme of the government.

---||Mangaluru||DK stands second in school admissions in state||Mangaluru: Dakshina Kannada (DK) district stands second in the state in school admissions from standards I to X. Despite surging Covid-19 cases in the district, the admissions to government, aided and unaided schools have been good. The first place was bagged by Uttara Kannada at 98.4% admissions, and DK stands second with 98.1% of admissions completed so far. Udupi district stands seventh with 97.2% of admissions, and Bengaluru Urban South stands last in the state with 76.1% admissions. Overall, the state has achieved 93% admissions as on August 12. According to officials from the department of public instruction, the teachers and officials in the district are working hard despite the rise in Covid-19 cases. Malleswamy, DDPI, DK, told TOI that admissions in government and aided schools have seen an increase due to the addition of more Kannada-English bilingual medium schools. “This year alone, we have added around 32 bilingual medium schools, and the numbers have increased to 82 schools in DK,” he said. DK has a target of 3,18,436 admissions, out of which 3,12,394 admissions have been achieved so far. From class I to X, only class I has achieved 93% of admissions, and the rest of the classes have above 98% admissions. On the rush for admissions, especially in government and aided schools, Malleswamy said there was a hope among parents and children that schools would resume at the earliest, soon after the second wave of Covid-19. However, it is unlikely to happen due to surging numbers. “School SDMCs, teachers, officials and locals are the reason for good admissions,” he said, adding there will not be any deadline set for admissions. This year’s admissions have also seen a lot of students earlier studying in private English medium schools migrating to Kannada-English medium government schools. Malleswamy said that aided schools have seen an additional 7% admissions. “We had a target of admitting 46,229 students, but admitted 49,608 students, whereas DK government schools have seen 1% additional admissions,” he said. On the decision of school reopening from August 23, Malleswamy said that it will be taken up after a discussion with deputy commissioner K V Rajendra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dk-stands-second-in-school-admissions-in-state/articleshow/85408380.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

---||Kochi||Shashi Tharoor’s remark on ‘Malayali link to Taliban’ shameful: BJP president J P Nadda||NEW DELHI: As a controversy erupted over former Union minister and Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's tweet on the alleged 'Malayali link to Taliban’, BJP president J P Nadda alleged that the Congress leader’s remarks associating Kerala with terrorism was shameful. “It is shameful that Kerala has been equated with a terrorist module,” Nadda said, while inaugurating the party office in Kozhikode, Kerala and added that the state had already become hub of ISIS activities and even smuggling of gold, which had links even with the office of the state chief minister. At a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said Tharoor is a repeat offender as he had earlier used phrases like “Hindu Taliban” and “Hindu Pakistan.” “Tharoor has used these phrases, which demeans India, therefore, anything better would be like expecting too much from Tharoor and Congress,” Patra said. Writing on Twitter, Tharoor commented on a tweet by a user named Ramiz, who had posted a video of Taliban fighters who had just reached Kabul. “#Taliban fighter weeping in joy as they reached outside #Kabul knowing there victory is eminent (sic),” Ramiz wrote on Twitter along with the video. To this, Tharoor wrote that two Malayali Taliban fighters appear to be in the video. “It sounds as if there are at least two Malayali Taliban here — one who says “samsarikkette” around the 8-second mark & another who understands him! (sic)” Tharoor tweeted. Ramiz, who mentions in his bio that he is interested in conflict journalism, later clarified that the Taliban do not have any Kerala-origin fighters. “There are no #Kerala origin fighters in rank and file of #taliban they are #baloch from #zabul province who speak brahvi and bravhi language is widely spoken among them, its a dravidian language very similar to telugu tamil malyalam etc (sic),” Ramiz tweeted. Tharoor responded by stating that the possibility of Malayalis being part of the Taliban cannot be ruled out. “Interesting explanation. Will leave it to the linguists to figure this one out. But there have indeed been misguided Malayalis who joined the Taliban, so that possibility cannot be ruled out entirely (sic),” he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tharoors-remark-on-malayali-link-to-taliban-shameful-nadda/articleshow/85412752.cms||---

Bilal Khatri is the toast of tiny hamlet called Bagh in Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh, who has been selected for a national award for handicrafts by the ministry of textiles, Government of India. The ninth generation master craftsman said, “I’m proud of the fact that I’m getting the national award for my Bagh print, which I incorporated on a bamboo durry. The award will be given in a formal ceremony in Delhi in winters, but it has already given me the much needed fillip in my fight to keep my pushtaini art alive,” said Bilal, speaking to TOI. His father Yusuf Khatri is a ‘shilp guru’ and winner of two national awards who taught Bilal the intricacies of Bagh motifs, the art which has given an identity to his village. “Bagh is a dying art, unless efforts are made to revive it, it will become extinct,” said Bilal and added, “MP is a state with 80 per cent tribal population. It is high time tribal youngsters are taught to master our traditional art forms, to ensure they become known, internationally.” It is his life mission to promote Bagh print, said the award-winning artisan, who went out of his way to help the poor artisans of his village in last 18 months of pandemic. “During the Covid-19 lockdown, I took cash and credit limit from bank to give material, colours, fabric and employment to poor artisans and readied 30,000 metres of Bagh print. The moment markets opened, we all restarted our journey to be on our feet,” Bilal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/national-award-for-bagh-artisan-of-mp/articleshow/85410105.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
---||Nagpur||Avni shooter forged arms licence, appoint SIT to probe: Petitioner NGO||NAGPUR: The Earth Brigade Foundation (EBF), petitioner in the criminal PIL filed in the shooting of Pandharkawda tigress T1 aka Avni, has requested appointment of a special investigating team (SIT) to re-investigate all evidence and re-examine all reports. The EBF has alleged that shooter Shafat Ali Khan Asghar Ali Khan had forged his arms licence, and there was tampering with evidence at the crime scene. In a detailed affidavit filed by Dr PV Subramaniam in the high court through lawyers Shreerang Bhandarkar and Sejal Lakhani, the NGO has sought directions against respondents Shafat Ali Khan Asghar Ali Khan to submit the guns used to kill T1 tigress for ballistic investigation. The petitioner has appealed to the respondent state government to initiate criminal proceedings against the shooters for ‘illegal’ hunting of T1 by fabricating and forging a bogus and sham arms licence, tampering with evidence at the crime scene, and dereliction of duty by forest staff under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The affidavit alleged that the licences submitted by the shooters do not have a unique identification number (UIN). As per the Arms Rules 2016, every arms licence has to have a UIN. If the Khans claim that their licences were apparently renewed on March 10, 2017, why did not the renewing authority generate a UIN? The UIN is nowhere present in copies of both licences, it said. The petitioner alleged that renewal endorsement is typed, and only the renewal date is handwritten, and, shockingly, the endorsement signatures of the commissioner of police, while seemingly similar, are different and distinct. In both licences, the renewal endorsement by the police commissioner, Hyderabad, is fully typed, only the day of the renewal date is handwritten. This raises strong suspicion of the possibility that the authorities could have acted in collusion with the Khans. Asghar used the gun belonging to his father Shafat Ali Khan. The petitioner had engaged accredited agency Helik Advisory, a premier organization in forensic and allied sciences, to compare the signatures of the commissioner of police on the licences of Khans. The forensic agency has confirmed the forgery. The said agency stated that the signatures on the licenxes are of different authorship. Further, while Shafat Ali Khan readily produced a copy of his licence during investigations, his son Asghar refused to produce the same before NTCA. The arms licence of Asghar seems to be forged, it said. The NGO further said that respondent Khans were not required to deposit their arms during the elections in Telangana. Shafat Ali Khan and Asghar Khan were members of the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), and both were exempted from depositing their guns. The act of depositing the guns was therefore done with the malafide intent of preventing official access to the guns, which were a vital part of the investigations. Further, the claims of Khans in the court that they were never asked to submit their weapons are completely false. As per RTI information, PN Wagh, the then divisional manager of FDCM, had met the Khans at Parwa forest rest house the morning after Avni was shot, on November 3, 2018, and he asked them to submit weapons. They said the arms were at Umri rest house. When Wagh went to Umri, the duo had already left. To several written communications by FDCM, the Khans said as the tigress was already dead, there was no need to give the weapons. The petitioner NGO also claimed that forensic report belies the claim of an attempt to tranquillize T1. The forensic report of T1 on December 6, 2018, revealed that the tranquillizing drug was found only at the site of the darting. However, no traces of the tranquillizing drugs were found in the body parts of the tigress. The lack of tranquillizing drugs in the blood or organs of T1 indicates that the dart was injected after death, with malafide intent to simulate a darting attempt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/avni-shooter-forged-arms-licence-appoint-sit-to-probe-petitioner-ngo/articleshow/85412710.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Joshi said issues of Punjab should be resolved within Punjab and not from Delhi. “In BJP, all the significant decisions are taken in Delhi even the decision with regards to the farmer’s issues has to come from Delhi, and so is the case with Congress whose leaders make errands to Delhi if they have any issue. Everyone saw Captain Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu rushing to Delhi in the recent past since the decision is to be taken from there and so is the case of AAP. So, I “I observed that SAD is a regional party that takes decisions for Punjab from within Punjab,” he said. After being expelled from the party, Joshi was trying to find a political ground for himself especially at Amristar-North assembly constituency where he had won assembly elections on two occasions and lost once. Sources said with AAP fielding former IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh from Amritsar North assembly constituency, the road to victory wouldn’t be easy for Joshi, which might force him to change the constituency. Joshi had accused three prominent Akali leaders hailing from Amritsar and Tarn Taran in 2015 for allegedly orchestrating an attack on his brother Raja Joshi and had publicly announced that SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal would be responsible if anything happened to his family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/joshi-expelled-by-bjp-after-speaking-for-farmers-protest-hints-at-sad-proximity/articleshow/85412808.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Aurangabad||Marathwada: 14 revenue circles get good rain for second consecutive day||AURANGABAD: Monsoon showers have returned to Marathwada with 14 revenue circles, including Aurangabad, receiving good rainfall for the second consecutive day. More than 65mm rainfall was recorded in a 24-hour period that ended on Tuesday morning. Eight circles in the Aurangabad district, four in Beed district, and two circles in Jalna district received heavy rainfall, bringing some relief for the farming community. In Aurangabad district, Balanagar (124mm) and Pachod (98mm) circles of the Paithan taluka received good rainfall. The Georail circle (85mm) in Beed district, and the Jamkhed circle (84mm) in Jalan district are among the areas that reported good rainfall activity, revealed the official data. The Marathwada region, comprising eight districts, reported an average 16mm rainfall in the 24-hour period ending Tuesday morning. The Aurangabad district recorded the highest rainfall (30mm), followed by Jalna (26mm), Hingoli (18mm), Nanded (17mm), Beed (16mm), Parbhani (9mm), Latur (7mm), and Osmanabad (4mm). The latest showers have reduced the August monsoon deficit to 65%, whereas the region, overall, has received 118% of the normal rainfall since June 1, shows the official data. Experts at the Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University said the revival of the monsoon has given a new lease of life to the kharif crops in the region. “Crops such as soyabean, maize and cotton are still in the growth or flowering stages in many parts of the region, whereas green gram and black gram crops have reached the harvesting stage. No doubt the dry spell of almost three weeks has caused some stress on the crops, but the recovery is possible due to the revival of the monsoon now — barring in 5-10% of cultivation areas where the damage may have been irrevocable,” said K K Dakhore, the agricultural meteorologist at the university, on Tuesday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has made a forecast of heavy rainfall for the next 24 hours in Aurangabad and some other parts of Marathwada, followed by the possibility of moderate showers over the subsequent 24-hour period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/marathwada-14-revenue-circles-get-good-rain-for-2nd-consecutive-day/articleshow/85410115.cms||---

Justice PB Suresh Kumar issued the order on a petition by a 28-year-old woman from Ernakulam who was 22 weeks pregnant. She approached the court as the outer limit of 12 weeks for MTP prescribed under MTP Act is over and hospitals are insisting for a court order. The petitioner contended that continuing with the pregnancy would involve risk to her life and that there is a substantial risk that the child will be born with physical and mental abnormalities. The foetus was diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome. The petitioner had mild mental retardation, visual disturbances, seizures, and weakness of the left lower limb with a permanent disability of 55%. In the judgment, the court held that even though the medical board has opined that Klinefelter syndrome is not a life-threatening disorder, continuation of the pregnancy would involve injury to the physical and mental health of the mother. As per Section 2 of MTP Act, termination of pregnancy beyond 12 weeks is allowed if a medical board is of the opinion that continuation of the pregnancy poses a risk to the life of the woman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health. MTP can also be allowed if there is a substantial risk that the child would be born with such physical or mental abnormalities to be seriously handicapped. While deciding on MTP on the above reasons, a court can consider the pregnant woman’s actual or reasonable foreseeable environment as per Section 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-allows-mtp-for-woman-with-mental-retardation/articleshow/85412826.cms||---

The exports had previously reached a high of 112 lakh bales in 2013-14, said industry players. Being the largest producer of cotton in India, Gujarat’s contribution to the total exports has been 40-45%. The Cotton Association of India (CAI) recently raised its estimate for India’s cotton exports by 5 lakh bales based on export shipment bookings data provided by the exporters. The apex body of the Indian cotton trade has now pegged the exports at 77 lakh bales, which will be 54% higher than the 50 lakh bales exported in the cotton season of 2019-20. About 70 lakh bales were already shipped as on July 31. According to the CAI data, the cotton exports from the country stood at 42 lakh bales, 69 lakh bales, 63 lakh bales, and 72 lakh bales in fiscals 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Strong demand coupled with low price of Indian cotton in the international market pushed up cotton exports. “There was strong demand for our cotton from Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia, and China,” said Arun Dalal, a city-based cotton broker. The Indian cotton prices remained Rs 2,000-2,500 per candy (one candy weighs 356kg), which were lower than the international prices throughout the year. “The cotton offtake from overseas buyers increased following strong demand for cotton yarn, which offered good margins to yarn manufacturers,” said Nirav Patel, a cotton exporter. “As our cotton was cheaper, importers turned to India for cotton imports.” The surge in demand, however, has increased cotton prices with export quality cotton ruling at Rs 55,000 to Rs 56,000 per candy, said industry players. CAI has projected 93.50 lakh bales of cotton output for Gujarat for 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cotton-exports-set-to-touch-7-year-high/articleshow/85412828.cms||---

Goa have signed the best strikers in the Indian Super League (ISL) with three Golden Boots being won by their players in the last four years. Ferran Corominas, of course, remains unmatched, and his replacement, Igor Angulo, lived up to the billing by finishing as the top-scorer last season. Angulo landed in Goa with a big reputation. He had won the Golden Boot in Ekstraklasa, the Polish top-tier league, and was consistently among the leading goal-scorers. Cabrera also lands here from Poland but his numbers are far from convincing. Last season, for example, he scored just five and had a poor season by his standards at Wisla Plock. So why are Goa betting big on this Spanish striker? “You have to give the club and the scouting team the benefit of doubt,” said the club’s director of football Ravi Puskur. “We looked at Airam not just in terms of numbers but also what he can do on the pitch. We identified him three years ago but never had the opportunity to have a professional discussion. He’s extremely hungry and will be the right fit for us.” Cabrera admits the last two seasons have not been the most fruitful of his career. There are, he says, always “ups and downs,” but has been left in no doubt that he will deliver on his promise. “It’s not a secret that I did not score a lot during the last two seasons. I did not play the way I wanted, but there are always ups and downs. You have to be prepared. I want to show everyone who is Airam Cabrera again. I am hungry due to the lack of success in the last two seasons,” Cabrera told TOI during an online media interaction on Wednesday. Cabrera, 33, is no stranger to Indian football. Clubs have tried, without success, to sign him in the past and he has several friends who have done duty for ISL clubs. ISL champion Javi Hernandez, now at Odisha FC, is among his closest friends and helped make up his mind. ‘Javi Hernandez is a good friend and he told me that FC Goa has the perfect style of play for my skills. Last season, the team played a style which was totally opposite to what I prefer. It was good speaking with Javi and then I had a word with Ivan (Gonzalez) too,” said Cabrera. Besides Javi and Ivan, Cabrera should know Juan Ferrando too. After all, the Goa coach tried to sign the former Villarreal forward during his time in Greece. “There is some synchrony in what we are trying to achieve,” said Puskur. Even though Goa were convinced, Cabrera took more time than he would have liked to decide on a move to India. It was personal, he says, largely due to his pregnant wife. “One thing for sure, the club really cared for me. Finally, I am here,” said Cabrera, who was the top scorer in the Spanish third division in 2008-09. Now that Goa have put all their eggs in the Cabrera basket, what can everyone expect? Another Golden Boot, like Coro and Angulo before him? “I don’t want people to say I am the new Angulo or new Coro. We are all different players. I have big respect for them. I know them really well. I am here to help Goa and give the coach whatever he wants of me. I don’t care about the numbers (goals). “Goals will come. This is a new country, but your skills don’t change. All that we have to do is adapt to your teammates, culture and the country. That’s my target,” said Cabrera.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-am-here-to-show-everyone-who-is-airam-cabrera/articleshow/85440373.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

In the petition, Keshav Prabhu, who heads the 14 freedom fighters, said that they have got an answer once from the central government that they have been offered one-time financial assistance, which they declined to accept. He said that they petitioned the Goa government as the one-time financial assistance of Rs 25,000 offered to them is not acceptable considering their contribution. Stating that they should be reconsidered for pension under the Freedom Fighters Welfare Rules, 1988, Prabhu said that they don’t mind if the arrears is not paid but it should be in the form of monthly pension. For this, we are anxiously waiting for the sanction order from the state government, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/14-freedom-fighters-petition-govt-on-pension/articleshow/85414858.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Shah’s team weighs in for Bandi’s padayatra success||Hyderabad: After suffering setbacks in Nagarjunasagar assembly byelection and graduate MLC polls in Telangana, the BJP central leadership wants state party chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar’s padayatra to set the tone for Huzurabad bypoll and next assembly elections in the state. Union home minister Amit Shah himself is closely monitoring Sanjay’s padayatra, which will begin in a week’s (August 24) time. A 15-member team of Shah’s election strategists has already landed in Hyderabad. The team will not only oversee the padayatra but also ensure that the party benefits the most from the walkathon’s ground-level response. During the recent West Bengal elections, the same team was part of the BJP’s poll planning and strategising. The team has been working with Shah since 2013 and was also involved in the party’s gameplan for the parliamentary elections. Sources said the team has already started talking to state BJP leaders who are involved in the padayatra’s planning. “Its members are not from the BJP. They are specialists who will provide us with inputs on how to make the padayatra popular and successful,” sources said. On the padayatra route map and schedule, the team is incorporating feedback from local leaders. The team’s first stop will be Sanjay’s meeting at Golconda during his padayatra. Originally, the padayatra was planned for two to three months, but the national leadership wanted it to last till the next assembly election. “In the initial phase, the padayatra will be undertaken for 40 days. It will also pass through poll-bound Huzurabad depending on the election notification,” A Rakesh Reddy, party spokesperson, told TOI. About 40 teams of local rank and file and leaders have been deployed across the state for the padayatra, while Shah’s team will provide guidance, he said. BJP national president JP Nadda and Union minister Smriti Irani will join Sanjay in his public meetings during the padayatra. “The plan is to have one national leader taking part in the padayatra every week,” a senior leader said. In the last year’s GHMC elections, the party leadership had sent Union minister Bhupender Yadav to oversee the election strategy. Yadav was party’s Bihar election committee chief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shahs-team-weighs-in-for-bandis-padayatra-success/articleshow/85415467.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The family was away. The “spiderman thief”, 25-year-old Mukhtar Ali alias Mausam has been arrested and remanded in police custody. Investigators have recovered stolen ornaments worth Rs 7 lakh from him. The businessman, who is in the stock clearing businesses at CST railway station, approached the V P Road police on August 5. He said he had left for Bihar after hearing about a bereavement in his family on July 22. When he returned, he found the Kumbharwada flat’s safety door open, and soon discovered the theft of cash and gold ornaments worth Rs 12 lakh. DCP Rajiv Jain formed a team led by senior inspector Hemant Bhaudhankar and sub-inspector Dilip Tambe to crack the case. They found renovation work was underway in the building and a bamboo scaffolding had been erected all around the building till the sixth floor. “Though the building has CCTV cameras, it had backup for only seven days. We checked with the building but couldn’t get CCTV footage of the time of the incident,” said an officer. Failed by technology, the police turned to good old detecting. They began questioning the family closely. At one time, the businessman said he had set out to renovate his flat before the building’s refurbishment and one Mausam had undertaken the work. He remembered that they had told Mausam about their impending departure for Bihar. Moreover, before leaving, the complainant’s wife had paid him Rs 10,000 as part-remuneration. He had apparently keenly watched the notes being taken out of a bundle by her. “With this information, we began work to trace Mausam, who had not reported to complete his work. We got his location in the area while he was searching for work and arrested him,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-spiderman-thief-scales-10-floors-to-rob-rs-12l-arrested/articleshow/85412840.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The bench of Justice Prakash D Naik pronounced the operative part of its order before the representing lawyers. A full text of the order, including the conditions of bail for Hemanti, would be released in due course. The order was not uploaded on the high court (HC) website till 9pm on Tuesday. Special public prosecutor Pravin Chavan told TOI, “The court has exercised its discretionary powers under Section 437 of the Code of Criminal Procedure while granting bail to Hemanti, primarily on the grounds of the accused being a woman of old age and spending more than three-and-a-half years in jail.” He said, “In case of DSK, the court primarily held that the crime was of serious nature and prima facie he seemed to have played an active role and participated in all irregularities.” Lawyer Aashutosh Srivastava, who appeared for the Kulkarnis, had cited the couple’s old age, especially in the wake of the pandemic, and the fact that they had spent more than half of the seven-year jail term if they were found guilty. Since October 28, 2017, when the first complaint was lodged against DSK, the city police have acted against DSK, Hemanti, his son, Shirish, sister-in-law Anuradha Purandare and 15 others, including three serving and a retired senior official of a nationalised bank. The bank officials were later discharged from the case. Of the remaining 15 people, Hemanti and seven others have secured regular or pre-arrest bails.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hc-rejects-dsks-bail-plea-grants-relief-to-wife/articleshow/85410208.cms||Vishwas Kothari

This will also be in the larger interest of commuters, the union stated in its petition. Taxi union leader A L Quadros said that taxis played a key role on feeder routes outside some of the railway stations that lead to office hubs including Colaba, Nariman Point, Cuffe Parade and Kamala Mills. “Those driving the iconic kaali peeli taxis of Mumbai have incurred huge losses to the tune of 70% drop in earnings over the past couple of months,” he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-taxi-union-wants-2-passenger-rule-to-be-withdrawn/articleshow/85412905.cms||Somit Sen

Sepoy Balwant Singh was inducted into the 3/1 Punjab Regiment in 1943. During a attack in Italy on December 15, 1944, his left leg was blown off in a mine blast. He became invalid and left service in 1946 with basic disability pension after being transferred to Rajputana Rifles. In 1972, the Centre made a provision to grant war injury pension to all those who suffered injuries during various wars, but denied the same to those who suffered injuries during the World Wars. The war veteran’s case has been in the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT), Jaipur, since 2010, but has not yet reached a conclusion. Recently, in a similar case, the Lucknow AFT had ordered a war disability pension to be given to another soldier injured during World War II. Hailing from Gidaniya village in Jhunjhunu district, Balwant Singh was transferred to Rajputana Rifles after the injury before he was discharged from the forces. His legal counsel Colonel S B Singh (retd) told TOI, “The government made a provision for war disability pension, which is 100% of the last drawn salary to be given to those injured in battles post 1947 and Indian soldiers who fought in the World Wars. Balwant Singh’s disability is 100% as he lost his left leg. But since there is no judge in the AFT, the case is pending. The normal disability pension is just 30% of the usual pension, but he should be granted the war disability pension as was done by the Lucknow AFT in the case of a soldier from Garhwal.”The war veteran left service on May 11, 1946, after a service of three years, two months and 16 days with disability pension. Claiming that the family received no help from the state government, the veteran’s son Subhash Singh said, “We stayed in the village and did not know anything about the pension for those injured in wars. We only realised it after the Kargil War. However, the court said my father, who is one of the oldest persons still alive from Rajasthan and fought in World War II, is not eligible for the war disability pension. The case has been in court and we hope that his contribution is recognised by the legal system so that he gets the war disability pension."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/97-year-old-wwii-veteran-still-awaiting-war-disability-pension/articleshow/85414865.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

---||Vijayawada||Telangana members may be axed by Andhra Pradesh in Tirupati temple board||TIRUPATI: Ripples of the battle over Krishna river water between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana may soon reach the doorstep of the country’s richest temple trust, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD). Sources say that the Andhra Pradesh government is planning to reduce representation from Telangana in the prestigious trust board. Though there is no rule on giving representation to neighbouring states, the state government as a gesture of goodwill, has been nominating politicians, industrialists, business magnates and religious leaders from Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other states as members to the board. Sources added that the river water war is one reason for reducing Telangana’s membership. The other reason is the pressure on the ruling YSRCP leadership to increase nominations from AP. Besides, there will be no BJP representative this time as party state president Somu Veerraju told TOI that they would also not recommend anyone to the board. The previous board, constituted in June 2019, had 36 members. The number later went up to 37 with the nomination of YSRCP legislator Malladi Vishnu. The government named nine VIPs from Telangana, including My Home Group chairman Jupally Rameshwar Rao, Hetero Drugs chairman B Parthasaradhi Reddy and chairman and managing director of Kaveri Seeds Gundavaram Venkata Bhaskar Rao among others. Other states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka got five nominations each, Delhi and Maharashtra two each and Odisha one member. With the battle over Krishna river water between the two states intensifying, Telangana government and an activist from Telangana had approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) alleging violation of environment rules and contempt of court on the proposed Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS) that would double the off-take of Krishna water from Srisailam reservoir. Consequently, the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) had inspected the site and submitted a report to the NGT alleging works in excess of what was needed to prepare a detailed project report (DPR). The AP government earlier this month nominated the chairman to the trust board. It will soon nominate members. Former MP YV Subba Reddy, who is also an uncle of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, was renominated to the board. There was a bonhomie between AP and Telangana when the TTD board was last constituted and thus the sister Telugu state got the lion’s share of nine members - a whopping 25 per cent of the board strength. This is against AP’s strength of 10, excluding the three ex-officio members. Now in the changed scenario, Telangana is unlikely to get the same preferential treatment that it got last time, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-may-pare-down-members-from-telangana-in-ttd-board/articleshow/85415489.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Volunteers from ‘Rang De’ led by Rangrao Desai went around Raichur on Sunday, stopping pedestrians, cyclists, motorists and shoppers, and asking them to identify on the cover of a book the freedom fighter adorning it. These were freedom fighters unlikely to find mention in school textbooks – Rani Abakka, Ballari Raghava, Sangolli Rayanna, among others. The team was eager to educate Raichur residents about the invaluable contribution to the freedom movement of these obscure heroes. Desai told TOI, “These are heroes, the exploits of whom have not been discussed much in our textbooks. I thought that educating the locals about these heroes would be an ideal way of celebrating Independence Day.” Working in teams of six, the volunteers went around Raichur, and asked those on the road about the freedom fighters.

The assault permanently damaged one of the cat’s legs, leaving it crippled. The Maninagar police have registered a case of mischief by killing or maiming animal against the accused identified as Narendra Kanani. Deepa Joshi, a 45-year-old who runs an non-governmental animal rescue and welfare centre, registered a police complaint against Kanani on Tuesday. She said that she received a video on August 4 in which Kanani is seen attaking a stray cat on the third floor of his apartment in Maninagar. She told police that another resident, Yash, objected to the attack but Kanani threatened him and asked him to take whatever action he wished. Based on the video, Joshi lodged a complaint under IPC Section 428 (mischief by killing or maiming animal) and 506 (criminal intimidation). However, no reasons for the delay in lodging the complaint has been mentioned in the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/maninagar-man-attacks-cripples-cat/articleshow/85412867.cms||---

The activists who were alerted about the puppies by locals rushed to spot and found the mother dog pacing around a manhole in which the five puppies were trapped. “We had to hire a few workers to dig a bigger hole near the manhole, cut the iron rods under the surface and then get into the drain to rescue the puppies. I had to be quick because there was not much oxygen in the drain. While the entire operation took over an hour, I made sure that I wasted no time once I got inside the drain,” said Pradeep Nair of Animal Warriors Conservation Society. In the video, Nair was seen using a torch to locate the puppies in the drain and carefully rescuing the puppies and reuniting them with the mother dog. “Our team is well trained, and we spend a great deal of time researching and learning about techniques to retrieve different types of animals not just in Hyderabad but also other districts in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh,” said Nair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/five-puppies-rescued-from-manhole-in-shaikpet/articleshow/85412942.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks status report from police on probe into 9-year-old girl’s murder||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked police to inform it about the status of investigation into the alleged rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl in southwest Delhi. Justice Yogesh Khanna, who was hearing a plea by the parents of the victim to set up a special investigation team (SIT) for a court-monitored probe, directed police to file the status report while posting the matter for November. The court refused to interfere at this juncture after standing counsel Sanjay Lao, appearing for the state, said an SIT had been constituted after the case was transferred from the local police station to Crime Branch. He added that two accused persons had confessed and provisions for murder and rape under Indian Penal Code, stringent Section 6 under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012, and offences under Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 had been added to the FIR. Round-the-clock security has also been provided to the parents, police informed the court, replying to one of the prayers in the petition. The court observed that in view of the state’s stand, the prayers in the petition seemed to have been answered. “The investigation is at a nascent stage. We can’t direct judicial inquiry at this stage,” the judge pointed out. “When they have constituted the SIT, let them do their work. You can’t presuppose (the outcome).” The parents of the deceased child have stated they have “no faith in the present investigation”. Advocate Jitendra Kumar Jha, appearing for the parents, said, “What type of SIT has been constituted? Nine days after the incident, police moved the application of custodial interrogation of the accused. What is this type of investigation by the so-called SIT?” The plea also sought adequate safety and security to other witnesses along with a judicial inquiry into the lapses on the administrative front to reveal the reason behind the delay in police response and “why no vital evidence was preserved”. The parents alleged the “total focus of police was to hush up/sabotage the case” and they were “tortured and pressured by police and its agent to compromise the case”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-status-report-from-police-on-probe-into-9-yr-old-girls-murder/articleshow/85412982.cms||Abhinav Garg

The 541.4m bridge commissioned in June 19, 1976, is peppered with potholes and craters at more than a dozen spots. Vehicles with pregnant women and senior citizens are forced to take a detour due to the bumpy ride. The last major maintenance work was carried out in November 2015 spending more than Rs 1 crore. But, the craters between two spans of the bridge are reappearing.“Two-wheel riders who have back pain and health issues are not taking the route, but private buses speed through the potholes on the bridge. A proper overhauling is urgently needed,” P Aiyarappan, president, Road Users’ Welfare Organisation, said. For almost a year now, the state highways department has maintained that they will refurbish the bridge, but nothing has been done so far. The bearings made of steel and rubber on the bridge decks were not replaced ever since the bridge was commissioned.Also, the strip-seal expansion joints between the two adjacent decks often come off, resulting in a horizontal crater. Last year, there was a proposal to refurbish the bridge at a cost of Rs 6 crore. But the proposal, which included replacement of bearings and pier protection, was a non-starter. In the last five years, even as the bridge witnessed maintenance work more than five times, the problems continue. “A proposal is submitted to overhaul the bridge completely. Vehicular movement has to be suspended to commence the work once we get the administrative sanction,” a senior state highways department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/repair-works-yet-to-be-taken-up-on-pothole-riddled-cauvery-bridge/articleshow/85412936.cms||Deepak Karthik

At least nine silencers have been stolen by the accused. With the arrest, two cases filed at the Kandivli police station were solved. “In July, two citizens came up to us in separate instances to complain about silencers being stolen from their vehicles,” said senior inspector Babasaheb Salunkhe. The thieves would surveil vehicles before choosing a target and dismantle its silencer. They would sell the silencers to a middleman who handed them to an individual who extracted platinum from the metal. The police have arrested three people— Mushtaq Khan, Jabbar Hussain and Sujit Yadav—but are yet to find the end customer. Khan was the mastermind and Hussain the middleman, police said.

The suspects have been identified as Nitin Jagtap of Kopargaon, Akib Maniyar, Mohammed Salem Qureshi and Naser Shaikh — all from Sangamner. Inspector Sandeep Gurme said, “It was in the early hours of August 11 that the suspects, driving an SUV, waylaid the truck and kidnapped the driver.” The driver identified as Umesh Sonawne of Wafegaon in Solapur district had loaded 19.50 tonne of steel rods from two different places and was heading to Pune when his truck was waylaid near Deogiri Forging Company of the Waluj area. The driver’s hands were tied and eyes were blindfolded before he was taken several kilometres on the Dhule highway where he was dropped. It was after he was spotted by some commuters, his hands were untied, following which he alerted the transporter who got him the booking for transporting the rods. Accordingly, an offence was registered against unidentified suspects on the charges of dacoity, robbery, kidnapping, wrongful restrain and for dishonestly receiving stolen property. Inspector Gurme said that the stolen truck was traced in Nashik district’s Gothi while the steel was recovered from Kopargaon-based place owned by Jagtap and Sangamner-based place owned by Shaikh. Police have also seized two vehicles that were used for illegally transporting the robbed steel from one place to another.

---||Aurangabad||Indiscriminate tree cutting at Savangi dam||Aurangabad: The Savangi dam, located on the outskirts of Aurangabad city, has witnessed an indiscriminate felling of trees that has causing huge ecological damage. A spot-visit to the water body on Monday revealed that many large and medium-sized Babul and other trees, which were growing on either side of the lake wall, had been cut. Known for its diverse bird population and healthy biodiversity, the Savangi dam's ecology is already under threat due to the municipal solid waste plant coming up in its vicinity. The waste plant has led to construction activity on a large area near the dam. Notably, turtle lake and red-necked falcons among other rare bird species have been spotted at the Savangi dam. However, many of these winged creatures have lost their roosting and nesting spaces due to the cutting of trees. Environment activist Prashant Gire said it is painful to see that the trees are being cut in an indiscriminate manner without any official action. “The civic administration should not become a mute spectator to such large-scale loss of trees. The authorities concerned should swing into action and invoke legal action against culprits,” said Gire, who is also the founder of NGO Jansahyog that is engaged in increasing green-cover in Aurangabad. Some local residents, preferring anonymity, said certain elements who have received the contract for fishing inside the Savangi dam could be behind the axing of the trees. Some wood was found stored inside the illegal shed constructed on the wall of the lake by these elements. The wood is purportedly from the axed trees. When contacted, Vijay Patil, the garden superintendent of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said he would visit the Savangi dam on Wednesday. “We will inspect the site and try to track down the culprits involved in cutting of trees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/indiscriminate-tree-cutting-at-savangi-dam/articleshow/85410264.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Trichy||Trichy district to focus on four rural blocks with low turnout for vaccination||Trichy: At least four rural administrative blocks in Trichy district have low vaccination record with only less than 30% of the eligible population getting vaccinated against Covid-19. Taking note of the vaccination data of the 14 rural blocks and Trichy city compiled as of August 16, the health department plans to give special focus to Lalgudi, Manachanallur, Marungapuri and Thottiam blocks.Out of the 20.9 lakh people above 18 years of age who are eligible to take the jab, Trichy district has so far vaccinated 37% while 9% have taken both the jabs. Rural blocks are witnessing a poor turnout according to the health department data. While Thiruverumbur, Manikandam, Musiri, T Pettai and Uppiliapuram managed to cover 33% to 37% of the eligible population, several blocks are yet to gain such a pace. Residents in Lalgudi claimed that adequate camps were not organised and publicised in their localities. Lalgudi has covered only 24% of its eligible residents while Manachanallur covered 23% and Marungapuri and Thottiam 28%. Rural residents said they don’t get to know the locations of vaccinations camps well in advance. However, vaccination hesitancy cannot be ruled out as one of the reasons for the low coverage. “Health officials can consider holding mobile camps at MGNREGA sites and group housing areas. But they need to sensitise people as there is hesitancy too,” B Boopathi, a resident of Nagamangalam village said.Andhanallur and Pullambadi blocks require emphasis since the coverage is mediocre. Though Trichy corporation has covered 50% of its eligible population, about 10% of those who were accounted under the city might be from other blocks and districts, corporation officials said. The vaccination drives held on the MGMGH campus that covered a section of the rural population were also added. “Based on the data, we will allocate vaccines to the blocks that have poor vaccination coverage records. Camps will be decentralised further in rural blocks and the locations will be publicised widely. As awareness is lacking in a few rural blocks, sensitisation drives will be held,” a senior official with the health department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-district-to-focus-on-four-rural-blocks-with-low-turnout-for-vaccination/articleshow/85412911.cms||Deepak Karthik

Most jewellery merchants employ workers skilled in dealing with gold jewellery and from different states like Kerala, West Bengal, Telangana and AP. “Trust is an important and key component in working at an AHC. Over 1,000 to 1,500 employees are working in 29 AHCs in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad and they will be unemployed due to the notices,” said a gold jewellery merchant. Further, transporting the ornaments to the ORR faces the risk of thefts. “It is our responsibility to return the jewellery to the customer safely with the hallmark and we are not in a position to take such huge risks,” said the owner of an AHC at Pot Market in Secunderabad.“The government can implement the GO 20 with amendments instead of issuing notices, which is creating a problem,” said a gold merchant in Panjagutta. The Indian Association of Hallmarking Centres also demanded the central government to make an amendment to GO 20 issued in 2013 by the industries and commerce department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-pcb-notices-ahc-staff-stand-to-lose-jobs/articleshow/85412972.cms||Sunil Mungara

Wildlife enthusiast Waseem Quadri, who sighted the bird recently, said the spotting of red-necked falcon at Savangi dam was total surprise for him. “While Savangi dam and its outskirts area is home to many resident and migratory birds, red-necked falcon was not seen here in past few years. It was sheer excitement to spot the bird as it is one of the most sought-after birds after the iconic Amur falcon,” he said. While red-necked falcons are known to live and hunt in pairs, Quadri, could not trace only bird. “It was almost a dusk when I was returning from a birding trip at Savangi dam. I could not see a pair of Red-necked falcon despite frantic search,” he said. Known for his fast and direct flight especially during making a kill the red-necked falcon is considered as ‘near threatened’ bird due to decline in population. Distributed up to Himalayan foothills and in some of the neighbouring countries of India, this falcon feeds of wide variety of small birds. The sighting of the red-necked falcon at Savangi dam has called for the need of conservation of the lake and biodiversity situated around it. “The lake comes under the jurisdiction of the local civic body and must be protected from tree-cutting, illegal fishing, and water pollution due to harmful pesticides and insecticides used during the wetland farming,” Quadri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/red-necked-falcon-spotted-at-savangi-dam/articleshow/85410298.cms||Prasad Joshi

One policeman was deployed at each of these fuel stations to prevent untoward incidents. A couple of employees of the fuel stations were also positioned at the entrances to stop the helmetless bikers. ACP Seetaram Gaikwad, of the city traffic branch, said some helmetless bikers did purchase petrol after filling their details in special forms made available at the petrol pumps. “These forms would first go to the traffic units, where verification would be done to find out why the bikers concerned were not wearing helmets. If the reasons are not valid, then the forms would reach the city traffic branch. From there, proposals would go to the regional transport office (RTO) to suspend the licences of the particular motorist for a particular period,” added Gaikwad. The exact number of helmetless bikers who filled the forms could not be known till the evening. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal had kicked off the campaign on Sunday on the occasion of Independence Day with an appeal to motorists to wear helmets. Police commissioner Deepak Pandey said that Nashik would be the first city where petrol pumps are not giving fuel to bikers without helmets. If this project is successful in Nashik city, it could also be tried out in other parts of the country. Petrol pump workers were not allowing helmetless bikers entry. Given the police bandobast and the requirement to fill the form, most helmetless bikers did not insist they be allowed to purchase fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-helmet-no-petrol-drive-takes-off-smoothly-in-nashik-city/articleshow/85378799.cms||Santosh Sonawane

On Tuesday, many parts of the city recorded up to 11 mm of rain as the cloud overcast brought down the maximum temperature to 24 degree Celsius, which is four degree Celsius below normal. The minimum temperature was normal at 22.2 degree Celsius. The city experienced wind speed of 10-16 kmph and relative humidity of 91 per cent. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad, the rain-bearing systems are likely to move westwards and northwestwards in the next 24 hours triggering fairly widespread heavy rains and flash floods in many northern districts of Telangana such as Bhadadri Kothagudem, Mulugu, Nizamabad, Nirmal, Kamareddy etc. The flash flood guidance report released by IMD, Hyderabad indicated that watersheds (catchment areas) in many districts have already reached their saturation levels, posing a threat of flash floods. Maximum temperature dipped to 24 degree Celsius on Tuesday“The land surface model is showing 100 per cent saturation of many watersheds in the districts of Bhadadri Kothagudem, Khammam, Mahabubabad, Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Mulugu and 85 per cent in few watersheds in districts of Nalgonda, Suryapet, Kamareddy, Komaram Bheem and Mancherial districts,” read the report. The IMD has put coastal Andhra Pradesh and northern districts of Telangana under a yellow alert till August 20. The advisory urges people to ‘be aware’ of the local weather situation. “In the past 24 hours, some places in districts such as Komaram Bheem, Suryapet, Khammam recorded up to 138 mm of rains. Under the influence of the low pressure area and cyclonic circulation, heavy to very heavy rains can be expected in isolated pockets of the northern districts of Telangana over the next 24 hours,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, IMD, Hyderabad. As per IMD rainfall figures from June 1 till date, Telangana has recorded 25 per cent of excess rains by recording 620.1 mm of rainfall as against normal of 496.4 mm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-records-up-to-11mm-rain-after-monsoon-break/articleshow/85413000.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: New cargo terminal to begin operation in September||AHMEDABAD: If all goes as planned, the new cargo terminal which is in the final stages of being ready, will be operational at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad by the first week of September. With the expansion of the cargo terminal, the city airport will begin to handle more volumes of international cargo besides domestic supplies. This will be SVPI airport’s second major infrastructure development project after its takeover by Adani Airports in November 2020. “The new terminal is built over a land parcel of 1,500 square metres within the SVPI airport campus. An old terminal building i.e. Terminal-III which was feebly used earlier, has now been augmented with the cargo terminal to expand the space. The construction and finishing of the building is over. Certain approvals are expected soon after which the new terminal will be operationalized,” confirmed a well-placed source. The city airport handles an estimated 50,000 metric tonnes of international cargo every year, according to estimates provided by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex. Gujarat being a manufacturing-heavy state involves movement of a variety of import-export shipments ranging from raw materials to finished goods including pharmaceutical products, chemicals, textiles, agriculture produce, electronics, precious metals, medical devices and related equipment among others. A source privy to the development also said that the new terminal will have updated security in place along with modern equipment to supplement handling of large volumes of cargo more effectively. “A bigger terminal with greater cargo-handling capacity will help reduce turnaround time for handling and clearing shipments. This in turn will provide a major boost to the industries based in Gujarat,” said Samir Mankad, CEO, GSEL, which manages the Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex. Some 60,749 MT of air cargo was handled at SVPI airport in Ahmedabad in FY 2020-21. This was at least 41% less than 1.03 lakh MT handled in the preceding year. “Such reduction in handling cargo volume was due to the pandemic when demand and industrial production both took a hit due to the lockdown. However, being at the centre of various manufacturing clusters in the state, the growth potential of cargo handling is buoyant in Gujarat, making an increase in cargo-handling capacity inevitable,” Mankad further said. Flights ferrying Haj pilgrims typically operated via Terminal-III. Sources confirmed that when the flights begin next season, an alternate arrangement will be made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-cargo-terminal-to-begin-op-in-sep/articleshow/85412965.cms||Niyati Parikh

Home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali also held a meeting with senior Hyderabad police regarding the case. Officials said that a lab technician, who is a distant relative of the complainant, and four security guards at the Gandhi hospital were being questioned. The complainant was sent for medical examination while a team of policemen is on the look out for the missing woman who is the patient’s wife. The woman, in her complaint to the police on Monday, claimed that her brother-in-law was admitted to the hospital a few days ago. Three people — the patient’s wife, another person and the complainant — had come to Gandhi Hospital as attendants. But four days prior to his discharge, the patient’s wife and the complainant went missing on August 13. As a result, the patient called his son to the hospital who took him to Mahabubnagar district. On Sunday, the patient’s son returned to Gandhi Hospital in search of his missing mother and maternal aunt. He found his aunt at the hospital, where she claimed that she was raped.

TSPCB, Hyderabad, environmental engineer M Dayanand confirmed to TOI about the notices. “The notices were served on more than half a dozen AHCs in the twin cities to shift them outside ORR,” he said. The state might take a final decision on their relocation as gold jewellery merchants have represented to public representatives and the government, he added. Expressing anguish over the notices, Indian Association of Hallmarking Centres, Telangana chapter, urged the government to exempt AHCs and allow them to work as usual.“We are planning to meet municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD) minister KT Rama Rao. We will ask him to direct TSPCB not to mount pressure on them to shift as hundreds of workers and staff will lose their livelihood,” Indian Association of Hallmarking Centres, Telangana chapter, vice-president Sunil Agarwal told TOI. Recently, a few gold jewellers operating AHCs met PCB chairman Rajiv Sharma and sought his intervention to withdraw the PCB notices. “He positively responded and promised to discuss the issue with the industries department,” an AHC representative said. The association members also met Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, who promised to take the issue to the notice of KTR. The gold jewellery merchants have spent Rs 50-80 lakh to set up AHCs by procuring imported machinery. “Measures have been taken to prevent pollution while processing the precious metal and it will not cause health hazards too,” another merchant, who has been operating an AHC for more than a decade, said. Meanwhile, a Task Force (members of gold jewellery traders), which has been constituted to resolve major challenges in hallmarking implementation, has started chalking out plans to put pressure on the government to drop the relocation move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tspcb-orders-hallmarking-centres-to-move-out-of-city/articleshow/85412951.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Aurangabad||3 in 4 people in Aurangabad rural still to get first vaccine dose||AURANGABAD: Even after seven months of the launch of vaccination programme against Covid-19, three in four people from the target beneficiaries in rural areas of Aurangabad district have still not received the first dose of the vaccine. Of the target of over 21.11 lakh population, barely less than 23.35% have been vaccinated with the single dose so far. The total number of fully vaccinated population in rural areas of Aurangabad district (excluding municipal limits) is hardly 7.16%. Aurangabad district health officer Sudhakar Shelke on Tuesday said insufficient stock of doses was the reason behind lesser vaccine coverage in rural areas. “The rural areas of Aurangabad district are not getting vaccine doses in proportion with the population. The municipal limits of Aurangabad are getting more doses as compared to rural areas as the spread of Covid-19 was more in the former in the past,” he said. Health authorities said at least two-third of total vaccine supply received by Aurangabad district should be diverted towards rural areas. “It is not the case that there are no takers for vaccination programme in rural areas. If the supply is further increased as a policy decision, our vaccination coverage will improve gradually,” Shelke said, adding that the status of vaccination in his jurisdiction was in keeping with the state-level trend. The municipal limits of Aurangabad, which has a target population of 11.78 lakh for the ongoing vaccination programme, has inoculated 38.6% beneficiaries with the first dose with 16.2% population is fully vaccinated having received both the doses. With five fresh Covid cases in rural areas and two in municipal limits, the total number of actives cases of the viral disease in Aurangabad district has increased to 185. The district has registered over 1.47 lakh Covid cases during the current pandemic so far, including 3,523 deaths till Monday, it was said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/3-in-4-people-from-arangabad-rural-yet-to-get-1st-dose/articleshow/85410331.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad Cricket Association suspension case sent back to single judge by Telangana high court||HYDERABAD: In a fresh twist to the war within the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA), a division bench of Telangana high court on Tuesday set aside the interim order of a single judge nullifying expulsions made by HCA ombudsman and sent both the warring factions back to the single judge to thrash out the issues afresh. The HCA turf battle had landed in court after ombudsman Justice Deepak Verma suspended vice president John Manoj and four other office-bearers. The action was challenged by Manoj and the single judge stayed the suspensions. Subsequently, HCA president Mohammed Azharuddin, who had backed the appointment of Justice Verma, filed an appeal against the single judge order on the grounds that no reasons were given by the court. On Tuesday, a bench of Justice A Rajasheker Reddy and Justice Shameem Akther took up Azharuddin’s plea and set aside the interim order but ordered rehearing in front of the single judge. “As the matter is still pending before the single judge and is slated to be heard on Aug 23, both of you go there and put forward your arguments,” the bench said. The bench also directed the HCA apex council not to take any major decisions in the next 10 days. The ongoing league matches being conducted by HCA could go on, it said. The roots of the current tussle in the HCA can be attributed to the reforms aimed at cleansing cricket bodies in the states as suggested by Justice Lodha Committee. The warring factions in the HCA have gone to the extent of appointing rival ombudsmen and suspending each other from the HCA. A single judge had earlier found fault with the way a local cricket club challenged the appointment of Justice Verma as ombudsman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hca-suspension-case-sent-back-to-single-judge-by-t-high-court/articleshow/85413056.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Hyderabad||Telangana plan to rejig school staff gets flak||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government on Tuesday released guidelines to rationalise teaching staff in all state schools across districts based on enrolments at schools during the academic year 2019-20. The move, however, has been resisted by teachers who have questioned the rationale of picking a pre-pandemic year as reference. The government has now set up a committee for the task with the collector as chairman, while additional collector, chief executive officer of zilla parishad and project officer of Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) are members. The district education officer is the member secretary. “Surplus teachers shall be posted in vacancies notified through transfer,” read the GO Ms No. 25 issued on August 12 and made public on Tuesday. It further directed officials to ensure that this rationalisation did not create new posts or reduce the sanctioned ones. The teachers, meanwhile, have asked the state to postpone the process until admissions for the current academic year was completed. “It doesn’t make any sense to carry out rationalisation under the current circumstances. There are reports that many students from private schools are joining government ones this year. Further, once the schools physically reopen, the number of enrolments might go up further. So, how is the education department going to rationalise now using 2019-20? The process should be postponed,” said MLC A Narsiderddy. Chava Ravi, general secretary, United Teachers Federation, added: “There are other problems as well. Teacher transfer cannot be carried out unless cadre is released as per newly formed districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-plan-to-rejig-school-staff-gets-flak/articleshow/85413032.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Luxury cars often bought ‘second hand’ to evade taxes||HYDERABAD: Many of the luxury cars in the city were passed off as second-hand cars with a whole corrupt system in place to work out tax evasion and other cost benefits, officials said. Authorities say that more than a 1,000 luxury cars, which cost more than Rs 4 crore are plying in the city, even as enforcement authorities approach the Centre to chalk out a plan to nab more luxury cars plying in the state without paying taxes. Right from the Ferraris to the super expensive Rolls Royce Phantom, the city has a good number of these vehicles plying on the roads. The first ever seizure of luxury cars in the city was carried out two days ago when 15 cars were apprehended, of which 11 were found to be plying without paying road taxes. Imported luxury cars cost anywhere between Rs 5 crore and Rs 15 crore. However, all the cars caught by the enforcement wing of the Road Transport Authority were second hand cars with an average cost of Rs 4 crore. So how is the cost brought down by an average of Rs 2 crore depending on the overall cost of the car? Non-payment of life tax or registering in states where the taxes is minimal is one way, which almost all of the 11 vehicles seemed to have used. Another way is to buy the cars as second-hand vehicles, showing the overall reduction in invoice price. “Luxury cars is a totally different segment. Usually a person who can afford to buy a luxury car does not go for a second hand vehicle. While it is possible to get second hand cars for much cheaper, buyers prefer buying new one’s sourced from the right places which can be brought for much less than the original value as well. It is done by undervaluing the car and getting clearance through customs and evading road taxes,” explained an insider from the luxury cars industry. West Asia, incidentally, is the biggest exporter of these cars—many a times used barely for days before being put up for sale. Also, buyers of luxury cars like to rotate their cars often—almost every six months—which gives them another reason for evading taxes. “This section of buyers are usually the affluent and young. For them upgrading the car every few months is almost a given and hence many try to evade taxes as they don’t intend to keep them for long,” added another source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/luxury-cars-often-bought-second-hand-to-evade-taxes/articleshow/85413029.cms||Amrita Didyala

The new RTO will also have a state-of-the-art automated driving test track, which will be Delhi’s 10th. The RTO has been carved out of areas that came mainly under the jurisdictions of Dwarka and Janakpuri RTOs, apart from some areas of Rohini RTO. The RTOs at Dwarka and Janakpuri are among the busiest zonal offices of the transport department and applicants have to wait for a long period to get a slot for a test to get a permanent driving licence. According to sources, the new RTO, which will cater to areas of outer Delhi near Najafgarh, is expected to be inaugurated soon. “Residents of this part of the city had to go to either Dwarka or Janakpuri to get a driving licence and a separate RTO has been a long pending demand,” an official said. It will also mean less rush at both Dwarka and Janakpuri facilities. Officials said the infrastructure at Jharoda Kalan included a swank RTO building and an automated driving test track. The pandemic and a lack of adequate number of trained manpower delayed the opening, sources said. At present, automated driving test tracks are available at Sarai Kale Khan (South and Central zones), Loni Road (Northeast), Shakur Basti (Northwest), Rohini (Northwest-II), Dwarka (Southwest), Rajouri Garden (West-II), Burari (North), Mayur Vihar (East-I) and Surajmal Vihar (East-II). With the opening of the automated test track at Jharoda Kalan and completion of work at Lado Sarai and Hari Nagar, Delhi will have 12 automated tracks by next year. The transport department then plans to rope in another agency for maintenance and operations of these tracks. The last time Delhi got a new RTO was a decade ago when the Surajmal Vihar RTO was created to cater to east Delhi areas such as Shahdara, Anand Vihar, Vishwas Nagar. Delhi’s first RTO was at Rajpur Road and the second one opened near Tilak Marg, now known as Indraprastha RTO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-rto-soon-at-jharoda-kalan-will-house-delhis-10th-automated-test-track/articleshow/85413110.cms||---

Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan V stayed the order after considering a petition filed by the company through senior advocate S Ramesh Babu. The land is situated in Muttil South village. In the government order issued on February 4, it was stipulated that only value of improvements need to be paid as the land was excluded from land-ceiling provision as a plantation under Section 81 of the Kerala Land Reforms Act. As per this section, exemption from land-ceiling provision was granted to private forests, plantations, cashew estate, and lands comprised in mills, factories or workshops. The petitioner contended that the government order allowing compensation only for improvements, and not the land, in the plantation is illegal, arbitrary, and violates right to equality and the constitutional obligation under Article 300A to not to deprive property save by the authority of law. Power of the government to take private property and convert it into public use, called eminent domain, is attached with the duty to pay fair and just compensation to the private individual or entity from which the land is acquired, the petition said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-stays-govts-order-to-acquire-over-100-acres/articleshow/85413091.cms||---

The women, who act as kitchen volunteers, have served about 10-30 meals per day for over 40 days during the pandemic and floods. “I have served about 12 meals each day for over 45 days,” said Nalla Sharada, who was catering to requests from Uppal, Medipally, Peerzadiguda, Dilsukhnagar, Amberpet. She said that she has decided to serve the needy as healthy home-cooked food will aid in the fast recovery of patients.  “If there is no one at home to cook, it becomes difficult for the whole family as they won’t have access to nutritious food. I wanted to do my bit to help families infected with Covid-19,” she added. Likewise, Aanchal Khanna, a resident of Bowenpally, served 32 meals per day on average for as many as 45 days. “I felt that cooking food was much easier than distributing it, especially when the requests started pouring in from distant areas. However, our team of cyclists ensured that food was delivered on time,” said Khanna, who catered to food requests from several areas. Sharada Khanna among others are part of Hyderabad Relief Riders, a cyclists’ group helping denizens during the pandemic by delivering essentials and medicines, who have taken up the role of kitchen volunteers. The group has over 25 kitchen volunteers including students, working women, homemakers and also men. Dinesh Sale, core member, Hyderabad Relief Riders, who oversees food requests, said that they used to receive about 20 to 30 requests per week during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, whereas now they are hardly getting a request or two per week. MS Kumar, a 57-year-old government employee, who availed food from kitchen volunteers said that he got help from these volunteers when his relatives and friends turned their back. “Hyderabad Relief Riders provided me with lunch and dinner for five days, that is until I cancelled the request,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/volunteers-step-up-to-the-plate-to-cook-for-the-needy/articleshow/85413076.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Both the workers are now in Qatar at a military air base. “We have not been informed as to when we would be sent back home, but we are sure we will be taken care of,” one of them, who hails from Karimnagar, told TOI over phone from Qatar. “We were never scared about our security as the US embassy where we were working and also staying at has high security,” a worker from Nizamabad said. It was only four months since he had gone to Afghanistan for work. “Our family back home is certainly relieved that we have gotten out of Afghanistan,” he said. He was doing administration-related work at the embassy. The other worker from Karimnagar went to Kabul four years ago and was working as an electrician. Employed through a contract firm, there was no need for him and others to get out of the embassy as accommodation was provided for them on the premises itself. In the aircraft which took them to Qatar, there were a few workers from AP and other states of India. There were also nationals of other countries. “Several people from Telangana and AP had gone to Afghanistan for employment. Some of them have returned in the last one month or so. But, there are still some more who are working in smaller firms. We are trying to locate them in case they need help,” Patkuri Basant Reddy of Gulf Telangana Welfare and Cultural Association told TOI. For about a week, the embassy authorities had indicated to the workers that they would have to be ready for an evacuation if the situation warranted. On August 14, a total of 83 workers, including officials, VIPs and security personnel, were on an aircraft which landed in Qatar around midnight. Another worker from Telangana, who was also said to be working in the US embassy in Kabul, returned to the state with authorities facilitating his travel back home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-t-employees-in-kabul-among-several-airlifted-by-us-to-qatar/articleshow/85413097.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Road users have expressed a constant fear of accidents on this stretch, as motorists tend to apply sudden brakes on spotting potholes, while heavy vehicles are slow to do so.“Not only are the potholes an invitation for an accident, but also cause massive traffic jams on this stretch,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame told TOI.He said the police have already impressed upon the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to resurface the road properly. “We have asked them to resurface the road within a week,” Shrirame said.A senior NHAI official said the road surface was damaged by the heavy rain last month. “We will carry out resurfacing work at to avert avoid inconvenience to traffic,” the official said.Regular commuters said they dread the prospect of driving on this stretch daily. “They have become a cause of worry for daily commuters like me — I use the bypass regularly to reach Hinjewadi,” Avdhut Kumbhar, a techie from Warje, said.Shyam Kale, a labour contractor from Sinhagad Road, said, “Motorists drive on the bypass under a constant fear of accidents — heavy vehicles do not slow down on the pothole-ridden stretch, while the small vehicles apply sudden brakes. Heavy vehicles might ram into the smaller vehicles,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pockmarked-katraj-dehu-road-bypass-a-danger-to-commuters/articleshow/85413082.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Three days left, UG applications outnumber last year’s figures in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The number of undergraduate applications at Calcutta University colleges has been substantially high this pandemic year, some places already receiving more forms than that last year even though three more days are left for the portals to close on August 20. The reasons for the deluge of applications seemed the same as last year. The high marks that Plus-II students received after boards and councils adopted “pandemic formulae” pushed up the number of candidates making it to the subject cut-offs, college principals said. Moreover, the absence of application fees removed the financial hurdles, adding to the number of students opting for multiple subjects in multiple colleges, they added. At Scottish Church College, nearly 48,000 forms have already been submitted, a number substantially higher than last year’s 30,000. “The number of successful candidates has increased than last year. Also, students are free to choose as many subjects and colleges as they wish to,” said principal Madhumanjari Mandal Chaube. Lady Brabourne, one of the sought-after CU colleges, has barred students from applying in more than four subjects but even then, 31,000 applications have already been submitted. The number, said officials, was significantly higher than that last year. “Free application forms and higher Plus-II marks are responsible ,” said principal Siuli Sarkar. St Xavier’s College, Kolkata, has closed its portal, with 25,000 applications—around 2,000 submissions more than last year. Their first merit list will be published on August 23 and admissions will be held between August 24 and 27. The second list will be out on September 3. Principal Fr Dominic Savio said, “The rise in the number of students with high marks this year led to a huge number of applications. The departments have raised cut-offs by at least 1%-2% than last year. In Bengal board, the pass percentage is higher but the number of students scoring high is a bit lower than those belonging to ISC and CBSE. So, we made some adjustments while preparing the list,” said Fr Savio. Commerce, English and economics have been of especially high demand. Like St Xavier’s, many CU-affiliated institutes closed their applications last week or beginning of this week. These colleges will now start the second round, which is scrutinising the applications and publishing a general merit index, listing out the names of all applicants according to their numbers and individual college’s admission formulae. At Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, the application deadline was August 14. An initial merit list will be published on August 22. “The initial merit list will be prepared after scrutinising all forms,” said principal Swami Ekachittananda. An online viva voce will be held between August 24 and 28. “Many colleges are holding online interactions before admission as entrance test was not allowed,” said an official. The first merit list for departments conducting viva voce will be published between August 26 and 29. At Asutosh College, Monday was the last date for application. “Online reporting will be held on August 18, 19 and 20. The first merit list will be published on August 22,” said an official. The authorities will check the applicants’ credentials during online reporting, based on which the first merit list will be drawn up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-days-left-ug-applications-outnumber-last-yrs-figures/articleshow/85413086.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The accused identified as Ankit Patanwadiya, who lives in Shinor, was nabbed on Vadsar Road based on a tip-off. During questioning, Patanwadiya told police that in past fortnight, he was involved in multiple thefts in the city. Just a week ago, he had stolen Rs 12,000 cash from a shop near Vadsar bridge and had also targeted a sports store in Sevasi around 10 days ago. Patanwadiya had stolen sports equipment worth Rs 59,000 from the store. “We have seized Rs 1.2 lakh cash, a sports bike, a scooter, silver coins, two mobile phones and tools used by him to break into the shops. The thief has admitted to targeting shops in complexes and malls at night and used to steal cash and valuables,” said a police official.

Reminders of Taliban’s brutal rule in the past have not only terrified them but they have also appealed to the Indian government to evacuate them from Afghanistan before fighters patrolling the streets of Kabul tighten their control and impose Islamic Sharia laws in the country. Nearly 300 Sikhs and Hindus who have taken shelter at Gurdwara Kartae Parwan after Taliban took control of Afghanistan have appealed to the Indian government to evacuate them. “Taliban met us, they assured us of safety and also shared their mobile numbers. But behind their amiable gesture lies the truth of their past, which still gives us goosebumps” said Talwinder Singh Chawla, one of the Sikhs staying in the gurdwara. A group of Taliban had visited Gurdwara Karte Parwan on Monday and assured Sikhs and Hindus of their security. They had also shared their mobile numbers and asked them to contact if they had any issues. “There is no police, no government, no law, where should we go except urge the Indian government to help us,” added Talwinder. He said that some representatives of India were in constant touch with them. In a nearly one-minute video, Talwinder is heard saying that 285 Sikhs and Hindu have taken shelter in the gurdwara. “They (Taliban) had come to us, but we request you to evacuate us as soon as possible. Our is future is unpredictable here, even the local Afghan nationals are desperate to leave the country as all of you must have seen the Kabul airport videos,” appealed the Sikh and Hindu sangat of Kabul in a 60-second odd video. Kabul-based Central Gurdwara Dashmetsh Pita Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji vice-president Charanjit Singh, who is currently in Moscow, said that situation was very precarious and both the Hindu and Sikh communities would be indebted to India they are airlifted immediately. A source said after Taliban had sought a list of girls over 15 years of age and the widows under 45 to marry them to their fighters. “No matter how much they try to polish their image and improve their reputation by faking such actions (giving assurances to minorities), their real face will be exposed soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/day-after-taliban-meeting-afghan-sikhs-hindus-seek-evacuation-help-from-india/articleshow/85413074.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The state committee passed a strict warning on an inhouse report that Jayarajan and another senior leader KP Sahadevan had engaged in a heated exchange during Kannur district committee meeting. The meeting had to be suspended following their unruly spat on the topic: The criminal activities of comrades with active presence and fan following in the cyber world. A report by a state secretariat member, who attended the district secretariat meeting, was the basis for the warning by the state committee. This is Jayarajan’s third such warning. He was earlier warned by the state committee for organizing a protest programme inside Payyannur police station. He addressed the party men from the veranda of the police station, using a mike. He faced a similar warning in connection with charges that he was trying to emerge as an idol in the party by creating a fan following.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/p-jayarajan-gets-third-warning-for-unruly-behaviour/articleshow/85413172.cms||---

So far, we have not observed any major technical problem there. One key section is where the viaduct turns from Paud Road onto Karve Road. Two other locations include the turn at Shivtirthnagar and another between Vanaz Station and the depot. The trial run was conducted at all these locations without any snags,” an official said.This is the second priority stretch; the other is a 7km section between Pimpri and Dapodi, on the 16km PCMC-Swargate line, also being developed by MahaMetro. Trial runs were successful on the PCMC-Dapodi stretch.Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said, “Our teams are now inspecting the Vanaz-Garware College track section on more technical parameters. After that ,the safety inspections will be conducted.

---||Hyderabad||Stranded in Kabul, Telangana worker fires desperate plea for rescue||HYDERABAD: Amid escalating tension in Kabul, a 44-year-old man from Mancherial is crying for help. B Rajanna, who had landed in Kabul on August 8, has urged the Indian government to evacuate him to safety. Rajanna, who works as a supervisor in a construction company, had gone back to the war-torn Kabul after his 22-day leave period got over. Though the situation around Kabul International Airport calmed down on Tuesday after two days of chaos with the Taliban setting up security posts, Rajanna is not sure if he can return soon to Telangana with commercial flights not allowed to take off. He said he had a return ticket for August 18 from Kabul to Delhi. While his wife, daughter and other family members in Mancherial are worried about his safety, Rajanna said he is safe in a camp put up by his company in Kabul. Asked what made him travel to Kabul when the situation was clearly getting out of hand, Rajanna told TOI over phone that he did not anticipate that it would take a turn for worse. “We knew that the Taliban would take control of the country, but what happened in the last few days was very quick The swift collapse of Afghan forces took us all by surprise,” Rajanna, who has been working in Afghanistan for the last four years, said. He had come down to Mancherial on July 18 to spend time with his family by availing his annual leave. Hundreds of Indians have been evacuated from Afghanistan While international forces scrambled to get their nationals out of the country, Rajanna said thousands of panicked people trying to escape on Monday after the Taliban took control of the country was heartbreaking. “Little did I imagine that I will be caught in the same situation when I had landed in Kabul ten days ago. I have been left speechless by the situation in Afghanistan,” he said. He said he heard gunshots on August 15 from a place not far away from where he had been camping. “There is a sense of fear all over the city. Luckily, there is no problem for food and accommodation,” he said. Another worker from Karimnagar is also working in the same company, he said. Meanwhile, social worker P Basanth Reddy said they will take up the issue of Rajanna’s return with the Centre immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stranded-in-kabul-t-worker-fires-desperate-plea-for-rescue/articleshow/85413116.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Kochi||Kochi: Corporation plans to bring drinking water supply under its control||KOCHI: In an effort to streamline the supply of drinking water and to ensure proper treatment of sewage waste in the city, the corporation authorities are planning to bring both the services under the civic body’s control. As of now, the Kerala water authority (KWA) is taking care of these services while the corporation spends crores of rupees to ensure adequate supply of water in the city limits. There have been rampant complaints that the drinking water supply in the city is inadequate and improper. “Besides the KWA’s supply, we also provide potable water through tanker trucks. Still, there are complaints regarding inadequate supply. So, it is high time we took urgent measures to rectify the flaws in the water supply,” mayor M Anil Kumar said.  “We are exploring the possibilities of bringing the supply of drinking water and sewage treatment under the corporation’s control. This will help address many problems which plague the water supply in the city,” Anil Kumar said. “All those who need water connections should register with the corporation. This will also ensure some revenue for the corporation,” he said. The state government is deducting huge sums from the plan fund allocated to Kochi corporation as the local body failed to clear the arrears to the KWA. During 2018-19 fiscal alone, the government deducted Rs 16 crore from the corporation’s plan fund for paying the arrears to the KWA. As per the bill given by the KWA in 2019, the corporation has to pay Rs 75.94 crore towards water bills of public taps in the city. According to a survey conducted by the corporation authorities a couple of years ago, there are around 80 public water taps in each division. The KWA is charging the bills for even public water taps which had been defunct for years. The corporation has been defaulting the payment of KWA bills since 2001. Moreover, the corporation is spending funds for supplying drinking water through tankers every year. “Now, the mayor has given anticipatory approval for paying the bills to the truck owners to the tune of Rs 2 crore. The amount being paid for supplying water through tanker trucks has gone up significantly,” opposition leader Antony Kureethra said.  UDF councillors V K Minimol, Deepthi Mary Varghese, M G Aristotle and A R Padmadas alleged that there are widespread anomalies in hiring the trucks. As per the records with the corporation, bills for supplying drinking water are given to contractors even in the divisions where potable water is available. The councillors alleged that the corporation authorities are using the clause that there is no need for inspection by the finance committee once a project is tendered as a cover for committing fraud. The authorities cite high demand in certain areas as the reason for exorbitant bills given to the contractors, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-plans-to-bring-drinking-water-supply-under-its-control/articleshow/85410463.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Police were able to track down the suspect, identified as Vishal Kamble, after CCTV footage showed him wearing a particularly noticeable shirt while committing the crime early on Monday. Crime Branch senior inspector Uttam Tangade said the police surveyed CCTV footage gathered from 90 spots and identified the suspect. The police got information that the suspect was from Old Sangvi, and deployed a team in the area to find him. Around 8.30pm on Monday, constable Rajesh Kaushalye noticed the suspect riding a motorcycle towards Sai Chowk in Sangvi. Kaushalye was able to befriend the suspect who slowly opened up to him. Kamble told the cop that a youth had slapped him last week and he wanted to take revenge. Kamble also confided in him about the unsuccessful attempt to steal cash from the ATM, said Tangade. Kamble was then taken into custody and handed over to the Sangvi police for further investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/youth-held-for-bid-to-steal-cash-from-atm-to-buy-pistol/articleshow/85413104.cms||---

---||Delhi||Can’t file rape case at drop of hat to settle scores: Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: False allegations of rape and molestation made at the drop of a hat, in a “very casual manner”, not only trivialise serious offences but also leave the accused stigmatised for life, Delhi high court said while emphasising that such cases needed to be dealt with an iron hand “due to the serious nature of the offences”. The court made the strongly worded order after it found that two warring couples had registered cross-cases of rape against each other. “People who make such false allegations of rape cannot be permitted to go scot-free. This court is pained to note that there is an alarming increase of false cases of rape and offences under Section 354, 354A, 354B, 354C & 354D (IPC) only to arm-twist the accused and make them succumb to the demands of the complainant” out of fear or shame, Justice Subramonium Prasad observed. “The accused in a false case of rape loses his honour, cannot face his family and is stigmatised for life. Allegations regarding offences such as one under Section 376 IPC cannot be made at the drop of a hat — in order to settle personal scores,” he said. The court further noted that “unless wrongdoers are not made to face the consequences of their actions, it would be difficult to prevent such frivolous litigations”. Taking note of the involvement of two lawyers in the matter before it, the court said it was “tragic to note that practising advocates belonging to the legal fraternity are trivialising the offence of rape. Rape is not merely a physical assault; it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. The act of rape has the ability to scar the mental psyche of the victim and this trauma can persist for years”. It pointed out that time spent by police in investigating false cases hindered them from investigating serious offences. “As a result, it leads to faulty investigations and the accused end up going scot-free. Valuable judicial time is also spent in hearing cases where false allegations are made and (it) is consequently an abuse of the process of law.” The court added that the problem of false allegations could be solved, or at least minimised, to a certain extent, if exemplary cost was imposed on the litigants. Refusing to quash the FIR in the present case, the court said that while it was not commenting on the merits of the allegations, if it was found that the allegations were not true, action should be taken against the prosecutrix and others who were instrumental.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cant-file-rape-case-at-drop-of-hat-to-settle-scores-hc/articleshow/85413264.cms||Abhinav Garg

The team will conduct joint surprise raids without alerting even local police stations or civic offices, chairperson of the KMC board of administrators (BoA) Firhad Hakim said on Tuesday. Hakim on Tuesday held a meeting with joint police commissioner (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar and KMC director-general of the KMC buildings department Anindya Karforma to chalk out a strategy to stop illegal constructions in the city. Hakim said he would lodge FIRs against police officers, who would actively or passively help land sharks with illegal constructions. The KMC brass would also take action against errant civic buildings department assistant engineers. “No police officer or KMC official plead ignorance about illegal constructions in their area,” he said. Some of the focus areas will be Garden Reach, Metiabruz, Kidderpore, Behala, Joka, Tollygunge, Jadavpur and neighbourhoods off EM Bypass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-kmc-to-team-up-to-stop-pond-filling/articleshow/85413118.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Kolkata ATC may reroute west-bound flights to avoid Afghan airspace||KOLKATA: Air traffic controllers in Kolkata were gearing up to re-route West-bound international flights through Mumbai or Ahmedabad instead of Delhi to avoid the volatile Afghan airspace, sources in Kolkata air traffic control (ATC) said on Tuesday. The detour could mean an additional flight time of 20 minutes to over an hour, necessitating aircraft to carry more fuel. “Some flights may want to avoid the airspace over Afghanistan due to the absence of civil air traffic service in the country. Though the US said it would provide the ATC service, the situation is very fluid and airlines may not want to take a chance. In such an eventuality, we will guide the overflying planes through Jamshedpur-Nagpur-Mumbai or Jamshedpur-Bhopal-Ahmedabad instead of Gaya-Varanasi-Lucknow-Delhi so that they can avoid Afghan airspace,” a veteran ATCO said. A similar situation had occurred in February 2019, when Pakistan shut its airspace following the surgical strikes by Indian Air Force. Several hundred flights had to be then re-routed through Mumbai, leading to huge pressure on ATCOs in Kolkata and Mumbai. “The biggest challenge was allocating the desired flight levels. We had to control the flow that required changes in flight timings to space out the flights,” recounted another ATCO. Pakistan and Afghanistan airspace serves major traffic flows between Europe and Asia. On Monday, the Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority (ACAA) declared Kabul airspace — which covers the entire country — “uncontrolled”. ACAA issued two notices to airmen (NOTAM), advising overflying commercial aircraft to reroute and declaring the civilian side of Kabul airport closed till further notice. But the situation arising from the Afghan crisis is likely to be less challenging than Pakistan’s airspace closure for seven months three years ago, simply because the number of flights at present are few owing to the pandemic. With major South-East Asian countries yet to open up, their own carriers as well as those from Europe are not operating on these routes. “Usually, Kolkata handles 700-plus overflights daily. But at present, the numbers is down to barely 100. Most of the flights that are operating are those from the Gulf. Even the oceanic route (over Bay of Bengal) that carry 60% of the overflying traffic are now catering to just 30% of the traffic,” a controller said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-atc-may-reroute-west-bound-flights-to-avoid-afghan-airspace/articleshow/85413137.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai Monorail COO booked by ACB for Rs 20 lakh bribe||MUMBAI: The Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) has booked the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Mumbai Monorail for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs 20 lakh to clear the bill of a private company which provides services at the monorail. The Mumbai unit of ACB booked Dr DLN Murthy, a class one rank officer under various sections of prevention of corruption act.  The ACB said that they haven’t arrested Murthy but on Tuesday carried out a search of his house to trace evidence against him. Murthy is the second class one rank officer to be booked after the ACB arrested Aarey Milk Colony Chief Executive Officer Nathu Rathod, in May this year, and his subordinate for demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 50,000 from a slum dweller. Later the ACB seized Rs 3.46 crores in unaccounted cash from his house. The complainant is a facility management company that has taken a contract of housekeeping, customer care services and other maintenance jobs of the Mumbai Monorail from January 2019 to August 2020. The contract had expired in August 2020 and the Mumbai Monorail was to pay a sum of Rs 2.5 crores and return a Rs 32 lakhs bank guarantee. The complainant company had requested the Mumbai Monorail to clear their dues but Murthy allegedly delayed it and after several follow-ups, an amount of Rs 2.1 crores and Rs 22 lakh as bank guarantee were cleared. The complainant then approached Murthy and demanded the balance amounts, for which Murthy asked for a sum of Rs 20 lakhs as his commission. The complainant company approached the ACB and lodged a complaint against Murthy, said ACP Alka Deshmukh (ACB). The ACB team sent independent witnesses who confirmed that Murthy had demanded money. The ACB through the complainant was trying to fix a date to lay a trap but sources said that Murthy smelled rat and started avoiding the complainant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-monorail-coo-booked-by-acb-for-rs-20l-bribe/articleshow/85413149.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Pune||Pune: Woman, 5 others held on charge of robbing builder||PUNE: The Kondhwa police on Sunday arrested a 19-year-old woman and five associates on the charge of robbing and attempting to extort a Panvel-based builder. As per a complaint lodged on August 12 by the builder, the woman — whose husband is lodged in Yerawada jail — and her accomplices robbed him of Rs80,000 after demanding Rs5 lakh from him. The complainant and the suspect were in an extramarital relationship, as per the complaint. The Pune cantonment court remanded the suspects in police custody till August 20. “The woman hails from Akola. She moved to Pune last year with her brother and a friend, who helped them get a flat on rent in Yeolewadi. She has been living there with her brother, who is among the five arrested aides,” sub-inspector Prabhakar Kapure of the Kondhwa police said. In his statement recorded with the police, the builder said he met the woman on a social media platform in June. They eventually became physically intimate, the statement said. “On August 7, the builder said he met the woman in her rented flat and was on his way back to Panvel in his car when her five accomplices intercepted him near Yeolewadi around 3.30pm,” Kapure said. The five suspects hurled abuses at him, assaulted him and demanded Rs5 lakh, threatening him with a false rape complaint if he did not comply. “The men snatched Rs50,000 he was carrying and forced him to withdraw Rs30,000 from an ATM. They let him go after forcing him to promise to marry the woman and pay them the rest,” Kapure said. When the suspects began to harass the builder for the remainder of the money, he approached the police. “We traced the mobile phone location of two of the suspects to a hotel at Bopdev Ghat and arrested them on August 15. They revealed the names of the three accomplices and the woman, whom we arrested the same day,” the officer said. “We are analysing the woman’s social media account and checking call records of all the suspects to see if they committed similar crimes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-5-others-held-on-charge-of-robbing-builder/articleshow/85413150.cms||---
---||Kolkata||No more queues, private hospitals in Kolkata defer requisition of vials||KOLKATA: A sharp drop in recipients has made several private hospitals in Kolkata defer fresh requisition of vaccines for the second time since July. While queues for doses get longer at government-run CVCs, private hospitals are left with enough doses to last at least another fortnight. Many have seen a near 50% drop in recipients since last month. At Peerless Hospital, for instance, the number of recipients has been dipping steadily since mid-July. The hospital now holds 7,000 doses in stock and plans to seek new stock only in September. “From more than 600 a day, the number of recipients has dropped to around 300. At this rate, our stock will last the whole month. So, we won’t be seeking new stock before September,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. The sudden drop in demand at private CVCs is being attributed to the gap between first and second doses for the 18-45 population. Since most took their first shot in June-July, there won’t be a second rush before September-October. “Vaccines are available free of charge at government centres. This has taken the crowd away from us. Secondly, with the Covid numbers sliding down, many are still deferring their first dose,” said a hospital chief. AMRI has 15,000 doses in stock and with an average daily administration of around 800-1000, the hospital will wait till the end of August before making a requisition. “We had planned a requisition this week but that won’t be necessary since the number of recipients remains low since last month. Across our three hospitals and our Southern Avenue medical centre, we are merely administering 800. The queues have shortened at the two malls which have been our off-site centres,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) had procured 35,000 doses of Covishield last month . “Our daily consumption has dipped from 1,200 per day 45 days back to around 400-500 now. We can manage with our existing stock for the next one-and-a half months. We do not find the need to requisition fresh stock this month,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Woodlands Hospital has a current stock of 25,000 doses and is vaccinating more than 600 daily on an average. But it won’t be placing orders this month. The hospital expects its stocks to last till the end of August. “The number will go up as due second doses of Covishield are scheduled for the next few weeks. The projection is 25,000 doses in August. For September, we will be placing orders for another 30,000 doses,” said managing director Rupali Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-more-queues-pvt-hosps-defer-requisition-of-vials/articleshow/85410511.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

While discussing measures for enhancing security of airport with the officials of LBSI airport, district administration and other agencies, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said the boundary of airport separating the runway and NH-56 is spread in half km area. For the safety of flights taking off or landing, no vehicle should be allowed to park near this boundary wall at any cost. The DM asked to make it a no parking zone. To check the entry of unauthorised people inside the airport premises through main gate, DM asked for the deployment of sufficient police force at this point on regular basis. He also asked for the deployment of traffic cops in this premises for proper regulation of vehicular traffic. Airport director Aryama Sanyal drew the attention of officials towards cleanliness and problems being faced in solid waste disposal after which DM asked the officials concerned to pay special attention on this issue. He said people involved in selling chicken, mutton and fish in the vicinity of airport should be strictly directed to keep their shops properly covered and ensure proper disposal of waste. The divisional forest officer Mahavir Kaujalgi was asked to initiate measures for checking the entry of animals like rabbits and jackal as well as possibility of bird hit. DM also sought details of the progress made in the proposal of expansion of the runway of this airport.  He asked SDM Pindra to complete the survey of land in seven villages, on which the expansion was proposed, as soon as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/500m-area-near-lbs-airport-boundary-a-no-parking-zone/articleshow/85413195.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Rampur police had already submitted two charge-sheets against the three under sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120b (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. The FIR in this case was registered at Ganj police station in 2019 on the complaint of local BJP worker Akash Saxena. Azam Khan and his son Mohammed Abdullah have been lodged in jail since February 2020 and they were granted bail in most of the cases, including this one, but after that police added section 120b (criminal conspiracy) in the supplementary charge-sheet on August 11. Azam had allegedly helped his son, who didn’t have the eligible age to contest an election at that time, to get a second PAN card using forged documents. The incorrect date of birth enabled him to contest the assembly elections in 2017 from Suar constituency in Rampur. 'Discharge' application is a remedy provided to the person who has been charged maliciously. If the false allegations have been made against someone, he can file an application for discharge. He is entitled to discharge, if the evidence provided to the court is not sufficient to prove his offence. During court proceedings, additional district and sessions judge (special MP/MLA court) Alok Dubey found that there was enough evidence provided by the police in their charge-sheet for framing charges and rejected the applications of Azam Khan, Abdullah Azam and Tazeen Fatima.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/rampur-court-rejects-discharge-application-of-azam-orders-to-frame-charge-in-dob-fraud-case/articleshow/85403134.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

If the vehicle owners don’t come forward to claim their vehicles, they will be scrapped, a civic official said, adding that police would also be roped in to check if any of the seized vehicles were used in any crime.“Notices will be put on the vehicles giving information about the RTO. The registration of the vehicles will be cancelled, if the owners fail to follow the conditions,” Madhav Jagtap, head of PMC’s anti-encroachment department, said.He said eight-day notice would be issued to the owners before scrapping the vehicles. PMC and the traffic department data revealed that 690 vehicles were towed in the first phase of a special drive in 2018. Over 450 vehicles were confiscated in the second phase of the drive in 2019. 13 lakh fit for scrappingPune: Around 13 lakh vehicles, both public and private that are over 15-year-old, are registered under the Pune RTO and fit for scrapping under the Union government’s policy announced in February.The state transport department had told the Pune RTO office to look into around 11 lakh vehicles, which might be running without any registration, after completing 15 years of their on-road age.The Pune RTO has sent a notice to those having these vehicles to either re-register them and pay the green tax without delays or face scrapping of the vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-resumes-action-against-abandoned-vehicles/articleshow/85413201.cms||---

The number of syringes the state gets is consistent with the number of doses it receives. But Bengal had registered negative wastage, administering more doses than it actually has received. This has resulted in consumption of more syringes than has been provided, leading to the shortage. The state government will now procure about 20 lakh syringes to fill up this shortage. “There is some shortage of syringes as we have administered additional doses from vials. This consumed more syringes that were not supplied by the central government. So, we are going to procure around 20 lakh syringes,” said director (health services) Ajay Chakraborty. According to sources, the state government has also written to the Centre to provide the additional syringes it has used. And if the supply does not come, the health department will be purchasing the syringes that cost about Rs 5 apiece on its own. “Currently, we have a negative wastage of about 7%. As a result, we have administered close to 16 lakh additional doses out of the total vials we have got so far. But the central government supplies syringes matching the number of doses it sends to us. Hence, the gap in the number of syringes supplied and the consumption,” said a state health department official. According to health officials, an efficient dose administrator can draw 11 doses from a vial that contains 10 doses. And the vaccinators in the state have been doing it specially in the case of Covishield, inoculating one additional person per vial in many cases. “So far, Bengal has received 3 crore doses (combination of Covishield and Covaxin) from the central government. In addition, the state had procured 17.7 lakh doses on its own in between May and June,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. Sources said that the state government had procured only about 10 lakh syringes for the 17.7 lakh doses it had purchased on its own. This has also eaten into the syringe stock. Health officials, however, said that the syringe used in the Covid-19 inoculation drive is the same as that of syringes used for universal vaccination, making it possible for them to go about vaccinating despite the supply shortage. “We have been able to fill up the gap in the syringe supply and consumption from our available stock in the store. But now, the shortfall figure has gone up to about 20 lakh syringes. Hence, we need to procure syringes to avoid any crisis in future,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/negative-wastage-of-vaccine-leads-to-syringe-shortage/articleshow/85410486.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

As per the data collected from district health wing, as many as 988 dog bite cases were reported in July; 264 more cases compared to the previous month. This month so far 482 cases have been reported. Among these, most of the incidents are caused by domesticated dogs. Doctors usually administer intradermal rabies vaccine (IDRB) for dog bites, and it is available in primary health centres and hospitals. “If one is bitten by a dog, he or she should wash the wound with soap water for 15 minutes. You should not cover the wound as the organism multiply in anaerobic condition. Even if there is a need to stitch the wound, we delay the process in order to get maximum oxygen exposure on the wound. We administer IDRB even if the person was bitten by a pet dog,” said Dr Vinod Paulose, district surveillance officer for non Covid cases. Dog bites are assessed in three categories depending on the severity of the wound, which should be evaluated by the doctor. “Most of the dog bite cases coming to us are those caused by domestic ones. Stray dog bite incidents are very less,” says Dr Naseema Nisar, superintendent of Angamaly Taluk Hospital. While veterinary doctors say with the pet population increasing in the district, especially after the pandemic, the dog bite incidents will rise further. “People should vaccinate their dogs and cats. Even if they are bitten by their pets they should approach a medical officer, irrespective of whether the wound is small or big one,” says Dr Kishore Kumar K J, a veterinary doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pet-dog-bite-cases-go-up-post-lockdown/articleshow/85410485.cms||T C Sreemol

This facility is being planned in the district in addition to the sorting and segregation facility coming up at Muttathara. CKC has recently entered into an agreement with the city corporation to run the facility, which is already equipped with two shredding machines, one baling machine and one dust remover machine. The company is awaiting a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the department concerned to go ahead with the project. District-level processing facility is envisaged as a one-stop solution for storage and scientific processing of plastic waste being collected from all the local bodies in the district. CKC had received permission to establish district-level sorting facilities in accordance with the solid waste management rules 2016. As per the present system, the non-biodegradable waste collected by Haritha Karma Sena (HKS) members of the local bodies is brought to the material collection facility and from there to the resource recovery facility (RRF). RRF is mechanised and the material brought to the facility are segregated, bailed and handed over to recyclers. The rejected plastic is shredded and send for polymerised road construction. Combustible waste collected by local self-governing institutions (LSGIs) is also stored in RRF before it is sent to furnace-based industries or land fill sites. In its proposal, CKC has pointed out that the area of an RRF is more or less 1,000 sq ft and is quite insufficient to store the waste brought from LSGIs. Often, the company was compelled to hire godown facilities for storage of waste, which caused additional cost to the company. CKC has two godown facilities in the district. The material sorting and segregating facility will have enough space. The unloading area will be large enough to accommodate a few days’ material in case problems occur within the facility as large volumes of materials may need to be stored to gain better leverage in the market or during periods when the markets are poor. Since shredding, baling and screening are dust-producing operations, dust collection systems and fans will be incorporated into the facility design. A filtered ventilation system, air emission control system, automatic sprinklers and control devices will be installed throughout the facility to suppress and prevent fires from spreading within. The ceiling will be high enough to accommodate equipment . The design of the facility will also include space for employee facilities like rest rooms and possible touring and meeting areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mega-sorting-segregation-facility-to-come-up-on-1-acre/articleshow/85410545.cms||Aswin J Kumar

According to the documents accessed by TOI, at least Rs 235 crore is due from the state government under these heads to the concessionaires. Of the five toll plazas operating on the highways in the state namely at Paliyekkara (Thrissur), Walayar (Palakkad), Kumbalam and Ponnarimangalam (Ernakulam) and Kollam, the KSRTC is paying the user fee only at Kumbalam. The concessionaire of the toll plaza in Paliyekkara alone had pegged the dues from the KSRTC at Rs 104 crore till March this year, due from the state government as the user fee by the KSRTC. The state government had issued free passes to car, van, jeep and light commercial vehicles that belong to within 10km radius of the Paliyekkara toll plaza, in 2012. The government had then assured the concessionaire that the user fee for such vehicles that have been issued free passes will be paid by the government. But this amount has now accumulated up to Rs 129 crore, which also is yet to be paid. Further, close to Rs 1.5 crore is due in a similar case at Kumbalam toll plaza as well. The NHAI has also asked the state government to expedite the process of payment of compensation and taking over the possession of land for the 16 projects in the state being undertaken by the NHAI on NH-66. The agency had approved Rs 16,504 crore as the land cost for these projects and had deposited Rs 8,601 crore towards NHAI’s share of compensation. The state government had deposited Rs 3,619 crore as its share for these projects. However, the competent authority for land acquisition (CALA) had only disbursed Rs 4,675 crore despite completion of the acquisition process. As per the agreement between the Union government and the state, the state would bear 25% of the cost of land acquisition for the highways in the state, while the remaining will be borne by the NHAI. The NHAI has also asked the state government to clear its consent for bearing 25% of the acquisition cost for four various highway projects running to 336km and the development cost has been estimated at Rs 25,000 crore. These include six-laning of Walayar-Vadakkancherry section of NH-544, six-laning of Thrissur-Edappally stretch of NH-544, including the proposed Ernakulam bypass, four-laning of Kollam-Senghottai section of NH-744 and four-laning of proposed Kutta-Malappuram section of NH, the alignment for which will be finalized soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/user-fee-at-toll-plazas-state-govt-owes-rs-235-crore-to-nhai/articleshow/85413302.cms||KP Saikiran

Local residents had initially suspected that a leopard might have attacked her because the injury marks on her body looked similar to the bite marks of some wild animals. But a post-mortem at the Sassoon General Hospital confirmed that the injuries were not caused by any animal,” said Balwant Mandge, inspector of the Machar police. The woman had on Monday morning gone to switch off a water pump at the well. When she did not return home till afternoon, her parents started searching for her. “They called up a training centre, where the woman used to attend a pre-police recruitment training course, to check if she was there,” the inspector said. “A leopard had recently killed a horse in the area. Suspecting that a leopard might have attacked the woman, her relatives went to the farm,” he said. “On checking the well, they found her body inside. She had suffered injuries on her face, ears and hands,” the inspector added. “The doctors checked whether it was a case of sexual assault, but found nothing. We are investigating the case from different angles,”Mandge added. The inspector added that they had registered a case of accidental death and had kept the woman’s cellphone in our custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/19-year-old-found-dead-in-well-with-injury-marks/articleshow/85413218.cms||---

Carrying out verification would take a long time. It used to take over a month to complete the entire process. To overcome the issue, we have started verifying documents online at this new facility. Now, the officer gets the PPO number, which is issued by the PCDA (Pensions) at Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, in a few days,” said a senior official.The facility was recently inaugurated by Rajeev Chavan, PCDA at the office. “We have appointed five trained staffers at the facility to complete the task. Besides, they will also address the queries put forth by the officers over phone and email.” Chavan told TOI on Tuesday.A senior army officer said, “The online process will make documents error-free. Often, after retirement, officers face several issues in their documents. Even a small error, like a spelling mistake, creates problems. Online verification will give an opportunity to each retiring officer to verify every document on their pension records. Earlier, they had to make the correction through official communication on paper. It was a time-consuming affair.”The office of PCDA (O) caters to over 53,000 serving officers of the army, including the Chief of Defence Staffs and Chief of Army Staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/quick-verification-process-for-retiring-army-officers-pension-documents/articleshow/85413253.cms||Sandip Dighe

This year, 98,360 applications were received , and the decline of 12,746 applications is a result of fewer job opportunities in the academic sector, aspiring candidates said. The data said the biggest drop in registrations is in the Pune centre.  Last year, 19, 799 candidates registered for the exam, but this year the number stands at 15,623. Balasaheb Kapadnis, coordinator for Maharashtra SET said, “It is difficult to say why the numbers have reduced this year. Any postgraduate student is eligible for SET. A SET qualified person will be eligible for an assistant professor’s post in any college or university in Maharashtra. We conduct the exam for Maharashtra and Goa. We have 15 centres and over 200 sub-centres in both states to conduct the exam.” Suresh Patil, state coordinator NET/SET PhD Dharak Sangharsh Samiti (NET/SET qualified candidates action committee), said, “There has been no regular recruitment of teachers in colleges for the past 10 years or so. There are over 50,000 candidates qualified for the post of assistant professor in the state waiting for the recruitment process to start. There are almost 15,000 vacancies yet the state is not recruiting teachers citing financial crunch. If there are no full-time teachers, how will the quality of education in the state improve? How will the employability of students improve? The minister (Uday Samant) had promised to start the recruitment process for about 40% of the vacancies within two months. Nothing has happened till now.” Patil added that SET qualified candidates are struggling. “There are postgraduates or PhD holders working for low wages in odd jobs. Private colleges pay poor salaries. There should be a regular recruitment process and 100% of posts must be filled. Only then will students be interested in SET,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-12k-drop-in-set-applications-this-year-highest-from-pune-centre/articleshow/85413292.cms||Ardhra Nair

The municipal authorities have inspected the flood-hit areas to carry out cleanliness drives at an accelerated pace. According to the flood bulletin of the Middle Ganga Division-III of the Central Water Commission, the falling trend of water level of the Ganga continued on Tuesday. The water level went 2.92m below the danger mark. According to district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma, over 39,000 people were shifted to safer places during the flood time, when the water level of the Ganga had gone above 72m mark on August 12. Over 35,000 people had returned to their places. The number of relief camps has also been reduced from 22 to three as people from low-lying areas of Kania and Saraiyya have left for their homes. Now, the focus is on sanitation, clearing silt left by the flood, ensuring clean drinking water and health services in the areas, which remained marooned for several days. VMC and zila panchayat besides the health department officials have been asked to intensify their drives in these areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/as-flood-water-recedes-admin-faces-challenge-of-cleaning-low-lying-areas/articleshow/85413368.cms||---

Educators said the lack of coordination between government departments is costing students and the schools and resulting in academic loss. The constant change in timetables is because the state government has not been able to plan the academic year, many students said. The state government had deferred the reopening of schools last week. They were to reopen from Tuesday. The state government authorities said the withdrawal was announced after the state task force advocated against resumption of offline classes for students. Director and honorary secretary of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Nandakumar Kakirde, said various departments of the state government are not functioning as a whole. “Each functions separately and does not consult the other before announcing any decision. It creates confusion for the school authorities, students and parents. It should be minimised and proper calls should be taken by the education and health ministers, and the chief minister.” Just two days before the reopening was deferred, the education department had ordered resumption of offline classes from August 17 in a notification and had also declared the guidelines. The notifications had permitted classes from Std VIII to XII in urban areas to resume offline while in rural areas permission for Stds V to VII was granted. Education consultant Markus Deshmukh said it was very unfortunate to state that the government had failed to fulfil its constitutional duty under Article 21 A to provide quality education. “The Constitution’s Article 21 A states that the State shall provide quality education, but the government has measurably failed to provide it. Constant change in opening orders by the government has hampered almost two years of education since students are not attending classes. Online education is a farce, only a few students from cities are getting education, rural children are suffering the most, they don’t have net facilities, no electricity and no equipment.” Aam Admi Party Parents’ union member Mukund Kirdat said that, “Last week the education department planned to start schools and the government/ task team cancelled it in two days, revealing a lack of coordination between the task force and the minister. It is unfortunate for the students that the government is not having any concrete future plan. It lacks concrete guidelines.” Kirdat said it was a stressful situation for parents and in the long-term detrimental to their children. On the other hand, online education had many limitations and Kirdat claimed that the education department was not serious about education, curriculum and assessments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-indecision-raises-academic-loss-queries/articleshow/85413313.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Crime branch SP Shobhit Saxena said that the cell received a complaint that alleged that the complainant, on the pretext of being offered admission to a reputed medical college in Bengaluru, had been cheated of Rs 10 lakh. The complainant received an email purportedly from the medical college, confirming the admission, for which he was told to pay Rs 10 lakh as advance fees. Fearing he would lose admission, the complainant paid the money online to a bank account. Immediately upon the receipt of the complaint, the investigation was started. Several layers of technical data were analysed to identify the beneficiaries behind the fake bank accounts given as bank accounts of the college. The accused was identified as Ashutosh Kumar. A team of the cyber crime cell supervised by Prashal Desai and led by PSI Sarvesh Sawant was sent to Gaya and Dhanbad to track the accused. With the assistance of police from Jharkhand and Bihar, the accused was finally apprehended. Upon interrogation, the accused stated that he would make fake KYC documents to open bank accounts, and then lure vulnerable people looking for admissions into paying money after promising them admission. Only once the persons reported to college for admission would they realise they had been cheated.

According to the visualization tool, the projected sea-level rise for Kochi in 2030 will be around 0.11m, 2050 is 0.23m and 0.30m by 2060. “The tool projects a 1m rise by 2130. The reason why Kochi sea-level rise is referred to is because it is the only point where the sea level is being monitored constantly. The IPCC mandates that one point be taken and continuous monitoring be done for several years. Which is why we only see reports of Kochi sea-level rise,” said K K Ramachandran, senior scientist-atmospheric processes, National centre for earth science studies (NCESS). “In the event of a one metre rise in sea level projected for 2130, around 374sq km of coastline of central Kerala will be affected or submerged. This includes Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Thrissur districts,” he said. The state should start making a proper action plan and take the IPCC report in our context very seriously. “We have a Kerala action plan for climate change. That report should be updated and indications in the new IPCC report should be incorporated in the local context,” Ramachandran added. A report of the shoreline change analysis done by the National centre for coastal research (NCCR) released in 2018 had indicated that the coasts of Kasaragod, Kannur, Malappuram, Ernakulam and Kollam are dominated by erosion. Notable erosions have been recorded in Calicut, Beypore, south Ponnani, Cherai, Njarakkal, Mallipuram, Chellanam, Kodamthuruthu and Kochi port to Chellanam areas, according to the report which looked at the shoreline changes from 1990-2016. In the span of 26 years, 45% of the coast has eroded, 34% is stable, and 21% is accreting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/central-kerala-coastline-may-be-hit-by-rise-in-sea-level/articleshow/85413378.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The Speaker had called an all-party meeting on Monday where he appealed to all leaders to have good discussions on issues pertaining to people and democracy, the CM added. “There should also be a discussion on the efforts of the UP government in controlling the pandemic. UP is the first state in the country to have conducted 7 crore tests and vaccinated 6 crore people,” he said. If everyone cooperates in Covid management, then those spreading rumours will be unmasked and the suraksha kawach of vaccines, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has provided for free, will be available to all,” the chief minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ready-for-ve-debate-on-key-issues/articleshow/85414949.cms||---

As part of the government’s new excise policy, liquor retail licences in the 32 excise zones were auctioned from August 5 onwards and initial bidding of 20 zones brought in Rs 5,300 crore in revenue. The auction of 12 of the 32 zones could not be finalised then because either the bidders got disqualified due to technical reasons or in some cases, there were not sufficient bidders, sources said. As a result, fresh tenders have been floated by the government that expects to receive bids of Rs 265 crore per zone on average, sources said. These estimates are based on the bids it had received for the 20 other zones and the total amount comes to Rs 3,180 for the remaining 12 zones. In the auction carried out earlier this month, the reserve bidding price was set at Rs 221 crore and the tenders were awarded at an average premium of 20% with the average bid price being Rs 265 crore. The highest bid was auctioned for the New Delhi zone at a 45% premium at Rs 315 crore. The 12 zones for which tenders have been floated again include areas like Lajpat Nagar, Sriniwaspuri, Kasturba Nagar, Dakshinpuri, Sarita Vihar, Sadar Bazar, Paharganj, Laxmi Nagar, IP Extension, Anand Vihar, Shakarpur, Najafgarh, Pitampura, Paschim Vihar, Punjabi Bagh, Vikaspuri, Tagore Garden, Mukherjee Nagar, Timarpur, Alipur, Ashok Vihar and Shastri Park. The government had collected Rs 6,358 crore in 2019-20 under the previous excise regime, after collection of excise from Indian and foreign liquor, VAT collected from wholesale and retail sales, HCR excise, and retail licensing fees. It is expected that because of the new policy and demarcation of zones for bidding, the amount would be around Rs 9,500 this fiscal. The new policy of the government is aimed at promoting consumer choice and availability of popular as well as niche brands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-floats-tenders-for-bidding-on-remaining-12-of-32-excise-zones/articleshow/85413394.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Agra-Etawah circuit is one the nine-odd ecotourism circuits that UP has with considerable potential to attract nature tourists. Starting from the Taj nature walk, the circuit has Sur Sarovar bird sanctuary (Keetham lake) in Agra, National Chambal Sanctuary, that is internationally recognised for ghariyals and over 300 bird species in Agra and Etawah districts and the lion safari in Etawah. The dry runs, comprising members of the tourism guild, hoteliers and private entrepreneurs, would be conducted along the route by the month-end. It would help the department in assessing existing facilities and what can be done to make it more attractive for tourists. APCCF, Agra zone, Sunil Choudhary said, “We have sought a budget for the dry runs from the forest corporation. The dry runs would help us find out our strengths and weaknesses.” The forest department in July had organised a conclave in Agra to explore possibilities for development of ecotourism in the said circuit. The conclave had participation from the tourism guild besides senior officials of the department. The department is planning two circuits between Agra and Etawah. One would start at the Taj and have Keetham lake and Churmura elephant conservation and care centre at Mathura and the other would start at Agra and have Chambal sanctuary and lion safari in its route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/forest-department-to-assess-infra-needs-of-agra-etawah-belt/articleshow/85414957.cms||---

Many are unable to concentrate on their studies and are worried about the fate of their family members back home. “Though we’re in touch with our parents and relatives, the political chaos in our small country has shattered us. We’re in a Catch-22 situation,” said a student from Afghanistan in the city. A delegation of Afghan students met University of Mysore (UoM) VC G Hemantha Kumar and registrar R Shivappa seeking their support. VC Hemantha Kumar said, “All Afghan students are in touch with their parents. They are anxious about their stay and future here. We have assured them all support,” he told TOI. “Many of these students will be completing their courses in the next few weeks. They are tense on what they should do once the exams are over. We told them that we will seek help from the Union government, and that UoM will take care of them till the situation returns to normalcy.” The students urged the Union government to extend their visas till peace returns to their country. “We are following news on television. Our parents are asking us to concentrate on our studies. But we are not able to do so,” said Haleem A. Another student said that her family is praying desperately for peace and an end to the crisis at the earliest. Police commissioner Chandragupta said about 95 nationals from Afghanistan are in Mysuru and majority of them are students. All of them have valid visas. An officer from the special branch said Afghan nationals have been law –abiding. There hasn’t been any law and order problem involving them in Mysuru. As of now there is no information from Foreigners’ Regional Registration Office about expiry of visa of Afghan nationals. According to sources, more than two dozen Afghan nationals of the total 95 residing in Mysuru are women. ----- I am from Kabul and my parents are not able to go out. I can’t express my feelings.

---||Pune||Leisure travel bookings up as nations welcome fully-vaccinated Indians||PUNE: International leisure travel has seen a 100% uptick in the past fortnight, a first since the 18 months of the pandemic, with several international destinations opening their borders for fully vaccinated Indians, the national office of the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) said on Tuesday. Over 12 crore Indians are now fully vaccinated — a majority with Covishield, one of the most widely recognised vaccines for travel in the European Union (EU). Jyoti Mayal, president of the Travel Agents Association Of India, told TOI, “Fully vaccinated Indians now have access to Switzerland, France, Germany, Spain and Mauritius without having to undergo quarantine upon arrival if found Covid negative. A lot of travellers, fully vaccinated with Covishield, are now venturing out. But those who have got both doses of Covaxin are still at a disadvantage as the vaccine awaits WHO approval. Many Indians inoculated with this vaccine are thus losing out on travelling abroad despite their double vaccination status.” Mayal said travellers were even going to the extent of opting for “via” flights to reach their country of choice due to a dearth of flights on most sectors. “Leisure travel bookings have especially picked up for the Maldives and European countries by about 100% in comparison to being almost nothing when the first Covid wave subsided last year. Some sectors are also running full with limited flights, causing airfares to double,” he said. Nikhil Thakurdas, owner of Odyssey Tours and Travels, told TOI that the per person return economy airfares between India and UK/Europe currently ranged between Rs80,000 and Rs1.2 lakh as against the Rs55,000-Rs65,000 range in 2019. “Many EU countries, which have recognised Covishield, have still not resumed their visa processing services in India. However, Switzerland, France, Spain and Germany are among the countries that have resumed processing all categories of visa, including for short stay, in India. This allows travellers to get their Schengen visas and travel to these four countries as of now,” said Thakurdas. Vikas Agarwal, director, VT Travel, told TOI, “Only the fully vaccinated Indians (those who have received Covishield and completed 14 days after the second dose) are being allowed into these countries. We are witnessing a good response for Switzerland. Earlier, it would take travellers about 12-15 days to get a Swiss visa. But it is now arriving in 6-7 days. The Embassy of Switzerland is accepting limited visa applications, after putting a cap on their number. This has expedited the process.” Agarwal, however, said countries that have opened up for the fully vaccinated Indian tourists “do ask for a negative RT-PCR test 72 hours prior, except for Egypt and Ukraine”. Thakurdas said the UK recently eased travel restrictions for India by moving the country from its “red” to “amber” list. This allows fully vaccinated Indian passengers to travel to the UK and go through the compulsory 10-day quarantine at home or place of stay of their choice on arrival in Britain. “This has resulted in a surge of Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFR) traffic to the UK. The vaccinated Indians are now willing to consider international destinations for a holiday, as they currently meet the double vaccination norm mandated by several countries to avoid the compulsory quarantine requirement. Enquiries have surged over the last couple of weeks for the fully vaccinated people looking for overseas travel during the upcoming festive season holidays,” Thakurdas said. A iXigo source said search enquiries have seen a 45-50% increase in the first week of August in comparison to the numbers during the same time last month. Data revealed that the highest search uptick has been seen for countries such as Qatar, Germany and the Maldives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/leisure-travel-bookings-up-as-nations-welcome-fully-vaccinated-indians/articleshow/85413399.cms||Neha Madaan

The project will consist of multi sports infrastructure and facilities like a football field with gallery, hockey field, cricket field, swimming pool complex, badminton,tennis, basketball, volleyball courts and a wrestling area, with all necessary utility services. There will be both outdoor and indoor sports facilities along with accommodation for sportspersons, athletes and guests. The ‘Khel Nagari’ project, conceptualised in 2018, was recently discussed by the Hidco board in its meeting after Hidco was brought back under the state housing department’s purview with housing minister Firhad Hakim as Hidco chairman. The authorities had earlier surveyed the location at Dumurjola. Along with the sports infrastructure, the transport of the surrounding area including roads will also be developed. There will be maximum use of solar energy and LED lighting for illumination along with huge green open spaces, as Khel Nagari will be a green sports city. Officials said the selected consultancy firm will work as a proof consultant who will do all necessary checking on drawings and documents prepared by the project’s principal consultant and the main architect who will be preparing documents based on the approved concept plan made by Hidco and the budgetary estimates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/khel-nagari-to-come-up-at-dumurjola/articleshow/85410710.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Kochi||Aircraft tyre testing facility to be set up in Kochi||Kochi: The Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC), the industrial promotion arm of the Government of Kerala, is exploring the possibility of setting up an aircraft tyre testing facility near Kochi, which could facilitate the indigenization of aircraft tyres, a market that is currently monopolized by the US, French and Australian companies. KSIDC is seriously considering the project, which will come up at the campus of Kerala Rubbers Ltd (KRL), a Cial-modelled company being set up in Piravom, said the KSIDC managing director M G Rajamanickam. The capital expenditure for an aircraft tyre testing facility is estimated to be around Rs 225 crore. The Kerala government has in principle decided to provide around 75 acres of land acquired from the Hindustan Newsprint Ltd at Piravom to the various projects of KRL, of which 5 acres will be used for the tyre testing facility, said Rajamanickam. “We had looked at the doing value addition of natural rubber, like producing Off-The-Road (OTR) Tyres & Heat Resistant Latex Thread (HRLT). Kitco had studied these, and we found that the projects are capital-intensive which requires Rs 1,000 core investments. Thinking of alternate plans, we talked to the heads of the Rubber Board and Indian Rubber Manufacturers Association (IRMRA) and thus reached the project of aircraft tyre testing facility. When asked whether Rubber Board and IRMRA could take it up as a joint venture, they said yes, and right now we have submitted the proposal to the government,” said Rajamanickam, who is also the MD of KRL. “According to IRMRA, there is a lot of demand for aircraft tyre testing facility in India for both military and civil or commercial aircraft there is an increased need for aircraft tyre testing facility in the country. Though a leading tyre manufacturer in Chennai has indigenized the aircraft tyre for military application, there is no manufacturing or indigenization for testing commercial or civil aviation. All the testing for commercial or civil aircraft tyres is currently done either at OEM (original equipment manufacturer) or in China or imported with OEM certificates without testing. There is huge potential for such a facility in India as other tyre companies also are eying the defence and commercial aviation market,” Rajamanickam said. The facility, if set up in India, can very well cater to the tyre testing requirement in Asia and MENA region, KSIDC views.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/aircraft-tyre-testing-facility-to-be-set-up-in-kochi/articleshow/85413481.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Mumbai||Degree cut-offs go up by 2-8%, BSc sees 25% jump in 2 colleges||MUMBAI: The first merit list in city colleges released on Tuesday brought little cheer to thousands of students with 90%+ scores as sought-after colleges closed over 94-95% for humanities and self-financed courses. In comparison, the cutoffs in these courses went up by 2-8% from the previous year. Interestingly, the cutoffs for plain vanilla science also went up by over 25% at a couple of city colleges. Since exams across boards were called off during the Covid second wave, the results were based on internal assessments by colleges combined with class X scores. Students scoring 90% and above went up drastically across boards. CBSE registered an almost 40% rise in 90% scorers in Maharashtra, while among state board students, the numbers rose by over 1100%. At St Xavier’s College, FYBA admissions in the first list closed at 98% for HSC students and 99.2% for students from other boards, and in Mithibai, it closed at 97.5%. Cutoff for arts at Ramnarain Ruia College was 96.2%, compared to last year’s 90.3%. Jai Hind, too, had a cutoff of 96.2% for arts. Eleven students at St Xavier’s with scores between 99.2% and 100% bagged seats in the first merit list from other boards, including two cent percenters. Seats are thrown up to students from other colleges after in-house admissions. Principal Rajendra Shinde said, “Our cut-offs have reached a historic high. Tonnes of applications have poured in.” At the college, 292 FYBA seats have been taken up by in-house candidates, leaving 50 seats for outsiders, which were distributed as 40% for HSC board students and 60% for those from other boards. In self-financed courses, like BMS, BCom (accounts and finance), BAF and even mass media programmes, top-rung colleges have cutoffs of 94-97%. “These cutoffs are unlikely to drop significantly in the next round, making it difficult for students even with 95% to get into a college of their choice,” said NM College principal Parag Ajgaonkar. BSc cutoffs at Mithibai and Wilson went up by over 25% compared to last year. The first list at Wilson closed at 90.3% as opposed to last year’s 64%, and at Mithibai, the cutoff went up from 55% to 84%. Mithibai’s in-charge principal Krutika Desai said science students may have secured admissions at colleges due to the delays in entrance exams and the uncertainty. “Also due to the pandemic, many students may now have interest in science,” she added. Since psychology was a popular course among arts students, the college was encouraged to start an honours programme in BSc (Psychology), the cutoff for which is 95%, she said. At Jai Hind, cutoffs are similar to previous years. “Two things have been at play: our entrance exam has normalised inflated scores and second, we received fewer application forms this year—over 5,000,” said principal Ashok Wadia. Ruia college principal Anushree Lokur said the cutoffs may drop in the second list, but it will not be significant. She said scores, though, have gone up due to a new marking system, these are relative. The only difference now probably is that there are more 90% scorers who may not get seats in colleges of their choice,” said Lokur. In allied BSc programmes, computer science has seen a 9% rise in cutoff at the college considering the demand for the course has gone up in the pandemic, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-degree-cut-offs-go-up-by-2-8-bsc-sees-25-jump-in-2-colleges/articleshow/85413428.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vijaypat Singhania petition to change ‘VT’ code on aircraft dismissed||MUMBAI: Bombay HC on Tuesday dismissed a petition by Dr Vijaypat Singhania and Vijay Sethi seeking directions to the Centre to attempt a change in the registration of aircraft from VT (Victorian Territory) to MG (Mahatma Gandhi’s homeland) or BH (Bharat). The Britain state prefix was ‘VT’ for Indian aircraft before Independence in 1947. A bench of Justice S J Kathawalla and Justice Milind Jadhav said that in the petition itself the duo had mentioned that the Centre has for the last decade been making efforts for replacement of the code with either IN (for India) or BH and HI (Hindustan) and that the civil aviation ministry keeps following up with the International Civil Aviation Organisation to check whether it can get any other alphabetic title for aircrafts registered in India rather than using ‘VT’. The HC said Singhania could always make suggestions to the Centre. It said there was nothing to show that the Centre has any statutory duty to have the code changed to any particular code or at all. Singhania is a registered pilot and holds the world record for highest altitude gained in a hot air balloon while Sethi is winner of the Himalayan Motor race in 1999, said the petition, argued advocates Asim Sarode and Ajit Deshpande. Global rules by ICAO require each aircraft to be registered in a country where it is allotted a registration number which has one/two letters as country code and three/four of owner’s or carrier’s choice, like ‘VT-123’ in case of Indian Aircraft, said the order. The petitioner’s contention was after independence, India cannot be a territory of the Viceroy and cannot continue to use the ‘VT’ code. The Centre was represented by advocate D P Singh. The HC said, “we do not find any case made out to show that any of the fundamental rights of the Petitioners are being violated.’’ The order said their plea for direction toCentre to submit record of attempts made to change ‘VT’ can be sought by the duo by invoking the Right to Information Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-singhania-petition-to-change-vt-code-on-aircraft-dismissed/articleshow/85415577.cms||Swati Deshpande

He said that people had shown SP the mirror in 2017. Saying that SP’s allegations will not shake people’s trust in PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath, Singh said that SP’s foundation is based on lies. “It is just a matter of a few months. People are ready with the mirror to show them. Till then, keep dreaming,” he said. The minister said that when it came to BJP’s encounter policy, SP’s discomfiture was obvious since the current BJP government had brought in proper law and order. Criminals who were getting shelter under SP are now behind bars and SP, whose identify was anarchy, had no moral right to speak on law and order.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Housing Board to offer violation relaxation on Delhi pattern||CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) is coming up with the agenda to regularise building violations in CHB dwelling units on the one-time settlement pattern followed in Delhi. The agenda is coming up for discussion in the next board meeting, which is likely to be held in the first week of September. The date of the meeting will be finalised by UT adviser Dharam Pal, who is also chairman of CHB. As per the agenda item, the board has proposed to formulate a method to provide some relaxations on need-based changes on the Delhi pattern. On January 29 this year, UT administrator V P Singh Badnore directed CHB to examine residents’ demand for one-time regularisation of additional construction on the Delhi pattern. CHB allottees claim that relaxation based on the Delhi pattern is a complete solution to the complicated need-based changes made by them. They said it was implemented in Delhi in 1999. Recently, CHB had extended the deadline for regularisation of need-based changes till December 31. The board has the same penal charges as last year. As per the order, CHB has fixed penal charges of Rs 50 per square ft per annum for EWS category flats. For LIG category flats, penalty charges have been fixed at Rs 60 per square ft per annum. For MIG category flats, penalty charges have been fixed at Rs 80 per square ft per annum. Penal charges for HIG category flats have been fixed at Rs 90 per square ft per annum. The board of directors had approved extension of deadline in its meeting on March 8. According to the order, temporary exemption from immediate demolition, subject to payment of penalty charges, has now been extended to December 31. Recently, CHB proposed to extend the deadline for regularisation of changes to December 31, 2021, after it expired on December 31, 2020. The proposal went to the UT administration for approval, but the authority asked the CHB to decide. CHB officials then placed the agenda in the board of directors meeting and it was approved. CHB has already ruled that changes made in flats by allottees, which do not meet the criteria fixed by the UT administration in their notification of need-based changes, will be termed as violations. The board had asked allottees to apply for regularisation of need-based changes after paying some charges. In 2019, the Chandigarh administration had decided not to provide a one-time amnesty solution for large-scale violations by CHB allottees in flats. Earlier, UT administrator V P Singh Badnore had decided to extend the deadline for allowing need-based changes, which ended on December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020. The UT administration has also clarified that additional constructions in the dwelling units of CHB flats were given temporary exemption from immediate demolition, subject to payment of penal charges. Penal charges have been imposed on the consideration that while demolition of additional construction on a large scale may eventually be the only alternative, allottees may get some time to rectify these violations in conformity with orders on need-based changes, the administration clarified. Over the years, residents of 50,000 CHB flats have made need-based changes in their flats. However, UT administration did not regularise these changes and issued notices to most of the allottees, who were demanding regularisation of need-based changes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chb-plans-to-offer-building-violation-relaxation-on-delhi-pattern/articleshow/85410679.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Lucknow||City loses its conservation connoisseur, legacy lives on||Lucknow: Barely out of the Allahabad University with a master’s degree in chemistry in 1952, a young man, Om Prakash Agarwal, chose a path less explored. Aged almost 22 at that time, the chemist joined the conservation wing of the Archaeological Survey of India to help the cultural community make use of chemicals and reagents to infuse a new life into the paintings of the bygone era. In no time, he fell in love with his work and committed his life to the cause. On Sunday, as the country entered its 75th year of Independence, India lost its committed and passionate cultural conservationist. He passed away at the age of 90 following prolonged illness. In the 69 years that fell in between, he moved to National Museum, Delhi, and spent his time infusing freshness in historic paintings that were losing out to the travails of weathering over the years. The ceiling and canvas paintings at Rashtrapati Bhavan’s Ashoka Hall, wall paintings in Tulja Bhavani Temple in Kullu, wall paintings in Chamba, Shantiniketan, Moti Mahal (Gwalior), and St Aloysius Chapel paintings in Mangalore are just a few of his contributions. Besides metamorphosing art, he created an infrastructure that works for conservation of art and cultural property. The contribution was well recognised on various national and international platforms besides fetching him the Padma Shri in 2011. “To him, his work was his dimension of patriotism and preserving cultural legacy for posterity was national service,” said his proud son Ajay, adding that his father held nation above money and position. “In the 1970s, he refused to join as director of the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property – a prestigious UN assignment – to set up country’s first National Research Laboratory for Conservation of Cultural Property and take forward his idea of INTACH, which he later founded,” he said. The conservationist’s wife, Usha, who accompanied him on many restorative trails, remembers him as a true companion. “Every project was special to him. But what set him apart was his knowledge of where to stop and what not to touch,” she said. Usha followed in her husband’s footsteps to take up a course in conservation in the late 1960s. She joined INTACH in 1984 to share her husband’s burdern. Over the time, she mastered in textile conservation and published the Directory of Museums in India. “His brain was a mirror of his heart. He spoke of his projects as someone talking about beloved daughter and expected the same sensitivity from others,” said Usha. “When the representatives from the Manglorean church approached him, the team asked him if he will take the responsibility if the outcome of his restoration work was negative. He asked them to see him like a doctor of paintings… and he said, ‘I will treat, he will cure’. The team went back. Almost a decade later they came back. The church is a masterpiece today.” Besides his students, the legacy of OP Agarwal is being carried forward by his grand-daughters, Nimisha and Kritika. They have founded an organisation that promotes artwork by folk and tribal artists of India as their contribution to the cause of which their grand-father was the flag-bearer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-loses-its-conservation-connoisseur-legacy-lives-on/articleshow/85414965.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Delhi||Delhi: JNU to construct medical school & hospital, project to cost Rs 900 crore||NEW DELHI: The Academic Council of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Tuesday approved the establishment of a medical school with a hospital at an estimated cost of Rs 900 crore to create a research ecosystem in the biomedical field. The university would also set up a 500-bed super specialty hospital on 25 acres of land in the southwest corner of the campus. The school and hospital are likely to be constructed by 2024. The school would integrate modern medicine with traditional medicine. Aligning with the new National Education Policy’s multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teaching and research, the medical school, apart from collaborating in research in life sciences, biotechnology, molecular medicine, systems medicine, nanoscience and social medicine, would offer academic programmes from MBBS to PhD. M Jagadesh Kumar, JNU vice-chancellor, said, “After the school of engineering and the Atal Bihari Vajpayee School of Management and Entrepreneurship, a medical school was much needed. A medical school having newer healthcare technologies with updated curriculum will be complementary to the existing expertise with an intimate and seamless contact in the biological as well as biomedical teaching and research on the campus.” “JNU will contribute and continue the transformation of medical education by integrating it with natural sciences, social sciences and traditional medicines. Given the diversity and depth of skills and competence available at JNU, this is the right time to meet the aspirations of the students and the society,” added Kumar. According to the proposal approved by the AC, which would now be placed before the Executive Council on August 24, the medical school would offer academic programmes like PhD, MD-PhD, MD, MS, DM, MCh and MBBS. The MBBS curriculum would be in accordance with National Medical Commission’s guidelines, which would comprise nine semesters followed by a one-year internship. “Emphasis should be given to integrate modern medicine with traditional medicine, including use of knowledge systems from humanities. The integrated patient services between modern and traditional medicine should be translated on a day-to-day basis. Moreover, clinical research should also be integrated,” stated the document. In traditional learning, pre-clinical education would involve lectures, small group discussions and laboratory sessions. Similarly, the traditional clinical phase of medical education would consist of lectures and group discussions, in addition to in-hospital rotations. There would be 17 broad specialty and supporting departments and 16 specialty departments. There is a plan to set up non-conventional departments like international medicine, complementary and alternative medicine, experimental medicine and translational research in the future where 50% of the faculty positions may be reserved for scientists. It would commence its operations with 259 faculty members in the ratio of 1:2:4 for professor, associate professor and assistant professor. Meanwhile, objecting to the development, JNU Teachers’ Association wrote to the Union ministry of education stating that the Academic Council meeting convened by the VC was once again an “open defiance” of several stated procedures. “The meeting saw the vice-chancellor seek the AC’s approval for the establishment of a medical school and super specialty hospital without prior discussion on the feasibility of such a programme with the faculty members of Centre for Social Medicine and Community Health and other related schools,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnu-to-construct-medical-school-hospital-project-to-cost-rs-900-crore/articleshow/85413569.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

---||Mumbai||Bombay high court invokes WHO definition of mental health in MTP plea||MUMBAI: “Reproductive rights also include the right of the woman to take a decision concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence. Coercion and violence need not always be physical. It can be deduced from surrounding circumstances,” said the Bombay high court while permitting a 22-year-old victim of domestic violence to terminate her 23-week healthy foetus on her plea that its continuance would inflict mental trauma. Parliament had recently extended the cutoff under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act to 24 weeks from 20. But the new law is yet to come into force as the notification is awaited, the central government counsel, Purnima Awasthi, informed the HC. The HC took note of the amendment and also that it provides for an MTP if continuance “would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health”. The MTP Act also sets out that the woman’s environment be examined to determine whether the pregnancy would pose a risk to her. The Act explains where pregnancy is caused by a rape, the resultant anguish shall be presumed to constitute a grave injury to her mental health. The HC said, “Rape is an instance of extreme sexual violence on a woman. Domestic violence is also violence committed on a woman though the degree may be lesser.” The expression “mental health” is a wider concept encompassing within its fold the expression “mental illness”, it said, adding: “The legislature has consciously used the expression ‘mental health’ in section 3(2)(b)(i) (which givers when pregnancies may be terminated by a registered practitioner) in contradistinction to the expression ‘mental illness’ or ‘mentally ill person’.” Mental health is not defined under the MTP Act. Hence, the HC invoked the meaning given by the World Health Organisation (WHO) which defined mental health as a state of wellbeing in which every individual realises his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make contribution to his or her community. Supreme Court too has consistently permitted MTPs which exceeded the 20-week ceiling where continuance would harm the woma’s mental health, among other reasons. The HC too had earlier held that it can give permission beyond 20 weeks if woman’s health is at stake. The woman, who got married in January, had filed a petition through advocate Aditi Saxena, seeking permission to abort on the grounds that the pregnancy is having adverse impact on her mental health due to continuing domestic violence. The woman, daughter of two taxi drivers, also said she was seeking divorce. She said if a child is born and in its absence it would be difficult for her to raise the child as she does not have any source of income. Saxena had cited a 2018 HC verdict which the bench considered. The HC’s view in the 2018 order was that “freedom of a pregnant woman to make a choice of reproduction which is an integral part of personal liberty”. It had said harm to her mental health forms a good legal ground to permit an MTP, if other legal provisions in law are met. A board of JJ Hospital doctors directed by the HC to examine the woman had advised continuation of pregnancy. It clarified that it was “beyond” its authority to opine on any other cause, apart from medical cause, with regard to termination of pregnancy. Directed by HC in August to undergo MTP at Cooper hospital, she was admitted on August 4, and discharged on August16 following the procedure. “This is by far the most progressive stand that the courts have taken on MTP. This judgment essentially means that a woman’s rights and her circumstances will supersede all other factors when it comes to reproductive rights,” said Saxena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-invokes-who-definition-of-mental-health-in-mtp-plea/articleshow/85413493.cms||Swati Deshpande

The accused has been identified as Swapnil Hotkar. According to the police, a metal ring got stuck in one of the fingers of the victim’s right hand. The family members took him to a private hospital here where he was given first aid and sent home, but did not do the required procedure. The following day, the accused voluntarily agreed to cut the ring at their home. Hotkar allegedly attempted to cut the ring with an electric cutter, but failed to free the finger. He also administered anesthesia and charged Rs 3,000 for the procedure. Later, doctors at another hospital had to surgically remove and rejoin the victim’s finger. “Now the doctors suspect that the finger has developed gangrene and the family is concerned as it has become numb and inactive. Hence the complaint against the ward boy,” the police said. An offence under sections 337 and 338 of IPC has been registered at the Naupada station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-ward-boy-arrested-for-damaging-teens-finger/articleshow/85413556.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Housing Board boss clarifies rules on inspection during flat transfer||CHANDIGARH: In what comes as major relief for Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) allottees, the board’s chief executive officer (CEO), Yashpal Garg, on Tuesday, issued orders stating that there was no need for inspection of a dwelling unit by board officials at the time of transfer, if no building violation notice was issued to the allottee. Board CEO Yashpal Garg said, “From the considerable number of queries during public hearings, it seems that there is need to again clarify aspects about inspections by CHB officials at the time of transfer of dwelling units. In cases where misuse/building violations are not reported as per available record, the information furnished by the applicant in the application form of transfer of dwelling units along with affidavit of the transferor and transferee are relied upon. In all such cases, fresh inspection is not carried out by CHB at the time of transfer of units.” However, he clarified, “The applicant/transferee are liable for concealment of facts in the affidavit with respect to misuse and violations and necessary action is taken as per law, act, rules accordingly. Further, the transferee continues to be liable for all the building violations either existing at the time of transfer or made subsequently.” Garg further said that in cases where reports of violations(s) were available in the CHB record, the affidavits about non-violation are not accepted and fresh inspection is carried out by CHB officials. The board has also issued orders to protect innocent buyers. The order reads, “It has been observed that in some cases, transfer of the unit was allowed on the basis of affidavits but subsequently, certain misuse/building violations were observed. When actions against such violations were initiated, the transferees felt cheated by the transferors by way of wrong declarations/affidavits while such violations existed at the time of transfer of the dwelling unit. As per stand of the CHB, the existing owner/ occupant (transferee) is liable to remove the violations, failing which, to bear the consequences like cancellation of allotment etc. However, to overcome such a situation and to protect innocent buyers, Chandigarh Housing Board has provided optional mechanism where the transferor and the transferee may jointly apply for an inspection by the CHB and obtain a certificate about there being no violation on that point of time. For this purpose, the joint application, along with a fee of Rs 5,000 may be submitted by the transferor (existing owner) at the reception of CHB.” Garg added that they had issued similar orders on August 27, 2019, but still many property dealers were misguiding people, therefore fresh orders were issued on Tuesday. “In case of any inspection in violation of August 2019 instructions, strict action will be taken against the officers concerned of CHB,” Garg warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chb-clarifies-rules-on-inspection-at-the-time-of-flat-transfer/articleshow/85410779.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh govt to hold second pottery fair on Diwali||LUCKNOW: In a re-run of the successful maiden exhibition of clay and pottery held last Diwali, the state government is set to organise a three-day exhibition to promote pottery and clayware this Diwali season as well. The UP Mati Kala Board has started preparations for the event during which 150 artisans from across the state will showcase their products. With the focus on ‘Vocal for Local’, the main attraction of the exhibition will be products like idols of Lord Ganesh and Lakshmi, decorative earthen lamps and other clay and handmade products that are in demand during the festival of lights. The fact that products like idols of Ganesh and Lakshmi, earthen diyas and other products worth Rs 50 lakh were sold during a similar event last year, has made organisers hopeful that the exhibition will be a hit this year as well. The exhibition had ended on a memorable note for the artisans when chief minister Yogi Adiyanath bought all their products when they went to meet him on the concluding day of the exhibition. Along with display and sale of handicraft, a 3-day long seminar and workshop to attain finesse in terracotta pottery under Mati Kala/Pottery Development Scheme will also be organised. At the seminar, experts from top institutions will shed light on the technical aspects of their discipline to the artisans expected to attend the event from all over the state. “The efforts of the board are directed towards making the market competitive for artisans which will not only improve quality of products but also fetch better prices,” said additional chief secretary, khadi, Navneet Sehgal. Apart from this, to realise the vision of ‘Self-reliant India’, with the help of local administration in every district of the state, a three-day Mati Kala temporary sale centre will be set up for all the artisans, thereby providing a market to their products.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-to-hold-2nd-pottery-fair-on-diwali/articleshow/85414977.cms||---
---||Goa||‘HC functioning with 66% sanctioned judge strength’||Porvorim: The high court of Bombay is currently functioning with just 66% of its sanctioned strength, its chief justice, Dipankar Datta, said on Tuesday. He said that while it may sound a bit over-ambitious to achieve zero pendency given the current judge strength, it is his mission to achieve zero pendency in all categories of cases in Goa, he said. Zero pendency status has already been achieved in criminal appeals where the sentence exceeds ten years, he said, adding that several tax matters have been disposed of and “we are confident of achieving zero pendency status in this area as well, shortly”. Datta said that since he took over in April 2020, the HC has seen 15 judges retire, and three more are on the verge of retirement. “During this time, only four new judges have been elevated,” he said. “These bottlenecks notwithstanding, there has been no slip in administration of justice according to the oath the judges have taken.” “Once the functional strength improves, it will provide me with the opportunity to send more judges to Goa to reduce the pendency as far as possible,” he said. With additional judges, the effort would be to “dispose of matters within a year from their institution at the high court,” he said, speaking at the formal function at the commencement of judicial proceedings at the new building of the high court of Bombay at Goa in Porvorim. Justice will be dispatched without the quality of judgements being compromised, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-functioning-with-66-sanctioned-judge-strength/articleshow/85413524.cms||---
---||Chennai||HC wants to free ‘caged parrot’ CBI, empower it like EC & CAG||Madurai: Calling the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) a ‘caged parrot’, the Madras high court on Tuesday issued a slew of directions to the Union government to make the agency more independent like the Election Commission of India and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. “This is an attempt to release the ‘caged parrot’,” said a division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran and B Pugalendhi on Tuesday. As the CBI itself had told the court that it had been working with constraints such as shortage of manpower, the judges directed the CBI director to send a detailed proposal seeking further increase in divisions/wings as well as strength of officers within six weeks. On receipt of the proposal, the Centre shall pass appropriate orders on them within three months, the bench said. Noting that an aura of reverence is attached to the name CBI, the bench then issued a slew of directions such as a statutory status for the agency, separate budgetary allocation, enough manpower and functional autonomy such as reporting directly to the minister concerned or the prime minister himself. Only when CBI is given statutory status, its autonomy would be ensured. Secondly it should have a dedicated cadre of officers on its own without getting the officials on deputation, the judges said. “There is always a clamour for CBI investigation. Whenever any sensitive, heinous crimes are committed and there is no proper investigation by local police, there is a demand for CBI investigation. Such demands for CBI investigation are seemingly increasing these days due to the credibility of the investigation agency,” said the bench. “When such is the trust and faith of the people, very sadly CBI is dragging its feet, whenever there is a demand for CBI inquiry, on the ground that resources and manpower available with it are restricted and therefore, it cannot conduct investigations. This is the usual stereotypical defence of CBI before courts,” observed the judges. On perusal of the detailed report filed on the queries raised by the court regarding the resources, manpower, investigating skills, infrastructural facilities, stage of cases investigated by CBI, the judges took note of the fact that CBI was functioning with several restraints such as lack of manpower, funds and facilities at Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL). The bench then directed the Centre to consider enactment of a separate Act to give statutory status with more powers and jurisdiction to CBI at the earliest. Separate budgetary allocation shall be made for CBI, it said. The director of CBI shall be given powers as that of the secretary to the government and shall directly report to the minister/prime minister. CFSL shall have more modern facilities and should be augmented on par with the facilities available to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US and Scotland Yard in the UK. Pointing out that receiving opinion from the experts at CFSL was one of the reasons for enormous delay in concluding the investigation by CBI, the judges directed the Centre to enhance the infrastructural facilities at CFSL in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh or to establish zone-wise CFSLs. The Centre should establish at least one CFSL in South, East and West zones within one year, the judge said. The court passed the order while refusing to grant relief in a public interest litigation filed by Ramanathapuram District Pathikkapattor Sangam seeking CBI probe in a chit fund scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-wants-to-free-caged-parrot-cbi-empower-it-like-ec-cag/articleshow/85413539.cms||Kaushik Kannan

MC officials said that work of laying sewerage pipes has been completed in all the 14 villages. Work on STP in six villages has almost been completed as only electricity connection is pending. Officials said that a request has been made to the power department, which promised to provide electricity connection in Kot and Billa villages by August 15. At Sukhdarshanpur, Naggal, Khatauli and Toka villages, power connection will be given by September 15. Work on setting up STPs in the remaining eight villages will be started and completed by the end of this year, officials said. They added that the work is being done under the Amrut Yojana of the Haryana government. According to MC officials, the project is aimed at providing facilities available in cities in villages. They said that the STPs and sewerage connections would keep the villages hygienic and free of diseases. Haryana Assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta met village sarpanches and residents recently and asked them to keep a strict vigil on ongoing work to ensure quality. “We have started various projects for development of villages on the pattern of the city, including electricity, water, sewerage and roads,” Gupta said. Three days ago, in a progressive work review meeting with MC officials, he expressed resentment at the slow pace of work on beautification of the entry points in 21 villages, he said, adding that he asked the MC commissioner to blacklist the contractor working on this and to issue ‘Risk in Cost’ fresh tenders for the work. The entry gates will have the history of the village.

The minister said that the administration has geo-tagged over two lakh sexual offenders in the state to monitor their activities and take measures to prevent crimes against women. Speaking to the media at YSRCP office in Tadepalle on Tuesday, the minister said the police have filed charge sheets within a week in 1,645 cases in the last year as per deadline fixed in the Disha Bill. She said that they have also filed charge sheets in 1,531 cybercrimes against women and 2017 cases of sexual harassments. “We have fast tracked investigations in offences against women following chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s instructions. Our teams are leaving no stone unturned to render justice to the victims,” claimed Sucharitha. She explained that they have also filed charge sheet within seven days in as many as 60 rape cases, 92 attempted rape and Pocso cases, 130 Pocso cases, 718 sexual harassment cases. She said police filed charge sheet within 15 days in 2115 cases. The minister criticized TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu for making baseless allegations against the government. She said that Naidu who did nothing to protect women and their self-respect during his regime is talking tall about the crimes against women after losing power. She said that the entire world watched in shame when Naidu backed the offenders against the tehsildar Vanajakshi when he was at the helm. She said that about 148 culprits were convicted under Disha Act in the last one year. “At least three people got death penalty and 17 were given life sentence and three people were convicted with 20 years imprisonment. Ten got 17 years imprisonment. She said it used to take at least four months to file charge sheet in the past which came down to 100 days by 2019. “We brought it to 86 days by 2020 and 42 days by 2021. It will be mandatory to file charge sheet within a week once Disha Act is cleared by the Centre,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/2l-sexual-offenders-geo-tagged-says-hm/articleshow/85410839.cms||Samdani MN

He said no such study has been undertaken and suggested that it be carried out by the law commission or prominent jurists. Two years ago, the Supreme Court held that Goa is a shining example of uniform civil code and hence it is pertinent to study the pre 1961 and post 1963 civil and criminal law system in Goa, he said. The study must focus on the merits and demerits and impact on people prior to 1961 and post 1963, the governor said. Goa has a rich history of judicial system, Pillai said, said added that the chief minister is pursuing the setting up of an international law university in Goa. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said the commencement of judicial proceedings at the new high court premises coincides with Goa’s 60thyear of Liberation. “Our forefathers fought the Liberation movement to provide justice, both legal and social. This dream has to become a reality,” he said, adding that courts have a great role to achieve this dream of our forefathers. “Access to justice is one of the most fundamental tenets of the Constitution,” he said. Chief Justice of the Bombay high court Justice Dipankar Datta said the Lyceum building will not be discarded and added that district courts will shift there and continue until their building comes up. Goa has a great legal tradition with the first court in Asia established here, he said. Justice Mahesh Sonak said the last 18 months have been difficult due to the pandemic and there’s understandable despair all around. “But these times taught us to value human life, value human relations and value a lot of matters that we almost took for granted during good times. Let’s be grateful for all this,” he said, concluding with the serenity prayer, “Grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to change the things we can, and above all, wisdom to know the difference”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/guv-calls-for-official-study-on-goas-pre-post-liberation-legal-system/articleshow/85413599.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The aid is mainly given to children whose parents died of Covid, families whose income has dried up due to the pandemic, and widows. At a function held in Secretariat on Tuesday, CM Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the distribution of this financial assistance in the presence of Pillai. Of the eight recipients at the function, two were selected through Norka-Roots namely Arya Mohan and Archana Madhusoodan. The children of NRKs who died of Covid received an aid of Rs 1 lakh each. The six others, selected by RP Foundation, are facing severe health issues amid financial problems. What prompted Pillai to set up such a fund was the requests he received for financial assistance when the pandemic worsened. “We noticed that many businesses and factories shut down during this period and people lost their jobs. They didn’t even have the money to buy food. When Covid initially hit the Middle East in a severe way, there were many Indian workers who couldn’t go back home due to financial constraints. We gave air tickets to a thousand and continued supporting their sustenance back home,” he said. Assistance will also be given for covering marriage expenses of women from underprivileged families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ravi-pillai-adds-rs-2cr-more-to-covid-fund/articleshow/85413655.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Allahabad||Receding flood water leaves squalor and stench behind||Prayagraj: Thousands of families in Prayagraj are bearing the brunt of the aftermath of floods. Filth, putrid smell, in-sanitation, and mosquitoes are adding to the woes of flood-affected residents. Residents of GTB Nagar, Karelabagh, Ganganagar, Chota Bagahra, Salori, Beligaon, Rajapur and adjoining areas said that they are living in extremely filthy conditions, and government officials have only paid customary visits to their localities. For many of them, it’s like an unending nightmare. Running from pillar to post in search of private sanitary workers to get houses as well as lanes cleaned has become a huge challenge, said residents. Residents of ward number 64 (GTB Nagar) and 63 (Karelabagh) said that the rivers may have receded, but relief is still a distant dream for them. “in the midst of bad smell and accumulated filth everywhere, we have to arrange drinking water on our own,” said a local. Senior Congress leader and GTB Nagar resident Nafees Anwar said, “Over 700 families of ward number 64 got affected due to flood water. He added, “Apart from flood water, drain water had also entered their homes and led to the worst conditions which they had never faced before.” “None of the government officials has visited the affected colonies in the western part of the city so far. It is only the people who are helping each other out,” he added. For many, arranging two square meals a day and drying household articles, including beds, have become arduous tasks. They are struggling to get their lives back on track. Many residents claimed that they had no option but to dispose of all the soggy furniture. “Only stuff made of plastic have survived. It will take at least two weeks to put things in order at home before we can get on with our lives. However, if it rains in the coming days, the situation may get worse,” said locals. Amid the mess, the demand for electricians and sanitation workers has gone up. Power supply has been resorted in many low-lying areas. District authorities said teams were fogging and spraying larvicides in affected areas. As the water level of both Ganga and Yamuna continued to recede on Tuesday, many more families returned home. Till 8 am on Tuesday, Ganga receded at 22 cm at Phaphamau and Chatnag, while Yamuna was coming down by 21 cm at Naini. The water levels at Phaphamau and Chatnag were 81.08 m and 80 m respectively. At Naini, it was 80.68 m.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/receding-flood-water-leaves-squalor-and-stench-behind/articleshow/85413635.cms||---

The commission is expected to announce the polling date on September 15, sources said. In June, the Supreme Court gave the commission time till September 15 for conducting local body polls, including publication and notification of schedule. This despite the commission arguing that the Covid-19 pandemic is still raging across the state. “The commission will announce the poll schedule on September 15. After a week’s time for filing nominations and withdrawal, polls will be held by September-end. Parties will get adequate time to campaign,” said a source. The elections to these local bodies were pending since October 2016 after then opposition, the DMK, complained about errors in delimitation exercise. In a related development, the business advisory committee of the assembly hurriedly met at 1pm on Wednesday to advance the debate on demand for grants for government departments by a week. It decided to end the session by September 13, while the original schedule was September 21. The meeting was attended by Leader of the House, S Durai Murugan, leader of opposition, Edappadi K Palaniswami, deputy leader of opposition, O Panneerselvam and opposition leaders. Chief minister M K Stalin did not take part. Sources say that elections were not discussed in the meeting, but there was an indication about the polls. “There was no official discussion about the local body polls, but the government wanted the budget debate to end fast,” said a leader, privy to the discussion. The commission, sources said, had been holding preparatory talks with the district administrators recently to speed up the process of notification of polls. The districts are Kancheepuram, Chengalpet, Vellore, Tirupathur, Ranipet, Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Tirunelveli and Tenkasi. The ruling DMK and the opposition, AIADMK had been holding meetings with their respective district functionaries. The AIADMK and its allies, the BJP and the PMK, won 12 out of 45 seats in all nine districts where the rural local body polls would be held. The opposition has no representation in Kancheepuram, with Congress and DMK bagging all four constituencies. AIADMK won one seat in Chengalpet, Vellore, Tirupathur, Kallakurichi and Tirunelveli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-civic-polls-schedule-to-be-out-on-sept-15/articleshow/85413643.cms||Julie Mariappan

AAP has also decided to announce their candidates in consultation with the party high command by October end, so that there are no doubts on names of candidates, who will get ample time for field work. The state election commission is yet to reserve seats. Sources in AAP said identification of probable candidates has been done in such a manner that the party is well prepared after the announcement of reserved wards. Constant deliberations are going on over the exercise with the party’s senior leadership in New Delhi. “We have been getting very good response from people in the city in our meetings and interactions with them. People want change in the Municipal Corporation and in the city’s political scenario to choose clean leaders, who can serve them. AAP is the only such party in the city now. We have already selected three to four probable candidates in all municipal wards and final announcement will be well before the MC polls with the direction and consultation of the party’s senior leadership in New Delhi,” said Chandermukhi Sharma, AAP’s MC election in-charge, Chandigarh. He added that both Congress and BJP had fallen from grace in the city. “Congress has a major blot of corruption due to Railgate and it is limited to only one family. BJP has done nothing for the city, except imposing taxes and financial burden on residents. AAP is the only political party which can govern the MC in a better manner by providing major financial relief on the lines of the Delhi government,” Sharma said. Although senior AAP leader and its MP candidate in the 2019 parliament election, Harmohan Dhawan, attends party meetings, he is not very regular due to his advancing age. Sources in AAP said that some meetings were held at his residence too, but as he is above 80 years of age, he doesn’t come out much. His family members are actively involved in the party’s meetings and activities. Box: More from Cong to join AAP today Joining of former city mayor and Congress president Pardeep Chhabra has given a major boost to AAP. Resignations of local Congress leaders has been continuing for past many days. Soon after Chhabra quit the party, Congress RTI Cell chairman Gagandeep Singh Ahluwalia had also sent his resignation to the party national president Sonia Gandhi. Around 50 former Congress office-bearers are all set to join AAP on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-starts-identifying-probable-mc-poll-candidates/articleshow/85410897.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Delhi||Man on bail kills wife, a witness; 3 Delhi cops suspended||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has informed a city court that three of its officers have been placed under suspension after a man, out on interim bail, allegedly murdered his wife, who was given protection under the witness protection scheme. The submissions were made before additional sessions judge Anuj Agrawal through a compliance report submitted by deputy commissioner of police (southeast). The court noted that according to the report by Delhi Police, sub-inspector, assistant sub-inspector and an inspector of Govindpuri police station have been suspended. “An inquiry was conducted pursuant to order of this court and erring officers have been placed under suspension and transferred to District Line. It has further been reported that departmental inquiry has already been initiated against the erring policemen,” it said in its order. The court noted that the report also said that a circular with respect to “witness protection scheme 2018” has been circulated to all concerned for meticulous compliance. According to police, accused Nanda Nayak allegedly killed his wife, who was also an eyewitness in a case lodged against him. The court had cancelled his 90-day interim bail as he allegedly threatened the witnesses and pressured them to withdraw the case and asked him to surrender in two days. Nayak allegedly strangled his wife before surrendering, police said. The court had earlier observed that the order by which the SHO concerned was directed to ensure proper safety and security of the complainant and her family members, was not diligently complied with by him. “The indolence on the part of authorities has led to loss of a precious human life. This court is at pains to observe that the system has failed to discharge its pious duty of protecting a hapless victim of crime. The moto of Delhi Police ‘Shanti, Sewa, and Nyay’ seems to have been belied in the instant case,” it had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-on-bail-kills-wife-a-witness-3-cops-suspended/articleshow/85413647.cms||---

RMLIMS spokesperson Prof Srikesh Singh said the action was taken after a probe conducted by a four-member committee headed by dean medical Prof Nuzhat Husain found charges to be prima facie true. Five students have been suspended for three months. The sixth, who allegedly attempted suicide, has been suspended for 15 days and a probe has been ordered to ascertain if he actually tried to attempt suicide and the exact cause of his depression. The boy has also been sent home to relax considering his mental health. Besides, the entire 2019 batch has been warned not to indulge in any ragging in future, he added. According to the complaint, the ragging incident took place on July 24 when asome 2019 batch students called a 2020 batch girl student to a lecture hall in the academic block and asked her to sing a song. When the girl failed to ‘live up’ to the expectations of the seniors, the latter started misbehaving with her. In the meantime, other 2020 batch students arrived and resisted the harassment, but they too were intimidated by the seniors. Later, the 2020 batch lodged a complaint to the institute's ragging cell. The girl lodged a separate complaint naming six 2019 batch students. On Monday, one of the six named accused students, allegedly tried to hang himself in his hostel room.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/medico-who-attempted-suicide-among-6-suspended-for-ragging/articleshow/85415027.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||End of second wave? Number of sealed buildings in Mumbai falls 98% since April||MUMBAI: In yet another sign that the second Covid wave in Mumbai has abated, the number of sealed buildings has dropped by almost 98% in the last four months. Only 21 buildings are sealed across the city at the moment, a huge drop from 970 on April 12. “Mumbai is at its lowest ebb of the pandemic right now,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force on Covid. The daily tally across the city has been less than 300 for about a week now and the daily toll too has dropped below 10. The BMC seals a building if five or more residents test positive for Covid-19. In case there are fewer than five cases in a building, the floor where the patient lives is cordoned off. The number of sealed floors touched 10,983 in the second week of April, but has now dropped to 1,116. On Saturday, for the first time since the pandemic began in March 2020, the city had no containment zones --- slum pockets or congested areas that are cordoned off due to numerous cases. During the peak of the second wave in April, the city had close to 2,800 containment zones. The BMC would barricade the congested areas to restrict vehicular movement in and out of these areas. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani got the city’s present Covid trend analysed and found new cases were mainly emerging from buildings and there were no clusters of cases in any part of the city. Joshi, however, advocated caution. “We have just begun unlocking and if people don’t follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and get themselves vaccinated, we could be looking at another disaster,” he added. Abhishek Ghosalkar, former Shiv Sena corporator from Dahisar, said the second wave had barely touched slums pockets. For example, Dahisar’s Ganpat Patil Nagar, one of the largest slum pockets with a population of upwards of 60,000, reported very few cases unlike in the first wave when it was a hotspot. The BMC sealed the slum in May when cases rose to 12. “BMC officials adopted an aggressive strategy of screening locals that resulted in even asymptomatic people getting diagnosed. This helped control the spread of infection in the Dahisar cluster,” said Ghosalkar. In Goregaon, BJP corporator Srikala Pillai, whose ward has slums such as Bhagat Singh Nagar 1 & 2, Laxmi Nagar and Indira Nagar, said the first wave was harsh on slumdwellers, who had to step out to keep home fires burning. Nehal Shah, a BJP corporator from Matunga-Sion, said slum-dwellers had developed herd immunity by the time the second wave hit. “There are concerns of the third wave probably hitting us again, but the government can avoid this by ensuring that those in the slums at least take one dose of the vaccine,” said Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-end-of-2nd-wave-no-of-sealed-buildings-falls-98-since-april/articleshow/85413745.cms||Richa Pinto

AICC secretary Ivan D’Souza told the media here on Tuesday, that Indira Gandhi was not a leader of the Congress alone. “She was a leader of the masses, but BJP national general secretary C T Ravi has been making political statements without studying history. We will send Ravi books so he can learn history. BJP has commenced a new policy of changing the names of schemes launched by previous governments. Let them launch new schemes and name them after a leader of their choice. There are several roads in India which are named after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but the Congress has never renamed any one of them. If BJP continues to play ‘name politics’, they will not win the next elections,” D’Souza said. The former MLC also questioned the BJP, as to why it could not change the name of Mangaluru International Airport (MIA). “BJP government is not capable of removing the name ‘Adani Airports’ at MIA,” he criticised. On ‘hookah bar’ remark against former PM Jawaharlal Nehru, D’Souza said Ravi has no moral right to speak about Nehru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/cong-warns-against-renaming-indira-canteens/articleshow/85408759.cms||---

Taking note of the development, the court reiterated that vendors operating at the weekly markets shall ensure that, if not vaccinated already, they get themselves inoculated at the earliest. Justice Rekha Palli expressed satisfaction that Delhi government has proposed to take RAT and RT-PCR test in these weekly markets. The Delhi high court noted that the grievance of the petitioner — Saptahik Patri Bazar Association — has been redressed and disposed of the plea. The government informed the court that “Delhi Disaster Management Authority has now taken a decision to permit all the authorised weekly markets to operate in the national capital with effect from August 9.” Before this, due to Covid-19 restrictions, it had allowed weekly markets to open but only with 50% of vendors and one market in each municipal zone. The high court had earlier this month issued notice to the government and asked it to respond to the association’s petition challenging the authorities’ decision to open malls and markets but not weekly markets. The petitioner’s counsel had said that the “restrictions on the other activities were relaxed on June 13 and these vendors who belong to the poorest of poor class are suffering.” The high court had earlier said it was expected that street vendors will take proactive steps to get vaccinated so that the third wave of Covid-19 could be avoided and the national capital was not faced with a surge as witnessed recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-get-all-vendors-at-weekly-mkts-vaxed/articleshow/85413687.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Pvt univs can open off-campus centres||Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday amended the Private Universities Act, 2017, allowing private universities to open a centre outside its main campus. These centres will be operated and maintained as the constituent units of the universities. According to a communique issued by deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, who holds the education portfolio, private universities setting up off-campus centres, however, will not be any authority to give affiliation to off-campus centre. Allowing private universities to open off-campus centres is in consonance with the New Education Policy. Sharma said the NEP calls for increase in enrolment by setting up one higher education institution in each district. New off-campus centres will meet the expectations of enrolment as stated in NEP. Promoting private investment in higher education, the government has allowed colleges which meet the government norms (such as additional land) to upgrade into a university, even if they are not in the name of a sponsoring authority. Additional chief secretary, higher education, Monika S Garg said, “Earlier, only those institutions which were in the name of sponsoring authority could apply for upgradation. Those institutions, which were in the name of degree college, had to transfer it to the sponsoring authority for upgradation into a university which involved procedural hassles.” “Simplifying the process, institutions which are in the name of colleges will also be upgraded into a private university and its establishment will be in accordance with the Private Universities Act, 2017,” Garg said. Under the other amendment which is towards granting autonomy, private universities will no more need government’s approval while framing their first statutes. Earlier, the statutes had to be duly approved by the government. Now, the power of ratifying the first statutes has been given to the university’s executive council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pvt-univs-can-open-off-campus-centres/articleshow/85415033.cms||---

The petitioner association submitted that the rear side of the hotel was abutting a narrow V-6 internal sector road surrounded by houses. The CITCO management leased out a part of the hotel to a private party to operate a gym and spa facility. It, in turn, allowed the private party to create an entry by breaking the rear boundary wall of the hotel to facilitate direct access to the gym and spa facility. Such an entry in the rear wall of the hotel is not in consonance with the approved zoning plan of the area in question, the petitioners contended. The petitioners also submitted that the chief architect, department of urban planning, UT administration, have already asked the Citco managing director to close the gate on the rear boundary wall of Hotel Mountview.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-issues-notice-to-ut-citco/articleshow/85410922.cms||---

For the entire duration of the next month, the traffic would be diverted for the vehicles going towards or entering the city from Lucknow side. In this regard, a detailed plan has been sent to the PWD by the traffic police. As per the plan, light and small vehicles coming from Rae Bareli side will come from Phaphamau Bazar via Tharwai-Garapur, Sahson, Andawa, Jhunsi and finally enter the city. However, big and heavy vehicles coming on this route, will go from Nawabganj to Prayagraj bypass (Delhi-Varanasi-Howrah highway) via Sahson-Andawa-Jhunsi and then enter the city. Likewise, vehicles coming towards the Teliarganj intersection and Govindpur would be diverted towards the Uptron intersection and via railway overbridge (going towards Shivkuti police station) from where the traffic would be diverted to Bank Road-GT Jawahar via Jhunsi. Form here, vehicles could go towards Rae Bareli and Pratapgarh. Vehicles arriving at the MNNIT crossing will also be sent on the same route. Roadways buses and all heavy vehicles would be diverted from Public Service Commission crossing and would move towards Varanasi-Jaunpur-Pratapgarh-Rae Bareli via Indian Press-GT Jawahar-Jhunsi. Similarly, from Civil Lines, Hanuman temple crossing and the bus stand, all the medium, small and all other vehicles will go to Rae Bareli-Lucknow, Pratapgarh-Varanasi via Medical crossing- Harshvardhan Chauraha-Jhunsi. Under the proposed plan, traffic is to be closed from September 01 to 30 due to repair work. Authorities of UP state roadways transport corporation (UPSRTC) have also announced increasing the fair for various destinations which involves rerouting the buses through the much lengthier route after the diversion is put in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/phaphamau-bridge-to-be-closed-for-a-month-traffic-to-be-diverted-from-sept-1/articleshow/85413690.cms||---
---||Delhi||Weatherman wants to hear from you for better forecast||NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is seeking inputs and observations from the general public to make its forecasting more robust. In a link posted on its main and regional websites, IMD has asked people to submit information on different weather phenomena ranging from rain, hailstorm, lightning, dust storm and gusty winds (over 62 kmph) that have occurred in their neighbourhood. The public has been asked for the weather phenomenon, its intensity and damage caused to gauge the impact in places where IMD’s observatories and weather stations do not exist. IMD officials said the exercise to crowdsource inputs began six months ago with over 8,500 observations having been collected so far from across the country. Out of these, nearly 50% of the observations are rain-related. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional met office in Delhi, said the data had so far helped them improve their own accuracy in forecasting weather-related events. The data was also being gathered to gauge future events. “It often happens that light rainfall is forecast to occur, but if the main stations like Safdarjung, Palam, Aya Nagar, Ridge or Lodhi Road do not record any rainfall, it is believed that there was no rain across the city. However, it may be possible that light to moderate showers may have occurred in some parts where a station or observatory does not exist,” added Srivastava. The weatherman further stated that this would help them identify which areas recorded rainfall. “Radar images can be checked to identify which cloud movement or formation may have contributed to rain in the area. This will improve forecasting accuracy and we can learn from the data provided to us,” said Srivastava, adding that short-duration events such as hailstorm or gusty winds could particularly be identified in this manner. “There is a section where people can report hailstorms, gusty winds and even lightning, along with the damage that has possibly occurred. If the main observatories do not record hailstorm activity, user inputs will help us know that there was hail along with rain. Quite often, the hail melts in seconds, so people’s inputs can be beneficial,” said Srivastava, adding that outer parts of Delhi would get better coverage. Data is currently being collected through the link https://city.imd.gov.in/citywx/crowd/enter_th_datag.php. People can make observations about the weather phenomena as well as report damage, including uprooted trees, damage to buildings, livestock, crops or telephone poles and flooding, among others events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/weatherman-wants-to-hear-from-you-for-better-forecast/articleshow/85413681.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Delhi||Pandemic-hit SC/ST people in Delhi get work sheds to resume business||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s SC/ST minister Rajendra Pal Gautam allotted work sheds to 46 eligible candidates through a draw of lots on Tuesday. “Due to the corona pandemic, owners of many small businesses have lost their jobs. Many such small businesses are owned by people belonging to scheduled castes. In the light of this, the SC/ST department made this scheme in which people can start their business again,” Gautam said while allotting the sheds. The allocations were made through Delhi SC/ ST/ OBC/ Minorities and Handicapped Finance and Development Corporation Limited (DSFDC) at Raghubir Nagar in west Delhi. DSFDC looks after these work sheds in the capital. The scheduled caste/scheduled tribes minister further said that the biggest problem for the scheduled caste persons was to find a place to work. “Due to rising inflation and the pandemic, many people were unable to pay the rent of their shops and lost businesses. Through this scheme, work sheds are being provided to the people so that they can start their own business and become self-reliant,” Gautam said. “Amidst these horrific times, when people are even struggling to get jobs anywhere and set up their own businesses, the Delhi government’s initiative would prove to be a boon for the scheduled caste / scheduled tribe persons to not only set up their independent businesses on a nominally rented workplace but also support their respective families in a dignified manner,” the minister added. The work sheds have been allotted to skilled and semi-skilled applicants for setting up units for creating leather goods, electrical goods, garments and services like tailoring and dry cleaning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pandemic-hit-sc/st-people-get-work-sheds-to-resume-business/articleshow/85413721.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Gang pushed bogus e-commerce websites to dupe shoppers||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Cyber Cell has busted a gang of five men who were using search engine optimisation technique to push bogus e-commerce websites for duping people. Initial investigation shows that over 10,000 people have been cheated of at least Rs 25 crore in the last three years. The accused had created dozens of bogus shopping websites for electronic goods and clothing. “Gullible netizens looking for online shopping of electronic gadgets and apparels through online search were directed to these bogus sites, and were induced to pay affront using the bait of highly discounted prices,” a senior officer explained. The purchased products were, however, not sent. If the victims repeatedly pressed for refund, highly inferior quality products were sent to deceive them. “Many complaints were received in CyPAD where the victims alleged that they had ordered a ‘Tablet’ from the website ‘www.bookmytab.com’ after an advance payment of Rs 3,699 or Rs 3,999, but the product was never delivered. All their efforts to contact the alleged website to get a refund went in vain,” DCP (Cyber) Anyesh Roy said. It was learnt that the website was being used to dupe people at a very large scale and several complaints were found online on various fora. Technical investigation was started and complete analysis of the mobile numbers was done. The money trail was established and the location of the accused was zeroed in. Later, raid was conducted at the location of the main accused, Vijay Arora, and incriminating material was recovered from his office, including inferior quality products. Subsequently, his operations managers and campaign manager, who were involved in search engine optimisation to push the fraudulent websites online, were also arrested. The associates were identified as Manmeet Singh, Rajkumar, Pradeep Kumar and Avtar Singh. Arora is a hotel management graduate from Meerut. He had worked in a five-star hotel in Lucknow for almost 10 months after his graduation. After that, he started his own company as a courier aggregator for several online shopping companies from which he got the idea of creating fake shopping websites to make easy money. “He gave shape to this idea almost three years back and since then, he has created more than 60 fake shopping websites,” the DCP added. The accused, Pradeep Kumar is a BTech graduate who has created over 30 websites for Arora. He used to get Rs 250 per victim who purchased a mobile phone or a Tablet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gang-pushed-bogus-e-comm-websites-to-dupe-shoppers/articleshow/85413716.cms||---

Besides, the court also directed the UP government counsel to seek instructions in the matter. Hearing a contempt petition filed by Capt Ajay Kumar Singh, Justice Prakash Padia directed to put up this matter on September 6 for the next hearing. Earlier, the counsel for the petitioner contended that despite several directions issued by this court from time to time, the movement of vehicles, including trucks and small vehicles, in the premises of the park was regularly being allowed, causing environmental hazards. It was further stated that under the beautification scheme, three toilets were allowed to be constructed and to be maintained, but unfortunately these toilets were not being maintained by the authorities. Also, the directions given by this court have been deliberately and willfully disobeyed by the opposite parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-affidavits-on-upkeep-of-azad-park/articleshow/85413734.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Delhi||2 UP cops suspended after rape survivor’s self-immolation bid||Varanasi: The in-charge and a sub-inspector of Cantonment police station at Varanasi were suspended on Tuesday, a day after a rape survivor and her companion attempted self-immolation outside the premises of Supreme Court. They had accused some policemen, including the suspended duo, and a judge of harassing them. Station in-charge Rakesh Singh and sub-inspector Girija Shanker Yadav, who was the investigating officer in the case, were named by the woman, who is in her 20s, in her video that she and her associate live-streamed on Facebook before attempting self-immolation on Monday. The rape complain had been made against BSP MP from Ghosi, Atul Rai. Both the woman and her companion had also accused former Varanasi SSP Amit Pathak and the then IG, Varanasi zone, Amitabh Thakur, apart from a judge, of harassing them at the behest of the jailed BSP MP by implicating them in a forgery case. On Monday night, the UP home department attached Pathak, who was Ghaziabad SSP, to DGP headquarters. Varanasi police commissioner A Satish Ganesh said, “The inspector and the IO of the rape case have been suspended. A new ACO and inspector have been posted in the Cantonment circle and police station, respectively.” The woman had filed the case against Rai at Lanka police station, alleging that he raped her at his apartment on March 7, 2019 and also recorded a video. Rai, who had filed his nomination as a BSP candidate from Ghosi, won the election as an absconder and later surrendered before a court on June 22, 2019. Rai’s brother, Pawan Kumar, lodged a complaint in November 2020 at Cantonment police station accusing the complainant of having forged her date of birth in her rape complaint. A non-bailable warrant was issued against her and her companion by a Varanasi court in August first week. The complainant had also filed another case against the jailed MP and his aide, Sudhir Singh, at Lanka in December 2020 accusing the two of defaming her on social media. Earlier this year, the complainant had moved Supreme Court seeking transfer of the rape case from Varanasi to Delhi, fearing a threat to her life. The SC had on March 9 stayed the rape case trial and issued a notice to the accused MP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-up-cops-suspended-after-rape-survivors-self-immolation-bid/articleshow/85413728.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Goa||Goa: 23 suspected dengue cases in Ponda taluka worry doctors||PONDA: Twenty-three suspected dengue cases have been reported in Ponda taluka. Dr Kalpana Mahatme, nodal officer of vector-borne diseases at the directorate of health services (DHS), Panaji, has said that the Ponda block has no outbreak of dengue fever and that the patients suspected of dengue at the five health centres had come from dengue-affected areas like Verna industrial estate. A total of five public health centres (PHC) — Ponda, Usgao, Betki, Shiroda and Marcaim — come under the Ponda block of the health services department. Of the 23 suspected cases, Ponda urban health centre (UHC) saw the highest with 12 cases, followed by Shiroda PHC with five cases. Madkai, Betki and Dharbandora centres have 2 suspected cases each. “Of the 12 suspected cases in Ponda block, seven work in Verna industrial estate and most probably they got infected there. Since they are staying in Ponda, the cases have been recorded at Ponda UHC,” Mahatme said. Ponda sanitary officer Manoj Naik said that they have already conducted a cleanliness drive, fogging and anti-larval spraying in the area to prevent mosquito breeding. House-to-house awareness programmes have been taken to prevent the outbreak of diseases. Dr Sunita Redkar, health officer at Shiroda PHC, said they have recorded five such cases. Three of them are working at Kala Academy, Panaji, one had returned from Pune, Maharashtra, and one was local. “We are taking all necessary precautionary measures and we urge residents to cooperate with us to prevent such diseases. People need to be careful and not allow water stagnation in open containers or empty bottles,” said the health officer. Meanwhile, a dengue suspect from Shiroda died at Hospicio Hospital, Margao, but not due to dengue. He was a chronic alcoholic with a history of several other ailments, including jaundice, said Redkar. “We had conducted his antigen test on arrival for Covid-19, however he tested negative. But, as his condition was continuously deteriorating, we rushed him to Hospicio Hospital, but he died while undergoing treatment,” Redkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/23-suspected-dengue-cases-in-ponda-taluka-worry-docs/articleshow/85413789.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Lucknow||Study: Skills dipped in 78% autistic kids during lockdown||Lucknow: If you thought your children gave you a tough time during lockdown, for once think about parents of children with special needs. A survey undertaken in Lucknow and Cornwall County by researchers found that children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) underwent change in behaviour. Also, more than 78% of the children went back from what they had learnt, signifying a clear regression in their skills. Global estimates indicate that ASD, a form of neuro-disability, can affect 5-10% of all children, causing significant social, communication and behavioural challenges in them. While nothing sets them apart from others in looks, kids with ASD may be gifted or challenged when it comes to language development, expression, social interaction and mainstream classroom outcomes. Ignorance about the condition and ways to manage it adds to the misery of families. However, experts believe that helping such children realise their true interest can act as the enabler required to make them learn socially acceptable life skills. The paper published in the special Covid-19 edition of Indian Paediatrics — the medical journal brought out by Indian Academy of Paediatrics (the second largest such academy in the world), has documented how technology came to the rescue of such parents. “During the pandemic lockdown in 2019, all face-to-face support and planned activities of children with ASD were interrupted, resulting in a significant change of routine for them. They reported higher levels of anxiety, reduced dispositional hope, and psychological well-being,” said Dr Sanjay Niranjan, who was part of the eight-member research team lead by Dr Rahul Bharat currently working at department of paediatrics, Royal Cornwall Hospital. “Such parents suffered immense mental pressure and stress due to the challenges,” Dr Niranjan added. The study — which included 30 participants from Lucknow and 15 from Cornwall — assessed the children on nearly a dozen parameters, including sleep, anxiety, attention, imagination, self-care, to assess deviation from normal behaviour. The parents were also supported with technological aids brought together in an app to support and manage the child which worked well. “The success of the method is now being replicated at the Royal Cornwall Hospital to check how far it can assist parents and children,” Dr Bharat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/study-skills-dipped-in-78-autistic-kids-during-lockdown/articleshow/85415074.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Chandigarh||Dissent, dispute weaken Congress as party leaders make getaway in Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: Over the past five to six years, Chandigarh Congress has gone through a rough patch with nine prominent leaders quitting the party after serious disagreements with the local leadership. Seven of them joined BJP and AAP while the remaining two, who left the party, are yet to decide their political future. One leader shifted from the Chandigarh Congress to Punjab Congress. In a major setback, Congress leader Pardeep Chhabra has joined AAP. Initially, except one, Chandermukhi Sharma, all leaders had good relations with former city MP and Union minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, but gradually their relations with him soured. Almost all these leaders started quitting Chandigarh Congress after the Railgate scam, in which Bansal’s nephew Vijay Singla was booked and arrested in a bribery case in 2013. However, they cited different reasons. Significantly, out of the nine top Congress leaders, four, including Poonam Sharma, Rajbala Malik, Pardeep Chhabra and Ravinder Pal Singh served as Chandigarh mayors on UT Congress ticket. They had also served on various crucial committees of the civic body authority and played a vital role in running the municipal corporation for many years representing the Chandigarh Congress. Now, Malik and Sharma are prominent BJP leaders, while Ravinder Pal Singh shifted to Punjab Congress and Chhabra has joined AAP. Chandermukhi Sharma and Sat Parkash Aggarwal served as elected municipal councillors for 10 and five years respectively from the Congress. Sharma, who is considered to be close to MP Manish Tiwari, engaged in an internal tussle with Pawan Kumar Bansal throughout his political career in the Congress. Finally, he joined AAP last year in September. Aggarwal joined BJP over five years back and is now serving as nominated municipal councillor in the Chandigarh MC. Two other leaders, Chitranjan Chanchal and Sandeep Bhardwaj served the Congress on the crucial posts of district president and general secretary respectively. Both had got the Congress ticket in the past and contested the MC elections but did not win. Chanchal has joined AAP and is now a prominent leader, while Bhardwaj recently quit the party. Another prominent leader Gurpeet Happy, quit the Congress and joined the BJP a few years back. Happy is a prominent leader, who represents villages and people of rural areas of the city. He served as sarpanch of Daria village. His exit from the Congress was a major jolt for them, particularly in rural areas. Switch to state unit:Out of the nine former key Congress leaders, former city mayor Ravinder Pal Singh quit Chandigarh Congress and joined Punjab Congress using his contacts in the top leadership of the state unit. He quit the party’s Chandigarh unit over his bitter relations with the Chandigarh leadership. Except for him, none of the leaders joined the Congress anywhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dissent-dispute-weaken-chd-cong-as-leaders-make-getaway/articleshow/85411008.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Ranchi||Will speed up pending edu projects in country: Union min||Hazaribag: The Union minister of state for education, Annapurna Devi, on Tuesday criticised the opposition for its unruly behaviour in Parliament, leading to the end to the monsoon session three days before its scheduled time. Speaking to reporters in Hazaribag on Tuesday, Annapurna, who began a three-day Jan Ashirwad Yatra on Monday to mark her one month in office, said during the monsoon session, 20 important bills were passed amid the pandemonium. “Our opposition leaders do not want to see the development of the nation, particularly for the backward classes like Dalits, OBCs, minorities and women. More bills were to be passed related to secondary education and new IITs, but did not happen as the opposition didn’t allow the House to function,” she alleged. Hailing Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his concern for the poor and the backward classes, Annapurna said Modi appointed 27 cabinet ministers, including women, Adivasis, minorities and Dalits among others, for their development. On her yatra, the minister said is devoting herself to know about the ground situation of education through feedback from people and to work accordingly. “Education in the country can be developed only through proper coordination between the Centre and the state,” she stressed, adding that several IITs, engineering colleges and other institutes initiated by the Union government in various states are still incomplete. “My aim will be to see how these projects can be completed as early as possible,” she said. Hazaribag MP Jayant Sinha, local MLA Manish Jaiswal and officials of the state BJP unit were also present during the interaction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/will-speed-up-pending-edu-projects-in-country-union-min/articleshow/85411902.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Narrow escape for J’khand man in Af||Ranchi: Just two days before the Taliban took full control of Afghanistan, a banker from the city identified as Satyendra Kumar (39) managed to return to India on August 12, narrowly escaping the horrors of the war-torn country. Kumar said following an advisory from the Indian Embassy in Kabul on August 10, he decided to take no chances and managed to get an Air India flight on August 12 afternoon and reached India at night. On August 13, he finally reached his home at Chutia locality of the city. Soon after, he left for Bhojpur in the Ara district of Bihar to visit his parents at his ancestral home and unwind. But watching the ongoing turn of events in Afghanistan is making him stressed, he said, underlining the fact that he is more concerned about a few of his colleagues, including one from Delhi and another from Patna, who are stranded there, and also worried about the local friends whom he got acquainted during his two-year stint there. Talking to TOI on Tuesday, Kumar said even though serving in the war-torn country wasn’t easy for anyone with the constant threat to life looming in the back of the mind, he had always felt Afghanistan as his second home, given the warmth and support he and his colleagues had received in the last two years. “Through a job portal, I got an offer with one of the top banks in Afghanistan to work there two years back. The offer was enticing and I chose to accept despite my family fearing for my safety,” Kumar, a father of two kids, said. Kumar completed his college education in Dhanbad as his grandfather used to live in Bhuli and worked in BCCL. Later, he did his PG diploma in computer science from Raniganj and settled in Ranchi with a job in a private bank before his foreign stint. In Kabul, he lived in Sehri Nav, close to the Indian embassy. “About nine Indians worked in the bank and we lived in a flat together. I was the only one from Jharkhand but we all are like one big family,” he said, adding that his colleague from Patna is currently stranded in Kabul after commercial flight operations have ceased. On Monday, the Union ministry of external affairs said they are working on ways to bring back Indians safely. Talking to TOI on the issue, chief minister’s secretary Vinay Kumar Choubey said the state government does not have any information about anyone from the state stranded in Afghanistan and neither did anyone approach them for help as of now. He said, “We are on alert over the situation, but as of now, we don’t have any idea if anyone from our state is stranded in Afghanistan as we haven’t received any communiqué from the Centre or any individual seeking our intervention. The government will certainly swing into action if anything comes to its notice,” Choubey said. Kumar said while the Indian embassy in Afghanistan was issuing advisories since June, they continued to stay there hoping that situation would normalize soon. “But the August 10 advisory was specific to Kabul stating that the Taliban are only 100 km away. The advisory asked Indians to leave at the earliest before the commercial flights stop operating. It was then that I realised it wasn’t safe to stay and rushed to the airport leaving all my belongings there. I managed to get an Air India flight which brought me and nine others to India on the night of August 12,” he said, adding that the officials at the Indian embassy were very much helpful in all respects. Recalling the horrific scenes of unrest in Afghanistan, he said in the last two years, he was witness to some 36 blasts. “The last one was on the house of the ministry of defence in Kabul (Wazir Akbar Khan area) by the Taliban in the first week of August. Even though our flat was 200km from that place, the intensity of the blast could be heard and felt,” he said, recalling how his family back home would often ask him to return. Considering the security concerns, Kumar said they were escorted by security guards provided by the bank to move out for the smallest of things, he said. “Even for buying toffees, we had guards to accompany us, but our employer often advised us to desist from going anywhere and provided 15 days leave in three months to visit our families back home,” he said. Kumar added, “My return to Afghanistan would depend on the external affairs ministry. If they say that it is safe to go back, I will certainly choose to go there as the bank in which I worked always supported us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/narrow-escape-for-jkhand-man-in-af/articleshow/85411968.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Hence, the deputy commissioner has directed the district deputy development commissioner (DDC) to take stock of the institutional quarantine centre at Hotwar and reopen it to house asymptomatic patients in case there is a surge,” a senior district official said on Tuesday. DDC Vishal Sagar did not respond to calls. As of Monday evening, Jharkhand had 256 active Covid cases. Of them, 106 were in Ranchi. As many as 27 new infections were reported statewide on Monday and nine of them were from the state capital. In July, the state department of health, medical education and family welfare had suspended home isolation provisions for mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and directed all 24 district administrations to ensure that Covid patients will have to be admitted to hospitals or institutional quarantine centres. “At present, the Ranchi sadar hospital is housing all active patients in its Covid wards. We currently have a bed capacity of 340. Since all patients will have to be kept in health facilities irrespective of their severities, we are also planning to reopen the 100-bed Covid Care Center at Risaldar Baba Community Health Centre,” Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar told TOI. Besides the sadar hospital, the Covid wards at CCL Hospital in Kanke’s Gandhi Nagar and the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) are also on standby, Kumar added. Doctors handling Covid patients since the onset of the pandemic in March last year are not ready to term the growing infections in Ranchi as the beginning of a third wave. “However, there have been laxities on the part of the citizens. A major chunk of the people is not using face masks and there are large gatherings of devotees outside the city’s temples on the occasion of Shravan. The district administration has also been reluctant as far as enforcing the appropriate Covid behaviour is concerned,” a senior functionary of the Ranchi chapter of the Indian Medical Association said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dist-admin-plans-to-reopen-hotwar-quarantine-centre-as-cases-rise-in-city/articleshow/85412084.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The special ACB court has fixed August 24 as the next date of hearing.” Moreover, the investigating officer of the case said he could not prepare the case diary because of his engagements with law and order duties. Notably, police had nabbed three persons — Abhishek Dubey, Amit Singh and Niwaran Prasad Mahto — from different places in July. Police had also registered a case (159/ 2021) in this regard with the Kotwali police station under sections 419, 420, 124 A, 120 B and 34 of the IPC, Section 171 (B) of the Representation of People’s Act and sections 8 and 9 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, following a complaint by Congress MLA Anup Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/horse-trading-case-cops-seek-time-to-file-reply/articleshow/85412029.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Vadodara||ABVP demands 25% hike in seats at MS University in Vadodara||VADODARA: M S University’s campus witnessed some anxious moments on Tuesday when a group of student leaders came face to face with the university’s vigilance staff at the head office. Student leaders linked with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) were stopped by the vigilance staff when they reached in large numbers to make a representation before the university officials. There were some heated arguments between the student leaders and vigilance staff after which the group resorted to sloganeering and dharna. The situation, however, was under control soon. The student outfit has demanded 25% increase in the number of seats at various faculties of the university to accommodate all the students who have passed out due to mass promotion this year. “If the public university does not accommodate them such students will be forced to take admission in private universities which will result in financial burden on their families,” its representation stated. Even as MSU’s officiating registrar Dr K M Chudasama assured that all the students who have sought admission will be accommodated by the varsity, the student outfit has threatened to intensify its stir if the university fails to increase the seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/abvp-demands-25-hike-in-seats-at-msu/articleshow/85411915.cms||---

Addressing a news conference at Mapusa on Monday, NCP general secretary Sanjay Barde said that the entire law and order system is paralysed as a number of crimes against women are rising by the day. “Why will a teenage girl commit suicide at such a vast beach when the elderly themselves are apprehensive to dip their feet in the water on that beach,” said Barde while demanding a thorough inquiry in the matter. Barde also questioned why the girl’s parents were not summoned to the beach while the panchanama was being conducted. “This shows that there is some kind of political interference in this case. Why has not a single minister from the BJP government spoken on this case?” Barde said. “The entire panchanama had been done in a hasty manner, only to make it look that the girl committed suicide,” Barde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-trying-to-hush-up-death-case-says-ncp/articleshow/85384191.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The cops said that one of the accused even posed as a politician to gain the trust of the victims. The cops have seized laptops, mark-sheets, bogus job offer letters and fake visas from the accused. According to the police, Chintan Patel, a resident of Waghodia Road used to pose as a politician from a party, and Vishal Tapodhan, had taken an office on rent and used to accept documents from people to get them visa.

---||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad fret over lack of paediatricians, have only 14||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: While Noida and Ghaziabad are gearing up for a possible third Covid wave with a focus on preparations for children, there are very few paediatricians in both the districts. The health departments have readied Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) beds in all Community Health Centres (CHCs) and other government hospitals and making other arrangements with another major outbreak in mind. In Noida, however, there is just one paediatrician under the chief medical officer (CMO) and one under the chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the district hospital. The district requires at least 10 such doctors. “We send a revised checklist of our staff every week. We have one paediatrician in the district under me, who manages all CHCs and PHCs. We need more specialists. However, we have Child PGI for referring cases,” said CMO Dr Sunil Sharma. Officials said that for all the government health centres, including the CHCs, one doctor needs to be on call while at least three others have to be posted at the centres. A total of four paediatricians are required under the CMO. Meanwhile, at the government hospital, two doctors are needed in every shift, taking the requirement to six. The district, therefore, needs 10 paediatricians to handle all government facilities adequately. However, officials say that hardly any district in the state has 10 paediatricians deputed. Since no specialist doctors are available, the districts are training regular medical officers and nurses in paediatric care. “We have trained at least one medical officer and one staff nurse from every government centre in specialised paediatric care,” said Dr Sharma. There is a huge scarcity of paediatricians in Ghaziabad as well. There are two paediatricians each at District Combined Hospital and MMG District Hospital and seven at District Women Hospital. One is attached with the CMO’s office. At present, a children Covid ward is reserved only at the District Combined Hospital, which serves as an L2 Covid facility whenever the need arises. The ward has 10 PICU beds, eight HDU beds and 10 oxygen beds. Besides, a 10-bed PICU ward has been readied at each of the four community health centres in Modinagar, Muradnagar, Loni and Dasna. None of them has any paediatricians. For running the PICU wards, each of these four medical facilities will need a minimum of three doctors to work in three shifts. Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical officer of District Combined Hospital, said he had sent a requirement of five paediatricians and 25 staff nurses for the children ward. “We are still to get paediatricians. Based on a recent order of the state health department, a training in handing PICU ward was imparted to almost all staffers at the hospital,” he added. The other two government hospitals — MMG and Women Hospital — are kept on standby. Dr Anurag Bhargava, CMS of MMG District Hospital, said a 10-bed PICU ward would be ready within few hours if the need arises. Dr Sangeeta Goyal, chief medical superintendent of Women’s Hospital, said, “Seven doctors are engaged in a special newborn care unit (SNCU) ward. We have been asked to remain on standby by the government, but a 10-bed Covid ward can be ready in an emergency.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-ghaziabad-fret-over-lack-of-paediatricians-have-only-14/articleshow/85414767.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Goa||Crime branch must investigate teen’s death: Goa minister Michael Lobo||PANAJI: A day after chief minister Pramod Sawant said the crime branch has been roped in to assist the Calangute police to investigate the death of the 19-year-old girl whose semi-nude body was found on Calangute beach, science and technology minister Michael Lobo suggested that the crime branch take over the investigation entirely if the present probe yields no results. “Let’s wait for a week to see the outcome of the investigation by Calangute police. Otherwise, I will write a letter seeking transfer of the case to the crime branch. Let the truth come out,” Lobo, who represents Calangute constituency, said. He said he has told the deputy superintendent of police and the Calangute police inspector to check CCTV footage of hotels and restaurants to ascertain whether the teen was alone. “When there is doubt in the minds of the people about the incident, especially among the teen’s family, it should be cleared. The chief minister has already given direction to do proper investigation,” Lobo said as he recounted that although doctors at the GMC had pinned the cause of death on drowning, the girl’s parents and members of the general public have been suspecting something else. “Let there be no stone unturned,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/crime-branch-must-investigate-teens-death-lobo/articleshow/85412661.cms||---

---||Goa||Will ask Centre to restart charter flights, says Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Tuesday that while the state government has not taken any decision to start tourism activities in the state, the government can “think positively” about resuming the industry. Sawant also said that the state would write to the Union government requesting that charter flights be allowed to restart. Sawant said that the state would consider the Covid situation in August and September, and then take a decision on restarting tourism. “We are willing to restart tourism,” he said, adding that if a third wave hits, the decision to restart the industry can be cancelled. Sawant said that the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) requested him to start charter flights, to restart tourism. “It is in the purview of the government of India,” Sawant said. “Until the government of India gives permission, we cannot start charter flights. I told them that last time, we had made a request to start charters to the Union home and tourism ministries...” The chief minister said that this time too, the state will write to the Centre. “We are ready to open the tourism sector by taking all precautions and putting SOPs (in place), but till now, we have not finalised them. TTAG has asked us to start tourism in October,” Sawant said. Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) president Ralph De Souza said that at least two months is required to prepare to start tourism. He also said that charter flights can be allowed with the restriction that tourists cannot move out of Goa once they come to Goa by charter flights. TTAG and GCCI on Tuesday submitted a joint representation to the government to restart international tourism. “Domestic tourism has started in Goa, and if we take health precautions and start charter flights, then it would be fine,” De Souza said, adding that “we are not keen on starting anything (that’s dangerous). We are interested in starting business with caution”. TTAG president Nilesh Shah said that Goa should allow international tourists. He also said that the Goa government should talk to the Union government to open up a channel to start charter tourism. “If we take a decision now, then in October, international tourists can come to the state.” He said that tourists from Russia should be allowed. Shah also said that the tourism industry is in a bad shape, and average occupancy is around 25%. He also said that only 1,400 hotels are open, and 2,000 others have not yet opened. “The Goa economy depends on tourism, and almost 1.4 lakh people are directly or indirectly involved, which means six lakh people are involved,” he said. The joint representation the two bodies submitted on Tuesday said that since the stoppage of international flights in March 2020, many operators have closed their offices. “With Goa being one of the leading states for tourism, we propose that charter flights are allowed to land from safe destinations that have allowed Indians to travel to their countries on a tourist visa, and international flights are already operating between two countries, such as Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan,” it stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-ask-centre-to-restart-charters-says-sawant/articleshow/85412627.cms||---
---||Goa||State to e-auction over 2 million tonne iron ore on Aug 27||Panaji: The state government has put up over 2 million tonnes of iron ore for the e-auction scheduled on August 27, to generate revenue for the state. This is the 26th e-auction, and will be conducted by the directorate of mines and geology. The iron ore which has been put up is currently lying at various mines, plots and jetties including Pissurelem, Kotambi, Rivona, Navelim, Tudou, Pale, Uguem, Shigao, Sonus, Trimurthy, Cudmen, and Tollem. At the 25th e-auction conducted in March, only 70% of the ore lying at jetties and ports found takers. Around 1 million tonnes (of the 1.6 million tonnes) of ore was purchased. The state government has been conducting e-auctions of iron ore to generate revenue for the state treasury, which has been facing a crisis due to the Covid pandemic. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, in his budget speech, said that the state would generate revenue of around Rs 500 crore from mining. In the recently-concluded monsoon session of the Goa legislative assembly, the House passed the Goa Mining Corporation bill to restart mining activities in the state. The bill is yet to get the governor’s assent. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018, following the SC order quashing the second renewal of 88 leases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-e-auction-over-2-million-tonne-iron-ore-on-aug-27/articleshow/85412576.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Malls in Mumbai Metropolitan Region shut again, blame 2-dose rule for staff||MUMBAI: Two days after resuming operations, most major malls in Mumbai downed shutters on Tuesday over their inability to comply with the mandate to use fully vaccinated staff. Many said they had taken their cue earlier from BMC commissioner I S Chahal’s verbal instructions that staff be allowed to work provided they had received at least one dose. But with the state’s August 16 notification saying all employees must have completed 14 days after receiving both doses, malls have decided to shut down for now. Visitors were surprised to find Inorbit and Infiniti at Malad shut. Growel’s 101 in Kandivli, R City in Ghatkopar and Phoenix at Lower Parel were also closed on Tuesday. In Thane, Viviana Mall and Korum Mall, however, remained operational. In a statement, the Shopping Centres Association of India said given the restrictions, malls will not be able to operate. It would be at least a month (tentatively September-end) before a sizable number of their staff get second doses, provided vaccines are available, it said. Rajneesh Mahajan, CEO, Inorbit Malls India Pvt Ltd, said the association was hopeful of certain relaxations. “We started the mall going by the BMC commissioner’s statement that a single dose for staff would suffice and accordingly mobilised manpower and undertook sanitation of premises. Malls are a large infrastructure and everything needs to be rebooted again when starting after a gap of a few months. We were expecting certain relaxations which did not happen, as per the August 16 government notification, which clearly said both doses were mandatory. We all want to comply with the government rules and hence have decided to shut again,” said Mahajan. Sachin Dhanawade, COO, Retail & Real Estate, Grauer & Weil (India) Ltd, which operates Growel’s 1O1 Mall in Kandivli, said a large majority of their staff are below 45 years of age. “Vaccination for under 45 years of age started in May in Maharashtra, which was soon suspended due to shortage of supply. Furthermore, the Central government also extended the gap between two doses for Covishield. Most mall staff are therefore partially vaccinated (one dose), having taken their first dose in the last 30-45 days. In this situation, as a sizable number of staff and employees are not eligible for their second dose, malls will not be able to operate before September-end,” he said. BMC chief I S Chahal late on Monday sent the notification reiterating the two-dose rule. “For now, we are following government orders mandating two doses. Meanwhile, we sent a recommendation to the government to allow malls where staff have taken a single dose of vaccine to operate. The same will be discussed with task force members,” said Chahal. Viren Shah, president of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association, said forcing people to sit at home without work despite the first dose was unacceptable. “If the gap for students travelling for studies could be reduced, why not for employees who need to earn their livelihood,” said Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/malls-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-shut-again-blame-2-dose-rule-for-staff/articleshow/85417037.cms||Richa Pinto

The NGT has given time till August 31 to finalize the plan. Cabral said that over 8,500 suggestions on CZMP have been received from people and authorities have scrutinized the applications and are working on it. “August 31 is the final date to submit CZMP but we will seek more time to finalize the plan,” Cabral said, adding that the state faced a lot of difficulties to finalize the plan. He also said that the state government wants to make it a people’s plan and people’s plan means that all the suggestions given by people have to be incorporated. “People are helping us to make the plan. This plan is not made in air,” he said. Cabral said that teams checking on ground-realities are finding it difficult to visit places due to the rain, but he has called for a review meeting next week to review the progress. He also said that authorities will be strictly implementing the ban on sale of plaster of paris (PoP) Ganesh idols in the state and action would be taken against anyone buying PoP idols during Ganesh Chaturthi. “For buying PoP Ganesh idols, people will be fined or there will be imprisonment if required,” Cabral said, adding that 98% of street lights would be functional before Chaturthi. The minister also said that many new transformers are being install across the state to provide uninterrupted electricity to people, which he said is also the chief minister’s focus. On the mining issue Cabral said that the chief minister is “focused on and is serious about restarting mining activities in the state”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-seek-more-time-to-finalise-coastal-plan-cabral/articleshow/85412708.cms||---
---||Goa||Free water must not stop after polls, says Sudin||Ponda: Welcoming the government decision to give 16 cubic litre water free to every household in Goa, former deputy chief minister and MGP leader Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar warned the ruling party that the assurance should not be an election enticement. The scheme should be continued even after election, he said. Stating that it is not a new idea instituted by the Sawant government, Dhavalikar recalled that the free water was mooted under the judicious use of water policy in 2016 when Laxmikant Parsekar was CM. But it could not materialise at the time, he said. “The consumption of a family of eight will immediately touch 20 cubic litre and government has to revert the water tariff hike,” Dhavalikar said.  He said that if the government is going to implement the scheme from September 1, it should waive the interest incurred on pending bills. Those with huge bills should be allowed to pay in instalments. Dhavalikar said that the government has been losing crores of rupees worth revenue through water theft and it should control this now itself to avoid further loss. About 40%water is stolen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/free-water-must-not-stop-after-polls-says-sudin/articleshow/85412762.cms||---

Both were welcomed into the party fold by BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade and general secretary Damodar Naik in the presence of a large number of their supporters who also joined BJP at a function held at the party’s South Goa district office. While Noronha had contested assembly elections twice — once as an independent and once on Trinamool Congress — D’Silva was fielded by Congress in the 2017 assembly polls. Former councillor Livrament Barreto was also among those who entered BJP on Tuesday. Significantly, both the new entrants to the party belong to the ST community which comprises over 25% of Fatorda voters. Tanavade in his address said that the entry of the ST leaders along with their supporters marked “the beginning of a new era” for Fatorda. The entry of “grassroots leaders” would help BJP in the 2022 assembly elections, he said. He criticised the coming together of Congress and Goa Forward Party (GFP) for the recent Margao municipality polls as a move driven by vested interests by sidelining their loyal workers. “Both (GFP president) Vijai Sardesai and (Margao MLA) Digambar Kamat do not think beyond selfish personal benefits,” Tanavade said. Naik, speaking on the occasion, hoped that with the ST population of Fatorda now getting attracted to BJP, the party would make significant inroads in the tribal votes of the constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congs-fatorda-block-president-ex-convener-supporters-join-bjp/articleshow/85412855.cms||---

Sawant said that there is no plan to start physical classes for students of schools and higher secondary institutes. “Students above 18 have taken the Covid vaccine, and the government can positively consider the proposal to start colleges,” he said.

---||Vadodara||Three posing as cops loot truckers||Vadodara: Three fraudsters posing as cops and extorting money from truck drivers on Dabhoi Road were caught red-handed by Vadodara rural police on Monday. The trio identified as Mitulkumar Dodiya, a resident of RV Desai Road; Vineet Shah, from Manjalpur; and Dhrumil Tailor, who lives in Raopura, used to keep a watch at Kelanpur on Dabhoi Road and take money from truck drivers identifying themselves as police. They had even put a plaque of Vigilance Cell — Government of India on their car so that nobody would be suspicious. During the wee hours of Monday, the accused stopped a truck driver named Shashibhushan Oza and asked him to show the vehicle’s documents. A few minutes later, they also stopped other truck drivers and asked them as well to furnish documents. After a few drivers showed documents, the accused asked all of them to give Rs 5,000 each and threatened to register a case if they would not pay money. The drivers did not have enough money and while they were negotiating, a patrolling vehicle from Varnama police station reached the spot and nabbed the trio. Police seized Rs 1,850 cash, five smartphones and their SUV and booked them for extortion and impersonating a public servant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/three-posing-as-cops-loot-truckers/articleshow/85412270.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Judicious water use will ensure zero bills for households’||Panaji: A day after he announced that the state government would provide 16,000 litres of free water per household, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday urged the people of the state to utilise fewer than 16,000 litres, so that 100% of Goa’s households would get relief from water bills. Addressing a gathering after inaugurating a market complex at the Goa housing board, Porvorim, Sawant said that the government’s decision to provide free water will force people to stop wastage as they will try not to exceed 16,000 litres of water a month. “When there is no wastage of water, we will be able to provide water to more households,” he said. Sawant said that the cost to treat and supply water to households is Rs 15 per cubic metre, and the state used to charge only Rs 2.2 per cubic meter. “I urge the people to use limited water, and if they use minimum water, nobody will get water bills,” Sawant said. He also said that on an average, the water requirement for a person is around 100 litres a day. Sawant also hit out at former PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar for being PWD minister for 20 years and still not providing proper water to the people of the state. Reacting to Dhavalikar’s claim that it was he who suggested giving free water, Sawant said that nobody told him anything, and that it was his government’s decision to provide free water. “He should have not said that he has told the government to provide free water,” Sawant said. The CM said that the state government is committed to development work in the state. He added that it is the duty of the government and its officials that there are no encroachments on government land. Meanwhile, housing minister Mauvin Godinho said that a preference is given in allotment (in plots and flats) to those staying within 10km radius of the project. Godinho said that the government is getting funds from the Centre based on performance.
