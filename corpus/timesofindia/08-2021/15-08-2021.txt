Their refusal to fit into society’s predetermined mould has given them a sense of freedom that by their own admission, is incomparable. Today, on India’s 75th Independence Day, five accomplished professionals, with a strong Kolkata connect, look back at the time they savoured the sweet taste of freedom for the very first time. We bring you their inspiring stories. Read on… Dipa KarmakarAccomplishments: Padma Shri, Arjuna and Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna awardee for Gymnastics, Dipa gained attention after winning a bronze medal at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, becoming the first Indian female gymnast to do so in the history of the games. First taste of freedom: I can’t pinpoint a day or a particular incident, but I can say that my family has played a big role in instilling this sense of freedom in me. They have never made me feel that I can't dream big because I am a girl. I have always had the leeway to do as I pleased, whether in choosing a profession or leading life in my way. That apart, whenever I have participated in international games, it has given me an immense feeling of being liberated. Pursuing sports has always given me a sense of independence. During the vaults that I do, my mind focusses on the techniques and remains alert. But when I train for them, it often crosses my mind that why won't women be given a chance to step out of their houses and carve the life they want? It is when these these thoughts cross my mind that I value my independence all the more. Taniya SanyalAccomplishments: The first woman firefighter in Indian Aviation, Taniya, has never undergone physical training in school or college — let alone sports — but cracked the difficult physical endurance tests to break the glass ceiling and be where she is today. Many accolades and recognitions later, she still holds the same passion for her profession. First taste of freedom: The power of making my own choices and taking up the responsibility to fulfil those have always driven me. Although I have always been able to make my way through difficulties, the sense of true freedom came from my identity as the first woman firefighter in Indian Aviation. Born to progressive and liberal parents was always an advantage. I savoured independence from an early age in all that I chose to do. Now that I am being able to fulfil my parents’ dreams alongside my own, it fills me with a sense of euphoria that is akin to the first feeling of freedom. Madhubrata ChatterjeeAccomplishments: The Kolkata-born UK-based space scientist specialises in satellite communication. She still misses the by-lanes of North Kolkata, where she grew up, and fondly remembers how the City of Joy made her feel independent when she was barely five years old. First taste of freedom: I have been fiercely independent since childhood. Perhaps, that is the reason I decided to be a space scientist at the age of 10, after reading Tintin’s Destination Moon! My first tryst with freedom dates back to when I left home, without telling my parents, to buy a bar of chocolate for my younger sister. I was four or five years old then. The feeling of stayed with me throughout my school and college days in Kolkata. After completing my engineering in Kolkata, I went to the UK for higher studies. The Master’s degree went well, but the real test was when I was doing my PhD. My husband was staying in Switzerland and my son, a toddler then, was staying with me. Every day, I would drop him at the day care, go to work, come back, do household chores and then get back to studies. That feeling of independence remains unmatched to this day. Shantanu MaheshwariAccomplishments: Actor, dancer, choreographer and a host — Shantanu wears many hats. He is part of a dance group that has represented India on the world stage and won accolades. First taste of freedom: My first real taste of freedom was at the World of Dance championship in 2015, where our dance crew, the Desi Hoppers, represented India. I was nervous and an overwhelming feeling of self doubt consumed me. I doubted my dancing abilities, skillset and style. But post our performance, the standing ovation from the audience that comprised dancers from all over the world in attendance, instilled immense confidence in me. That, I feel, also gave me a sense of freedom — of being free from all the doubts and fears I had before our act. The cherry on the cake was us winning the competition and bringing home the trophy for India on August 16 that year. It was a day after our Independence day, which again gave me a sense of freedom like one I'd never experienced before. Samarpan MaitiAccomplishments: He’s a scientist and the runner-up of Mr Gay World 2018. The true sense of freedom eluded the Midnapore boy, who is also a LGBTQA+ activist, for the longest time until he shifted base to Europe a few years back. He is currently researching on cellular biology in Geneva. First taste of freedom: In 2019, when I went to Europe, I first tasted freedom in its true sense. I saw men kissing each other right on my university campus. I felt liberated the day I first stole a kiss at a cafe in Geneva and no one batted an eye. I wasn’t judged, teased or arrested. Freedom is the right to celebrate yourself and it gives you the right to speak, think and live the way you want to. For the longest time, I had lived in a shell. It took me a lot of effort to come out; more so, because I come from a small town. It is easy to be discriminated in the Indian society — not only for being a homosexual man but also because you ‘fail’ to fit into a predetermined mould. Even today, I cannot marry my partner legally in India and I don’t enjoy the same rights as my heteronormative sister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/indias-young-talents-recount-their-first-taste-of-freedom/articleshow/85332935.cms||Debolina Sen

Those arrested were also involved in collecting air-dropped weapon consignments and delivering the same to active terrorists in Kashmir Valley, besides carrying out reconnaissance of important targets in other parts of the country, ADGP (Jammu zone) Mukesh Singh on Saturday. The first JeM ultra arrested in this chain was Muntazir Manzoor alias Saifullah of Prichoo in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district, from whom cops recovered a pistol, one magazine, eight live rounds and two Chinese hand grenades. His truck used for transporting weapons to Kashmir Valley was also seized, the ADGP said. Subsequently, another JeM affiliate — Ijahar Khan of Mirdan Mohalla in Uttar Pradesh’s Shamli district — was arrested. Ijahar revealed that a Jaish commander in Pakistan by the name of Muntazir alias Shahid had asked him to collect weapons dropped by a drone from near Amritsar. “Jaish also tasked Ijahar with the reconnaissance of Panipat oil refinery, which he did and sent videos to Pakistan,” ADGP Singh said. “Two other terrorists — Touseef Ahmed Shah alias Showket and Adnan, both from J&K’s Shopian — were asked to carry out a recce of Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi, but they were apprehended before they could complete the task,” the ADGP said. Touseef was asked to procure a second-hand motorcycle to be used for an IED blast in Jammu, Singh said, adding, “The IED for this purpose was to be dropped by a drone. Touseef was arrested before he could complete this task.” Jahangir Ahmed Bhat of Bandzoo in Pulwama was the fourth JeM terrorist arrested in the case. “A fruit merchant from Kashmir, Jahangir was constantly in touch with Shahid in Pakistan and had introduced Ijahar to him. Jahangir was also carrying out recruitment for the outfit in Kashmir Valley and across the country,” the ADGP said, adding that further investigation into the terror module was underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/four-jaish-terrorists-arrested-major-attack-averted/articleshow/85337024.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Security personnel have been posted atop high buildings while drones are being used to keep a vigil on roads leading to Sher-i-Kashmir Stadium at Sonawar, the main venue of the I-Day function where Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha will take the salute of the parade. Authorities have issued special ID cards sans which none would be allowed to move towards the function venue on Sunday. IGP (Kashmir Range) Vijay Kumar said the security grid has been tightened across Kashmir Valley as a precautionary measure to foil any terror attempt. Checkpoints have been established at various locations in Srinagar — including Lal Chowk, Hari Singh Street and Jehangir Chowk — where security forces are randomly checking vehicles, particularly two-wheelers, frisking commuters and examining their identity cards before allowing them to move ahead. Similar nakas have also been set up on the outskirts of the city to prevent the infiltration of terrorists. A police officer said several sophisticated drones have been deployed within a 2km-radius of sensitive spots like Lal Chowk, Sonawar and adjoining areas to maintain aerial surveillance near the main I-Day function venue. “High-tech drones have also been pressed into service in Anchar and adjacent areas of Soura downtown, besides other parts of the city, to keep a close watch on suspects and fortify the security grid already in place,” he added. Contrary to previous years, the roads leading to SK Stadium at high-security Sonawar remained open for civilian movement during the day, before being closed later in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sharpshooters-drones-deployed-in-srinagar-ahead-of-i-day/articleshow/85337152.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The Indian Air Force (IAF) lifted heavy equipment for underwater search and rescue from Visakhapatnam on the intervening night of August 13 and 14 to the air force station in Pathankot. Specialised divers from the Navy and Army’s Special Forces have been working along with officials of other agencies. On August 3, the ‘Rudra’ chopper, an armed version of the indigenous advanced light helicopter from the 254 Army Aviation squadron, had taken off from Mamun cantonment around 10.20am. The helicopter developed some snag about 10 minutes after getting airborne and crashed into the centre of the reservoir, about 30km from Pathankot, during a low-level sortie. The expansive water reservoir in Kathua district is around 25km long, 8km wide, and more than 500ft deep. Recently, the search team had digitally located the wreckage of the helicopter. The operation is challenging due to the near-zero visibility below 50m because of the water’s colloidal nature in this season, which adversely impacts the accuracy of sonars and other sensors. A small area of 60m by 60m was localised and special sonar equipment flown in from Kochi was employed to enable the search to enter its final phase. Specialised machines, including multi-beam sonars, side scanners, remotely operated vehicles and underwater manipulators have been flown in from Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai and Kochi, and pressed into action. Apart from this, expertise and equipment of the Army, Navy, IAF, NDRF, SDRF, NGOs, state police, dam authority and private firms from across the country have been deployed in the search operation. “Search operations continue unabated despite bad weather and rain. Experts, specialised equipment and divers are being continuously flown in and international assistance is also being sought. No efforts are being spared for early conclusion of the search operation,” Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said.

India and the UK have been conducting the annual bilateral naval exercise "Konkan" since 2004. The latest such exercise started on August 12, when the Talwar-class frontline frigate, which is assigned to the Western Naval Command based in Mumbai, met the Royal Navy for exercises at sea before entering Portsmouth harbour on Friday. The harbour phase of the exercise will continue until Monday, including professional interactions, sharing of best practices and harbour drills. The exercise will then move to sea, when INS Tabar is scheduled to meet the frontline Royal Navy ship HMS Westminster, along with shore-based aircraft, for air defence exercises, anti-submarine procedures, replenishment-at-sea activities and communication drills. A highlight of the exercise will be the cross-deck helicopter operations, wherein choppers will carry out landing procedures. High commissioner Gaitri Issar Kumar said the joint exercises were aimed at "enhancing interoperability, synergy and cooperation between both navies". She said INS Tabar’s visit to Portsmouth "will contribute to further strengthening the friendly contacts and cooperation between both navies". The Indian Navy had taken part in a range of exercises with the UK’s Carrier Strike Group, led by HMS Queen Elizabeth, in the Bay of Bengal in July.

---||World||Taliban 11 km from Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif under multi-pronged attack||ISLAMABAD: The Taliban seized control on Saturday of the capital cities of Paktika and Kunar provinces and launched a major offensive from several directions on Mazar-e-Sharif, an important city in northern Afghanistan. After taking over the entire province of Logar, the insurgents are now almost on Kabul’s doorsteps. When reports last came in, they had reached Char Asyab district, 11 km south of Kabul. Footage from Paktika’s capital, Sharana, and Asadabad, the capital of Kunar, showed people waving the Taliban flag and walking through the streets of the two cities. Provincial lawmakers in the twin cities confirmed that the intelligence departments, offices of the governors, police headquarters and local jails are now controlled by the insurgents. There was some fighting in Sharana earlier but local tribal leaders intervened and negotiated a pullout of government forces. The Paktika governor was en route to Kabul after Sharana was taken. In Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold of warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, there was heavy fighting on the outskirts, government officials said. In a pre-recorded message to the nation, beleaguered Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said remobilisation of Afghan forces was his top priority and vowed to prevent further bloodshed in his country. "I will not allow the imposed war to bring more devastation and death to the people. Under the current situation, remobilising of the security and defence forces is our top priority and required measures are underway for this purpose," Ghani said. "I know that you are concerned about your present and future, but I assure you as your president that my focus is to prevent further instability, violence and displacement of my people," the Afghan president said. "To do this, I have started widespread consultations within and outside the government, with political leaders and international partners, and I will soon share the results with the people," Ghani added. Afghan analysts, however, believe that Ghani is no longer in control. "It’s not about President Ghani anymore, it’s about making the transition as bloodlessly, as orderly and as swiftly as possible," Haroon Rahimi, a law professor at the American University of Afghanistan, told media. "If Kabul falls under pressure, all hopes for a political settlement will be lost," he said, suggesting that the Kabul administration should hand over authority to a transitional body to negotiate a power-sharing agreement with the Taliban. The Taliban now control more than half of the country’s provincial capitals after capturing much of northern, western and southern Afghanistan in less than three weeks before the US is set to withdraw its final troops, raising fears of a full takeover by the insurgent group or another Afghan civil war. With their sweeping territorial gains, the insurgents and their supporters have been messaging that normalcy has returned to the provinces under their control. "The militants do not harm security personnel if they voluntarily surrender and the group works for all people irrespective of their ethnicity," one of the messages, probably aimed at encouraging soldiers to surrender ahead of a Taliban assault, read. It also appears to be an attempt to dispel reports that the group has executed government civil and military officials in districts they have captured and forced the girls to marry Taliban fighters. Top security and intelligence officials that TOI has interacted with said that the division of Afghan society on ethnicity basis has been one of the key factors responsible for the rapid retreat of Afghan forces and the apparent crumbling of the system that was in place in the war-ravaged country for 20 years. "Except President Ashraf Ghani and former ruler Hamid Karzai, the majority of Afghan military and civil officers are non-Pashtuns. Urban non-Pashtuns were already ahead in education, so the majority of teachers, doctors and engineers benefited from American intervention. In two decades foreign and local scholarships were granted to Afghan students and teachers," observed Zafarullah Khan, a former police and intelligence official form Pakistan’s northwestern region along the Afghan border. In the past 20 years, the official said, the war against Taliban was fought by the Afghan National Army along with US and Nato troops in mostly Pashtun-majority districts. "The Americans could not trust the Pashtuns for recruitment in the army as in many incidents the Pashtun soldiers had killed their officers or Americans and decamped with M16s, suggesting that many Pashtuns had joined the army for this very purpose," Khan added. During the peak time of the war on terror, the Taliban were running shadow governments in most of the Pashtun-majority provinces in a tribal way that has been practised in Afghanistan for generations. Confident about their victories in the Pashtun belt, the Taliban had organised themselves in the northern provinces during the last two decades and started their victory trail from Kunduz, the only Pashtun-dominant province in the north. "Anyone having knowledge of Afghanistan and Afghans would know that, as predicted a decade ago, a non-Pashtun army would just melt away in the Pashtun provinces. The Afghan forces had no public acceptance in Pashtun areas. Their defeat was inevitable," revealed a conversation with Afghan tribal elders and politicians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-11-km-from-kabul-mazar-e-sharif-under-multi-pronged-attack/articleshow/85338095.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Following a plea moved by the school a single-judge bench of Justice Jayant Nath stated in an order that the documentary – which released on Netflix on August 6 – can stream only after all references and scenes related to the school are removed. Advocate Sandeep Kapur, who appeared alongside senior advocate Rajeev Virmani, on behalf of the school, says, “In our submission, we told the court that the name of the school has been used elaborately and frequently in the documentary of the defendants without having obtained permission. We also submitted to the court that the documentary contains visuals of the school building without having obtained permission. This is in contravention and in violation of the order (dated 08.01.2018) of the court of Additional Sessions Judge, Gurugram.” In the August 10 order, Justice Jayant Nath states, “The impugned act is contrary to the orders passed by the Ld ASJ, Gurugram and the co-ordinate bench of this court. The defendants are restrained from streaming, broadcasting, telecasting etc the documentary or any of its abridged versions.” It adds, “The defendants may stream the said documentary after deleting all references to the plaintiff school in question and deleting the portion where the building of the school is depicted.” Netflix has declined to comment on the order. A notice was issued to all respondents and the matter is listed for further hearing on October 22, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-hc-restrains-streaming-of-documentary-on-2017-student-murder-case/articleshow/85333373.cms||Niharika Lal
---||India||August 14 to be Partition Horrors Remembrance Day: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday announced August 14 to be observed as "Partition Horrors Remembrance Day", setting off a debate on the decision. "Partition’s pains can never be forgotten. Millions of our sisters and brothers were displaced and many lost their lives due to mindless hate and violence. In memory of the struggles and sacrifices of our people, 14th August will be observed as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day," said the PM as he explained the rationale of the decision in a series of tweets. Pakistan celebrates its independence day on August 14. "May the ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’ keep reminding us of the need to remove the poison of social divisions, disharmony and further strengthen the spirit of oneness, social harmony and human empowerment," Modi said. Compliance happened immediately, with the home ministry issuing the gazette notification soon after the PM’s announcement. "The Government of India declares 14th August as ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’ to remind the present and future generations of Indians of the pain and suffering faced by the people of India during the Partition," the notification said. Home minister Amit Shah said, "I welcome PM Modi for taking this sensitive decision. The wounds of the Partition of the country and the grief of losing loved ones cannot be described in words. I am sure that 'Partition Horrors Remembrance Day' will strengthen peace, love and unity by eliminating the ill-will of discrimination and malice from society." Senior journalist and Rajya Sabha MP M J Akbar, who has studied events leading up to the Partition and its aftermath, welcomed the decision. He said people need to know about its horrors. "I wasn't born during the partition of Bengal but does it mean that I should have no knowledge of it? My last book, "Gandhi’s Hinduism, the Struggle Against Jinnah's Islam", is about those events. Unless we learn from what happened, ignorance, I'm afraid, will have very deleterious consequences." "For me the story of Partition and refugees is not only the story of the brutal tragedies that took place, but also the unbelievable miraculous story of how Gandhiji single-handedly saved Bengal from havoc by going on a fast and putting his life on the line," he said. Retired professor of sociology at JNU, Anand Kumar, disagreed and said, "It is a worrying thing that the top leader is looking backwards. Earlier, it was citizenship and Article 370... Partition was an issue of an unholy alliance of the British and political leaders, including the Muslim League, Hindu Mahasabha, and, to an extent, the Indian National Congress. The new generation will not be impressed by the interpretation of the communal forces in the face of other global challenges and multiculturalism." Professor at JNU, Bikramaditya Kumar Choudhary, said, "Our understanding is on the basis of reading of the narratives and text and talking to people. It was not a one-day incident that you want to remember, it was also a culmination of hate politics." He said Partition happened in 1947 because there was a nurturing of hate for more than two decades. "It has always led us to disaster. And one disaster that India has faced was the hate politics, created by the colonial empire, because it suited them," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/august-14-to-be-partition-horrors-remembrance-day-pm-modi/articleshow/85339454.cms||---
---||India||Get Covid shot & inspire others, says President Kovind||NEW DELHI: While the second wave of Covid brought the health infrastructure under stress, India’s leadership rose to the challenge and the government’s efforts, supplemented by the states, private sector and civil society, helped deal with the crisis, President Ram Nath Kovind said on Saturday. Addressing the nation on the eve of Independence Day, Kovind said India has travelled a considerable distance in the 75-year journey of the Republic, and the world looks up at the miracle of India as the biggest and most vibrant democracy. Exhorting people to bear the interests of the country in mind at every step, President Kovind also paid homage to the Covid warriors who worked through the ongoing crises tirelessly and urged everyone to get vaccinated. “The reality is that no infrastructure, even of advanced economies, could withstand a crisis of such enormous proportions. Efforts were made on war-footing to plug the gaps. The leadership rose to the challenge, and the government’s endeavours were supplemented by initiatives of the states, private sector healthcare facilities, the civil society and others. In this extraordinary mission, foreign nations shared the essentials generously, just as India had reached out to many nations with medicine, equipment and vaccines. I am grateful to the global fraternity that came forward with a helping hand,” he said. He added that no one should let their guard down. “Vaccines are the best possible protection science offers to us. Under the world’s biggest vaccination campaign going on in our country, more than 50 crore fellow citizens have been vaccinated so far. I urge all eligible citizens who are yet to get vaccinated to do so at the earliest.” The President highlighted strides India’s agriculture sector has taken against all odds. Referring to his recent visit to his ancestral village Paraunkh in Kanpur Dehat district in UP, Kovind said, “The psychological distance between the urban and the rural is now much less as compared to the past.” He added that “the series of agricultural marketing reforms will empower our ‘annadata’ farmers and help them get better price for their produce”. Kovind also referred to the post-Article 370 J&K as the “rising of a new dawn” there. “The government has initiated the process of consultation with all stakeholders who have faith in democracy and the rule of law. I urge the people, especially the youth of J&K, to utilise this opportunity and work on realising their aspirations through democratic institutions,” he said. Lauding the country’s overall achievements, the President praised the Indian Olympic contingent for bringing home the highest number of medals in the history of India’s participation in the sporting event, congratulating, in particular, the women sportspersons for overcoming adversities to excel on the playground. “From higher educational institutions to armed forces, from laboratories to playgrounds, our daughters are making their mark. In this success of our daughters, I see a glimpse of a developed India of the future,” the President said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/get-covid-shot-inspire-others-says-president-kovind/articleshow/85339764.cms||---

It has not yet reached such a level (advance or lower) of civilization where unmarried girls, regardless of their religion, indulge in carnal activities with boys just for the fun of it, unless it is backed by some future promise, assurance of marriage,” observed Justice the bench of Justice Subodh Abhyankar, adding: “And to prove her point, it is not necessary every time for a victim to try to commit suicide as in the present case.” The complainant had taken poison on June 2 this year, a day after she was allegedly denied marriage. Police took her ‘dying declaration’, but she fortunately survived. The accused faces charges under IPC sections 376 (rape), 376(2N) (repeated rape of the same woman), 366 (kidnaping or inducing woman to compel marriage) and various sections of Pocso Act at Mahakal police station in Ujjain. His counsel, Umesh Sharma, submitted before the court that the accused had a two-year affair with the complainant and they had entered into a physical relationship on their free will. Sharma argued that the complainant is 21 years old and had falsely said, under the pressure of family members, that the incident took place around three years ago. The parents of both the accused and complainant were against the marriage because of their religion, so it can’t be said under these circumstances that the accused committed rape, advocate Sharma said. The government counsel opposed the bail, saying that the accused had repeatedly raped the woman since October 2018 on the pretext of marriage, and on June 1 this year refused to marry her because he was marrying elsewhere. This led to the suicide attempt, he pointed out. After hearing both sides, the court denied bail to the accused and observed that in majority of rape cases, the defence of the accused is that the “prosecutrix was a consenting party and in most of the cases the accused gets the benefit of doubt. “A boy who is entering into a physical relationship with a lass must realize that his actions have consequences and should be ready to face the same as it is the girl who is always at the receiving end because it is, she who runs the risk of being pregnant and also her ignominy in society if her relationship is disclosed,” said the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/unmarried-girls-in-india-dont-do-carnal-activities-for-fun-madhya-pradesh-high-court/articleshow/85339931.cms||---
---||India||Indian Ocean is warming but what does that mean for us?||A recent IPCC report sounded the red alert and issued arguably its strongest warning on climate change. It says that the Indian Ocean is warming at a higher rate than other oceans. TOI breaks it down for youHow much has the Indian Ocean warmed?The Indian Ocean has warmed faster than the global average. Surface temperature of the tropical Indian Ocean rose by 1°C on average during 1951–2015, compared to the global average of 0.7°C. The Indian Ocean is not the only ocean to warm faster than global average—the western equatorial Pacific Ocean has too. Why has the Indian Ocean warmed faster than the global average?A tropical ocean gets a lot of heat, according to Swapna Panickal, scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. And in the case of the Indian Ocean, the body of water is landlocked to the north—by the South Asian land mass—-causing heat to accumulate in the northern parts. By comparison, the Atlantic Ocean is open to the northern polar regions allowing heat to dissipate into cooler waters. Another possible reason: the southwest monsoon circulation, which plays a role in directing heat of north Indian Ocean southwards, has weakened in recent decades. That may have allowed more heat to accumulate in north Indian Ocean. Does that mean the region’s sea levels have risen faster too?Not necessarily. Sea levels in the north Indian Ocean rose at the rate of 1.06–1.75 mm-1 a year from 1874 to 2004 and 3.3 mm year−1 between 1993–2015. That’s comparable to global mean sea level rise. However, relative sea levels are thought to have increased faster. What are relative sea-levels and why have they increased faster in Asia?Relative sea levels refer to the level of the sea in relation to land. For instance, the northern coasts of the Bay of Bengal--West Bengal and Bangladesh--have seen sea levels rising by 5mm and more a year (compared to the overall 3.3mm in the north Indian Ocean). This is because the Bengal delta is sinking, adding to the effect of sea level rise. Land subsidence is occurring in many parts of Asia, especially in deltas, due to both natural and development factors. Parts of Jakarta, for instance, are sinking as much as 10 cm a year. What about future sea-level rise in the region?If Indian Ocean continues to warm faster than global average, sea levels could start rising faster. Unlike some oceans, most sea level rise in the Indian Ocean is caused by warming—because water expands in volume when it warms—and not so much due to the melting of glaciers and ice. But there is uncertainty around the melting of ice sheets, such as the Greenland ice sheet, that contributes to global mean sea level rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indian-ocean-is-warming-but-what-does-that-mean-for-us/articleshow/85340096.cms||---

The Myanmar-based faction had declared a three-month ceasefire from May 15, citing the "unprecedented" situation created by the pandemic. It has now extended the truce by another three months, leaving the government hopeful of a breakthrough in attempts to bring the outfit to the negotiating table. "This is a very, very positive and encouraging announcement. A few days ago, it decided not to give the usual I-Day bandh call. I wish that this ceasefire becomes a permanent one and Ulfa(I), under the leadership of Paresh Baruah, comes to the nation’s mainstream with full dignity," said CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, who had flagged peace talks as his top priority immediately after assuming office on May 10. This Independence Day will be the first instance since 1996 of Ulfa not calling a strike on August 15. As for a truce, Ulfa had twice before gone back on such overtures. In March 1991, undivided Ulfa had declared a unilateral ceasefire while proposing negotiations with the Centre. The then governor, DD Thakur, agreed to facilitate talks, but Baruah never took it forward. It transpired that the Ulfa commander-in-chief used the ceasefire only to reorganise the outfit's ranks amid Army's Operation Bajrang. Nine months later, Baruah once again declared a ceasefire, but that turned out to be an eyewash as well. In 2006, when the late author Mamoni Raisom Goswami tried to revive the bid to initiate talks, Ulfa declared "restraint" but never a unilateral truce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-i-day-overture-ulfa-extends-truce-for-first-time/articleshow/85340134.cms||Prabin Kalita

The process of disengagement has been completed successfully at some of the places,” said Singh, in his address to the armed forces on the eve of Independence Day. Turning to Pakistan, the minister said the situation along the Line of Control has remained “under control”, and infiltration has been checked, over the last one year due to “the alertness, indomitable valour and vigilance” of Indian soldiers. The border ceasefire violations have also come down after the fresh truce with Pakistan in February this year. If “non-violence is our ultimate duty”, protecting the nation’s integrity is equally important. “We will always be ready to do anything in the defence of the country, no matter what price may be paid for it. To maintain peace and prosperity, it is necessary that you should always be alert in the defence of the nation,” said Singh. The government is leaving “no stone unturned” to meet the operational requirements of the armed forces. The capital outlay in the annual defence budget has been increased from Rs 1.13 lakh crore to Rs 1.35 lakh crore, which is an increase of 18.75% from the previous financial year. Citing the ongoing induction of the 36 Rafale fighter jets from France and the recent Rs 46,000 crore order for 83 indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft, he said the “operational edge” and combat capability of the IAF is being steadily enhanced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-talks-on-but-be-ready-for-any-challenge-defence-minister-rajnath-to-armed-forces/articleshow/85340152.cms||---

One of them, however, swam to safety. Dozens of villages under Terasia and Sarampur diara are inundated with floodwaters. As a result, a large number of people have taken shelter near the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. A health centre has also been set up near the old toll plaza on the northern side of the bridge to provide treatment to the victims. According to sources, community kitchens are being run and boats pressed into service to evacuate the people from the flood-ravaged villages. Water ambulances have also been made available in some of the worst affected villages. Woman dies: Wakeel Rai, a resident of Miranpur village under Raghopur block in Vaishali district, is cursing his fate for his failure to arrange a country boat for his pregnant wife, Nisha Devi. After she complained of labour pain on Thursday evening, Nisha was rushed to the local primary health centre at Raghopur Fatehpur village. She developed some complications during delivery and was referred to the Patna Medical College and Hospital. A worried Wakeel tried to arrange a boat for his wife, but in vain.

He said CM Nitish Kumar should also make such a declaration from Gandhi Maidan if the Centre does not pay heed to the state’s demand for a caste-based census. “If not Parliament, then from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I demand PM Modi to announce a caste-based census in the country for the holistic development of the poor, suppressed, backwards and extremely backwards (sic),” Tejashwi tweeted. He said the PM was not giving time to Nitish for a meeting on the issue. “Since central government has said no to caste census, Nitish should announce it from state expenditure during his Independence Day speech at Gandhi Maidan,” Tejashwi added. Earlier in the day, Tejashwi had criticized the PM for observing August 14 as ‘Partition Horror Remembrance Day’. When mediapersons sought Tejashwi’s comment on Modi’s declaration, he said, “The PM is a follower of Britishers who ruled the country once. He believes in the policy of divide and rule.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pm-should-announce-caste-census-from-red-fort-today/articleshow/85334848.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The Vizag mutiny, in which Indian soldiers took up arms against British officers, started on October 3, 1780. Heritage conservationists in the city have demanded the state government develop a memorial in recognition of the first Indian uprising against the British in One Town in the city. Speaking to STOI, history buff and heritage conservationist Vijjeswarapu Edward Paul said British records state that three British officers were killed in the mutiny. “The chief of the settlement was imprisoned, the treasury and armoury were looted, and the cantonment was plundered. Then, the mutineers started to march south to join Hyder Ali’s forces to fight against the British. After a few days, with the help of the zamindars and their forces, the mutineers were apprehended on October 8, 1780 and brought back to Visakhapatnam. They were tried for the mutiny and looting. All three British officers might have been buried at the Old European Cemetery in the city. But today only the grave of a young officer by the name Kingsford Venner is left intact. The inscription on this grave mentioning the mutiny stands testimony to that event,” said Paul. Paul went on to add that nearly 25 years after this revolt, another mutiny took place in Vellore, in which about 130 British soldiers were killed. “Though the number of British personnel killed were more in number, the mutiny at Visakhapatnam happens to be the first in India’s history. But in 2006, the then Tamil Nadu government celebrated its 200 year jubilee, claiming the mutiny to be the first in India.” “I request the government authorities to raise a memorial in recognition of the first mutiny. The city of Visakhapatnam will thereby find a place of glory in the story of the freedom struggle of the country,” said Paul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/historians-call-for-memorial-to-mark-countrys-first-mutiny/articleshow/85335451.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The man, now aged 50, was involved in a "road accident". According to police, he is a native of Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh and was found living in disguise as a Garhwali (a native of Garhwal hills) near Nepali Farm in Dehradun. He also learnt Garhwali dialect over the years and started a Hindi weekly newspaper, while "in hiding".

It looks bad. The graffiti would lend an arty touch to the art capital of India and maybe, discourage people from spoiling the walls,” said Rajanvir Singh Kapur, MD of WBTC, which is leading the campaign, ‘Colours of Kolkata, #coloursofkolkata,’ to celebrate the diversity of Kolkata this Independence Day. “In future, eminent artists of Kolkata will be invited to help create public art at prominent locations to make the city even more beautiful.” Famous personalities from Kolkata, past and present, will be portrayed on several other wallsFamous personalities from Kolkata, past and present, will be portrayed on several other wallsThe campaign has started off with remembering Tagore and Ray on their 160th and 100th birth anniversaries. Graffiti, representing their lives and works, is being painted on the wall of the WBTC tram depot at Park Circus. The next locations in line are the Tollygunge depot, opposite Tolly Club, and the Gariahat depot near Ballygunge Phari. Those involved in the project hope to cover most of the walls by Durga Puja. The first two art work have been curated by WBTC, in collaboration with a city-based art campaigner, Mudar Patherya, and his group. “The objective of #coloursofkolkata is to utilize the public walls to send out the message that Kolkata is artificially and aesthetically one of the most vibrant cities.

---||Patna||Patna schools admitting pupils on basis of merit||PATNA: In view of the fact that conducting entrance exams amid the Covid-19 pandemic is a Herculean task, several city schools are admitting Class X pass-outs based on merit, cut-off marks and aptitude tests. Loyola High School, for instance, will not select Class XI students on the basis of any entrance test, but their merit. Its principal, Brother Sudhakar Reddy SG, told this reporter, “It is quite difficult for us to select the candidates because a large number of them scored very high marks in the Class X exams. We have, therefore, issued a cut-off list.” He added, “The cut-off marks for admitting CBSE students to the science stream is 85% (maths, science, and English) and that for their ICSE counterparts is 80% in the three subjects. Pupils interested in commerce and arts streams require 75% each in social studies, maths and English.” Brother Sudhakar also pointed out that priority would be given to Loyolites. The official website of St Michael’s High School (SMHS) says, “For the science stream, we expect an average of 85% or the corresponding grade in maths and science. An aggregate of 70% or the corresponding grade is a must for the commerce stream.” SMHS is also considering factors like regular attendance in classes IX and X, character and conduct of the candidates and their performance in an aptitude test. Its principal, Fr Armstrong Edison SJ, said, “The admission process is nearing completion now.” Like Loyola, Notre Dame Academy (NDA) is giving priority to its former students. For non-NDA students, the cut-off for science and commerce streams is 90% and that for arts is 85%. Mary Alphonsa, the principal of Don Bosco Academy, said, “We first retained our students after their board results were announced. Others are being admitted to Class XI on the basis of their pre-board marks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schools-admitting-pupils-to-class-xi-on-basis-of-merit/articleshow/85335095.cms||Faryal Rumi

Till Friday, the last bus left its terminus at 5.30pm or 6pm as bus workers had to complete their round trip and get back to garages well before 9pm. Anyone failing to reach their garage was asked by police to pay a hefty fine. However, with the extra two hours, bus owners said they are confident of providing services till 10pm-10.30pm. “The challenge for private buses plying on the north-south corridor was especially difficult. A bus plying on route 230 had to leave Kamarhati by 5.30pm or a bus plying on route 222 from Bonhooghly (Baranagar) had to leave around 5pm in order to reach Alipore Zoo and Behala Chowrasta with ample time to return to their garages on the northern fringes of the city on time. Buses going to North and South 24 Parganas were terminating routes midway,” said a bus owner. Buses on shorter routes — from north or south Kolkata to Howrah or Esplanade — set last trips around 6.30pm. “Now that the CM has announced her decision, we are confident of providing services well past 9pm. Depending on where one stays, the last bus will reach its destination between 10om-10.30pm,” said Pradip Nasrayan Bose of the West Bengal Bus and Minibus Association. Tapan Bandhopadhyay, secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, however, has a word of caution. “Just because there is an extension of normal activities, we will not run our entire fleet till night. We are still making losses — a reason we have given a clarion call to save mass private transport on August 14. Unless we make money, we might not change the timetable,” he said, adding that a section of long-distance passengers have shifted to bikes and cars in absence of local trains. Kalyan Chowdhury, who travels to Shyambazar from Behala, said, “The last bus leaves between 5pm and 5.30pm. I need to stay in office till 6pm. I had to break my journey and never reached home before 8pm. I hope things change from Monday.” “Each bus is following a separate fare structure and timing. I hope things improve on Monday,” said Saikat Mukherjee, who travels from Sealdah to Tollygunge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-hour-breather-to-help-office-goers-get-buses-home/articleshow/85335751.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The employees intensified the agitation after the assistant executive officer B Ramachari, who submitted a report on the incident, died of a cardiac arrest. The protesters alleged this was due to the ‘pressure’ mounted on him. According to temple employees, Subba Reddy sacrificed a goat on the temple premises after he recovered from Covid-19 in July. Some employees and religious organisations said the action goes against the rules of Sri Vaishnava. The endowments department had constituted an inquiry committee under the assistane EO. Temple employees alleged that Ramachari submitted a report confirming animal sacrifice at the temple but it was swept under the carpet by the EO and other senior officials. Employees also demanded action against the EO for allegedly pressurising Ramachari. Meanwhile, the EO staged a counter protest, alleging that employees were blaming him for his strict work ethic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/staffers-call-to-suspend-eo-over-animal-sacrifice/articleshow/85335656.cms||---
---||Patna||Education department targets to increase Bihar's GER to 30%||PATNA: The education department has launched an intensive drive to enhance the state’s gross enrolment ratio (GER) from 14.5% to 30% by the end of the decade. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary told this newspaper on Friday that the state’s GER would be equal to the national average (27.1%) soon as “the results of the sincere efforts being made by the government have already started bearing fruit”. “The state’s GER has increased from 13.6% to 14.5% in just one year,” he added. The minister also pointed out that, “Now, there is at least one +2 school in every panchayat and steps have been initiated to upgrade the eligible institutes as degree colleges. Steps are also being taken to avoid unnecessary delay in the grant of affiliation to degree colleges which fulfil the requisite criteria.” The government has already decided to open eight new model degree colleges in different areas of the state for promoting quality education. Four of these have been set up in Gaya, Araria, Katihar and Purnia and sites for the remaining are being identified. “Private universities and higher education institutions of national repute are also being set up,” he said. Choudhary further pointed out that the department would soon take up the issue of distance education with the Union government so that “all the existing centres of distance education continue to function smoothly and impart higher education to the youth”. He added, “The University Grants Commission will be approached to relax its recent condition of recognizing the Directorate of Distance Education of only the universities which are NAAC-accredited with ‘A’ grade. With this impractical condition, all the distance education centres will face closure, giving a big jolt to the government’s effort to enhance its GER. In the meantime, the universities have also been asked to take necessary steps for improving their grades.” The Bihar State Higher Education Council’s vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha said the council had earlier planned that higher education institutions in rural and mofussil areas would launch a door-to-door campaign to attract the youths in the age group of 18-23 years. But, it could not materialize owing to the second wave of Covid-19. Now, this campaign would be launched more effectively with the help of mukhiyas and sarpanches in every gram panchayat soon. “The National Service Scheme wing of different universities and colleges have also been directed to launch enrolment drives in their adopted villages,” he added. Efforts are also being made to make science education more attractive and purposeful by giving impetus to laboratory work. “Institutions with well-developed labs will be earmarked in each district where students of other colleges in groups of 16 can attend practical classes at least for 10 days in each session. Besides, mobile laboratories with all the essential equipment and chemicals will move from one college to the other for facilitating practical training to the students in rural areas,” Jha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/education-department-targets-to-increase-ger-to-30/articleshow/85334971.cms||B K Mishra

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: 600-year heritage of Kuchipudi village waits for Unesco tag||VIJAYAWADA: With Ramappa temple in Telangana fetching the Unesco world heritage site tag, artistes and historians have raised demands to bring into focus the heritage of Andhra Pradesh. Chief among these is Kuchipudi. Located around 60 kilometres from Vijayawada, Kuchipudi village is the birthplace of the centuries-old dance form. Families residing here pass on knowledge of the art to younger generations, highlighting the village’s eligibility to be identified as a world heritage site. In fact, Kuchipudi is the only village that gives its name to a dance form that has drawn international reputation for centuries. The dance has been performed since 1502 CE by members of Brahmin families residing in the village. Women were initially not allowed to perform. Historians say the village was known as ‘Kuchelapuri’, the land where Lord Krishna’s devotee Kuchela lived. Bhagavathula, a local group from the Brahmin community, used to perform a specific dance that was known as the ‘Bhagavathula Melam’. The basic principles of the dance form have their roots in Bharata’s Natya Shastra and only men from Bhagavathula families were allowed to perform it. Sidhendra Yogi, who is considered a guru of the form, trained hundreds of youth from the village and his composition ‘Bhama Kalapam’ earned a unique identity across the globe. Historians point out that the Bhagavatula families of Kuchipudi did not get any support from rulers of the region until Nawab Abdul Hasan Tahnishah of Golconda saw a performance during his visit to the city of Masoola (Machilipatnam). Impressed with the dance form, he made enquiries and came to know that it had no specific name. He then named the dance after the village of Kuchipudi. Tahnishah also gifted 600 acres of land in the name of Kuchipudi Agraharam to the Brahmin families that were working towards the preservation of the dance form. The nawab also freed the artists from paying taxes and asked them to instead focus their attention on the dance. Since then, one male child from the family is initiated into the art form at the age of 5 years and 5 days, considered to be the most auspicious time for starting the course. The tradition continues to this day. The history of Kuchipudi village and archives preserved locally were washed away during the 1977 cyclonic storm. The literature included the evolution of the art form, its history and royal patronage in the past. At present, only a few vetaran artistes and gurus know the heritage of the village. Locals regret that both Centre and state failed to portray the village as a heritage site. Chinta Bala Krishna, a natya guru from Kuchipudi, said, “Our village is identified under indigenous tourism project by the Union ministry of tourism and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). But no activity is done to boost tourism here. Many artists who trained at gurukuls in the village are taking the art form to future generations. But governments should focus on preserving the heritage structures and natyalayas in the village.” Some organisations such as Silicon Andhra and Andhra Arts Academy have conducted record performances of Kuchipudi with thousands of artists, garnering international recognition, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/600-yr-heritage-of-kuchipudi-village-waits-for-unesco-tag/articleshow/85335579.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 50% rider on opening draws mixed reaction from artists||KOLKATA: The state’s notification on Friday that has allowed reopening of cinema halls, manchas, auditoriums and open-air theatres with 50% occupancy has generated mixed reactions. If Bhoomi’s Soumitra Ray wants to start the moment he gets an assignment, Lakhhichhara’s Gaurab Chatterjee wants to wait for at least a month due to health concerns. According to Pt Subhen Chatterjee, classical concerts hardly happen in Kolkata during this time of the year.  “Few can draw a full house for ticketed concerts. Allowing 50% occupancy is huge for our fraternity. However, it will take time for classical concerts to reboot,” he said.Cactus frontman Sidhu performed a pre-Independence Day solo show in Khardah on Saturday. “Talks are on for a ticketed show of Cactus on August 21,” he said. However, Chandrabindoo’s Upal Sengupta is unsure of the audience turnout now. Singer Lopamudra Mitra believes that restarting this year will not be as easy as it was in 2020. She was the first Bengali singer to perform at a live open-air show for a Bijoya Sammelani programme at Kankurgachhi when the government allowed events to resume last year. “There are more challenges this year. Listeners have interest, but hardly the money to buy tickets now,” she said. Rupam Islam of Fossils isn’t interested in jumping on the bandwagon yet. The last live show Fossils had was in March 2020. “I am not interested in restarting with 50% occupancy. The mood will be missing. No organiser will want to pay full money and artist remuneration since it is difficult to recover the investment with a 50% capacity,” he said. Yet, some want to take the risk. Aneek group theatre, which staged a play at Tapan Theatre on August 8 before this notification was issued, has already planned its next. Its secretary Arup Roy said, “We applied at Star Theatre and will be performing ‘Project Manhattan’ on August 28.” DumDum Shabdomugdho Naatyokendra has taken inspiration from Aneek’s August 8 show. The group’s director and president Rakesh Ghosh has decided to stage ‘Sappho Chitrangadaa’ at Tapan Theatre on August 21. “We have been collecting money and relief material to support artists and technicians involved with theatre. But I felt this effort was humiliating for them too. They want work and not dole to survive. When their counterparts in serials and films can shoot and earn, they, too, should get the opportunity. That’s why we decided to stage a play next Saturday,” Ghosh said. Debesh Chattopadhyay, who now divides his time between the Hills and Kolkata, wants to stage a Sansriti production in early September when he returns to the city. But Nandikar does not want to begin before Pujas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/50-rider-on-opening-draws-mixed-reaction-from-artists/articleshow/85335732.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Dr Guleria was bestowed Gitam Deemed-to-be University’s 41st Foundation Award in Visakhapatnam on Saturday. Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the award ceremony, Dr Guleria said the only unpredictable factor that may affect the trajectory of the third wave could be constant mutations of the virus. “However, I believe the impact of the third wave may not be as bad as the second wave. But people should understand we are yet to overcome the second wave as India is still reporting about 40,000 cases a day,” said Dr Guleria. When asked if any vaccine tweaking is needed for the mutations, the AIIMS director said existing Covid-19 vaccines are effective against all variants. Even if vaccine recipients contract the virus, the disease will be milder and prevent deaths, he said. In reply to a question on the need for booster shots, Dr Guleria said booster shots can be considered only after vaccinating all people in the country. Answering a query on the anticipated impact of the third wave on children, Dr Guleria said there is no scientific evidence to prove that it may disproportionately affect kids. “It is only a general assumption. As per the recent sero-survey, about 50% of kids have developed antibodies against the virus, which points to the fact that they may have contracted the virus from other infected family members, but might have remained asymptomatic or escaped with mild symptoms,” said Dr Guleria. Dr Guleria said Andhra Pradesh is doing well in terms of Covid-19 management. “Daily case numbers in Andhra Pradesh are on the declining trajectory. We need to be more vigilant , through aggressive testing, tracing and tracking, localised strategies and mini lockdowns in Covid-19 hotspots,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/public-behaviour-vaccines-to-decide-3rd-wave/articleshow/85335310.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Addressing them, the minister said, “Keeping in mind the closure of schools for a long period amid the pandemic, it should be ensured that schools function for full hours on all working days and the teachers give their 100%. All the regional officers of the education department should visit the schools under their jurisdiction regularly and ensure that the Covid guidelines are implemented. Schools and their surroundings should be kept clean and well sanitized.” He further directed the officials to make sure that all the teachers and non-teaching staff of different schools are fully vaccinated and adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour.

The KRMB team, which inspected the project site as per the directive of National Green Tribunal, found many deviations during the inspection. The three-member panel—comprising KRMB member convenor DM Raipure, member (power) LB Muanthang, and CWC expert Darpan Talwar—has reportedly submitted its report to the NGT. “Though no work was under progress at the time of the visit, many works have already been carried out more than what was required,” the KRMB team said in the report. It said it found two batching plants were installed at the site, and coarse aggregates, fine aggregates and sand aggregates were staked behind the batching plants. It also enclosed pictures to defend its arguments. The team said the delivery cistern has been excavated to its full length and width. It further said that the significant depth of cistern was excavated and the link canal of the length of 500 metres is proposed to connect the Srisailam right main canal. The KRMB team further said that 10 out of the 12 proposed tunnels have already been excavated for erection of 5m dia pipeline (delivery main). It said the excavation of tunnels for short length for about 35-50m has been carried out. Shot-creting at the initial area was also observed by the team. The KRMB team said it observed that full length (250m) and 40m width pumphouse pit has been excavated for EL 730ft. “The pump house pit excavation levels were observed to be below the level of invert of delivery tunnels. To support the rock mass in the form of shot-creting with pattern rock bolting has been observed on the vertically excavated walls of the pump house,” said the inspection panel. The team added that it noticed that a major portion of fore bay with full length of 237m width has been excavated at varying levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/krmb-committee-says-excess-works-carried-out-at-rlis-site/articleshow/85335543.cms||Samdani MN
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: August 17 date for revamped Bagree block inauguration||KOLKATA: Bagree Market in Burrabazar, where a fire blazed for over 100 hours three years ago and left one block with 200-plus shops and offices gutted, has undergone a makeover and now sports a brand new white-and-blue façade. The entire Rs 20 crore spent on the renovation has been contributed by the owners of 1,022 shops, offices and godowns in the market. Of this, Rs 15 crore was spent on reconstructing A Block. While the rest of the market was revamped and opened for business on April 25, 2019, work on the A Block, where concrete had peeled off pillars and beams after being exposed to extreme heat for days, got underway on July 17, 2019. The section reconstructed with spacious aisles, new elevators and washrooms is all set to be inaugurated on August 17. The 23-month overhaul of this severely damaged portion of the market facing Canning Street was supervised by engineers from IIT Roorkee and executed by a specialised firm from Baroda. “The September 2018 inferno had destroyed Block A completely and damaged the rest of the market. But we pooled resources and decided to script a turnaround. We are now set to unveil a brand new Block A that looks like a portion of a mall,” said Asutosh Singh, president of the market’s shopow-ners’ association. The fresh coat of paint that Bagree Market has received for the first time in several decades makes it stand out in a cluster of dilapidated and rundown buildings in the locality. But there is more to it than just the external makeover. Inside, the market has undergone a thorough alteration with corridors cleared out and false ceilings torn down. Bright lights and fire detection and fighting gadgets have been installed. “There are separate electric panels for different floors replete with modern fire-fighting system. A new lift has been installed, which will be operational in a couple of days. There are separate washrooms for men and women with special arrangements for senior citizens,” said Singh. In the months that followed the blaze, experts from Roorkee inspected the damage, conducted tests and chalked out a repair plan. While the extreme heat had caused concrete to flake off, the steel joints used in the construction of columns and beams had stayed intact. “High-quality Belgian steel used during construction in the 1960s had withstood the heat. So, all the concrete was stripped off along with the walls. Then steel jacketing was done and repair was carried out with micro-concrete that is 10 times stronger than the reinforced cement concrete that is usually used,” an engineer overseeing the repair said. “We have not only installed state-of-the-art fire safety equipment and changed all the electrical wiring, but a new SOP has been put in place to ensure there is no encroachment in the corridors. We have employed two fire officers and two electricians to ensure compliance at all times and meet any exigency,” said market association core committee member Girish Vasandan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/aug-17-date-for-revamped-bagree-block-inauguration/articleshow/85335768.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The live telecast of the programme will be available on different digital platforms from 8am. The movement of vehicles on all roads leading to Gandhi Maidan will be restricted from 7am till the main event ends. As many as eight tableaux on various social issues will be displayed on the occasion. Meanwhile, a large number of people flocked to different markets to buy India’s flag and other accessories like badges, caps, ribbons and wrist bands on Saturday. Makeshift stalls selling flags and a wide range of other items were put up in areas like Nala Road, Kadamkuan, Ashok Rajpath, Boring Canal Road and Thakurbari Road. Mohd Shakib (43), a vendor on Bailey Road, told this reporter, “Flags and other decorative items cost anywhere between Rs 10 and Rs 550.” Confectioneries and sweetmeat shops also sold tricolour ‘barfis’ and cakes. Ajay Singh, the owner of a confectionery near Kidwaipuri, claimed, “I-Day cakes and sweets are flying off the shelves.” Another shopkeeper, Gunjan Kumar, said, “Innovative and creative I-Day sweets are quite popular among Patnaites.” Schools hold competitions: Several city schools organised different competitions on online platforms on the eve of I-Day on Saturday. While International School students participated in a flag-making competition, the pupils of Baldwin Academy took part in a Hindi speech competition on the topic ‘Aazadi Hamara Dayitva’.

---||Kolkata||Two special flights to take students to UK from Kolkata||KOLKATA: Air India will operate two special flights between Kolkata and London on August 22 and 29 to cater to the student traffic headed to the UK and the US ahead of the fall semester. AI officials said flight AI 0164 will depart London at 1.15pm on August 21 and 28 to reach Kolkata at 3.05am on August 22 and 29. The return flight will take off at 4.30am and reach London at 9.55am. “The flights are being operated to meet the rush of students travelling to the West. Apart from Kolkata, there will be similar flights departing from Amritsar, Ahmedabad and Kochi. Revival of the direct weekly flight that was discontinued in December 2020 can happen only when India moves out of the amber zone of the UK government’s alert list of countries,” an airline spokesperson said. While the news will bring cheer to students, it is disappointing for the business community as well as tourists who were hoping to travel once the weekly service is restored. Britain is among the select countries that has allowed Indian tourists to travel to the country and also done away with the requirement of institutional quarantine if flyers are fully vaccinated. It is, however, recognizing only Covishield, the vaccine licensed from Oxford AstraZeneca developed in the UK and not Covaxin that is developed in India. The carrier is operating regular flights to the UK from only Delhi and Mumbai. Travel agents in Kolkata have been lobbying for the return of the direct flight to Heathrow in London that was introduced on September 16, 2020, but withdrawn after December 22, 2020, as India severed air connectivity with the UK for 10 days to check the spread of the UK variant of Covid virus. During the second wave, India has similarly been isolated to stop the spread of the Delta and Delta plus variants that are considered to be much more infectious than the earlier strains. With the UAE gradually opening up and Switzerland, Germany, Spain and France allowing tourist travel with no quarantine requirements for those who are fully vaccinated, travel agents say a direct flight will become popular if the service is consistent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/two-special-flights-to-take-students-to-uk/articleshow/85335789.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The institute is involved in research activity in the field of Orientology. It has a huge collection of over 1.4 lakh books, including several rare titles, and 28,000 manuscripts practically covering every aspect of Orientology. The collection covers several languages and scripts, such as Sanskrit, Prakrit, Indian regional languages and classical Asian and European languages. NEARING 175 YEARS, AND EVOLVING The Pune Nagar Vachan Mandir was founded on February 7, 1848, and will enter its 175th year in 2022. It is located in Budhwar Peth and thrives as a functioning public library with a collection of over 50,000 books and more than 3,000 registered members. At a time when gadgets and social media are affecting people’s reading habit, surviving as a public library is difficult. But Pune Nagar Vachan Mandir has adapted to the changes and revamped its model to include its presence on the web and deliver books to homes. 127 YEARS ON, THE SHOW GOES ON Founded in 1894, the Bharat Natya Mandir is one of the very first platforms for experimental theatre in Marathi and hosts some of the most important drama competitions like the Purushottam Karandak, Firodiya Karandak and the Maharashtra government’s drama competition.

The increase in water level was in the range of 12cm to 16cm all along the downstream of the river from Hathidah to Kahalgaon. Consequently, panic gripped people living in the lower areas of northern Patna who remained concerned about the further increase in the water level of the river. Similar sentiments were expressed in other towns like Munger, Bhagalpur and Kahalgaon. At Hathidah, rumour spread that an embankment had been breached there since the Ganga continued to flow at its highest flood level (HFL) of 43.33 metres for the second consecutive day. The water level in the Ganga at Digha in Patna was 1.16-metre above the danger mark and at Gandhi Ghat 1.63 metres on Friday. However, on Saturday, it flowed 1.32-metre above the danger level at Digha and 1.78 metres above the red mark at Gandhi Ghat. At Gandhi Ghat, the HFL is 50.52 metres and the Ganga was flowing at 50.38-metre mark on Saturday, just 14cm below the HFL. At Kahalgaon, it was flowing 1.21-metre above the danger level and at Bhagalpur 86cm above the red mark. Water resources department (WRD) sources said the only positive sign for the day was that the river was flowing 1.59-metre below the danger level at Allahabad and only 38cm above the red mark at Varanasi, while it was steady at Buxar, flowing 83cm above the danger level. “If there is no rain in the upper reaches of the Ganga and in the basins of Ken, Betwa and Chambal rivers for a week, the Ganga will begin to flow at its danger level along its stretch in Bihar in the next one week,” a WRD source said. On the other hand, WRD is expecting the third peak of the flood in the state between August 15 and September 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ganga-water-level-in-patna-rises-further-by-15cm/articleshow/85334756.cms||Abhay Singh

Rajesh allegedly developed illegal intimacy with Rinku before getting married to Pooja. To maintain his relationship, Rajesh voluntarily took the responsibility of meeting the monthly expenses of the couple. Sanjeeth and Rinku felt that if they eliminate Pooja, Rajesh will again share a room with them and take care of their expenses. In the absence of Rajesh, the accused couple smothered Pooja to death and later claimed that two unidentified persons came and killed Pooja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/couple-held-for-womans-murder/articleshow/85337006.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM orders probe into vandalism by Shiv Sainiks||NAGPUR: A month after Shiv Sena activists allegedly ransacked vehicles of a NHAI contractor in Washim and also set machinery on fire, Union transportation minister Nitin Gadkari has dashed off an angry letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray. “It came to my notice that these leaders are making unauthorised demands from the contractors. They are harassed and threatened in case the demands are not fulfilled. They’re creating hurdles in many projects, particularly in Washim district,” Gadkari, the Nagpur MP, wrote. After the letter was received by the chief minister’s office (CMO), Thackeray ordered home minister Dilip Walse Patil to conduct an inquiry and act against the culprits. Subsequently, the state DGP was asked to act immediately and the local police booked several persons, including Sena activists, under various offences. The home department had sought a complete report from the DGP in this regard. Gadkari’s July 25 letter was reportedly leaked from the home department. The Union ministry of road transport and highways had sanctioned a large number of projects in Maharashtra. Many of those have been completed and others are in progress. Four lanes of Akola to Nanded 202km national highways are being constructed in four packages. Package-2 from Gedshi to Washim also includes construction of a bypass (length 12km) for Washim city. However, the Shiv Sena leaders allegedly stopped the work on the bypass and the main road. “The work on Malegaon to Risod highway has been completed except for one bridge on the Painganga river. The contractor has been stopped completing it by public representatives. Whenever he restarts work, the activists threaten him. We’ve urged the contractor to finish remaining work as early as possible in available resources,” the BJP heavyweight mentioned in his letter. The Union ministry has also undertaken works of Rs135 crore on highways passing through Pulgaon-Karanja-Malegaon-Mehkar and Sindkhedraja, which is in worse condition and a PIL has been filed in Nagpur bench of Bombay HC in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-orders-probe-into-vandalism-by-shiv-sainiks/articleshow/85338860.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Monsoon has hit supply and production of edible oils and pulses, which has impacted its prices. “Due to the pandemic, production in oil mills hasn’t returned to normal yet as workers who migrated are yet to return to their workplace. Also due to rise in fuel prices, transportation costs have increased. Till December last year, we were witnessing panic buying of edible oils which led to supply issues. These are a few reasons why prices have increased,” said Pankaj Gupta, a wholesaler of edible oils based at Sodala. He added that prices of edible oils have doubled compared to last year, but by September there is a possibility to witness a slight dip in the rates. Traders admitted that prices of mustard oil are at an all-time high. “We had witnessed slight dip in prices, but from August 10 onwards, prices have increased again,” said Namo Narayan Mittal, a wholesale dealer of grocery items. Similar is the condition of pulses and dry fruits. “Till June, we were selling calfornia (variety) of almonds between Rs 600 and Rs 650 per kg, but it is now been sold between Rs 900 and Rs 950.

In all, 150 cyclists signed a pledge to donate their organs. They also motivated others to donate organs and save the lives of the needy. “It is a myth that signing or taking a pledge for organ donation will allow the government to harvest the organs when a person is declared brain dead. Before harvesting the organs, the doctors take consent from the family and only after that the organs are retrieved. Those who are taking pledge should inform the families that they wanted to donate their organs in case they are declared brain dead after an accident or any other medical condition,” said Dr Manish Sharma, coordinator, State Organ Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) On the occasion, SMS Medical College principal and controller Dr Sudhir Bhandari said the institute now has developed heart transplant and liver transplant facilities.

So far, six people have been arrested in connection with the incident. “Three persons arrested on Friday evening have been identified as Ankit Verma alias Gadumma, Keshu and Shivam. Of these, Keshu was named in the FIR,” DCP South Raveena Tyagi said on Saturday. The police are now on the lookout for other accused. Three accused arrested earlier on Thursday in connection with the incident were released on bail from the police station itself. The Barra police had filed an FIR under IPC sections 147, 323, 504 and 506 against a local man, who runs a marriage band, his son and around 10 unknown people based on a complaint by the victim, Afsar Ahmed. To recall, a woman resident of Kacchi Basti had accused her neighbours Saddam, Salman and one Mukul of molesting her daughter and getting her converted with the lure of Rs 20,000. The police had registered a case on July 31, but in the absence of evidence during preliminary investigation, the police did not file a section of conversion in the FIR. In protest against this, the local activists had created ruckus at Ram Gopal crossing in Kachchi Basti in Barra on Wednesday evening. When Afsar, a relative of one of the molesters, passed by with his seven-year-old daughter, the activists allegedly dragged and thrashed him severely.

---||Allahabad||Police arrest criminal who shot himself to implicate accomplices||Prayagraj: A 22-year-old Pratapgarh based criminal, who had shot himself in the lower abdomen part on August 6 and then tried to implicate three of his accomplices by accusing them of shooting him, was arrested by police on Saturday. The criminal, Noor Mohammad alias Paglu, had executed a sensational loot in the Utrav area in the trans-Ganga pocket of Prayagrah district last month along with the two other accused who he falsely named for shooting him. He had planned to implicate his partners in crime as they refused to share the booty with him. Noor Mohammad alias Paglu, a resident of Misirpur Mustarkahad, shot himself near his village under the limits of Mandhata police station of Pratapgarh district on August 6. He was taken into custody by the Pratapgarh police on Saturday after he underwent treatment at a hospital in Prayagraj. Police said that Noor Mohammad himself informed police about him getting shot with the claim that two unidentified bike-borne miscreants had shot at him and left him critically injured. The police, acting upon the complaint, lodged a case under sections 195 and 307 of IPC with Mandhata police station and started the investigations. The senior cops were stunned on Saturday when they learnt that the criminal had hatched the conspiracy only to implicate his accomplices with whom he had committed a loot in Utrav in Prayagraj district. Deputy SP (Raniganj) Atul Anjan Tripathi told TOI that Noor Mohammad had a dispute with his accomplices over sharing the loot amount and that to implicate them in a fake case, he had hatched the entire conspiracy and shot himself on August 6 outside his native village of Misirpur Mustarkahad. He added that when police connected the links regarding the incident during investigations, cops found that the criminal wanted to implicate his gang’s accomplices and hence shot himself with the help of an illegal weapon. Noor has around half a dozen criminal cases pending against him in police stations of Prayagraj and Pratapgarh. Police on Saturday also recovered a 0.315 bore country-made pistol and one used cartridge which he had used to injure himself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/police-arrest-criminal-who-shot-himself-to-implicate-accomplices/articleshow/85338989.cms||---

The rivers are further receding at a much faster pace. However, many people in the flood relief camps are reluctant to return to their homes, fearing that water level might again increase. After flowing above the danger level (84.73m) for about ten days, both the rivers have receded below it at all the three measuring points of the district. Flood water has also retreated in rural areas, giving relief to thousands of villagers and cattle who had taken refuge in the relief camps. The level of Ganga (as recorded at 4.00pm of Saturday) at Phaphamau was 83.96m, and at Chhatnag, it was at recorded as 83.04m. At Naini, Yamuna was flowing at 83.72m, which is far below the danger level. Ganga is receding at a speed of 7cm per hour at Phaphamau and 5cm per hour at Chhatnag. Likewise, Yamuna at Naini is receding with a speed of 6cm per hour. Flood water is decreasing in several areas of the city, including Chota Baghara, Bara Baghara, Bakshi Khurd, Sadiabad, Shivkuti, Guas Nagar, Salori, Karelabagh, Daragunj, Nagvasuki and Harshvardhan Nagar. Many localities, which where earlier approachable only by boats, can now be reached by cycle or even by walking. While some of the people have started returning to their houses, others who are still in the camps are providing essential items to those who had opted to stay back at home, mostly to guard their belongings. “In our locality, while the families had shifted to relief camps, it was the responsibility of students like us to guard the belongings. But now as the water is receding, many people are coming back,” said Rajesh Patel, a student in Chota Baghara locality. Meanwhile, the retreating water is leaving a trail of damage caused by it. Piles of garbage, silt, thick rotten vegetation, filth, sewage and plastic are all left behind on the roads and areas from where the water has receded. The district administration maintained that a massive drive to clean up the localities would be taken up despite the task being mammoth. “The cleaning work has already started in localities,” said PRO of Prayagraj Municipal Corporation, PK Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ganga-yamuna-recede-further-flowing-one-metre-below-danger-mark/articleshow/85339019.cms||Rajeev Mani

The administration, meanwhile, is providing all relief material, including ration kits, to the people displaced by the flood and intensified cleaning operations in various localities. Ballia people heaved a sigh of relief as the Ganga stopped rising further after reaching 60.25-metre and became constant before reaching the all-time high flood level of 60.39-metre. As the water receded slowly, there was no relaxation in relief operations and the Varanasi Municipal Corporation was asked to finalise a strategy for immediate cleaning of the areas as flood water receded. Lives of around two lakh people have been affected in the past one week as flood water entered urban localities and villages. Also, 39,203 people of around 8,000 families were compelled to leave the flood-hit areas by August 12 when the Ganga water level reached the highest flood level of the current flood season. According to the bulletin of the Central Water Commission’s Middle Ganga Division office, the water level of the Ganga in Varanasi was 71.88-metre against the danger mark of 71.12-metre on Saturday morning and receding at the rate of 2-cm per hour. The river receded upstream at Phaphamu and Prayagraj. The Ganga has come below the danger mark of 77.72-metre in Mirzapur and the trend of further fall in water level will continue downstream. In Ghazipur, the river was flowing at 64.67-metre against the danger mark of 63.10-metre. Though water level of the Ganga has become constant in Ballia after touching the mark of 60.25-metre, the district is reeling under flood as Saryu (Ghaghra) is also on a rampage by flowing above the danger mark of 64.0-metre. Regarding the flood scene in Varanasi, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “The Gangas water level has adopted a receding trend after affecting over two lakh people in more than 40 city localities and over 100 villages in the district. As many as 39,203 people from over 8,000 families had left their places and 10% of them took shelter in flood relief camps.” “The scene has still not changed much and so far the pace of fall in water level is very slow. But, major relief is expected by Sunday evening and water will start receding sharply,” he added. “Community kitchens in 22 relief camps are continuing to serve the people taking shelter there and also the displaced people reaching there for food,” he said adding, “After distribution of 8,500 ration kits, 1,500 kits are kept in reserve. Now, focus is on ensuring availability of milk, drinking water bottles, LPG cylinders and other articles for which demands are coming from the families stranded in marooned areas on the banks of the Ganga and Varuna. The number of boats has also not been reduced from 111 in the relief operations,” he added. “VMC and other agencies concerned have been asked to start sanitation drives in flood-hit areas with the fall in water level while proper chlorination of supply water is also being ensured. Health department is also providing services to the needy people in flood-hit areas,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ganga-recedes-in-kashi-but-isstill-flowing-above-danger-mark/articleshow/85338934.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The outpatient department is now registering almost the same number of patients, which it used to register before the pandemic. Patients can be seen standing at long serpentine queues at the OPD waiting for their turn to see the doctor. Even in wards, the situation is not different. A ward of surgery department, which has a capacity of 34 beds, is currently accommodating 60 patients. “The daily registration at the outpatient department is more than 8,000 and it goes even more up to 10,000,” said Dr Rajesh Sharma, medical superintendent, SMS Hospital. While patients are coming in increased numbers, it has become quite difficult for the hospital administration to control the situation as the fear of third covid wave is looming large. However, the hospital administration appealed to patients to follow Covid appropriate behavior. But, at a time when more than 8,000 patients along with their relatives are coming to the hospital, it has become a herculean task for the administration to ensure social distancing. Besides, doctors who are providing treatment to patients, are also facing difficulties as a lot of patients are coming with complications as they delayed their treatment fearing Covid during the second wave. “We are witnessing patients with gallbladder stone, kidney stones, hernia and appendicitis. But, now such patients are coming with malignancy, jaundice and perforated appendicitis, which are complications. Actually, hernia may not be emergency, but if surgery gets delayed, it may become an emergency. So, a lot of such cases are coming and we have no option except admitting them to operate in emergency situation,” said Dr Jeevan Kankaria, professor (surgery), SMS Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/patient-footfall-in-sms-hospital-at-pre-covid-levels/articleshow/85337193.cms||---

Wechased him for more than two hours,” Singh added. Nagaur police officers further stated that they have got concrete clues on the whereabouts of the smuggler who would be arrested soon. “ We were following every protocol while chasing him.

Modi is currently held in a UK prison. Proceedings on his extradition are underway. The court also said that while releasing the property, an appropriate inventory, memo and list should be drawn before the handing over to the authority concerned. “After release of the property from attachment by the prosecution ED, it shall be dealt with strictly in the manner provided by law ... ,” the court said.

The NHRC was hearing a plea filed by Supreme Court advocate Sravan Kumar who pointed out that most students studying in private colleges feel stressed and victims took the extreme step after failing to cope with the pressure from the untrained teaching staff. According to 2019 reports, 383 students committed suicide in Andhra Pradesh while Telangana saw 426 cases, an 11% increase. In November 2020, the NHRC had sought a preliminary report from both AP and Telangana governments after consulting experts in the field of education, psychology and the corporate sector to identify the challenges and chalk out an effective strategy to address them. Though the NHRC gave six weeks’ time, both the governments failed to submit report. NHRC’s latest order once again directed the chief secretaries of AP and Telangana states to submit the report failing which action would be initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/nhrc-talks-tough-on-student-suicides/articleshow/85335364.cms||---

---||Goa||HC gives coastal body 6 weeks to decide on Vainguinim wall notice||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has granted a period of six weeks to the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) to decide on the showcause notice issued to a starred hotel for allegedly constructing a wall on Vainguinim beach. Vainguinim Valley Residents’ Association (VVRA) had filed a writ petition before the high court over the construction of the wall. GCZMA was to earlier decide on the showcause notice within two months. The court during the hearing on August 12 has asked the authority to decide on the matter within six weeks, after which, the matter will be taken up for hearing. In the writ petition pending before the high court, GCZMA had sought for an extension of the two-month period to decide on the showcause notice, which had been issued to the starred hotel on April 28, 2021. The VVRA lawyers told the high court that GCZMA filed an application asking for extension only on June 14, almost at the fag end of the two-month period given to the authority to decide on the showcause notice. GCZMA representative told the high court that the delay in acting on the showcause notice was due to chairperson of GCZMA being posted on Covid duty. The representative also said that as per the government rule, GCZMA had been functioning only with 50% staff strength due to the pandemic and so the authority could not decide on the showcause notice within the given time. VVRA told the high court that GCZMA had not only failed to comply with the orders of the court, but had also deliberately denied to the Vainguinim Valley residents an inspection report of the joint site inspection conducted of the wall on the beach under the deputy collector’s watch. The residents allege that the wall is being constructed on the public beach by the starred hotel illegally without any valid permissions. The hotel has, however, claimed that it has only carried out repairs to the wall, which is a structure to prevent sand erosion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-gives-coastal-body-6-weeks-to-decide-on-vainguinim-wall-notice/articleshow/85338972.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Uproar in Panjab University after officials defer next phase of Senate polls||CHANDIGARH: Protests were held in Panjab University by various student organisations, former senators and candidates of registered graduates constituency in front of the VC office on Saturday, demanding elections for registered graduates. The varsity had postponed the elections on Friday. The registered graduates constituency is the biggest in Panjab University with 3,61,869 eligible voters. It was to go to polls next. D P S Randhawa, one of the contestants from registered graduates constituency said, “This decision has been taken deliberately as they were doing in the past. The administration never wants democracy to prevail on campus and now they have found a way of not conducting polls, but we are not going to back off. We will make sure we get the date for polling.” According to a notice issued, 272 polling booths had to be set up in seven states and UTs, including Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand and Delhi. Uttarakhand and Delhi failed to give permission for the elections, which were to be held on Friday, necessitating a postponement. As per the notice, even Haryana, which is supposed to have 29 booths, has lapsed on giving permission for at least seven booths, stating they are being used for Haryana Staff Selection Examinations at present. Punjab too, in a letter dated August 10, has reportedly communicated to the varsity that “the schools have opened only a few days ago and senate elections happen to be on a working day” while requesting the varsity to either choose alternative dates or reschedule the polls for a holiday. “Therefore, due to circumstances stated above, which are beyond the control of the university, competent authority has ordered to postpone, for the time being, the election of registered graduate constituency,” the notice read. On the other hand, Mritunjay, the PUTA president said, “The administration must be knowing the issue from last 15-20 days but they issued the notice last night, which clearly shows how irresponsible they are and how they want the democratic system to shut down in the university.” Ex-senator Ashok Goyal said, “if they don’t respond to us then we are left with the only choice that is taking them to the court. We want democracy which treats everyone equally but they put dictatorship rule and it will not work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/uproar-in-pu-after-officials-defer-next-phase-of-senate-polls/articleshow/85330341.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Man held for killing two women, chopping, burying bodies||AURANGABAD: The Latur police have arrested a 54-year-old man on the charges of murdering his 85-year-old mother-in-law and her sister over a month ago, chopping the bodies into pieces and burying them. Other family members had gone to a neighbouring village at the time of the incident. The accused, identified Traymbak, alias Raju Naraynkar, is a resident of Gothewadi that falls within the jurisdiction of the Killari police station. Naraynkar, who has confessed, has been remanded in police custody. The deceased women have been identified as Trivenibai Sonawne (Naraynkar’s mother-in-law) and Shewantabai Sawalkar. The elderly sisters had been missing since July 7. Based on a complaint lodged by Trivenibai’s daughter Tulsabai, a missing case was registered on July 10. Superintendent of police Nikhil Pingale told TOI: “The man allegedly murdered his mother-in-law Trivenibai by banging her head against the wall. Shewantabai witnessed the incident and raised an alarm. The accused then strangled her.” Later, Naraynkar allegedly chopped the bodies and filled them in a sack and took the same to his farm. He dug a pit in the bed of a dried-up pond and buried the sack in it. Rain in the following days had filled up the pond. When Naraynkar’s wife and other family members returned, they asked Naraynkar about the two elderly women. Naraynkar claimed he was unaware of their whereabouts. However, when Trivenibai’s Mumbai-based son failed to contact her over the phone, he came to Latur and started following up with the police. Senior police officers then started probing the missing case and visited the house. Naraynkar, however, had fled without informing anyone, thus attracting police attention. Teams were formed and the accused was rounded up on July 10 from Colaba in Mumbai. During preliminary questioning, the accused confessed to murdering Trivenibai and Shewantabai. Pingale said the police had to empty the pond twice and dig at half-a-dozen spots before finally retrieving the decomposed bodies. The post mortems were carried out on Friday. Police have booked the accused on charges of kidnap, murder, and destruction of evidence. He said prima facie it appears that there was some dispute over property.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-held-for-killing-2-women-chopping-burying-bodies/articleshow/85333508.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The states like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh followed in with 27,019, 10,141, 6247 and 8500 complete inoculation of prisoners respectively. State Immunisation officer Dr Santosh Shukla said, “The state government on our request formed a special policy for such people who are highly vulnerable, high risk for getting infection of Covid-19.” “Due to this we were amongst the few states to begin special camps for prisoners in jails across the state removing mandatory requirements of documents and other things in May”, said Dr Shukla. “This ultimately helped in inoculating the maximum number of prisoners with two doses of vaccine. Later, the details were also shared with the government of India and a policy for inoculation of vendors, saints, and nomadic people on the same line were formed”, added Dr Shukla. The idea of camp was based on a successful vaccine administration plan- wherein measles and rubella vaccines were injected to children of female prisoners across the state during a vaccination programme held around a couple of years back. It was first implemented in the prison of Vidisha district of state, where Dr Shukla was posted then and later in the whole state, claimed Dr Shukla. The state has till Saturday evening inoculated 3.76 crore vaccine doses to its adult population including 60.88 lakh being administered both the doses of vaccines. The state required to inoculate around 11 crore doses to complete the two doses inoculation to its all 18 plus population in the mass drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-tops-in-administering-both-doses-of-covid-vaccines-to-prisoners/articleshow/85337364.cms||Antriksh Singh

This bus service has started after a gap of five years. Earlier, tourists were forced to travel by taxi after alighting at Neral suburban station. Taxi operators were opposing the ST bus service for fear of losing business. “The 500-metre stretch between highway and Neral suburban station via Khanda is often tenuous. The taxi operators deliberately raise unnecessary issues as part of their pressure tactics to subvert the ST bus service for their vested interests. Illegal encroachers also usurp road space. Both these factors were against public interest,” alleged Matheran resident Janardan Parte.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/now-take-st-bus-from-neral-to-matheran-in-mumbai/articleshow/85339032.cms||Umesh K Parida

---||Kolkata||Duare vaccine set for rollout next week: Kolkata Municipal Corporation||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) is finally set to roll out its Duare Vaccination (vaccination at doorsteps) facility from next week. In an effort to reach out to the elderly, infirm and terminally ill people who can’t move out of their homes and get the jab at city’s vaccination clinics, the civic body had announced the scheme a fortnight ago. However, the KMC health department took its time before formally launching the scheme as the health officials were working on the modalities. Singing legend Sandhya Mukhopadhyay will be one of the recipients of the scheme to begin with. A descendant of Asutosh Mukhopadhyay and a resident of Bhowanipore will also receive the jab at home, KMC board of administrators chairman Firhad Hakim said on Saturday. The civic brass has made a minor change in the rule, making it mandatory for the family of a recipient to ensure that a doctor is present when a civic vaccinator administers the dose. “The shot must be administered in presence of a registered medical practitioner to look after the discomfort factors of an ailing or aged recipient,” said a KMC health department official. However, a section of KMC health department officials conceded that it would be a tough job for the family of a recipient to get hold of a physician who will be present at home to observe the effects of vaccines. “While we acknowledge that getting a doctor at home amid a pandemic is tough, we can’t take chances as an ailing person may develop complexities after the shot is administered. We don’t have enough medical officers who can visit households after discharging duties at vaccination clinics,” said a KMC health department official. According to rules devised by the KMC health department, the family of a bed-ridden citizen needs to approach the nearest KMC vaccination centre and book a ‘vaccination slot at home’ after showing a medical certificate to the medical officer of the clinic. After examining the certificate, the medical officer will book a slot and fix a date for the recipient depending on the availability of vaccines. For octogenarian citizens, a slot can be booked by submitting a photocopy of the Aadhaar card. KMC vaccinators will visit the households between 5pm and 6pm. Under no circumstances, the KMC will take the initiative to administer the shots at home to the able-bodied people and citizens below 80 years, said a KMC health depart-ment official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/duare-vaccine-set-for-rollout-next-wk/articleshow/85335473.cms||Saikat Ray

Arun Kumar, a labourer, had a tiff with his wife, following which she left his home and began to live with her parents in Jani village.

Efforts are on to nab the culprit.” Police have also found empty liquor bottles from the house and suspect that “excessive drinking was also one of the reasons of marital discord” between them. “Arun also used to taunt his wife for giving birth to two daughters, leading to fights between them.

In his address to the state on Saturday evening, the former chief minister said, “The nation’s farmers have been protesting against the three black agrarian laws for over a year. Till now, 600 farmers have died while protesting but the Union government has turned deaf to all their pleas” Nath alleged that unemployment has broken all records and the youths are wandering in search of jobs. “How can we ever ensure a happy life for the future generations in this scenario?” he asked. Nath, who went for an aerial survey of the flood-hit Gwalior-Chambal region earlier this month said, “The common man is distraught with the excessive rains and floods. Congress party sympathises with the affected families and our workers are helping with the relief works”. Nath said that the country needs to fight new challenges under current circumstances. “Our country needs to fight against inflation, unemployment, fight for the respect and security of women and give opportunity to our traders and businesses. These are the major challenges before the nation today,” he said. “We must recognise the truth, accept the truth and will support only the truth,” Nath said. He said that after Independence, India faced many challenges. “We are proud of India’s unity. It is difficult for today’s generation to understand the challenges of those times”, the senior Congress leader said. Nath said that it was the Congress government under Jawaharlal Nehru that took the country into a new path of development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/unemployment-inflation-causing-distress-says-nath/articleshow/85337394.cms||---

Taking cognizance of the arguments from both the sides, special judge Sanjay Kulkarni granted conditional bail to the jawans. The court also took cognizance of the fact that there was a delay of about eight months in the registration of the offence. The court also observed that even two days prior to registering the FIR, a civil suit about the plot was filed. Based on the complaint lodged by lawyer Asha Dandge, the duo identified as Vijay Bhujbal and Kundalik Sanap were booked on the charges of atrocity, criminal trespass, abusing, intentional insult, criminal intimidation on August 10. A woman had lodged a complaint stating that she had purchased the land from a man named Bhaskar Pakhre in 2005. The neighbouring plot was given by Sanap to Bhujbal. During her visit to the plot in January this year, she found that the accused allegedly lifted soil from her plot and encroached a portion of it. The woman claimed that the suspects showered casteist slurs on her and threatened her of dire consequences for objecting to the alleged encroachment and lifting of sand from her plot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/army-jawans-get-bail-in-sc/st-atrocity-case/articleshow/85333552.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Aurangabad||Teen gang-raped & filmed in Aurangabad's Jalna district||AURANGABAD: A 17-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped and filmed by two accused on Friday evening at a village in the Badnapur taluka of Jalna district. The assault took place when the girl, riding a moped, was on her way to meet a friend in the neighbouring hamlet. Later, a farmer had found the girl — who had been adopted by a local priest — unconscious on a farm. The police have arrested the key accused , while a manhunt has been launched for his accomplice. Badnapur police inspector Shivaji Bantewad told TOI, “We have slapped the accused with sections of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and other relevant sections of the IPC. One accused has been arrested and on Saturday, the court remanded him in five-day custody.” The officer said that both the accused are married men and though the girl knew them by name — as it is a small village — she had never before interacted with them. The officer, citing the girl’s statement, said the two men had waylaid her near a farm. They forcibly dragged her into the orchard, then gagged and raped her. The accused even recorded the act on their mobile phone and threatened to make the video public if the girl told anyone. Police said when the second accused came to know that the girl was hospitalised and police too had reached the hospital, he fled the village. The key accused, however, thought that fearing social stigma, the girl would not reveal anything, so he stayed. Police said a probe is being carried out to ascertain if the video had been shared by the accused. The incident sparked outrage with activists demanding a water-tight chargesheet within a stipulated time and a fast-track trial. They have threatened to take to the roads if the demands were ignored.

All 18 counters of the retail chain were shut at 5.30 pm instead of the normal 8.30 pm and the shopkeepers gathered on the Rims campus holding candles and recited the National Anthem. One of the protesting members said they have been selling generic medicines at rates cheaper than Jan-aushadhi kendra, which also sells generic medicines. “Hundreds of patients admitted at Rims cannot afford costly and branded medicines and for them, Dawai Dost had been a lifesaver for many years. It is completely illogical to force us to shut our counter,” the protester said. Earlier this week, the matter was also taken up by the high court which sought a response from the Rims authority to inform what plans are in place to make affordable medicines available to the patients coming to the hospital after it ordered Dawai Dost to stop its operations there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dawai-dost-shopkeepers-stage-protest/articleshow/85337421.cms||---

District collector Kaushlendra Vikram Singh told TOI that an inquiry has been ordered to fix accountability. “It seems there was some problem with the alignment of the crane,” he said. The victims had climbed into a fire engine's crane trolley to set up the flag on the corporation building in Maharajwada for Sunday’s hoisting. Officials said that the front legs of the hydraulic machine suddenly shot upwards, and the three victims were thrown off. A video of the incident shows how panic broke out the moment the four men fell. Onlookers began running helter-skelter, fearing that the giant crane may topple. The victims were taken to hospital where three of them — Pradeep Rajora, Kuldeep and Vinod Sharma — were declared dead. An angry mob beat up two officials, leading to deployment of police. Gwalior municipal commissioner Mukul Gupta went to the spot. So did minister in charge of Gwalior, Tulsiram Silawat. He met family members of the victims and ordered officials to make adequate arrangements for the treatment of the survivor. CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan prayed for peace to the departed souls, strength to the families and speedy recovery of the injured. Compassionate jobs will be given to the kin of the three people who died and financial assistance of Rs4 lakh will be provided to each family. BJP Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia also expressed condolences.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s vaccine dilemma: To go all out or ration doses||KOLKATA: With less than 36 hours to go for the new vaccination timetable to take off, the health department at Kolkata Municipal Corporation are faced with a dilemma — should they continue to administer the jabs at the current pace or should they apply brakes just a bit to build up a buffer? While the former will mean less pendency, the latter will ensure the inoculation drive does not face uncertainty and continues uninterrupted irrespective of constraints in supply and allocation. According to the new timetable, second doses will be administered on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and first doses on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The civic brass is yet to take a call particularly in case of Covishield vaccines due to its irregular supply and a rise in second dose pendency. At present, KMC is administering around 25,000-30,000 Covishield jabs daily to both first and second dose recipients. Going forward, the civic health department can either continue to administer 25,000 doses to either first dose or second dose recipients daily, depending on the day of the week. Or KMC could administer around 15,000 jabs a day to first and second dose recipients. “Till now, we have been inoculating around 1.5 lakh people a week, or 25,000 in a day. Of this, around 15,000 were second dose and 10,000 first dose recipients. We can continue to give 15,000 shots to second dose recipients or 45,000-50,000 shots a week on the three days allocated to second dose recipients and a similar number of doses to first dose recipients on other three days. This will enable us to build a buffer of 50,000 doses in a week. But that will also mean an increase in the second dose pendency rate. Alternatively, we can continue at the current pace and administer 25,000 doses daily. If we do this, there will be no buffer stock and uncertainties about the following day's vaccination will remain,” a health official explained. Another health official made it clear that KMC was geared to vaccinate as many people as possible if it received supplies. In June, there were days when the civic body had inoculated 60,000 people. This was possible because at the time, a bulk of the vaccines reaching the state were being allocated to KMC. The situation has, however, changed with a bulk of the vaccines now being allocated to the districts to step up the inoculation drive there. In Kolkata, 51.4 lakh doses have been administered, of which 37.8 lakh are dose one and 13.6 lakh are second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmcs-vax-dilemma-to-go-all-out-or-ration-doses/articleshow/85335528.cms||Saikat Ray

The court was hearing the petition filed by M Rajesh. The petitioner’s mother joined service as part-time sweeper in Tangedco at Tirunelveli district in 1997. In 2011, Tangedco had created a post for part-time conservancy workers and several people including the petitioner’s mother were absorbed to the post with time scale of pay and dearness allowance.The petitioner’s mother died during service in 2013. Following her death, the petitioner had submitted an application seeking compassionate appointment, however, the authorities had rejected the same stating that the legal heirs of part-time employees would not be eligible for compassionate appointment. Challenging the same, the petitioner had filed this petition in 2018.The petitioner’s counsel submitted that his mother was absorbed by the authorities with a time scale of pay with dearness allowance. Therefore, the petitioner’s mother was a regular employee and not part time.However, the standing counsel for Tangedco submitted that though the petitioner’s mother was absorbed with time scale pay she was only working as a part-time conservancy worker. He submitted that legal heirs of people who are under temporary appointments, consolidated pay, daily wages, contract appointments and part time conservancy workers are not eligible for compassionate appointment.Taking cognizance of the submissions, justice D Krishnakumar observed that in the case on hand, since the petitioner’s mother was not regularized, as per the law laid down by the Supreme Court in its verdict, the contention of the petitioner seeking compassionate appointment cannot be accepted and it is liable to be rejected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-job-plea-by-deceased-workers-son/articleshow/85339012.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Aurangabad||Activists seek lifting of KT weirs’ needles on Godavari & Pravara||Aurangabad: Water right activists have demanded that needles of the Kolhapuri Type (KT) weirs built on Godavari and Pravara rivers be lifted at the earliest. The demand has come as the Jayakwadi dam this year has a lower stock compared to last year and due to the extended dry spell of monsoon. The activists have highlighted the standing order of the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA), which states that KT weir needles that obstruct the flow of water should not be placed in position until an equitable distribution is achieved by October-end. Water right activist Abhijit Dhanorkar, in a memorandum submitted to Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation , has demanded the order of MWRRA be followed with immediate effect. “Around 15 KT weirs are built on Godavari river in the upstream areas of Jayakwadi dam and another 14 such weirs raised on Pravara river are obstructing the flow of water towards Nathsagar (reservoir of Jayakwadi dam) since the beginning of the monsoon. While we had not taken any objection to such practice earlier due to good run of monsoon , it has now become imperative to lift needles of these weirs in order to facilitate the release of water in downstream areas,” Dhanorkar said.  GMIC executive director Kiran Kulkarni said the authorities concerned would be asked to take a review of the overall situation. “A dedicated panel meant to oversee the equitable distribution of water will be requested to hold a video conferencing with different authorities and ensure necessary compliance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/activists-seek-lifting-of-kt-weirs-needles-on-godavari-pravara/articleshow/85333606.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: New timing to push up sales by 40%, hope restaurants||KOLKATA: The extension of closing of time for restaurants and bars from 8pm to 10.30pm from Monday will help to revive the food and beverage (F&B) industry in the state that had been struggling to survive with dwindling footfalls and mounting losses. The hotel and restaurant industry employs over 80 lakh people in the state and over 9 lakh in Kolkata. Leading restaurants and bars are gearing up for a big week since the outbreak of the second wave and hope for a 30%-40% jump in sales following this extension, which now includes the peak dining hours. For most of them, dinner sales constitute almost 50%-60% of the total business. The off-shops, too, are optimistic that the new timing will boost their sales. Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India president Sudesh Poddar pointed out that the restaurants were missing the dinner crowd . “From 7.30pm to 10.30pm is the prime time for dinner and we shall now be on the revival path. So far, we were losing the dinner crowd,” he said. According to him, a mere 35% of sales is generated by lunch. Speciality Restaurants chairman Anjan Chatterjee added: “We were losing more than 50% of our business because of the restricted timing. For fine-dining restaurants, dinner often contributes 75% of our total business.” Park Street restaurants, too, believe the dinner crowd will be back. Mocambo and Peter Cat owner Nitin Kothari expects the next weekend to be a big one. “At both of our restaurants, customers are enquiring about the change. We hope there will be a 35%-40% jump in business,” he added. Moulin Rouge, Waldorf and Floriana owner Charles Mantosh agreed. “Dinner in Kolkata starts from 8pm, so we were missing the diners,” he said. Chillies owner Rishi Bajoria pointed out that so far restaurants and bars were merely recovering the cost. “The extended timing would help us to earn something,” he added. The owner of KK’s Fusion and Mio Amore Pradip Rozario was happy that finally he will be able to recover some losses. Aminia director Kabir Azhar and Chowman director Debaditya Chowdhury felt that this will be a big boost to dining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-timing-to-push-up-sales-by-40-hope-restos/articleshow/85335554.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

University sources said that among the invited poets were some who had raised voice against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Shaheen Bagh last year, prompting the two dignitaries to skip the event and eventually resulting in its cancellation. The event was to be held at the historic Senate Hall of AU’s Arts faculty and all preparations were complete. However, at a time when almost all participating poets had arrived and so had the guests, including many heads of departments, deans and administrative officials, an announcement was made that the programme was being called off. Although the varsity administration cited ‘unavoidable circumstances’ as the reason behind cancelling the event, people close to AU administration informed TOI that this was done after the chief guest and the VC backed out from attending the function as among the invited poets were some who had raised their voice against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Shaheen Bagh last year. “Since Friday morning, the issue was making rounds on social media which may have been the main reason for the main guests not attending the event and finally leading to the cancellation of the event,” said a senior faculty member of AU. Social media posts even claimed that the event was called off after the intervention of the UP chief minister’s office. AU authorities, however ,refuted all such claims. AU’s public relation officer, Jaya Kapoor, on Saturday issued a press statement saying, “The programme of kavi sammelan and mushaira proposed to be organized on Friday in the Senate Hall was cancelled. The programme was to be organized by Urdu Academy and AU and its Urdu department and the Culture Committee was giving logistical support, but some names kept in the panel of invitees were without approval.” “The VC had nothing to do with organising details of the event. She had been invited to chair the session since the event was being organized in the Senate Hall of the university. The programme was cancelled due to unavoidable circumstances. There is no truth in media reports that the programme was cancelled at the behest of or on the intervention by either the CM office or Union ministry,” said the PRO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-abruptly-cancels-poetic-event-meant-to-mark-i-day/articleshow/85339034.cms||Rajeev Mani

Since the bus driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner without noticing a speed breaker, the boy fell down from the bus and sustained a fracture on his pelvic bone and also sustained injuries in his urinary tract.Following this incident, the claimant filed a petition seeking compensation before the motor accident claims tribunal at Tirunelveli. After considering the oral and documentary evidence, the tribunal in 2014 had directed the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, Tirunelveli to pay Rs 10,55,450 as compensation with 9% interest.Challenging the order passed by the tribunal, the transport corporation (appellant) had filed the present civil miscellaneous appeal before the HC Madurai bench in 2016. The appellant submitted that the claimant had travelled on the footboard of the bus and he invited the accident.Taking into account the grievous injuries sustained by the claimant, justice R Tharani observed that the compensation amount fixed by the tribunal is reasonable. However, the claimant is entitled for 7.5% rate of interest for the compensation amount. Hence, the judge partially allowed the appeal and directed the transport corporation to pay Rs 10,55,450 compensation with 7.5% interest to the claimant within eight weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-upholds-tribunal-order-on-relief-to-accident-victim/articleshow/85339028.cms||---
---||World||China most distrusted nation, says survey of Indian youth||NEW DELHI: Covid-19 pandemic, terrorism, cyber-security and the Ladakh stand-off with China are the top foreign policy concerns of the Indian youth, shows a new survey. The survey of the urban Indian youth by Observer Research Foundation (ORF) finds that while the government’s decision on the Quad, China and Pakistan find huge support, there is a big thumbs down for the decision to walk away from RCEP. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla is expected to release the report on Independence Day. India may be a predominantly young country, and a rising international power, but has rarely captured the views of its youth on foreign policy issues. By and large, the respondents agreed with the Modi government’s foreign policy actions. But an overwhelming 80% believe the top foreign policy priority for India should be to strengthen its economy. Other priorities are to fight against terrorism, build ties with the US, resolve disputes with India’s neighbours (not China or Pakistan). Interestingly, nearly half of the youth surveyed are concerned about tackling climate change, something that would have been nothing more than a nerdy interest about a decade ago. Border conflicts with China occupy greater mind space (52%) than border conflicts with Pakistan (49%), an indicator of changing security perceptions. Curiously, the respondents consider Sri Lanka as India’s most “trusted” neighbour (68%) — counter-intuitive, since Chinese challenge in the neighbourhood came via Sri Lanka besides also the Tamil question which has marked Indo-Lanka ties. Bhutan, India’s staunchest ally, came a lowly third, even lower than Nepal, which is surprising. Pakistan comes at the bottom with 10 per cent trust ratings. The government’s decision to ban Chinese mobile Apps received an 86 per cent endorsement, Balakot air strike about 68 percent, almost the same as the Quad (64%). Right up at the top after the Chinese Apps is “control illegal immigration”. It’s clearly an issue close to the hearts of young Indians, and could influence political choices. Over 77 per cent of the respondents rated the US as the most trusted leading global power. The US was followed by Australia, Russia, Japan, France, UK and the European Union (EU). The country that the respondents distrusted the most (77 percent) is China. Who will partner India in the years ahead? They said Quad, Russia and Europe, in that order. China is causing as much concern among the young Indians as among governments. The survey said that it found 62 percent of respondents were of the view that India should abandon non-alignment in case of rising US-China tensions and ally with the US. The respondents expressed concern not only about China interfering in India’s neighbourhood, but also about its military and economic superiority. They also expressed fears of a breakout of war. While those surveyed had definite views about India’s permanent membership of the UNSC, and were familiar with the World Trade Organisation, a surprising two-thirds had not heard of the Non Aligned Movement. India was one of the founders of this movement in the 20th century. The study observes, “There is low awareness about more recent platforms and forums, such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Group of 20 (G20) and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-most-distrusted-nation-says-survey-of-indian-youth/articleshow/85340235.cms||Indrani Bagchi

The murder is a fallout of a political rivalry that has taken communal overtones, police said. Preliminary investigations revealed that Pradeep had fought for the pradhan’s post in the recently concluded panchayat polls and lost. The Tyagi family held the Akhtars responsible for their defeat as they felt they had not voted for Pradeep. On late Friday night, while Akhtar was returning home through a forested stretch of the village, the two brothers who were in an inebriated state confronted him. They were having a heated argument, when an enraged Raju picked up a spade and struck Akhtar. The blow proved to be fatal. The brothers fled the spot, leaving behind a bleeding Akhtar. Soon enough news spread of the attack and Akhtar’s relatives accompanied by members of their community zeroed in on Raju, Pradeep and their sibling, Sandeep, and attacked them. Raju somehow managed to flee but was hit by a vehicle while on the run. He was arrested. Situation turned volatile when Akhtar succumbed to injuries. The crowds began to swell outside the hospital but timely intervention of police saved the situation. Nevertheless, the villagers kept the body on the road outside the police station on Saturday. They blocked the highway, demanding justice. Tempers were cooled after senior officials rushed to the spot, assuring action against the culprits. Prabhakar Chaudhary, SSP, Meerut,said, ‘We have arrested Raju Tyagi and he is being questioned. Meanwhile, an FIR has been filed at the behest of Akhtar’s family. It is purely a matter of political rivalry. Adequate police force has been deployed at the village to prevent any further untoward incident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-village-tense-after-brothers-hack-man-to-death-over-political-rivalry/articleshow/85333673.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra unlock: Local trains and malls now open for fully vaxxed||MUMBAI: Wearied by months of lockdown hardship, Mumbaikars are looking forward to long-awaited relaxations in local train travel and business from Independence Day on Sunday. Malls can now reopen, while restaurants, gyms, salons and spas are permitted to function at 50% capacity till 10pm, helping ease livelihoods. While easing restrictions, the state government has issued a rider than workforce in establishments like shops, malls, restaurants and even wedding halls should be fully vaccinated (14 days since the second dose), though BMC commissioner IS Chahal said on Friday that staffers with a single dose will also be allowed to work and shop owners have to display the vaccination status of their staff. However, till late on Saturday evening, no such change of rules was issued by the state and Chahal said he was awaiting orders from the government. Senior state government officials said the health department was expected to issue revised orders soon, and until then the current rule of having only fully vaccinated staff would be applicable. Most relieved is that section of the workforce that has taken both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine and may take the train. Jashwant Jani, an employee of Roopam Fashion House in Crawford Market, said, "I live in Mira Road and it would take three hours to commute by bus... Now I have a rail pass and can travel without fear." Gym owners are waiting to welcome evening crowds as are salons and spas. Anas Qureshi, manager of Rhino's Gym in Chakala, Andheri (East), said, "Our clients are very happy and are making appointments. We have informed them of our intense safety protocol which involves sanitising equipment every hour, installing oximeters and making masks compulsory at entry. Our staff is fully vaccinated. Eighty percent of customers have taken the first dose too." Irfan Rangrez of Gym Spirit in Andheri (West) reopened shop a few days ago, after closing hour was redefined as 8pm. "The gym equipment was spoiled, so I spent Rs 1.5 lakh to refurbish. It will take a while to recover that investment but at least the actors of Lokhandwala Complex and Versova who are our members can come for evening workout now." On Saturday, the management of Growel's 101 mall in Kandivli got workers to sanitise premises and began recalling employees, all of whom are partially vaccinated. Growel's has deployed social distancing officers and will ensure contact-less facilities. Restaurants are keen to host patrons for dinner after a long interval. Aaswad in Dadar has got its cooks and kitchen staff inoculated, but waiters are still in queue. "Until then we will offer in-dining only until afternoon. At least we are permitted to reopen till 10 pm," said manager Rajesh Sanzgiri. Betty Ho of Betty's Salon in Hill Road, Bandra, and beautician Lee Mein Yang of Lokhandwala, Andheri, were happy to recall staff in anticipation of higher footfalls. Fashion garment retailer Mayur Shah of Ella Stores, Irla, said, "Now the government has just to carry out vaccination at full throttle, and allow functions to happen with a larger number of people. Then business will start properly."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-unlock-local-trains-and-malls-now-open-for-fully-vaxxed/articleshow/85337729.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Goa||Didn’t find anything wrong with Mary Kom bout: Lenny||Panaji: With seven medals, the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo turned out to be India’s most successful outing. There was a first-ever gold in track and field won by javelin star Neeraj Chopra. There were high hopes from the Indian boxing contingent which had five men and four women, but only Lovlina Borgohain could bring home a bronze medal. “Lovlina was lucky enough to get a very good draw,” said Lenny D’Gama, the only Asian evaluator/observer among the four who kept a close eye on the referees and judges at the Games. “She is tall and has lanky hands, but if she had boxed from far in the semifinals and scored every round, she would have kept her opponent at a distance. But the boxer from Turkey was very strong and rated world number two.” Much was expected from MC Mary Kom, who had won bronze at the 2012 London Games where Lenny was also present as an observer. But at 38, age was catching up with Mary Kom and she lost her round of 16 bout against Colombia’s Valencia Ingrit in the women’s fly 48-51kg category. The six-time world champion was left shocked. She had won her last two rounds, but the judges thought otherwise. She was upset with the 3-2 split verdict, but there was no room for manipulation. “When the results were announced, the Colombian girl was graceful enough to lift Mary Kom’s hand and she thought she won the bout when it was clearly announced. We reviewed the bout in the morning and found nothing wrong,” said Lenny. There are two cameras stationed on the judges table and they were instructed not to move right or left. Lenny along with other evaluators met every morning to review the bouts. From the total 36, they even sent back three officials when they found they were not up to the mark. Two were from Europe while the other was from Asia. “Mary Kom looks fit, but her age was playing. When you see Lovlina against her opponent, the Tunisian was too strong. So, we should also work on strength and psychological training for the boxers. It is not only technical training,” said the Goa Boxing Association vice-president. In the men’s category, star pugilist Amit Panghal and Vikas Krishan also couldn’t do much. The Games were held without spectators and could be a factor for many athletes. But Lenny feels otherwise. “At the London Olympics, there was a lot of crowd but it added to the chaos. Organisers can control the crowd to that extent. As there was no crowd in Tokyo, the organisers could work to perfection,” said the 67-year-old. Lenny’s knowledge and expertise can be put to use for Goan athletes, and he is now looking forward to a meeting with chief minister Pramod Sawant. He has ideas and wants the government to listen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/didnt-find-anything-wrong-with-mary-kom-bout-lenny/articleshow/85355026.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

Residents of the area have expressed concern about the sighting of the big cat near the road that is currently used as an alternative route to the Panhala fort as the main road was following the landslide. Uttam Dalwi, a resident of Panhala, said, “Two of my friends — Abhijeet Gaikwad and Raju Burud — and I saw the leopard resting on a rock below the fort wall next to Lata Mangeshkar’s bungalow. We called our local photographer friend Dheeraj Kurade to take the big cat’s picture. With the main road to Panhala fort closed due to the landslide, locals are using the Nikamwadi route to reach the destination and with the sighting of leopard in the area, the villagers are now scared.” Amit Jagtap, another villager, said, “Around seven-eight leopards have their habitat in the forest area around the Panhala fort. The leopard that was seen on Friday evening was resting on a rock in the forest area. When the villagers gathered to get a glimpse of the big cat, it returned to the dense woods. People should not panic as the leopard was in its natural habitat and did not harm anyone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/leopard-sighted-near-panhala-fort/articleshow/85333679.cms||---

There is also no mention of the waiver of educational loans for students, which was one of the major promises it made. The former chief minister said there is also information that the government is formulating rules to ensure that most people do not benefit from five-sovereign gold loans. The government should not cheat the people and should waive the loans of all those who obtained loans through cooperative societies, he said.AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam said that the people who believed in the DMK’s poll promises of gold and educational loan waivers, Rs 100 subsidy for LPG cylinders, electricity billing once a month and Rs 1,000 for women of households are today a disappointed lot. The allocation for food subsidy in the interim budget for 2021-2022 was Rs 9,604.27 crore but in the revised budget it has been reduced to Rs 8,437.57 crore. It was announced that petrol price would be reduced by Rs 5 and diesel by Rs 4, but petrol price alone has been cut, that too only by Rs 3, he said. The budget would affect poor people hard, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dmk-has-fooled-people-with-false-promises-eps/articleshow/85339037.cms||---

Health officials said there were 125 cases of chikungunya in the rural parts of the district by July-end , which increased by another 29 by August 10. Similarly, cases of dengue which stood at 65 by July-end increased by 19 by August 10. Last year, there were only 62 dengue cases and 43 chikungunya cases in the rural parts of the district. Chikungunya and dengue are both transmitted by the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which breeds in fresh accumulated water. Senior officials of the district malaria office said that various measures were being taken to control the spread of the two diseases. District Malaria officer Madhav Ahire said that June and July both saw a sharp rise in dengue and chikungunya in the district. Dengue cases were more in Nashik taluka, followed by Sinnar, Dindori and Peth. Meanwhile, chikungunya cases were also more in Peth taluka followed Nashik, Sinnar and Trimbak talukas. Health workers attached to the primary health centres were conducting survey of ailing patients and asking them to get their blood tests conducted at the PHCs. Also, awareness activities were being done among villagers not store water in their houses for too long, which could lead to breeding of mosquitoes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dengue-chikungunya-cases-rise-in-nashik-rural/articleshow/85333714.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Mumbai||Non-farm use of plot only after infra in place: RERA||MUMBAI: Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority has said mere conditional permission for conversion of an agricultural plot to a non-agricultural one outside urban areas without offering any infrastructure can be termed only as an ongoing project and hence is required to be registered under RERA. Permission to convert a plot from agriculture to non-agriculture use is only the beginning of the process and is completed when the tehsildar records that all conditions imposed stand fulfilled and that constitutes a “completion certificate”, clarified MahaRERA. Dealing with “plotted development” outside urban areas, MahaRERA on August 10 directed a developer to immediately register one such project on finding that conditions imposed in an almost decade-old nod for non-agriculture (NA) use by Raigad collector remained unfulfilled. “The very nomenclature of the completion certificate means that the premises are now complete and fit for human habitation’’ said MahaRERA chairperson Ajoy Mehta. The NA use will commence when the tehsildar records that all conditions are fulfilled. Mehta directed the promoter-developer not to advertise, sell or permit bookings of any NA plots in a project called Amarai in Kolad for sale till it is registered under Section 3 of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA). He also imposed a penalty of Rs 50,000 to be paid to MahaRERA for flouting provision of the Act in failing to register an ongoing project. “Facilities that were promised and those enumerated in the NA order have not been given, thus the property remains devoid of facilities to enable a reasonable human to enjoy it...hence the project does not have a CC till date,’’ said the order. Aamrai Kolad Plot Owners Welfare Association had last year filed a complaint before the MahaRERA and Sai Developers and others. According to their lawyer Zaman Ali, in May 2012, the Raigad district collector had in its conditional NA permission directed the developer to construct infrastructural facilities, including roads, storm water drains, sewage lines, water supply and develop open spaces, within two years. Soon after the permission, the developer advertised the project, promising infrastructural amenities and possession period of one year on payment of Rs 50,000 development charges per plot. The complaint is despite the payment, the project “remained incomplete’’. After RERA came into effect on May 1, 2017, in October 2017, the developer issued fresh ads for remaining unsold plots offering amenities, including a pool. But with infrastructural facilities and amenities not provided, the project would fall under the ambit of RERA as an ongoing project, requiring registration, said the association. The developer through its lawyer Tanmay Ketkar argued the project was complete in 2014, having complied with all NA conditions, and all plots are sold, hence it is not an on-going project and the complaint is an “mala fide’’ harassment. Mehta said in case of a plotted development, it was “mandatory’’ that all amenities as agreed have been completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/non-farm-use-of-plot-only-after-infra-in-place-in-mumbai-rera/articleshow/85339058.cms||Swati Deshpande

They also feed it with rotten chicken waste and dead carcasses of animals, but people were not aware of the health implications due to consuming this fish, he said. Consuming this fish also causes skin ailments. But, as they grew to larger sizes in a short time, the traders were selling them.The traders said that they had sourced the fish from Madurai, while some had said that it came from Thanjavur. The shopkeepers were warned and fined Rs 2,000 each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/1000kg-of-banned-stale-fishes-seized-in-dindigul-market/articleshow/85339039.cms||---

Several areas were badly affected by Cyclone Tauktae in May, recent heavy rainfall in July resulted in flooding, landslides and several hutments collapsed. Kandivli (E) MLA Atul Bhatkalkar said Mumbaikars suffered substantial damage due to the cyclone and heavy rain but the government ignored the city. “A recent GR offers only Rs15,000 to slum-dwellers. Not only have huts been damaged, even traders have suffered huge losses. Many old housing societies have ground floor flats whose residents suffered huge damage. The government must compensate all,” he said. Anil Divakar, resident of Pathan chawl, Hanuman Nagar, Kandivli (E), said his house collapsed along with four others in July. “We are living in a BMC school. I meet the corporator, seeking help, daily” he said.

The school education department on Friday had announced a cut in syllabus of up to 50% for classes I to XII.“For primary school students, the cut in syllabus is largely based on the reduced number of working days with a bridge course to ensure students catch up with their lessons from the previous year, which is welcome. But, school reopening or some alternative to ensure two-way communication between teachers and students for lessons is a must. Otherwise, we might not even be able to get students to learn the minimal content,” said K Saravanan, headmaster of a government-aided primary school in Madurai. Teachers said that though syllabus reduction for all classes is inevitable due to the pandemic, it raises concerns over lack of uniformity in teaching in different schools as well as of different boards.“Last year, some private schools had completed the entire syllabus in online classes despite syllabus cut. The syllabus reduction should not be done keeping in mind only competition from students within the state board schools. For higher studies, students across boards compete with each other. There is also no syllabus reduction for competitive exams as well so far,” said Senthilnathan M, president, Private Schools Correspondents’ Confederation. He also added that except for mathematics, which is challenging to teach online, there is no real need to reduce syllabus for this year but tweaking of exams could be beneficial to students.Meanwhile, for students who are set to write their board exams, teachers said that the reduction in syllabus will help them focus and plan better for studying. “This year, the cut in syllabus has been announced early and is the same as last year for higher secondary classes, so we can be better prepared. Practicals especially will be easy to clear. All chapters are covered but just not in depth. Students going for competitive exams will need to put in extra hours to cover the whole syllabus but the study material has not been reduced, so it is fine,” said S Vennila Devi, district co-ordinator for government NEET coaching.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/teachers-syllabus-cut-will-impact-schools-differently/articleshow/85339062.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Chennai||Engineering graduates can get second degree in another branch in two years: AICTE||CHENNAI: Engineering graduates brooding over lack of jobs in their stream and cursing themselves for not choosing some other specialization have some good news from the All India Council for Technical Education. The apex body has now decided to allow engineering graduates to do a second engineering degree in a different discipline in two or three years under lateral entry system. The council has asked all technical universities and institutions to make necessary changes to its statutes to implement the decision. “AICTE is receiving requests from students regarding admission in B Tech as an additional degree through lateral entry, ” the AICTE said in its circular sent to vice-chancellor of technical universities and directors/principals of AICTE approved institutions. “It is informed that the proposal was placed before the AICTE executive committee (EC) on its 144th meeting held on July 13 and the EC opined that technical universities can facilitate such students to take admissions to BTech/BE by allowing them to get admissions at appropriate level of BTech programme in another discipline or branch of engineering,” the circular said. “Executive committee approved the exemption from pursuing courses already done in the first discipline of B Tech programme and students can be appropriately guided to complete their requirements of the second discipline. As there is a practical component involved, students will be required to take admission in an institution or college as a regular student and the concerned university will ensure this and make necessary provision in their statutes accordingly. The EC further approved the duration for completing additional degree to be two years to three years without compromising credit requirements in core discipline and attainment of learning outcomes of the new programme. In view of the above, you may take necessary changes in your statute and take appropriate decisions in this regard,” said Dileep N Malkhede, advisor-I, Policy and Academic Planning Bureau , AICTE. Anna University vice-chancellor R Velraj welcomed the move and said it would help the students who cannot get jobs after their degree. “They can study the branches in which they are interested in the second attempt. We will discuss it in our academic bodies and implement it,” he said. Anna University former vice-chancellor E Balagurusamy also welcomed the move and said students can finish engineering degree in two years after eliminating the common core subjects. He further said in earlier days when there were just three or four branches available students were allowed to study another stream and they will get a degree by studying an extra year. “A mechanical student can pursue mechatronics and electronics students can study computer science and computer science students can pursue AI and data science. This concept would certainly widen their skill set and enhance their ability to do multi-disciplinary research work,” he added. Career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said students do not know much about engineering branches when they join courses. “This move will give them a second chance to study what they like after finishing their courses. However, the course duration should not exceed two years,” he said. However, S Vaidyasubramaniam, vice-chancellor of Sastra said allowing two degrees at UG level will lead to artificial demand for popular courses. “Instead of allowing two engineering degrees at UG level, either the existing UG degrees must be made interdisciplinary or comprehensive PG degrees should be encouraged,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/engg-grads-can-get-second-degree-in-another-branch-in-two-years-aicte/articleshow/85337633.cms||A Ragu Raman

The bullet missed Mohammad Irfan, 28, a hosiery worker, by a whisker, and zipped past him after touching his hand. Irfan lived in a labour quarter. Gurmeet Kumar, landlord of the labour quarter, said Irfan was sleeping on the terrace on the fourth floor. At around 11.15pm, someone fired in the air and a bullet went past him after touched his hand. Ifran, who sustained a minor injury, raised an alarm afterwards. Thereafter, he called the police. Assistant commissioner of police (north) Dharampal said it seems that someone near the labour quarter has fired in the air. The police have also recovered a bullet from the roof of the labour quarter. Further probe is under way, the ACP added. Gurmeet said, “There was a birthday party in the locality and the police have detained some youngsters who were in the party for questioning. I also own a gym and police are also seeking details of people who come to the gym. They suspect that I could have been a target for the person who opened fire. However, I don’t have any rivalry.” The Daresi police have lodged an FIR against unidentified accused in this matter under Section 336 (Act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Arms Act. Police are also checking records if anyone in the locality hold an arm licence. Besides, the CCTV cameras installed in the area are also being scanned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bullet-zips-past-sleeping-man-cops-clueless-on-shooter/articleshow/85337627.cms||---
---||Kochi||Transit along new NH-66 bypass road to get costlier||Thiruvananthapuram: The transit along the new national highway (NH) 66 bypass road will get costlier from this week onwards as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is set to start toll collection. The toll collection will most likely commence from Wednesday, NHAI officials here have said. The tolls will be collected at the plaza that has been set up near Thiruvallom. The NHAI has also released the tariff for various categories of vehicles. As per the tariff, the fee for light motor vehicles (car, jeep and van) is Rs 70 for one-way trip and Rs 105 for two-way journey, if the return trip is on the same day. Regular commuters can avail a monthly pass for a fee of Rs 2,305. As many as 50 journeys can be done using this pass in a month. For people residing within 20km radius of the toll plaza, the cost of monthly pass is Rs 285. For light commercial vehicles, light goods vehicles and mini buses, the rates are Rs 110 (one-way trip), Rs 170 (two-way) and Rs 3,725 (monthly pass). For buses and trucks with up to two axles, the rates are Rs 235, Rs 350 and Rs 7,805, respectively. Two-wheelers and auto rickshaws are exempted from the toll. The fees announced are on the higher side compared to other toll plazas in the state, which are likely to cause protests from road users. Advocate Paraniyam Devakumar, the patron of federation of residents’ associations, Thiruvananthapuram, (FRAT) said that levying a fee of Rs 70 for cars was very unfair. “Cars are no longer a luxury vehicle. Even middle class people use cars as their preferred transport mode these days, especially during this pandemic era when public transport modes are deemed unsafe,” Devakumar said. He added that though the fee for local residents were lesser, this too was unfair. Residents must be given exemption from paying the toll as most people were affected by financial crisis owing to the lockdowns induced by the pandemic, Devakumar added. Meanwhile, NHAI officials here said that they did not have any other option. This fee structure had to be followed if the capital cost investment had to be recovered. “We have incurred an expenditure of over Rs 1,000 crore just for the 26-km of the NH stretch from Kazhakkoottam to Mukkola. This includes construction of the highway and related structures, including service roads, elevated highways, drainage lanes, foot over bridges and culverts. The fees are fixed based on the total expenditure,” said a senior officer with NHAI. The work of the second phase of the NH stretch from Mukkola to Karode (16.2km) and an elevated highway at Kazhakkoottam are currently going on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/transit-along-new-nh-66-bypass-road-to-get-costlier/articleshow/85335676.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: After 23 years of litigation, sepoy’s widow to get his disability pension||CHANDIGARH: After 23 years of litigation, the plea of a disabled infantry soldier of the Sikh Regiment — who died during the pendency of the petition — against the "illegal" rejection of his claim for disability pension was finally allowed, holding him eligible for disability pension. The Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) has asked the Army to release the disability pension of the late Sepoy Paramjit Singh till the date of his death and family pension thereafter to the widow, Amarjit Kaur. Singh joined the Army as a fit soldier in 1988 and served in field areas, but was invalided out in 1993 when he incurred diabetes in service. Though his disability was declared "attributable/aggravated by stress and strain of military service" by the medical board entitling him to disability pension, his claim was illegally rejected by the defence accounts department despite various judgments of the Supreme Court and the high court's ruling that the accounts department did not have the power to overrule positive declarations of medical boards. He was not even paid normal pension since he did not have the requisite qualifying service for service pension. The family lived in extreme poverty after his invalidation from service. Paramjit filed a writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court, which was later transferred to the AFT. Setting aside the orders of the accounts department, the Chandigarh bench of the AFT, comprising Justice Mohammad Tahir and Vice Admiral HCS Bisht, has now directed to pay the Sepoy’s disability element. Legal experts point out a trend has lately emerged where Military Regimental Records Offices have started flooding the AFT with "Review" and "Leave to Appeal" applications in matters decided in favour of veterans, which are already settled by courts, thereby clogging the system. Experts further state that such applications are being filed circumventing the detailed procedure prescribed by the defence minister in 2015 which prohibits such applications without explicit sanction of the defence ministry or filing of reviews and appeals in matters settled by high courts and the Supreme Court. Tribunals facing shortage of members AFT benches are functioning at a fraction of the authorised strength. The Chandigarh Bench is functioning with only one judicial and administrative member against the strength of three each and is also holding court for the Shimla circuit and Jammu benches. Apart from the AFT, even other tribunals are facing massive shortage of members on account of protracted litigation wherein rules made by the central government which undermined the judicial independence of tribunals and made them subservient to the executive, were repeatedly struck down by high courts and the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-23-yrs-of-litigation-sepoys-widow-to-get-his-disability-pension/articleshow/85337685.cms||Ajay Sura

The party said that Swapnesh Sherlekar will contest from Tivim, while Roshan Mathias will be the party’s candidate for Calangute constituency. State convener for Goencho Avaaz Viriato Fernandes said that the party will not compromise with the two constituencies in the upcoming elections. “Over time, we will be announcing more candidates in other constituencies as per the requests we receive, from people who are desperately looking out for clean and honest alternatives. Goencho Avaaz Party remains committed to fulfilling Mission Clean-up Goa politics,” said Fernandes. Fernandes described the current MLAs as “turncoats and corrupt” who have sold Goa to the highest bidder for personal profit and self-interest. He also said that the high-handed approach of the state government to push through the three destructive linear projects, an ill-thought out CZMP plan and the Goa Adhikarni Bhumiputra Bill, proves the ill intentions of the government. Roshan Mathias, vice-president of Goencho Avaaz said that Calangute is facing its darkest days under the successive oppressive regime of the government. “Land-grabbing by external land sharks, who are hand-in-glove with politicos has been detrimental to the local Calangute populace to an extent of forceful displacement of the local,” said Mathias. Mathias said that lack of basic infrastructure and “lawless decadence masquerading as tourism” has heaped misery on the locals. From environmental issues to panchayat level functioning, active gram sabhas, RTI related matters. and public interest litigations, Mathias has been vocal in Calangute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goencho-avaaz-to-contest-tivim-calangute-seats-in-2022/articleshow/85339069.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The two recently-conducted waste collection drives for glass waste and cloth waste were organized across all the wards. Despite the logistic difficulties involved in organizing the drive, the city corporation has decided to branch out to all wards and propagate the idea of sorting, segregation and handing over the collected waste to proper agency among the city residents. As much as 31 tonnes of glass waste and 3.5 tonnes of cloth waste were collected by the corporation in the past one week. The dry waste collection has been halted in the city for almost a year mainly due to the Covid-19 related issues and earlier delay in settlement of bills to the firms chosen for the collection and transportation of dry waste. The health wing of the corporation has already prepared a new plan to revamp the dry waste collection system in the city. Zone-based collection using agencies and monitoring using weigh bridges have been mooted. The waste collected in the past one week will be handed over to the agencies whose contract has been extended for the time being. Once the council clears the new plan put forward by the health wing and approves the rates for collection and transportation, the system will be extended for 11 different types of dry waste.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/now-dry-waste-collection-centre-for-each-ward-in-city/articleshow/85335703.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Nashik district administration has instructed all organisations and schools to adhere to all Covid norms during the unfurling of the Indian Tricolour on Sunday. Bhagwat Doifode, the resident deputy collector, said there are no restrictions on the celebrations. “But if schools are inviting teachers and students for the flag-hoisting ceremony, they must ensure that all Covid norms are followed,” he said. Many of the schools in the district have made arrangements for online celebrations so that students can be part of it. “Our teachers and non-teaching staff will be coming to school for the flag-hoisting event. But we have made arrangements so that our students can attend the event online,” said Nilufer Chavan, the principal of Wisdom High. Some schools have invited students of Class X to be physically present during the event as this is their last year in the school. State minister food, civic supplies and consumer protection and Nashik district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal will hoist the national flag on the premises of the divisional commissioner’s office on Nashik Road at 9.05 am on Sunday.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Unhappy with his ‘strand-by-strand cosmetic wig’, man gets back Rs 1.5 lakh||MUMBAI: Ordering a hair loss solutions company to refund Rs 1.50 lakh to a city man who paid Rs 2 lakh for a “strand-by-strand cosmetic”, a type of wig, but was disappointed as it was not natural-looking as promised, a district forum observed that hair affects the personality and confidence of a person, and the company cannot compel him to put a disliked product on his scalp. The forum also directed Advanced Hair Studio Pvt Ltd to pay Rs 15,000 as compensation and costs of the complaint to the 46-year-old man. The man had purchased the wig in 2014 after seeing advertisements of popular celebrities endorsing them. The man complained to Mumbai Suburban District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in October 2015 that the firm’s senior consultant showed him photographs of celebrities in which it appeared the wigs allegedly provided by them gave a look as if the hair was naturally grown. The man said he made full payment in September 2014. The man said he was disappointed and dissatisfied as the product fixed on his scalp looked like a normal wig, which could be bought for Rs20,000-50,000. He said the pre-assurance about getting an “exclusive natural look” was totally missing. The man said he paid an exorbitant amount because of the assurances. He said that when he wanted the wig removed he had to pay Rs1,050 for a solution. The man said he moved the forum when requests for a refund were rejected. The firm submitted said they had studios across India. It said they provided at least a 45- minute consultation session, where the man was told about four procedures offered for hair loss. The company said the man had even signed a declaration clearly stating that he had thoroughly understood all details about the procedure. It said that as per terms and conditions of the quotation, the amount was non-refundable. But the forum said if a complainant was not satisfied with the product and treatment, he has the right to repudiate the contract. It said terms and conditions mentioned in the quotation or declaration form were not binding on him. “Another point of view is that the hair is a very important part of our body which affects the personality and overall body language of the person, which is a very effective part of the beauty of the person. Every person having their own hairstyle and beauty... not easily agree to sacrifice with his beauty and personality,” the forum said. It said that while the man has the right to seek a refund, considering the material cost and other things, it was not justifiable to refund the full amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-unhappy-with-his-strand-by-strand-cosmetic-wig-man-gets-back-rs-1-5l/articleshow/85339068.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Niranjana A V, Sneha B, Sivakami V S, Varsha V S, and Amanchi Dharani are the ones who brought laurels to the college. “As they have been performing well and being university toppers in all other semesters, we expected these girls to bring ranks to the college. Besides showing a genuine interest in the subject, they were equally active in academics and extra-curricular activities. During the online classes, their curiosity had prompted us to prepare more and to include more interactive sessions,” said Vinitha Mohan, head of the department, philosophy. All the five girls chose philosophy after completing their higher secondary education under science stream. Niranjana and Sneha, who scored first and second ranks respectively, opted for philosophy out of their real passion for literature and aesthetics. While the fifth rank holder, Dharani, a native of Andhra Pradesh, says she took philosophy as she could not score well in her class XII exams, “I found it difficult to get admission for graduation, so, the principal of the college suggested philosophy. I was not aware of the subject then, but gradually I became passionate about it and my intention was to excel in whatever I choose,” she said. Initially, these students were also anxious about the online classes. “A sudden switch to online classes was challenging. By giving ample breaks between the classes and making interactions friendly, our teachers made everything so easy and interestingStudy materials, including notes, were shared by teachers,” said Niranjana . “Even the personal notes prepared by us were shared among all in the classSneha, the second rank holder, is my best friend and she used to share many additional points during our last-minute discussions,” she said. Sneha and Niranjana were active in the activities of the NSS unit. While Varsha is into singing, Dharani loves to do anchoring.

A total of Rs 34,220.65 crore has been allocated for agriculture and allied sectors for the year 2021-22, said agriculture minister M R K Panneerselvam. A separate wing to focus on organic farming, an agro-industrial corridor from Trichy to Nagapattinam, and a moringa export zone in the districts of Theni, Dindigul, Karur, Tuticorin, Ariyalur, Tirupur and Madurai are highlights. As is the Kalaignarin Anaithu Grama Orunginaintha Velaan Valarchi Thittam, a scheme to ensure all the 12,524 village panchayats are self-sufficient in farm produce. This year the plan is to implement it in 2,500 village panchayats at a cost of Rs 250 crore. Reflecting the DMK’s focus on Tamil culture and heritage, the Budget made permission from collectors mandatory for cutting down palmyra trees. Besides, 76 lakh palmyra seednuts and one lakh almyra seedlings will be distributed to farmers with full subsidy in 30 districts this year. Uzhavar sandhais (farmers’ market), the brainchild of the late chief minister M Karunanidhi, will get a makeover. “The government will put an end to all measures taken to dilute the objectives behind uzhavar sandhais and will rejuvenate them,” the minister said. There was something for all sections in the Budget. Stressing that the agriculture sector will prosper at a faster pace only when youngsters become job creators rather than job seekers, the minister said the government proposed to impart training in capacity building with the help of agri-business firms and alumni. The government will also introduce teaching of agriculture and horticulture courses at the undergraduate level in Tamil. Mission mode will be adopted to conserve traditional varieties of paddy, develop skills among rural youth and promote cultivation of millets, cotton and coconut. To aid farmers forced to sell their produce at low prices, the government also announced the setting up of an organisation to give a fillip to the food processing industry. Storage and transaction facilities for agriculture produce will come up near ten regulated markets, where the farmers could sell their produce with minimum transportation cost. “It is proposed to establish modern cold storages in two locations, Oddanchattiram and Panruti, based on the requests received from the farmers during the discussions held,” Panneerselvam said. Pulses will be procured through cooperative societies and civil supplies corporation and supplied to PDS and noon meal scheme, while minor millet rice will be supplied to PDS in cities such as Chennai and Coimbatore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dmk-allocates-rs-34000cr-for-agri-allied-sectors-in-tns-1st-exclusive-farm-budget/articleshow/85337703.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Munambam police register over 4,000 migrant workers||Kochi: Munambam Janamaithri police station has achieved an ambitious task of registering almost all the migrant workers employed in the area and issuing them an easy identification card within two days’ time. The unique initiative of labour data collection shows that a total of 4,207 migrant workers from 11 states are working in Munambam. The maximum number of workers is from Tamil Nadu (2,472), while 1,232 are from West Bengal. A total of 342 workers are from Odisha, while 79 are from Andhra Pradesh and 70 from Assam. There are 10 from states like Jharkhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi. Soon after the fishing sector resumed operations once the trawling ban was lifted, the police stepped in to gather information in the wake of past experiences of an influx of migrant workers seeking employment in the area, said CPO T S Subeesh and ASI T S Siju who coordinated the operation. “Compared to other police stations, Munambam’s migrant workers are predominantly employed in the fishing sector – either working on boats or in the harbour or ice plants. We have registered all those working in this sector within two days’ time. Now only 50 workers from the hospitality industry, working mainly in resorts and hotels are left to register. That will be completed by August 31st,” said ASI T S Siju. “We had earlier convened a meeting of the employers from the fishing sector seeking their co-operation in this. Each data sheet had detailed information of the worker, along with a copy of his Aadhaar card and a photograph. When they registered with us, we issued an identification card in return to each of them,” Siju said. The data collected included name, address, phone number of the worker and details of the employer. It also had the home address and the name and phone number of a relative of the migrant worker from his home state. The data came extremely helpful when a migrant worker Jogesh Das from Bengal died at a hospital as preparing the documents for repatriation of the body could be swiftly done using the data. “Next year, we will be using an online data collection method. Employers will be able to fill in online forms and when the workers arrive, we could verify the information and could issue passes,” Siju said. District police chief (Ernakulam Rural) K Karthik, Munambam DySP R Baijukumar and SHO A L Yesudas backed the project and data collection activities were supervised by SI K S Shyamkumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/munambam-police-register-over-4000-migrant-workers/articleshow/85335836.cms||Shenoy Karun

Not disclosing any names, Rawat told TOI, “In politics, we remain in touch with everyone. But, its is a fact that BJP MLAs, due to non-performance of the state government, are fearing defeat in the polls and are seeing a winnable alternative in Congress.” Notably, speculation was rife in political circles that several BJP leaders, especially those who had earlier left Congress for BJP, are upset since the BJP chose Puskhar Singh Dhami as the new chief minister of Uttarakhand. Congress has recently appointed Harish Rawat as the head of the Congress campaign committee in the state and a likely candidate for the Chief Minister’s post from the principal opposition party. Speaking on the suspension of the Twitter account of party leader Rahul Gandhi, Rawat said that Twitter is acting on the behest of the union government, adding that, “efforts are being made to silence people in a democracy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/several-bjp-mlas-are-in-touch-with-congress-fearing-defeat-in-assembly-elections-says-harish-rawat/articleshow/85333910.cms||Gaurav Talwar

As many as 288 vehicles under Ernakulam RTO limit were converted to CNG ones till August 14 this year, against 473 vehicles last year. The number of vehicles being converted into CNG ones have increased after the pandemic induced restrictions were lifted last year. The conversion continued to keep its momentum from June last year, and every month more than 40 vehicles were converted till the second lockdown was imposed in May this year. The highest number of vehicles converted in a month under Ernakulam RTO limit before the pandemic was in February last year - 23 vehicles. Soon after the state government lifted the restrictions, conversion of vehicles has picked up momentum with 30 in July and another 30 in just 14 days of August. The highest number of vehicles converted in a month under Ernakulam RTO was in November last year with 87 vehicles, followed by 79 in January this year. Compared to previous years, it is the rural areas which show more takers for converted CNG vehicles than in the city limits. Conversion of vehicles in Perumbavoor, Muvattupuzha, Aluva, Mattancherry and Tripunithura has already somewhat touched the number of vehicles converted last year. As many as 219 vehicles were converted into CNG last year in Perumbavoor joint RTO limit, whereas, 217 vehicles have been converted till August this year. “Rising petrol prices force owners to convert their vehicles into CNG as per the provisions of the motor vehicles department,” said Perumbavoor JRTO Prakash. Meanwhile, an owner who wants to convert his vehicle has to shell out more than Rs 50,000 to retrofit it with a CNG kit, the price of which has increased after the pandemic. The rising demand and short supply of the kits for conversion are some of the issues faced. The agencies which retrofit the kits are flooded with enquiry from vehicle owners and bus operators for the past two months as the price of the fossil fuel touched Rs 100. “The price of the CNG tank is around Rs 20,000 now, without GST. It was only around Rs 12,500 before the pandemic. When the lockdown was announced, manufacturing of cylinders and importing of components required for manufacturing the kits were affected. This led to a shortage in the availability of kits while the demand skyrocketed. With the corporate vehicle manufacturing companies focusing on launching their own CNG vehicles, the availability of kits reduced further,” says Ayyappan B, managing director of Surabhi Gas Track pvt ltd. At present, it takes a day to retrofit a kit in a vehicle as the infrastructure in the retrofitting firms are not yet upgraded to meet the rising demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/soaring-fuel-price-forces-more-people-to-favour-cng-vehicles/articleshow/85335759.cms||T C Sreemol

The Indian Air Force (IAF) has lifted heavy equipment for underwater search and rescue from Visakhapatnam on the intervening night of August 13 and 14 to the air force station in Pathankot. Specialized divers from Navy and Army’s Special Forces have been carrying out work along with officials of other agencies. Specialised machines, including multi-beam sonars, side scanners, remotely operated vehicles and underwater manipulators have been flown in from Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai and Kochi, and pressed into action. The expansive water reservoir is around 25km long, 8km wide, and more than 500 feet deep. Apart from this, expertise and equipment of Army, Navy, IAF, NDRF, SDRF, NGOs, state police, dam authority and private firms from all over the country have also deployed in the search operation. Recently, the search team had digitally located the wreckage of the helicopter. According to those involved in the operation, the deep underwater operation is challenging due to the near-zero visibility below 50 metres owing to the colloidal nature of water in this season which adversely impacts accuracy of sonars and other sensors. A small area of 60m by 60m has been localised and special sonar equipment flown in from Kochi is being employed to enable the search operations to enter their final phase. The Advanced Light Helicopter Rudra of the Army Aviation Squadron had taken off from Mamun Cantonment at 10.20am on August 3 and crashed in the Ranjit Sagar Dam area about 30 km from Pathankot while carrying out low-level sorties. PRO Defence at Jammu Lt Col Devender Anand said, “Search operations continue unabated despite bad weather and rain. Experts, specialised equipment and divers are being continuously flown in and international assistance is also being sought. No efforts are being spared for early conclusion of the search operation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/day-13-submarine-rescue-teams-of-navy-flown-in-to-find-missing-helicopter-pilots/articleshow/85337749.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Covid-related isolation & school closure tell on kids’ mental health||MUMBAI: When 12-year-old Mihir (name changed) stopped attending online classes, his parents tried to coax him to change his mind. The Andheri-based student then ran out of their flat and hid in the building’s basement for a few hours before coming up with a demand: Will attend school offline, but not online. A 10-year-old boy in Ahmednagar who had stopped talking and sleeping at night was taken to psychiatrists in various cities. “One morning, he went to the school building on his own, saying he wanted to meet his teachers,” said a psychologist from Mumbai who helped counsel the child. While these are only two examples of how children miss schools and friends due to Covid lockdowns, experts say there are more; the pandemic has altered the mental health balance in some children. “Schools are a lab where emotional and social development takes place. Children have interactions and bond with one another. It is the place they encounter laughter, play and problems and learn how to solve them,” said psychiatrist Harish Shetty. Long-term closure of schools, he said, had led to some children battling “sadness, loneliness and a sense of isolation”. On Friday and Saturday, he tweeted about the need to reopen schools—albeit in phases. “Education is the right of the child! Open schools as a pilot project in districts that has least #COVID19 in #Maharashtra. #vaccinate all school staff on an asap basis,” he tweeted. The Maharashtra government’s pediatric state task force on Covid has already prepared guidelines for reopening schools and submitted them to the chief minister’s office. “We have given a detailed plan on the measures to be adopted before schools reopen. It will take time to adopt some recommendations such as the need to provide better ventilation,” said pediatrician and task force member Dr Vijay Yewale. The guidelines to reopen schools include structural changes, reorganising classes, planning classes in batches, ensuring every child’s temperature is tested at school entry points and even travel in batches instead of crowded buses. “We too realise the need to reopen schools but it cannot be done hastily. We need to prepare schools for opening and hold parents-teachers association meetings before doing so,” said Dr Yewale. In July, the United Nations started a campaign to reopen schools after its global education report warned that the losses children and young people incur from missing out on school may never be recouped. “From learning loss, mental distress, exposure to violence and abuse, to missed school-based meals and vaccinations or reduced development of social skills, the consequences for children will be felt in their academic achievement and societal engagement as well as physical and mental health,” said the Unesco report. Children from poorer countries are the worst hit as they do not have access to remote learning tools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-covid-related-isolation-school-closure-tell-on-kids-mental-health/articleshow/85337782.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC permits 19-year-old girl to leave father’s home||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court permitted a 19-year-old to leave her father’s home and make her own living arrangements, after her family violated the conditions set by court and continued to hinder her meetings with her boyfriend. The family is against her relationship with her boyfriend, who is yet to complete 21 years and cannot legally marry her. Last month, the youth moved the HC, complaining that his girlfriend was being forcibly detained by her family and not being allowed to meet him even though she is an adult. The HC interacted with her and sent her to the shelter home in Paldi on July 20. On August 2, the high court tried to bring an amicable solution to the problem. It asked the girl to live with her family upon certain assurances given by her father. One of the conditions was that she would be allowed to meet her boyfriend twice a week in the house and that she would be allowed to take up a job. This arrangement was made for a month and the HC was to hear the case further on September 6. But a week passed, and the girl came to the court once again and submitted that the family had continued to harass her and had also failed to keep any of the promises made before the court. She told to that she did not wish to go back to the shelter home and should be allowed to be left to her own devices. The court said that since she is adult, she cannot be forced to live with her family against her wish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-permits-19-year-old-girl-to-leave-fathers-home/articleshow/85337791.cms||---
---||Goa||Eye on Nuvem ticket, Mickky joins Cong||Panaji: Former tourism minister and four-time MLA Fransisco ‘Mickky’ Pacheco, joined Congress on Saturday in the presence of AICC Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao in Delhi. The former MLA with a chequered political history has also announced his intention to contest the 2022 assembly elections. Pacheco, who also held the rural development portfolio, was part of the earlier BJP-led state government till he was convicted and sentenced to six months for slapping a junior engineer with the power department in 2006. The chief of Goa Vikas Party (GVP), Pacheco stepped down from the Laxmikant Parsekar cabinet and has been out of politics, but is now hankering for the Nuvem assembly ticket from Congress. “The citizens of this country lived a better life under Congress governance. They are realising it now after seeing BJP government,” said the former MLA. Pacheco said that he is willing to work across the length and breadth of Goa to strengthen the party organisation and support it with election strategies. “Look, I’m a political surgeon. I can go to any constituency, work with the people, and help get the party candidate elected. Whatever other responsibilities the party delegates to me, I will wholeheartedly do,” said Pacheco. Pacheco’s first term as MLA was in June 2005, when he was elected from the Benaulim constituency as an NCP MLA. In the same year, Pacheco jumped to the United Goans Democratic Party. In June 2007, Pacheco returned to the NCP fold to win the Benaulim assembly seat. In March 2012, the flamboyant politician contested and won the Nuvem assembly seat as a candidate of the Goa Vikas Party. Pacheco, who is in his mid-fifties, is known for sporting bandana-ponytails and chunky gold chains. Prior to joining Congress, Pacheco said that he is against the idea of Congress forming an alliance with any other party for the 2022 polls. He had said that other parties should merge into Congress instead of fighting the polls in alliance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/eye-on-nuvem-ticket-mickky-joins-cong/articleshow/85339097.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Genome lab to begin testing on Tuesday, even if with few samples||MUMBAI: BMC’s latest acquisition, the genome laboratory at Kasturba Hospital, near Saat Rasta, will test its first batch of Covid-positive samples on Tuesday. While the plan is to run a complete cycle with 384 samples, BMC officials said it may not be possible to gather so many samples as the daily caseload was low. “We will wait until Monday to gather as many samples as possible, but we want to start off on genetic sequencing at the earliest,’’ said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. He said sequencing would start on Tuesday even if it was with fewer samples. The lab, with the latest genome sequencer donated by American manufacturer Illumina, was inaugurated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on August 4. The genome testing will reveal variants of Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus in circulation in Mumbai. In the last few days, genetic sequencing of Mumbai samples done in laboratories in Pune and Delhi revealed increasing number of Delta-plus variant along with the main Delta variant in Mumbai. A state government update on Friday stated that 11 out of 66 Delta plus cases in Maharashtra were from Mumbai. Of five deaths due to Delta plus, one victim was from Mumbai. The jury is out there on whether Delta plus can be as worrisome as the original Delta variant, which was responsible for the large second wave in the country. “The first Delta plus sample from Mumbai was found in April, and we have so far seen limited cases. So the Delta plus variant, also called AY.1*, doesn’t seem to be a big problem so far,’’ said a senior doctor. At the moment, BMC’s health department is busy gathering samples for the first round of genome-testing. Samples are being sought from four patient pools those who died of Covid, those with long hospital stay, those living in clusters and those with a history of foreign travel. “While it is good that there is a sharp dip in cases, hospital admissions and deaths due to Covid, we have not been able to gather required samples,’’ said Kakani. Operating a cycle with 384 samples would cost around Rs10,000 per sample, but fewer samples would mean more running costs. “But we have to make a start to gather information about the variants in circulation ahead of the possible third wave,’’ he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-genome-lab-to-begin-testing-on-tues-even-if-with-few-samples/articleshow/85337838.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Chandrapur falls off wagon, excise department eyes Rs 20,000 crore target||MUMBAI: The revenue mobilised by the excise department since April 1 seems to indicate that the target of Rs 20,000 crore for the current financial year will be met after the state government lifted the ban on sale and consumption of liquor in Chandrapur district. Chandrapur used to contribute nearly Rs 650 crore per year before the ban was imposed from April 1, 2015. After the ban was lifted, the excise department garnered Rs 60 crore in July alone. “We expect that the same trend will continue. Liquor consumption in Chandrapur district is on the rise. In the current financial year, we expect to mobilise Rs 650 crore from Chandrapur district,’’ an official said. Following a protest lodged by a social activist, the state had imposed a ban on sale and consumption of liquor in Chandrapur from April 1, 2015. At the time, Devendra Fadnavis was the CM, while BJP politician Sudhir Mungantiwar was guardian minister of Chandrapur. On May 27, the MVA government led by Uddhav Thackeray lifted the ban to tackle the resource crunch. The district has renewed licences of 250 permit rooms and bars, 32 beer shops, two clubs, four wine shops and 72 country liquor shops from July 1. In a month, 8.02 lakh bulk litres of country liquor, 2.12 lakh bulk litres of Indian-made foreign liquor, 1.88 lakh bulk litres of strong beer, 19,000 bulk litres of mild beer and 1,964 bulk litres of wine has been consumed. An official said that last year, in view of the stringent lockdown, it was difficult for the department to achieve the target. “Thanks to the permission granted for home delivery and counter sale, the department was able to just achieve the target. Now that restrictions have been lifted, it appears that the department will achieve the target of Rs 20,000 crore. In the last four months, we have mobilised Rs 3,788 crore, while last year it was Rs 2,834 crore during the same period,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-chandrapur-falls-off-wagon-excise-dept-eyes-rs-20k-cr-target/articleshow/85339091.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The man allegedly befriended the Rajkot woman over Facebook and then with the promise to marry her, he developed physical relations with her. She accused 35-year-old Gautam Garaniya, a native of Amreli, of raping her multiple times in the last three years. According to the police, the woman claimed that after befriending her on the social media platform, the Surat resident exchanged mobile numbers with her and they started talking. Accused told her that he was working in the textile industry in Surat and they started having an affair.A few months later, Garaniya came to Rajkot to meet the complainant and stayed in a hotel. After a few meetings, he proposed her of marriage. The complainant stated that their intimate relationship started in February 2019, when the accused started visiting Rajkot and both would meet in a hotel where they had physical relations. But as time passed by, she came to know that Garaniya is married and has children too. Garaniya, however, promised to divorce his wife and to appease her, both went to Dwarka, Junagadh and Surat and stayed in hotels. After sometime they again went to Dwarka where the complainant this time refused any more physical relation before marriage, but he forced her to concede to his demands, she alleged. He again promised to marry her asking her not to lodge any police complaint against him. He also agreed to meet her father, the complainant stated. However, he backed out from all his promises and therefore, the woman finally lodged an FIR, police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/woman-files-rape-plaint-against-lover/articleshow/85335916.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||On Tikri road, farmers clear road partially, but not police||TIKRI BORDER (BAHADURGARH): Farmers camping at Tikri border since November 27 have freed enough space on National Highway (NH) 9 for vehicles to pass through and enter Delhi from Bahadurgarh, but authorities in Delhi are yet to lift the barricade. TOI visited Tikri border this week and found that farmers had set up temporary homes close to the road and made ample space for at least two vehicles to pass on one side of NH 9. Farmers who are camping on bypass roads, in a stretch of over 10km, too have given enough space for vehicles to pass. Bahadurgarh Chamber of Commerce and Industry vice-president Narinder Chhikara said they met Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and had written letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, but there seemed to be a political reason for not reopening the border. “There are around 12,000 MSMEs which have suffered losses of around Rs 22,000 crore so far and 1,200 factories are about to shut down. Industry has already been facing losses due to coronavirus, but if this goes on for more time, more industries would shut down. One has to bear a cost of around Rs 7,000 to make a round of Delhi to fetch or send material to Delhi as the direct way is closed. In earlier phases, farmers created issues; but, now, they have no problem with us crossing the border. However, police are not allowing anyone to cross. Delhi police officials are mum. Industrialists should get instant relief, else they would be forced to shut down their establishments,” he added. Contacted, BKU (Charuni) state president Gurnam Singh Charuni said it was up to the police to open the border or keep it sealed. “Farmers have no objection if all Delhi borders are opened by police as farmers have made their demands clear to the Union government and nothing more is required. We never created trouble for anyone and have been sitting peacefully. We will stage dharna till our demands are not met,” he added. Delhi police officials refused to comment on this issue. Jhajjar SP Rajesh Duggal said Haryana Police had not kept any barricades on the Tikri border and had kept the border open from their side. “Tikri border has not been sealed by Haryana Police," he added. Tikri protesters Parbhjot Singh, Baljit Singh, Ajit Singh and many others claimed that farmers did not want to trouble industrialists or the public. “We are protesting in a peaceful manner, but the saffron party is seeking to defame farmers by sealing borders. Farmers have freed one side completely and it’s up to Delhi police or government to open. One thing is clear: farmers will not step down until their demands are met. Delhi borders are their home for now. We have lost hundreds of people and suffered heavy losses, but all are mum about our plight,” said Prabhjot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/on-tikri-road-farmers-clear-road-partially-but-not-police/articleshow/85337839.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Teen’s dad tears into cops, mom, neighbours call for justice||PANAJI: The parents of the 19-year-old woman whose body was found at Calangute beach on Saturday lashed out at Goa police, with her father stating that the cops confused him while he was still disturbed after seeing his daughter’s body, and took a “wrong statement” from him. He also accused the police of spreading lies to the media regarding the deceased’s relationship with him. He said that when the body of the woman was found at the beach, he should have been called to identify it at the spot. “How did the police shift the semi-nude body? Police showed me the body at GMC, and I identified it to be that of my daughter. I asked the police where her clothes were, and the police told me they are searching for the same,” he said. He said that when he saw his daughter’s body, he was disturbed. “Despite being in this same disturbed condition, police personnel began confusing me all the more by questioning me if she had gone for a picnic, or whether she knew swimming,” he said. “Police confused me and took a wrong statement of mine. They have told the media that I have not given a mobile to my daughter. They also told the media that we used to have fights. She was my loving daughter,” he said. The father said that when he approached Mapusa police to register a missing complaint, police said that she must have had a boyfriend, and hence this incident must have happened. “I told the police that she is not like that, and she didn’t make calls to anyone,” he said. “We want justice, and whoever is behind the incident should be punished,” said the deceased’s mother. “We want to know how she died and why she died. If she died by suicide by jumping into the sea, then how come her body was dry and not wet?” She said that her daughter used to go out only with them, and not anybody else. “Why did the police not call us to the spot? What was their reason for shifting the body?” The father said that she had boarded the bus at Guirim. “Her sister was waiting for her at Porvorim, but I got a call from the sister that she did not reach Porvorim. After the call I went to Panaji to search for her,” he said. The father said that because police don’t act on complaints, such incidents take place and his daughter lost her life. The deceased’s neighbours too suspect foul play in her death. A relative of the deceased said that when he asked the doctor what was the quantity of water found in her stomach (as doctors said that she had drowned), the doctors said there was no water in her stomach. Another neighbour sought to know why she wasn’t clothed if she had died by suicide. “We will sit at Azad Maidan on Monday for justice, and if we don’t get justice, we will decide on a further course of action,” a neighbour said. Meanwhile, Aldona MLA Glen Ticlo said that chief minister Pramod Sawant would decide whether to transfer the case to the crime branch for a detailed investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/teens-dad-tears-into-cops-mom-neighbours-call-for-justice/articleshow/85337854.cms||---
---||Pune||One-hour waiting on weekend, many restaurants in Pune booked to capacity till Monday||PUNE: Many restaurants in the city are booked to capacity (50% of the total seating allowed) till Monday, sources from the hospitality sector told TOI, while referring to the response recorded during the first weekend without “Covid-19 restrictions”. Patrons have been pre-booking tables for the weekend since Thursday, and restos had no space to accommodate more on Saturday, especially with the 50% capacity rule. Huge waiting time outside fine-dining restaurants was reported in parts of the city, especially in areas like Koregaon Park, Balewadi High Street, Vimannagar, Kalyaninagar and Baner. “The waiting time for tables this weekend is about 35-60 minutes, but we do not have a better option since operational deadline is still restricted to 10pm. To preclude possibilities of crowding, the authorities must extend this deadline further, especially for fine-dining restos, where a chunk of patrons visiting are fully vaccinated,” Praful Chandawarkar, director, Malaka Spice told TOI. He said restricted deadlines could be retained for street-side shacks that flout hygiene and social distancing norms, but operational hours could be extended for fine-dining restaurants, which cater to educated guests, where percentage of full vaccination was higher. Some restaurant owners said they have been doing an informal survey on the vaccination status of those coming in, and have found that almost all those visiting upscale restos were fully vaccinated. “Most walk-in guests arrive at peak hours, between 8-10pm. With limited seating, all popular restaurants are completely full this weekend, starting Friday,” he said. Lovely Narang, president, United Hospitality Association, and owner Agent Jack’s, told TOI, “Because all restaurants were operating at 50% capacity, patrons had a difficult time getting a place on Saturday.” The restaurateurs said the increase in patron footfall has been apparent since restrictions were lifted, but seemed more pronounced on Friday-Saturday. Sanjay Singh, general manager - Radisson Blu Hotel, said, “We have seen increased footfalls of resident guests dropping by our multi-cuisine restaurant, bar and coffee shop after operational deadline was extended to 10pm. With this extension, several lunch functions, including weddings, have converted from morning events to night programmes.” Vikram Shetty, owner of Sadanand Resort and Sadanand Regency, said, “Some restaurants are avoiding taking in late reservations after 8-8.30pm as they have to wrap up earlier than usual. My Baner restaurant also reported a surge in footfalls and was filled to its 50% capacity during the weekend.” A city-based tippler visiting his favourite joint after months said, “All bars in the Kondhwa area were completely full on Saturday. There was a waiting of nearly 25 minutes at the lounge I visited. Many patrons were standing, waiting for the seats to empty. Some of them were even trying to stop more people from entering the lounge to preclude crowding. “ (With inputs from Joy Sengupta)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-hour-waiting-on-weekend-many-restos-booked-to-capacity-till-monday/articleshow/85335937.cms||Neha Madaan

However, until then, the authorities are to see that no heavy vehicular traffic goes over the bridge,” a division bench comprising Justice Sunil P Deshmukh and Justice Mahesh Sonak said. The government admitted that the condition of the bridge was not very good and that a report had accordingly been prepared. Advocate General Devidas Pangam told the court that immediate repairs are difficult due to the ongoing monsoon season and that the authorities would have to wait for some time. He added that stoppage of heavy vehicular traffic movement over the bridge is on. In his petition before the court, Sattari resident Vighnesh Shirgurkar said that the heavy traffic movement that the bridge experiences during the morning hours would have to be stopped. “In the circumstances, the authority concerned would, with the aid of the police, see that heavy vehicular traffic does not go over the bridge until it is repaired. The learned advocate general states that soon after the monsoon is over, repair of the bridge would be undertaken and on completion of repairs, the bridge would be made available for heavy traffic,” the court held. Shirgurkar, in a letter, had requested the high court to take cognisance of the serious condition of a bridge and road located between land survey numbers 60/1 and 110/1 in the village of Vante, Sattari. He stated that the bridge was in a ramshackle state and was likely to collapse, and pleaded for immediate measures to avert untoward incidents. His letter was accompanied with photographs. He also requested that heavy traffic over the bridge be stopped. The court had subsequently issued notice to the state through the chief secretary and the executive engineer, sub-division-IV, works division-XVI (PWD), Valpoi, Sattari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-bars-heavy-traffic-over-crumbling-sattari-bridge/articleshow/85339125.cms||---

He constantly worries about the safety of his mother and siblings, whom he left behind in Afghanistan when he fled to India as a refugee in 2018. They live in Tagab district, which was captured by the Taliban around a month ago. “My family tell me that all they hear every night are the sounds of explosions and gunshots,” said the 27-year-old Hamdard, who makes a living selling Afghani burgers in Lajpat Nagar. “Their life is worse than that of animals because they have no freedom. There is no work and the markets are closed in Tagab. Contacting them is difficult with mobile access unavailable most of the time.” Hamdard at least has his wife and two children, aged five and two years, safe in Delhi.  “I am unable to save any money because I don’t earn much and have ever rising expenses, but my children don’t have to go through the ordeal like those in my home country,” said the young man. With the Taliban gaining ground and taking control of important districts amid escalating violence, the Afghan refugees living in Delhi are filled with a sense of dread.  Shaki Erkin, who came to India alone around nine years ago, hasn’t heard from his family for over a fortnight after the Taliban occupied his village in Jawzjan province. “The phones of my relatives are switched off and there are no responses to my messages. I am terrified and can’t stop thinking of what might have happened to them,” said Erkin, who runs a stall selling Afghani fare and fries. When Erkin last spoke to his family, his kin told him that their vegetable crops had been damaged. In any case, they could no longer go to the city to sell them. An angry Erkin exclaimed, “They are terrorists. The Taliban only want destruction!” The refugees were glued to TV and mobile phones for news of Afghanistan when TOI met them on Thursday.  “Only the wealthy people there are happy. Most want to escape from Afghanistan,” declared a woman who has a small business in Jangpura. “But the borders are sealed and a visa is next to impossible to get.” Kabul is holding out and Safiullah Noori, 29, says he is able to converse regularly with his family and friends there. “We fear they will capture Kabul soon. Things aren’t normal in Kabul and we are tense,” said Noori, a cook at an Afghan restaurant in Bhogal. His younger brother graduated from a Pune college and went to the Afghan capital for a visit but is unable to return to India now. Noori reached Delhi in December 2019 with his wife and brother-in-law. UNHCR registered him in January 2020 as an asylum seeker, but his application for refugee status is still being considered.  “I was a chef at international-level hotels and restaurants in Kabul, but haven’t been able to find good jobs in Delhi because I don’t have a refugee card,” Noori said. “Without refugee status, I am unsure about my future in India.” According to Ahmad Gia Ghani, head of Afghan Solidarity Committee, around 22,000 Afghan refugees live in India, around 13,000 of whom are asylum seekers. “Getting a refugee status is difficult,” shrugged Ghani, adding, “The Taliban target families of those working for the government or international organisations. They want young girls and widows to be married to their fighters. It is a terrible situation.” Qais Arash, who helps patients from Afghanistan get admissions in city hospitals, said, “Many people are here on a medical visa, but no one wants to go back home. The problem is visa expiration and the fines imposed for overstaying. They may not be permitted to re-enter Afghanistan for some years too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/away-from-gunshots-and-explosions-afghan-refugees-lose-sleep-over-turmoil-back-home/articleshow/85335930.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

With the addition of 5,787 cases on Saturday, the state had added 81,817 cases this month, which is lower than the 1.18 lakh cases added in the first two weeks of July. Also, the state added 134 deaths on Saturday, taking the total added this month to 2,073, which is lower than the 2,128 deaths added in July. The total cases in the state rose to 63.87 lakh and deaths rose to 1,34,909. For the sixth consecutive day on Saturday, the daily Covid tally in the city was lower than 300 cases. On Saturday, suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted that there was no active containment zone in Mumbai. The state Covid update showed that 265 cases and six deaths were registered on Saturday. In the first fortnight of August, the city registered 4,080 cases and 96 deaths, as against 7,814 cases and 203 deaths in the first fortnight of July. “The Covid situation is clearly under control at the moment,’’ said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. He said BMC was using the decline to build new jumbo facilities ahead of the possible third wave. The jumbo facility at BKC grounds has already restarted after being closed for few months for upgradation. “The Malad facility is functional and the Mulund one too is ready to be commissioned,’’ he said. He said the jumbo facilities would be commissioned as and when the requirement arises. Two other facilities under construction at Sion and Kanjurmarg may take around a month for completion. Senior state government officials say that there are at least 6-7 districts in the state that still need to be under surveillance as they are still adding many cases. “Cases in the state are also plateauing, but if cases in these districts are brought under control, the state’s graph will stablise further,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cases-in-2-weeks-of-aug-lower-than-those-in-july-1st-fortnight/articleshow/85338145.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Accused had procured answer key from J&K||Chandigarh: While intensifying investigation into the HSSC constable recruitment exam, Kaithal police claims to have arrested Raj Kumar, a resident of Khanda Kheri village of Hisar, who had first procured the answer key. Raj Kumar is among the four persons arrested by the Kaithal police in the last three days. Now total number of persons arrested in the case in Kaithal has gone to 17. Besides this, cops have also impounded a Bolero jeep spotted near an examination centre. The jeep is found to be registered in the name of the father of a constable. They were accused of arranging paper solvers, who appeared on behalf of candidates in centres of Karnal. Karnal police has arrested seven persons so far in the case of implementation. According to the police, Raj Kumar had got the answer key from Jammu and Kashmir and had brought the same to Haryana and sold to Narender, the main accused for Rs 1 crore. Narender had further clicked a deal with Ramesh of Balaji Acadamy and the two sold the key to candidates for Rs 12-18 lakh, “ Further investigation are in progress and our teams are now looking for the source paper and answer key leak now. Besides this, the police parties are in the process of apprehending candidates, who had procured the answer key with money,” said cops. It may be recalled that last Saturday, HSSC had started conducting written tests for recruitment of constables in Haryana police. As the answer key of the test was found to have been leaked a day ahead of test, the commission had cancelled the test and announced to reschedule the same in the future. As of now, 17 persons, including kingpins Ramesh and Narinder, have been arrested from Kaithal, seven from Karnal and two each have been arrested from Fatehabad and Hisar districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/accused-had-procured-answer-key-from-jk/articleshow/85337888.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Delhi||DDA: IDLI manages to reduce red tape||New Delhi: IDLI, a complete online interface by the Delhi Development Authority for conversion, mutation and extension of time for all types of land and shops, has transformed over the last one year the working of an organisation where red tape was seen as routine and getting any such work done without a tout or bribe would have been difficult. The Interactive Disposal of Land Information (IDLI) system which has done away with movement of physical files has so far disposed of 2,165 applications for e-conversion out of a total 4,671 applications. In the case of e-mutations, the land disposal department has disposed of 1,533 applications out of the total 1,864 received by DDA so far.The IDLI system was developed by DDA without any expenses. “I came across frequent complaints of files and papers going missing, which was a major pain for people. So, we needed to find an IT solution so that all papers are available online in our system and there is no physical interaction. All queries are raised and responses are submitted online and there is zero physical interaction,” said Subu R, former commissioner (land disposal) in DDA, who conceptualised and implemented it. He is currently posted as principal director, office of CAG, looking after the Railway Board. The system that was rolled out on August 13 last year is working well and now the Authority is focusing on quick disposal of applications, said DDA vice chairman Anurag Jain. “We have expedited the processing of applications in the past few months. Now we are targeting to ensure that we don’t have any pending applications beyond the prescribed 90 days. We are hopeful of achieving this soon,” he added.Subu said the system has features to communicate with the applicants back and forth including payment gateways which saves lot of time while nothing is lost in transit. “The position of the file is known to the applicant and therefore the philosophy of monitoring is theoretically transferred to the public. Since the time stamping of each event is possible, the responsibility can be easily fixed with no more missing or file lost cases,” he told TOI.Another DDA official said now with all details available online in the system, they can locate where the files are and the officers responsible for processing them. “So, accountability is fixed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-idli-manages-to-reduce-red-tape/articleshow/85335948.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||India||PM Modi engaging in duplicity on Pakistan with eye on UP poll: Congress||NEW DELHI: Releasing a March 22 letter Narendra Modi had written to Imran Khan on Pakistan’s “national day”, Congress on Saturday said Narendra Modi has deep love for the neighbouring country but resorts to duplicity and invokes the Partition when faced with polls. Dubbing the emphasis on “Partition” a sly bid to polarise society, it said Modi has been left without a plank to go to people because of inflation, high fuel prices, farmers’ protest and irregularities in the Ram Temple foundation, and has thus started planning for a divisive campaign in Uttar Pradesh like the “shamshan-kabrastan” drive in last the elections. AICC spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said it was on March 22 in 1940 that the Muslim League in its Lahore session passed a resolution on Pakistan, on the basis of which the League launched a movement for a separate country. “Imagine, the PM of India on March 22 congratulated Pakistan on the anniversary of such a day, and then he sheds crocodile tears on it to serve his political interests,” he said. Stressing “Modi‘s love for Pakistan”, the AICC said Modi went to Pakistan uninvited on December 25, 2015 for dinner and then invited the ISI to probe the terrorist attack on the Pathankot airbase. It said the irony was that ISI had orchestrated the attack. Surjewala said the country was asking Modi when would he reduce fuel prices, give jobs to the youth, clarify on the Pegasus scandal and withdraw the farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-engaging-in-duplicity-on-pakistan-with-eye-on-up-poll-congress/articleshow/85340467.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Just 14% fully vaccinated in Nagpur, two dose norm may raise hackles||NAGPUR: To implement the new guidelines of state government, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) from Sunday has made completion of 14 days from second dose of vaccine mandatory for those entering the city from other states, for visiting malls and working in offices, commercial establishments, restaurants etc. With just over 14% of total population in the city fully vaccinated, the traders’ association and experts feel the new guidelines will create controversy and increase inspector raj. From August 16, the NMC’s nuisance detection squad (NDS) will start visiting various establishments. If final vaccination certificate is not produced, warning will be given during the first visit and action in the second visit. In its new guidelines, the government has made two vaccine doses mandatory while permitting almost all commercial establishments and increasing timings of essential, non-essential shops, restaurants etc to 10pm. It even allowed parcel service from restaurants round the clock. As per data of the state’s public health department, the estimated population of the district is 52.73 lakh. Of them, 19,32,580 people have taken the first dose between January 16 and August 12, which comes to 36.65% of total population. As per data available till Friday, second dose has been given to 6,78,675 people — 12.87% of total population. In city having population of 29 lakh, second dose has been given to 4,24,678 people, which is 14.64% coverage. First dose has been given to 10,35,663 people, which is 35.71% of total population. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI that the new norms will be implemented in an effective manner. “There are sufficient number of centres where people can get two doses easily. We are ready to help associations of traders, restaurants etc to plan and ensure two doses for all the staff,” he said. Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) Dr Anup Marar said that the rules for entering city from other states, visiting malls or working in offices might compel the ill-informed hesitant citizens to get vaccinated. “There are empty counters at most private hospitals that are flush with vaccine vials. Moreover, negative RT-PCR report should be sought from all those entering Maharashtra, like in case of many states. Likewise, NMC should make vaccination compulsory and conduct door-to-door screening,” he said. Terming the condition of two doses as a good move, president of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT), Dipen Agrawal, said that it will encourage people to get fully vaccinated and prevent third wave. “But it violates the fundamental rights like right to life, personal liberty and livelihood, especially when there is no relation between full vaccination and continuation of profession or occupation. The new norm will increase harassment and inspector raj,” he said. Agrawal stated that the new norms are not justified, particularly considering the pace of vaccination in the state. “The government is unable to ensure sufficient doses at the centres. Duration between two doses of Covishield is 12-16 weeks,” he said. He demanded speeding up the vaccination drive and giving more time to owners and staff of shops, malls, restaurants, bars and banquet halls. “Condition of first dose is acceptable to some extent but it should not be applicable to below 18 years group as they are not yet eligible for vaccination. I doubt whether mandatory/forced vaccination will withstand judicial scrutiny,” said Agrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/just-14-fully-vaxxed-in-city-2-dose-norm-may-raise-hackles/articleshow/85335971.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Pune||Pune: Individualize risk assessment in Covid cured, say doctors||PUNE: Experts have advised against delaying elective (nonurgent) surgeries among the Covid-19 recovered in view of the residual symptoms as it could complicate the pre-existing conditions. Residual Covid symptoms, are common and may linger for more than 60 days after the diagnosis in the Covid recovered. A Covid-recovered patient’s pre-operative risk assessment should be individualized, by factoring in surgical intensity, co-morbidities and the risk-benefit ratio, the experts said. “As per the existing guidelines, not everyone should wait for 4-12 weeks for an elective surgery after recovering from Covid-19. The pre-operative risk assessment cannot be generalized. If an elective surgery is going to ease the complications, it should be considered an essential surgery, if not an emergency one,” said surgeon Sanjay Kolte, president of the Poona Surgical Society. Delay in seeking medical care for various anal conditions is also being seen very commonly among people. “We are seeing many patients of fistula, who are postponing the advised surgery even after the considerable time after Covid recovery. Fistula has the tendency to branch over a period of time and can get complicated,” said Healing Hands Clinic’s chief proctologist Ashwin Porwal. Porwal said, “Last week, I came across two such cases. One presented with the extension of the fistula from the scrotum to the abdominal wall. He had to be operated on in an emergency with specialized surgery. Another case was associated with bleeding piles. The patient came with haemoglobin dropped terribly low to six grams per deciliter (g/dl). He was given a blood transfusion and was operated in emergency with laser surgery.” Experts from the India and the American Society of Anaesthesiology have issued norms for carrying out elective surgeries in Covid recovered. “The guidelines only help surgeons in prioritization of cases. They do not interfere in surgeon’s discretion about scheduling an elective surgery as per the individual patient’s need,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/doctors-individualize-risk-assessment-in-covid-cured/articleshow/85335954.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Pune: Malls, shops to operate till 10pm from today in PMC, PCMC limits||PUNE: All shops and malls will operate till 10pm — two hours more than the earlier 8pm deadline — in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits from Sunday following the state government’s relaxation guidelines, but the rural areas in the district would not get any additional relaxations. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday communicated the revised guidelines to for the municipal corporation areas in the district to divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao because the weekly Covid review meeting was not conducted this week. Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioners, Vikram Kumar and Rajesh Patil, respectively, subsequently issued fresh relaxation orders on the lines of the state government’s August 11 order. According to the new directives, people can travel by local trains 14 days after getting both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine. The eligible commuters will have to procure a pass through a system announced by the state government. The public relations officer of the Pune railway division, Manoj Jhawar, said he was yet to receive any orders and would plan only after getting instructions from the state government. Salons, gyms and spas have been allowed to remain open till 10pm in the corporation areas. Multiplexes and places of worship would remain closed. According to the new guidelines based on the state government order, patrons will have to wear a mask while waiting for a table or till the food arrives. Restaurant owners have been told to keep a few windows or doors open for better ventilation. Only fully vaccinated people would be allowed to enter malls though they would operate for longer hours. Divisional commissioner Rao said, “We were instructed by the deputy chief minister to issue orders for the city areas on the lines of the state government orders. So, all shops, malls and restaurants will operate till 10pm. We have not relaxed restrictions in rural areas. They will continue to follow the orders issued last week.” Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar told TOI, “We shall be continuously monitoring Covid cases ward-wise and ensure that more tests are conducted.” Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said there would be strict monitoring of Covid appropriate behaviour though the relaxations were announced. Mahendra Pitaliya, the secretary of the Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP), welcomed the decision to allow shops to operate longer. “We have been cooperating with the government in Covid mitigation initiatives for the past one-and-a-half years. The traders and shopkeepers are following necessary precautions. The additional working hours would be a big respite for the shopkeepers,” Pitaliya said. Residents of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas also heaved a sigh of relief. “We are heading towards regular life with baby steps. Hope the opening up process will continue,” said a techie from Hadapsar. The district’s weekly Covid-19 positivity rate declined to 3.8% for the August 5-11 period — the lowest in the past seven months and 0.9% less than the previous week’s 4.7%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/malls-shops-to-operate-till-10pm-from-today-in-pmc-pcmc-limits/articleshow/85335950.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Hyderabad||Revenue tribunals add to Telangana farmers’ woes||HYDERABAD: A day after the Telangana high court slapped notices on Rangareddy and Nizamabad district collectors over special revenue tribunals, thousands of farmers and landowners are now on the horns of a dilemma whether they would get a chance to present their arguments before the special tribunals or do they have to approach civil courts to resolve land disputes. Even as the fate of 17 lakh acres of land that are in dispute hangs in balance, the high court’s recent order that the tribunals cannot dispose of 16,000 revenue cases without first conducting hearings has put the state government in a spot of bother. The government set up the revenue tribunals for quick disposal of land disputes. According to revenue officials, there were 16,910 cases pending in various revenue courts, headed by tahsildars, revenue divisional officers and joint collectors. Soon after the state government abolished revenue courts and formed special revenue tribunals led by district collectors, all the cases were transferred to the tribunals. However, the tribunals headed by the collectors delivered judgments in a unilateral way without giving a chance to the parties to put forth their arguments before the court. “Following the directions from the state government, the collectors have disposed of all the cases in just one stroke. In many cases, the parties were not aware that their cases have been disposed of. This is against natural justice and due procedures have not been followed,” a revenue divisional officer admitted. Official sources said the CCLA issued a circular after the high court in March 2021 directed that the respondents should issue public notices calling upon parties to appear before the tribunals in each district on a fixed date and time to enable them to make their submissions. “The court also directed whenever such requests hearings are received, the tribunals should pass fresh orders after granting a reasonable opportunity to the parties of being heard either in person or through their advocates,” sources said. Based on this direction, the government directed all the collectors to recall such orders on April 15 and 16 and display notices on April 19 calling upon the parties to submit their arguments. “Despite these circulars and court orders, the district collectors ignored instructions to give time to the petitioners and give fresh orders,” said S Chandrasekhar, founder-member of India Against Crime. The government also did not find a solution to over 17 lakh acres which were incorporated in part B (disputed land) on Dharani portal due to various reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revenue-tribunals-add-to-t-farmers-woes/articleshow/85339108.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Pune||Pune: Hospital visits decline as cancer patient treatment adapts to Covid restrictions||PUNE: From modifying chemotherapy protocols to designing shorter courses of radiation therapy, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought radical changes in cancer treatment across the world. Cancer experts in Pune vouch that the changes in administering the therapeutics have minimized patients’ hospital visits without compromising the care. These changes in cancer treatment, however, are not meant for all. “Because of the nature of the disease and its treatments, cancer patients are required to visit healthcare facilities more often than patients with other diseases. The pandemic has necessitated significant patient-centric changes in administering key therapies. These changes have benefited cancer patients across the spectrum without compromising the quality of care,” said senior medical oncologist Shona Nag. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are the key treatments for the uncontrolled growth and spread of cancer cells to the surrounding tissues. “Post-pandemic weekly chemotherapy protocol has been changed to two or three weekly protocols to reduce the visits and stay in the hospital. We have even shifted some carefully selected patients to oral chemotherapy as compared to standard intravenous chemotherapy method,” Nag said. Besides, wherever possible, doctors prefer advising shorter courses of radiation treatment. “For example, radiotherapy for breast cancer usually consists of 15-20 days, but there is some data to show that it can also be completed in five days. This shorter protocol is found very useful in carefully selected patients,” said radiation oncologist Sanjay M H. Pandemic has prompted doctors to provide home-based care to a sizable number of seriously ill cancer patients during the pandemic restrictions. “We administered chemotherapy to over 30 severely ill patients within the comfort of their homes by following the due precautions and ensuring standby emergency services during the second wave,” said medical oncologist Rahul Kulkarni. In addition to intravenous drips, doctors are also relying more on targeted oral and hormonal therapies wherever feasible. “This practice has been adopted worldwide. We have also encouraged teleconsultation,” Nag said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospital-visits-decline-as-cancer-patient-treatment-adapts-to-ncov-restrictions/articleshow/85335983.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Mahatma Gandhi statue a sign of communal amity, says 92-year-old||HYDERABAD: As Mahatma Gandhi spoke, 17-year-old Vunnam Venkaiah who managed to get as close as possible to him, was overawed by the man leading the freedom struggle. Gandhi was on his way in a train from the Madras (now Chennai) to Wardha in Maharashtra and made a stop over at Khammam. Aware of this in advance, Venkaiah who was already by then taking part in the freedom movement, was among those who went in 100 bullock-carts to attend the meeting. “We will settle for nothing less than complete freedom,” Mahatma Gandhi had said addressing the crowd. “Gandhi spoke in Hindi and some of those who heard him from right in front and understood, passed on the translation to people standing behind. The crowd was stirred up,” Vunnam Venkaiah told TOI. The 92-year-old Vunnam Venkaiah who lives in Nelakondapalli mandal in Khammam district recalled that it pained him when they got news of Gandhi’s assassination on January 30, 1948. Within nine days, he got a life-size statue of Gandhi and installed in Mujjugudem village, the place where Venkaiah was born. Venkaiah said that the installation of the statue was possible despite the Nizam’s police due to an atmosphere of communal amity. A situation had arisen when during the armed struggle, four people who were passing on information to the Nizam’s police were identified. “They would have met a violent end had not my family and other people intervened. We lived in complete communal harmony with Muslims in the village, even referring to them as our own relatives. So when Gandhi’s statue was installed, no information was passed on to the Nizam’s police,” Vunnam Venkaiah recalled. Venkaiah’s main activity was to educate people on the freedom movement and keep them abreast of what was happening elsewhere in the country. One of his relatives was killed in firing by the forces that tried to prevent the activity. “I will not describe the freedom struggle as something dangerous that I got involved it. Participating in the freedom movement was the ultimate gift anyone could have asked for,” Venkaiah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gandhi-statue-a-sign-of-communal-amity-says-92-yr-old/articleshow/85336495.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Patna||Bihar govt free to hold caste census: Deputy CM Renu Devi||PATNA: Deputy CM and senior BJP leader Renu Devi on Saturday said the Bihar government, like Karnataka, was free to conduct caste-based census in the state. The Karnataka government had conducted 'socio-economic and education survey’, which mentioned about the population percentage of different castes in that state, in 2015. Talking to mediapersons on the sidelines of ‘Sahyog’ programme held at the state BJP office here, the deputy CM, however, made it clear that the Centre wouldn’t accept any proposal for caste-based census in the country. “It’s a policy decision of the Centre to not conduct caste census,” she said. Renu’s statement came barely hours after the chief minister’s office received an acknowledgement from the PMO on CM Nitish Kumar’s letter written on August 4 seeking PM Narendra Modi’s appointment to discuss caste census issue. On Friday, leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had accused the PM of ignoring Nitish by not replying to his letter. Nitish had assured the leaders of the state, including Tejashwi, of meeting the PM to discuss the contentious issue when they had met him in his office on the premises of the state assembly during monsoon session of the assembly in July. On Friday, Tejashwi had also written to PM, demanding a caste-based census in 2021 for “equitable distribution of reservation and other benefits to the OBC category”. Meanwhile, former CM and HAM (S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi has urged the Bihar government to conduct a caste-based census in the state on its own. Earlier, the Maharashtra government had made a similar demand, sources in the BJP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-free-to-hold-caste-census-deputy-cm/articleshow/85335469.cms||Ramashankar

But during the day, the download speed would be only 12Mbps and at night hours, it used to go up to a maximum of about 20Mbps. When I complained, I was told that the speed varies from one area to another,” said Ambrish Chautalia, a resident of Wanowrie. Hadapsar resident Pushpa Jadhav said she experienced cross connections twice in the last week. “My colleagues were getting a false ring when they were calling me, but my cellphone was not ringing. These issues can escalate and have serious consequences when we are working from home,” she added. Whenever there is a power cut, the network is down, so the hotspot on cellphones does not work when the Wi-Fi is off and work halts. Pratham Tupe, a resident of NIBM Road, said, “Since the last month, power cuts increased due to the rain, and I have been disconnected from important online meetings with no way to reconnect till the power comes back.” Telecom operators said they were always trying to expand physical infrastructure, despite constraints. “The service in Pune has been improving after the rain in July caused a lot of damage to our physical infrastructure, such as cell towers. However, we have also faced resistance from citizens when we approach societies to mount towers,” said a spokesperson of a leading telecom operator. “Even though we want to lay more cables to expand broadband, the civic bodies have restrictions on digging roads,” another operator said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dropped-calls-slow-broadband-speed-add-to-pressure-of-working-from-home/articleshow/85336006.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

---||Hyderabad||‘Freedom to choose; to live without discrimination’||TOI’s TOP 5 Freedom to think without any influence of gender, religion, race. Independence should give us wings to fly above our limitations of poor-rich, literate-illiterate, elder-younger, near-far. Independence should make us more humane, not selfish. -- Niraj Sanghi To think above the strings of society, where every male is independent to express himself emotionally, every female is independent to choose her marital status, every girl is independent to play sports and every boy is independent to wear makeup. -- Ayana Gopal Freedom to express to the world what I need to project. A world where freedom is guaranteed to live and let live. Where every citizen holds the highest platform to express oneself independently. A society where freedom is respected in the real sense to bring eternal joy to the mind and heart for a promising future. -- Ahmed Ali My hostel days when I had the freedom to do everything and lived life on my terms. It was my second home where my friends were my family, and no one dictated how I should live my life. -- Keshav Bang Having both the lock and the key in my hands. It is my right to choose anything and everything. It is knowing my limits but also knowing when to break free. It also isn’t easy—the mental cages that come with making choices. So, independence is my claim to live my way. -- Arusha Bhatt …............................... ........................................... Being able to chase a path of my own without conforming to the standards set by previous generations. To be able to function through unprejudiced thoughts and actions. To me independence is inclusion, acceptance, acknowledgement and appreciation for what I am today so that I can live a life of fulfilment tomorrow. -- Dr Avlokita Sharma Being in a position where one is free from judgment, bias, hatred, hypocrisy etc. Where people accept each other as they are irrespective of their caste, creed, position in society, sexual orientations etc., and where relationships are based on mutual love, faith and hope. -- Samir Kumar Sahoo Being able to do what feels right without always having to think about log kya kahenge. To be able to be my true self without the constant fear of being judged. To me, independence is being free from my own insecurities, anxiety and inhibitions. -- Ishika Ranjan Freedom from poverty, illiteracy and ignorance. To me independence means knowing the limits of my intellect and emotions while respecting the boundaries of other individuals. -- Pratulay Sharma Freedom to be able to think, express and do things as per my wish, as long as they are lawful and not causing harm to any other being. -- Radhika Mehtani To spread the essence of oneness, brotherhood, love, compassion and equality among my countrymen. To uphold the rights that are bestowed upon me in our Constitution, to protect the integrity of our nation and spread the message of India's ‘unity in diversity’ across the world. -- Parimala G Tadas Being free and not controlled by someone else; not being dependent on someone. But we Indians are controlled by our society, a wife is dependent on her husband, children are not allowed to follow their passions, people get jobs on the basis of their caste but not by their talent. When this stops, only then will our country achieve real Independence. -- Raksha Vishwanath Being free to express myself. To act and work sincerely, honestly, confidently and boldly, without losing my self-esteem and at the same time to be tolerant and sensitive towards others, respecting them equally. -- Vinaya Chandra When women walk alone without any hesitation, people cast their vote without petty favours from political parties, women are shown in films with dignity and given equal importance as men with no regional groupism in sports -- that will be independence for me. -- A Syamala Being independent inside is as important to me as being able to say and do what I want on the outside. Freedom from false perceptions, prejudices and growing intolerance and the right to live and pursue a life as I please, is a bare minimum. That is true independence for me. -- Meenakshi Priya Not just being liberated from foreign rule, but also from the evils existing in society. We still see caste discrimination and harassment of women in many parts of the country. True independence is equality in society and empowerment of women in all sectors. -- Pavani Mudireddi Freedom from poverty. Freedom from hunger. Freedom from disease. Freedom from terrorism. Freedom from fear. Peace with neighbouring countries and the world. Freedom from things that divide us. Be it caste, region, language, religion. -- K L Sapra The Oxford dictionary defines Independence as the time when a country gains freedom from political control by another country. For me, it means much more than that, it is a sense of pride to bask in the richness and glory of one’s own country free from any other forces. -- Aritra Chakraborty Meaningless to me until democratic institutions like the judiciary, press and other public institutions are controlled by the government in power. It's important that we stay guarded. If we want our independence to be safe, we have to guard our institutions from losing their independence. -- N Nagarajan Self rule, sovereignty. But if people do not have access to roti, kapda and makaan and are not self-sufficient in their life, that is not total independence. Equal social, economic, cultural and political justice among all sections of society is prime. Independence means a worry-less life. -- Dr V Taramathi Freedom to express and use that freedom to improve, learn and experience everyday living. Freedom that satisfies your desire to become a stronger person and yet does not separate us from our values. For me independence means living life to the fullest. It is about standing bold and strong. Independence is the power of imagination. -- I Akhila Jyothi Freedom of making choices and being responsible for the consequences. It means to able to do things on my own and organise my life without the influence of others. -- Khulood Md Zaheer It will be the day when the last citizen of India gets both the doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. That will signal the end of untold miseries, trials and tribulations that we have undergone and the dawn of a prosperous, happy and healthy India. -- Murlidar K Freedom to improve, learn and become a stronger person. Freedom of making my own choices and taking responsibility and facing the consequences of those choices. Independence for me doesn't mean stifling others’ voices and rights or seizing power and position. It is about using the powers to bring meaningful changes in the lives of deprived classes. -- Mohammed Abdul Gaffar Living in our country without restraints, free from discrimination, absolute security; particularly for women and children, equal opportunities for all in every field and feeling the joy of freedom. -- Dr N J Rajaram Wanting to do things for oneself and make one’s own decisions without help or influence from other people. -- M Nagaraju Not just about liberty, equality or democracy but respecting what our forefathers fought for – the nation’s heritage and culture. Independence is to live, love and strive hard to keep the spirits high in any situation. -- Deepesh Surana Freedom to express myself, make choices and take decisions in a self-sufficient way. While being independent allows me these rights, this also comes with a sense of responsibility and answerability. For independence and responsibility are truly two sides of the same coin. -- Prisha Gupta Freedom to learn whatever I wish. Freedom to earn as per my skill and capacity. -- C Satyanarayana Making my own choices, taking responsibility for those choices. Freedom to the people, state and country. Freedom to be who you are and to do what you want to. -- Chakshitha Respect for the women fraternity in every walk of life. They play a major role as daughter, wife, sportsperson and even Army personnel. -- S Mubbesher Mehdi Taking responsibility for your life and choices you make. Not being reliant on others for your livelihood, working as hard as you can in order to achieve the lifestyle you want. Realize that you don't have to do it all on your own but take comfort in knowing that you can. -- Nishtha Raghuwanshi Freedom for people to express themselves and use that freedom to improve, learn, and experience everyday living with peace and prosperity. For me independence is pursuing a peaceful life while being responsible for what we do. -- Syed Abdul Wasay Being able to do what my heart desires without giving a hoot to societal shackles, and yes, to ensure to be a responsible citizen at the same time. -- Ruchika Gupta To be independent to do what I should for my nation, respecting its ethnicity, rich culture and background. Independence for me is to give back to society with my wisdom that I earned from its core values and history. Independence is being self-reliant and self-sufficient in all ways as a daughter, sister, wife and above all a mother. -- Sapna Jain Independence means freedom. Freedom to live, freedom to grow. This will be possible only if there is barrier-free access to resources, opportunities for all people irrespective of gender, caste and creed. Equality should replace inequality in all spheres of life. Depriving one's right to live in any manner is not Independence. -- Dr N Ashok Kumar Having freedom and the ability to take steps to better our future. Independence is both freedom and responsibility. Now we are independent because the great martyrs sacrificed their lives for our India. I feel proud to be an Indian. -- Sindhuja M Indians are used to our parents taking care of us for a lifetime come what may, but once we get over it and learn to make our decisions, remembering we are the ones who are supposed to live by the choices for the rest of our lives; that is my independence. -- Pranathi Varma To be resourceful- to be able to adapt to any situation and satisfy your needs with what you have. It is to take responsibility for your actions and be aware of the consequences, be brave and take the risk of trusting only yourself. -- Eshaan Sharma Will be the day when we need no social welfare schemes, no freebies. More welfare schemes mean we have achieved sustainable development goals; we are still lagging in development. Social justice and social engineering depict independence for me. -- Rekha Rao Freedom of choice where every Indian enjoys his/her Constitutional rights. Where everybody is free irrespective of their caste, religion, sex, status. I dream of an independent India where every child has 100 % freedom to live. -- Nazia Athar To be fearless and face challenges. To believe in ourselves. -- Vineetha Govind The way of life where every person can think, speak and execute their thoughts in an independent way. Every thought we think and execute today is the future of our country. Independence is something where every person can satisfyingly live their life. -- Srimurthy Revanthika Being free of control from anything, unmoved by any emotions like sorrow, joy etc as well free from the control of things like food, shelter, money etc. -- Priyanka Samanta Freedom to not just choose from the options available but also pave our own way. People are no more gullible as they voice their opinions and choose their lifestyle. This freedom to scrutinize and obviate negativity is ‘Independence’. -- Aseema Misra To be heard and understood. Freedom to live by one’s conscience rather than on others’ concepts. -- Anand Menon ......................................

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Comparative religion study’ prepared Justice Rohinton Nariman for a life in the courts||MUMBAI: At the Tata Agiary in Bandra, a pre-teen was ordained a priest in the late 1960s. The child priest on Thursday retired as Justice Rohinton Nariman, from the nation’s highest court. On Friday, speaking at an e-farewell organized by Bombay Bar Association, Justice Nariman said, “My stint as a priest, as a 12-year-old moulded my life to a very considerable amount.” It helped discipline him and “chiselled” his memory, for his later stints as a lawyer and judge. He recalled a tradition set by legal giants like Dinshaw Mulla, Jamshedjee Kanga, H M Seervai and Justice Dinshaw Madon. “Tradition stands for many things, but first and foremost, it stands for discipline,” said Justice Nariman. He added, “As a child used to going to school only a km away, my universe was a small one. Suddenly, you are put into a fire temple for 28 days. I was used to air-conditioned comfort and for the first time had to sleep on a leather bed on the floor, with a little fan on the ceiling. In the month of May. You can imagine what a massive comedown for a little child.” “However, it proved to be one of the greatest experiences of my life. It taught me so many things. To be by myself and without other children. I was with people five times my age.” But though they were “very grandfatherly and very nice” to him, becoming a priest was no child’s play. It was “rigorous.” He had to stay in “seclusion” for ten days, then bathe, pray five times a day, at 12.40 am as well. But at the end, standing before a huge audience including his pious great grandmother “who came all way from Colaba,” he stood before the fire with his priest and “belted out for 3 hours the prayers from the Avastha from memory.” Ideally there are 72 chapters. “I did some 50-odd,” said the just-retired judge, 13 more than legal giant Jamshedjee Kanga. “So priesthood gave me discipline and chiselling of memory,” said the judge who struck down as unconstitutional Section 66A of the IT Act which had empowered penal action against someone for saying, among other things, something ‘annoying’. At the farewell, counsel Darius Khambata, Navroze Seervai and Janak Dwarkadas and BBA chief Nitin Thakkar recalled Justice Nariman’s prodigious memory, his encyclopedic knowledge of comparative religion, world history, law and western classical music, his values that stood him in good stead. “Comparative religion study rudders you somehow, gives meaning to life. It did a great deal for me as a lawyer and as a judge,” said Justice Nariman. And his message to young lawyers: “The more diverse your experience in life, the more it will help you in law.” “Law itself is greatly interconnected, you realise it at the Supreme Court more than anywhere else,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-comparative-religion-study-prepared-justice-nariman-for-a-life-in-the-courts/articleshow/85339119.cms||Swati Deshpande

There was something important to be achieved and we knew we would have to go to any extent to realise it,” Panthulu told STOI. After India got independence on August 15, 1947, the erstwhile Hyderabad state had not acceded to the Indian union by the Nizam.  “We got instructions from PV Narasimha Rao, who was a leader of All Hyderabad Students Union, that independence should be celebrated despite the restrictions. As students, we took out processions openly. Until that time, we only engaged in underground activity,” Panthulu recalled. Coming out of jail, there was more resolve . Panthulu got trained in using arms in then Madras. He became part of a 30-member dalam that would not only resist the Nizam’s forces and the Razakars but also take the fight into their camp. Panthulu is particular that the supreme sacrifice that Rama Kotaiah, Subba Rao and Narsi Reddy made in a village in Samsthan Narayanpur area in Rachakonda hills should never be forgotten. When the Indian union forces were heading to Hyderabad, Panthulu and his associates were assigned the responsibility of being part of the group to trek before the path that the army that proceeding to Hyderabad. The Nizam acceded and Hyderabad was liberated on September 17, 1948, merging it with Indian Union.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/knew-no-fear-panthulu-recalls-valour-of-freedom-struggle/articleshow/85336550.cms||---

---||Delhi||Let us come back, Afghan students make a plea to JNU||NEW DELHI: The conflict in Afghanistan has left many students from that country studying in Delhi in need of assistance.  In Jawaharlal Nehru University, such students have requested to be allowed into the closed campus, a plea that has also been taken up with the university administration by the students’ union. In a circular issued on Saturday, JNU registrar Ravikesh said, “Some Afghan students of JNU have requested the administration to facilitate their return to the campus. As the university has remained closed as directed by DDMA, government of NCT of Delhi, this matter is being looked into.” Women students who had taken admission in 2020 and were taking online classes want to come to Delhi to continue their studies. They want documents for their visas to be processed. A sociology master’s student in Kabul completed the first semester online after taking admission in 2020. She has mailed her centre dean but hasn’t received a response. “The situation in Kabul is very scary,” she told TOI. “My family wants me to go to Delhi since it’s not safe here anymore, especially for girls.” She hoped JNU would send her the required documents for her visa. Online classes aren’t possible now. “The Taliban cut the power lines and deprived us of electricity. It’s the same with the internet,” she said. JNUSU has also taken up the issue. In a letter to VC M Jagadesh Kumar, the union said, “While other universities in Delhi have granted students in similar circumstances the requisite permission for student visa, JNU has not given any necessary support to its students from Afghanistan. We request you to grant to the students concerned the necessary documents and permissions for their visas along with hostel accommodation on an urgent basis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/let-us-come-back-afghan-students-make-a-plea-to-jnu/articleshow/85336014.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi civic bodies have few devices to monitor 40 noise hotspots||NEW DELHI: While 40 noise pollution hotspots have been identified in the jurisdiction of three civic bodies in the city, there is an acute shortage of sound level meter (SLM) devices that are used to measure noise levels. There are 12 hotspots in North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s areas, but the civic body does not have even a single SLM device. The south corporation, which has 22 hotspots, has just one device. The east corporation is in a relatively better situation with five SLM devices, a report submitted to the National Green Tribunal states. Meanwhile, DJ sets, generators and construction activities are some of the most common complaints regarding noise pollution against which action has been taken by agencies concerned this year. According to the report, 1,442 cases of violations were noticed between January and March, out of which 1,047 were related to DJ sets and loudspeakers, 99 to generator sets, 273 to construction equipment and nine to firecrackers, among others. Traffic police issued maximum challans for modified exhausts/silencers. In the three months, the cops issued 2,883 noise-related challans, out of which maximum 2,070 were for modified exhausts. Total 560 challans were issued for use of pressure horns and 29 for honking in silent zones. A study conducted by the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology-Delhi, which was carried out recently, had found that honking of vehicles is a bigger noise polluter than firecrackers. Noise pollution was measured on eight major roads and 12 intersections of the city, including Anand Vihar, IP Extension, Govindpuri Metro Station, Maharani Bagh, Dwarka Sector 10 and Connaught Place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-have-few-devices-to-monitor-40-noise-hotspots/articleshow/85336043.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Deshbhakti classes to try to make children good citizens||NEW DELHI: Open discussions in class with teachers, group classroom activities, engagement with family, self-reflection and community engagement comprise the Deshbhakti curriculum in Delhi government schools. The curriculum was launched on the eve of Independence Day on Saturday by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Following the submission of the copy of the curriculum by State Council for Educational Research and Training, Kejriwal said, “In 70 years, every possible subject was taught in schools except for deshbhakti.” The curriculum aims to develop self-confidence, awareness, respect for constitutional values, problem-solving mindset among students while empowering them to face challenges and bring about changes that will benefit the country. The three themes of the Deshbhakti curriculum include knowledge, values and behaviour. Students will be imparted knowledge about constitutional values, plurality and diversity, freedom struggle, achievements and social problems. They will be taught about values like honesty, integrity, humility, empathy, love and respect for country, compassion, sacrifice. They will be behaviourally influenced to stand up against injustice and adopt scientific reasoning and civic responsibility. Eight learning outcomes are sought to be achieved, namely self-awareness, self-confidence, problem solving abilities, practising of constitutional values, pluralism and diversity, environmental sustainability, ethical social behaviour, collaboration and social and civic responsibility. The evaluation will be based on self-assessment, peer assessment and assessment by a teacher. “The Deshbhakti curriculum will help realise the dreams of our freedom fighters and the celebration of Independence Day will cease to be symbolic in schools, instead holding a substantive meaning,” said Kejriwal on Saturday. “Our government is fully committed to celebrating the spirit of independence each day.” Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia added, “When we started working on the curriculum two years ago, we did not know what form it would take and how it would be formulated. It proved to be a dynamic and constantly evolving process. We have learnt a lot during the pilot of the curriculum and will continue to learn more with time.” Sisodia added that the assessment would be taken care of appropriately. “While we will keep anecdotal experiences in mind, we have to objectively assess if patriotic feelings are actually being instilled in the minds of our children,” the deputy CM explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/deshbhakti-classes-to-try-to-make-kids-good-citizens/articleshow/85336084.cms||---

The institute has been allotted 28 acres of land near Kamrej against its minimum requirement of 50-acre plot to develop basic facilities as per Union human resource development ministry (MHRD) directives. According to the scheme issued by the government for IIIT, minimum 50-acre land is required to develop classrooms, laboratories, hostel, quarter, sports activity, auditorium and research labs. The scheme further states that 100-acre land can be utilised to develop facilities for training, advance academic research, commercial research, guest house, demonstration theatre, incubators and recreation. It provides an alternative to arrange some facilities at other locations keeping the minimum requirement fixed at 50 acres. In the given land parcel, the institute can develop only a campus for academic work. Meanwhile, it has become a point of discussion among students who are studying from home but raising concerns through email and phone calls. A group of students raised the issue to the education ministry and Surat district authorities. “The institute has accepted much less than the minimum required land. This will compromise the future growth prospects of the institute and students,” said a student on condition of anonymity. IIIT is operating from the campus of Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) at present. The institute has only nine regular faculty and an equal number of SVNIT teachers are conducting classes. Its campus placement is handled by SVNIT at present. Due to global pandemic the institute is working in online mode. IIIT was earlier suggested land near Khajod and another on Dumas Road but due to some reason the land was not finalised. “We got 28 acre land and our attempts are continuing to get more. We are trying to get adjoining government land but it is not yet finalised,” said J S Bhat, director, IIIT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/iiit-given-half-the-land-it-requires-to-develop-standard-campus/articleshow/85336062.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Hyderabad||NHRC calls for report on student suicides in Telangana & Andhra Pradesh||HYDERABAD: Expressing serious concern over suicides of Intermediate students in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has sought detailed reports from both the governments on the causes that led to the suicides and also remedial measures taken to prevent them. A NHRC bench warned of penal action on two chief secretaries under sections of the Protection of Human Rights Act if they fail to respond. The NHRC bench was hearing a petition filed by K Sravan Kumar, an advocate from Telangana, currently practising in the Supreme Court. While 426 students took their lives in Telangana in 2019, 383 student suicides were reported from the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. Figures for 2020 were not available owing to the lockdown, said the bench. The NHRC, in its order (dated August 13, 2021), said: “In spite of several measures taken by the authorities, the suicides of students are continuing unabated. Maybe, a change in strategy is the need of the hour.” “Consult experts in the fields of education and psychology to identify the weak links and chalk out an effective strategy to address the issue.” The commission asked both the states to submit a preliminary report within six weeks. “The phenomenon of suicide by students is not confined to AP or Telangana alone, but is rampant in other states also. There is a need to brainstorm in order to employ scientific and professional methods in the education system as a whole in a holistic manner to nurture the young lives to full bloom,” it said. Needless to say, in the rat race for higher qualifications, higher pay packages and higher standards of living, students, parents, teaching community and society as a whole were ignoring the primacy and value of human life, the NHRC said. According to Sravan Kumar, a majority of the students studying in private colleges face extreme pressure. Untrained teaching staff, lack of counselling and hostels without basic facilities compound their problems, he said. While AP took steps like implementing recommendations of professors Neerada Reddy and D Chakrapani by setting up monitoring committees, ethics committees, etc., in every college and by penalising the colleges where suicides were reported, Telangana formed district-wise committees and conducted surprise checks at colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nhrc-calls-for-report-on-student-suicides-in-t-ap/articleshow/85339128.cms||---

He said that feedback on this model stretch would be taken from people and the project replicated on 540km of road length by Public Works Department (PWD). The department manages 1,280 km of arterial roads in Delhi, out of which 540km-long roads that are wider than 100ft will be redesigned and beautified. The project to beautify arterial roads of Delhi has seen several hurdles and delays. Under pilot project, beautification work on the stretch between Chirag Dilli and Sheikh Sarai has been completed. The stretch has been redeveloped on the lines of the design pattern of the T-3 approach road. Besides other amenities and features like bicycle lanes, footpaths, plantations, selfie points, parklets and artwork, statues of freedom fighters and artifacts of historical heritage have also been placed on the roadside. Kejriwal said that Delhi’s roads were being redesigned and made better. He asked the people to give their feedback on the project. PWD minister Satyendar Jain, MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj and senior officials were present during the inspection. The CM said, “The 800m-long stretch is part of the pilot stage of the project. We have thoroughly inspected the entire pilot stretch and will discuss its shortcomings and strengths. We will work on the next projects accordingly and begin with phase one of redesigning 540 kilometres of roads.” He stated that the road standards would be increased to provide the highest quality of public spaces to Delhiites. People should also come forward with their suggestions, he urged. “Statues of freedom fighters Bhagat Singh and Rani Laxmi Bai have been installed to celebrate India's freedom struggle. Two fountains, artwork on foot overbridge, ten sandstone benches, a Buddha statue, information boards and sandstone artwork, among others, have been incorporated in the pilot project. A cycle track and footpath have also been developed on one side of the road. Sufficient space for planters has been provided,” said a PWD official. The official stated that 11,000 litres irrigation tanks had been developed along the stretch to maintain the three-tier greenery and seating arrangements provided at regular intervals to make it pedestrian-friendly. PWD also plans to develop drinking water points and public toilets along the model stretch and areas have been earmarked for kiosks and street vendor zones. Chief minister Kejriwal had visited another sample stretch at Nehru Nagar on April 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-roads-to-be-beautified-redesigned-cm/articleshow/85336037.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Unpaid since last year, engineering teachers in Nagpur send SOS to governments||NAGPUR: Even after AICTE instructions to colleges not to withhold salaries of teaching and non-teaching employees, a majority of them in the district have not been paid since last year under the pretext of Covid-19 pandemic. A leading educational group in city, which is closely related to Nagpur University vice-chancellor, has allegedly failed to release salaries of its entire staff for nine months, except paying them meagrely in September last year. The employees have now lodged complaints with central and state government authorities. In June, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) chairman Anil Sahasrabuddhe had dashed a letter to one of colleges on Katol Road asking it to settle the dispute with its staff and release the salaries at the earliest. His directive came after the college staff lodged a complaint with the apex body as their management had failed to release their full wages for months throughout last year citing the pandemic. According to the aggrieved staff, they are facing several problems due to non-payment of salaries and all their savings have now been exhausted. Many of them have availed bank loans for purchasing flats, properties, and vehicles, and now unable to pay the instalments. “We don’t have money even to pay school and college fees for our children. It has become very difficult to run the home as our borrowings too are coming to end. Schools have stopped online classes for our children due to non-payment of fees. The management should give a thought to all these issues,” they said, adding their personal lives are totally disturbed. Many of the employees have already left their jobs and settled for lesser salaries elsewhere, as it was not possible to run the homes without money. The college management passed the entire buck to Maharashtra government for its failure to release scholarship dues for last one year. “We are also trying to take loans to pay the wages, but even banks are reluctant. The banks expressed apprehension as to how we would pay the instalments, if the government is not providing funds,” one of the college directors told TOI. Secretary of the same college said despite facing difficulties, the college owners have paid staff salaries from their pockets and have paid a substantial amount till date. “We had also tried to explore the possibility of bringing an outside investor to settle the salary issues, but that didn’t materialize. We’re trying our best to keep staff motivated in these hard times. We are hopeful that the government would seriously consider our issues and release our legitimate dues towards scholarship,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unpaid-since-last-year-engg-teachers-send-sos-to-govts/articleshow/85336053.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Though labourers were inside the building when the incident took place, but they came out unharmed. Importantly, no injuries were reported despite the fact that the area is thickly populated and the road sees heavy traffic. The residents of area complained that they had asked the owner to dismantle the building taking all safety measures, but he ignored their suggestions. Their complaints at MC office also went unheard. After the collapse, police reached the spot and cordoned off the area. The vehicular movement has been stopped on the road. The debris has covered a part of the road as well. The electricity in area was also interrupted. One of the residents Kunal Sachdeva said the building owner had started the dismantling work on his own, but he did not take any safety measures. He said he even asked him to at least cover the building with sheets, but he did not listen. He said they had also raised the matter with MC a month back, but nobody paid attention. On Thursday too, an unsafe building had collapsed, leaving at least 10 injured. The city has around 132 such buildings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/part-of-another-unsafe-building-collapses-no-injuries/articleshow/85338025.cms||---

IPSCDL wants the consultant to survey an area of 91.7 sqkm, which includes Panaji and adjoining areas as part of the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) of the Union ministry of Urban Development. Smart City Mission officials said that IPSCDL will obtain the draft base map of the city from the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) which will then be given to the consultant for integrating data about demography, infrastructure, amenities, vacant and government lands, socio-economic facilities and other inputs. As part of the AMRUT Mission reforms, urban local bodies have to prepare urban planning and city level plans, including preparation of masterplan using GIS. Masterplans provide the basis for infrastructure provision, effective land use management and utilisation, spatial growth management, enable project planning, and urban management. The draft masterplan needs to conform with the outline development plan and regional plan prepared by the town and country planning departmemt. “The horizon year for the draft masterplan will be 2041,” said an official. According to data available, ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) has released the first instalment of Rs 23.7 lakh to IPSCDL under the sub-scheme on formulation of the local area plan (LAP) and town planning scheme (TPS) under AMRUT. The state high-powered steering committee (SHPSC) has approved the reparation of the masterplan using GIS in the state annual action plan (SAAP) in January 2016. In 2017, IPSCDL announced that it had begun preparing a GIS-based masterplan by integrating geo-spatial data with a door-to-door survey. The aim, said then IPSCDL managing director Swayandipta Pal Chaudhuri, was to improve tax collection and prevent revenue leakages. The Corporation of Panaji City (CCP) had prepared a city development plan (CDP) in 2007 and in 2013, CRISIL risk infrastructure revised the CDP with the funding obtained through the JNNURM scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/imagine-panaji-to-appoint-consultant-to-prepare-gis-masterplan/articleshow/85339137.cms||---

Three years later, his fingerprint in Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) database helped him re-unite with his parents. Ironically, the teenager failed to recognise his parents as he apparently has memory loss. Madhapur police said a few days ago UIDAI authorities informed them that a teenager, Surya, applied for Aadhaar card, but their fingerprint records show that an Aadhaar was already issued to him a long time ago. Based on the Aadhaar number and other details shared by UIDAI authorities, Madhapur police contacted Bhadradri-Kothagudem police, who found that his name is Sandeep and not Surya. “Kothagudem police informed us that there was a missing case about Sandeep, which was registered in 2018 by his parents. Since the boy was not traced, the district police closed the case. We contacted the boy’s father and called him to the city,” Madhapur SI K Rajendra told TOI. His father, Karunakar, immediately came to the Madhapur police station and shared Sandeep’s Aadhaar card, their ration card and other details, including the boy’s photo. When Sandeep went missing, he was 16 years old and studying class 9. “How Sandeep reached Hyderabad is a mystery. Three years ago, one day he walked up to one Manjula at Sheikpet and sought her help to find him a job, claiming that he is an orphan. Manjula gave him shelter. He used to do odd jobs. Recently, the teenager decided to relocate himself to Chennai in the hope of finding a better job. He was told by someone that Aadhaar will be sought to get any job. It was for this purpose he applied for Aadhaar,” police said. For Karunakar, the joy of reuniting with his son Sandeep was short-lived as the teenager claimed he did not recognise his father. Karunakar could not take this shock and broke down. He even recalled their past memories, but the teenager failed to recall anything. “The boy forgot his past, reportedly after suffering an injury. Sandeep, when asked about Bhadradri-Kothagudem, claims he remembers visiting the temple several times, but he cannot recognise Karunakar. However, the boy was handed over to his father, who took Sandeep to Kothagudem,’‘ police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/aadhaar-reunites-teen-with-family-after-3-yrs/articleshow/85339129.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Many flooding Nagpur doctors with weird queries about Covid vaccines||NAGPUR: City doctors are facing an uphill task trying to clear bizarre doubts of the masses regarding vaccination. Experts feel the existing vaccine hesitancy stems from misconceptions, and may even trigger the anticipated third wave. The queries range from vague ones like vaccine-induced impotency and fertility concerns to serious ones like requesting doctors for a fake certificate to skip taking the jab. This has become a tricky challenge for doctors. The hassled doctors, apart from trying to remove the misconceptions, are also alerting the government for a more vigorous campaign to nullify the vaccine hesitancy before the anticipated third wave. Dr BK Murali, owner of Hope hospital on Kamptee Road and Ayushman Hospital at Ramdaspeth, said he was left stunned when a couple of citizens had approached him for a fake vaccination certificate. “Call it a fear or the vax hesitancy at its best, I had got a terrible request to give someone a fake vaccination certificate as the person was unwilling to go for the jab. This is a dangerous trend. If rampant, we must all oppose and resist them to ensure they don’t turn superspreaders in the coming days,” said Dr Murali. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of Vidarbha Hospitals Association and director of Orange City Hospital, said it is distressing to note the public hesitancy. “The number of vaccinated vis-à-vis the number of vaccines available in city is disproportionate. Lot of vials are lying unused in private hospitals and may even expire. It is disheartening to hear about some persons approaching centres to get vaccination certificate without getting vaccine,” he said. “There are certain NRIs who got their first dose abroad and now seek the second dose which is a difficult process in CoWin software,” he said. Dr Marar also said there are cases where a person vehemently states that he took the first dose and shows a certificate but is confused about the registered mobile number. “If there was any doubt about efficacy, side effects or complications of vaccine; no frontline health care workers including doctors, medical students, bureaucrats, healthcare and police personnel would have ever taken it,” he said. Psychiatrist Dr Rajesh Rathi, also a sexual health expert, said he is flooded with calls regarding vaccine-induced impotency, sexual performance and infertility. Dr Jay Deshmukh too said people have shown the tendency to blame on vaccination any uneasiness they would develop or health complications. “Whether headache or infertility, people blame vaccination for everything and keep relating their illness to it,” he said. NMC’s medical health officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said several efforts are being taken to motivate masses to get vaccinated. “We are planning to provide vehicle to bring and drop back beneficiaries at their homes once the vaccine doses are in surplus. Counselling would also be done,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/confused-masses-flooding-docs-with-weird-queries-regarding-vaccines/articleshow/85336091.cms||Soumitra Bose

The civic body conducted random checking in Karol Bagh and City Paharganj zones on Saturday and found these parking spaces running illegally. “The north corporation’s remunerative projects cell and zonal authorities conducted a special drive and found that many illegal parking lots were being operated by private persons on roads, public land, etc., and they were illegally charging parking fee from public without any permission from the civic body,” stated a press release issued by the department. Deputy commissioner Rajesh Goel confirmed that the civic body had lodged 18 police complaints at various police stations against parking mafia on Saturday. “We’ve asked the authorities to register FIR and take action against the parking mafia as per law. We have also asked them to keep strict vigil to prevent such illegal business. Total 13 complaints have been lodged regarding illegal parking in City-Sadar Paharganj Zone and five in Karol Bagh Zone. The complaints have been lodged at Kashmere Gate, Lahori Gate, Kotwali, IP Estate, Moti Nagar, Sadar Paharganj, Kirti Nagar and Naraina police stations,” he said. Goel said the drive, which is under way for the past three weeks, would intensify further to ensure smooth movement of traffic and pedestrians. “We have taken various initiatives during the last one month to improve parking management in our areas, to enhance the revenue from parking sites and to prevent illegal charging of parking fees,” he stated. The north corporation runs 133 parking sites, of which 66 are being operated and managed by authorised contractors and 67 have been declared as free parking sites till the contractors are selected to run these parking sites through e-tender process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-civic-body-lodges-18-complaints-against-illegal-parking-sites/articleshow/85336105.cms||---
---||Delhi||After failed revamp plans, Novelty plot goes on lease; North Delhi Municipal Corporation faces flak||NEW DELHI: Novelty Cinema, one of the oldest cinemas in the Walled City having opened in the 1930s, is passing into history.  North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to lease it out to a private concessionaire for a period of 99 years. Last year, the complex was to have been demolished to make way for a parking lot-cum-commercial complex but the Covid pandemic stalled any progress. After making several plans to revamp the property, including reviving the cinema hall, developing a spice market, commercial complex and a parking lot, the civic body decided to take a new turn. On Wednesday, the north corporation, in its standing committee meeting, okayed a proposal to lease 1,157 square metres of land for 99 years for Rs 34.75 crore. However, the municipal corporation is facing flak for this decision, with both Aam Aadmi Party and Congress claiming that the almost century-old property in a prime location could have been revamped and utilised for a better purpose. AAP MLA and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj alleged that the BJP-ruled north corporation has undersold something worth Rs 150 crore for a mere Rs 34 crore. “The piece of land is completely commercial in nature. There is a parking lot and a wide road next to it, something that's rarely available in the Old Delhi area. The market value of the plot should have been Rs125-150 crore and if the municipal corporation had retained the land and built a shopping complex on it, it could have raked in around Rs 300 crore,” alleged Bharadwaj. Standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain refuted these allegations. “The total land comprising Novelty Cinema measures 1,157 square metres. The circle rate for the area is Rs 70,080 per sq metre. Applying the commercial rates for the locality, the cost of the Novelty Cinema plots comes around Rs 24 crore,” Jain maintained. “But the civic body has leased it for Rs 34.75 crore after e-tendering. Other political parties are not aware of the facts and making false allegations.” Congress councillor Mukesh Goel stated that the transaction should be investigated by an independent agency to identify the people involved in selling this commercial property at such a low price. “Even a 100 sq m house in Gali Telian, located just behind this commercial property, attracts a price of Rs 12-15 crore,” Goel said. “In Chandni Chowk, the rate for a small shop is Rs 2-5 crore.” Other councillors added that had the auctioning of Novelty Cinema been done according to the DDA procedure, the property could have brought in a higher amount. Novelty took on its familiar name when it was given on perpetual lease to the Novelty group. However, the lease was not renewed in 2006. “Later, the matter went to court and we regained possession of the plot,” said former mayor Jai Prakash. At one point, old Delhi had 12 cinema halls, but now the majority of them are closed. For many city residents, Novelty was where they had their first experience of a movie on the big screen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-failed-revamp-plans-novelty-plot-goes-on-lease-corpn-faces-flak/articleshow/85336098.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Delhi: Focus on slip road, foot overbridge to free Peeragarhi Chowk||NEW DELHI: A proposal to develop an underpass at the heavily congested Peeragarhi Chowk—a major intersection of Rohtak Road and Outer Ring Road—has not been found feasible. Other options like slip roads will now be utilised to decongest this busy intersection, said officials of Public Works Department (PWD). The intersection has a Metro line, a flyover and surface-level connecting arterial roads. An underpass on the lines of Ashram Chowk or Punjabi Bagh was earlier proposed to be developed at the intersection.  “Feasibility of an underpass at Peeragarhi Chowk for traffic going towards Mundka was discussed in UTTIPEC. Since the underpass was not found feasible at the location, slip roads and foot overbridge have now been planned to ease the traffic flow. These work may take up to 2 years to be completed,” a senior PWD official said. The slip road will be developed from Mangolpuri to Punjabi Bagh, which will be a part of the overall corridor development project.  “DUAC has given its approval and a preliminary estimate has been submitted for this project,” the official stated. The existing slip road for traffic moving from Meera Bagh to Peeragarhi Metro Station will be widened, the proposal states. Other decongestion measures include shortening of two traffic islands on the way from Mangolpuri to Meera Bagh by 2-3 feet.  “Shortening of these islands will provide adequate space for traffic going straight towards Meera Bagh,” an official explained. The foot overbridge has been proposed near the Peeragarhi flyover. Peeragarhi Chowk remains a traffic nightmare due to several reasons, including the presence of many commercial outlets like banquet halls, encroachments and heavy inter-state traffic flow.  A Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee had identified it as one of the new traffic hotspots, which is adding to air pollution in Delhi-NCR and where urgent intervention is required.  Other traffic hotspots included the T-junction near Manesar in Gurugram, Peeragarhi Junction, Tughlaqabad Container Depot and Gandhi Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/focus-on-slip-road-fob-to-free-peeragarhi-chowk/articleshow/85336114.cms||Paras Singh

Recognized as Himachali Pahari Cattle by NBAGR, the bovine breed constitutes about 7.59 lakh (41.52%) of the total cattle population in the state and contributes about 7.46% to the state’s total milk production and 10.73% of milk obtained from cattle. Due to changes in the socio-economic environment, this cattle breed is under threat of extinction. Himachal Pradesh animal husbandry minister Virender Kanwar said the project will be launched at Cattle Breeding Farm, Bagthan, in Sirmaur district over an area of 10.9 hectares to develop a nuclear herd of the breed, improve it and conserve it in its original tract with the original characteristics of its cows and bulls. He said area under grazing/pasture was six hectares to provide natural living environment and grazing facility He said the state government will set up three ultra-modern sheds at an initial cost of Rs 75 lakh to rear 50 disease-free Pahari cows (30 adult and 20 heifers) at Bagthan. The cattle will be purchased from farmers at an estimated cost of around Rs 17 lakh. He said compared to others, the hilly breed gives less milk, but the quality of milk is rich. Its milk production per lactation cycle is in the range of 540 kg. They mostly find their own feed by grazing and are resistant to common diseases, making them suitable for low-budget dairies. They can also adapt to harsh climate He said bullocks of this breed are most suitable for farming in hilly terrains. Also, because of its smaller size, its feed requirement is less, making it more economical for hilly areas farmers who have small farm holdings. He said that department will spend Rs 2,520 every month on each cow and Rs 1,572 on each heifer to meet feeding requirements. The department will purchase three bulls for natural service under the project, he said, adding that the procurement of animals will be done from farmers whose animals have a record of lactation yield. Farm to cost Rs 1 crore Estimated to cost Rs 1 crore, the farm will have sheds for rearing cows, bulls, calves, and heifers to provide natural living environment and grazing facility. It will be equipped with scientific waste management and rainwater-harvesting facilities as well as a fodder farm||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/hp-govt-to-launch-project-to-conserve-pahari-cow/articleshow/85338079.cms||Anand Bodh

The phased-out buses ran on city roads for 15 years with the last run in June this year. Now, the brand new CNG buses, whose ‘wet lease’ contract was signed last December, will provide similar rides and the entire fleet of 400 buses will be inducted gradually by October. The first lot of 25 buses will arrive in a few days. Many commuters welcomed the re-entry of non-AC buses as BEST has been inducting only AC Mini and Midi buses in the past few months. “We enjoy the rides in these non-AC, airy buses as we are used to travelling in these for years,” said Suresh Mohan, a senior citizen who prefers the non-AC to the AC bus, especially during Covid pandemic.  Another passenger Vaishali Satam said that MUTP buses were popular among commuters for the wide windscreen and comfort in travel. “Due to air suspension on the rear axle, passengers on the last seats could sit comfortably without any jerk. We hope the new non-AC buses have similar features,” she said. The new CNG buses will have good suspension and comfortable seats, assured a BEST official. A unique feature of these buses, taken on lease, is that the conductors will also be provided by the private contractors. Till now, the ‘wet lease’ model involved private agencies supplying buses along with drivers, paying for fuel, maintenance etc. Now, they will also give 400 conductors, who will work for BEST and collect faress. Last year, BEST panel member Ravi Raja had raised an objection, saying how can we trust these conductors who will be “outsiders” and not employed with BEST. On Friday, BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra said there will be supervision of these conductors. “For every passenger caught without a ticket, we will impose fines on the contractor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/400-new-buses-as-best-phases-out-664/articleshow/85339134.cms||Somit Sen

The accused Bhola Patel had changed his identity and was living as a monk Bhaveshgiri to avoid getting caught. He spent most of his time in temples and ashrams away from his family members, but used to come to Surat to meet them once a year, said C R Desai, police sub inspector, crime branch. “Patel had come home (in Surat) a couple of days back and we were informed by a local person who knew him. After 26 years, his looks had changed, but locals helped us identify and confirm that he was the same person the cops were looking for,” said Desai. According to case details, Patel had disappeared with a television set, a video cassette player (VCP) and three video cassettes worth a total Rs 12,000. Patel used to work for Manji Patel in August 1995, who ran a video rental service. When Patel was asked to deliver the electronics to a client on rent, he disappeared with the valuables. He sold the goods and went back to his native village Virdi. When the cops reached his village, Patel escaped from the village. This happened multiple times. As the cops continued to search for Patel in Virdi for 3-4 years, he decided to stay away from his family and started living as a monk. He started wearing saffron clothes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/thief-who-pretended-to-be-monk-arrested-after-26-years/articleshow/85336152.cms||---

Unaided Schools Forum (USF), which represents non-state board affiliated schools, says the GRs are unconstitutional and illegal. Subhas Chandra Kedia, honorary secretary of USF, said, “This three-year NOC must not be confused with the one granted under RTE Act. That is for recognition of a school. Also, every school already takes NOC before applying for affiliation to CBSE/ICSE etc as mentioned in bylaws.” Contrary to popular perception, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) grants affiliation to Std IX-XII. New schools apply when their batch reaches Std VIII so that the affiliation paperwork gets completed by the time the students reach Std IX. Describing the intricacies of the two GRs, Kedia said, “Issued on March 4 and July 20 last year, these GRs seek to impose a validity period of three years for NOC issued by the state government for affiliation of schools associated with boards such as CBSE, Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), International Baccalaureate (IB) etc.” He added that the state government plans to collect a whopping Rs1.5 lakh for every NOC it renews. “They say these charges are for scrutiny of renewal application, but it seems that is just going to add to the state’s revenue. A lot of our members are being asked to renew the NOC, which means hundreds of schools will have to cough up Rs1.5 lakh each, that too every three years,” said Kedia. A few school owners spoke with TOI, though on condition of anonymity, and said this NOC issue needs to be resolved immediately. “Last year when the GRs came out, our association had written to education department and we too thought that the government won’t follow through with it. But now many of our peers are getting pressured to shell out the hefty amount which is not feasible considering that fee collection itself has become an issue,” said a school trustee. USF claims a similar GR had been issued over a decade ago and that had been stayed by the court. Kedia said, “The GR, dated August 7, was challenged by in writ petition No.2157 of 2010, following which it was stayed by the high court. Still, the state government went ahead and issued these GRs in 2020.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/grs-linking-noc-to-board-affiliation-illegal-say-schools/articleshow/85336119.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

It was a house at Kidangoor near Angamaly that was raided by the central agency on Saturday. According to an official statement, raids were also held at six more places in Chennai and Thiruvallur districts of Tamil Nadu as well. As per the statement, raids were held at the premises of accused and suspects involved in trafficking of arms, ammunition and narcotics from Iran and Pakistan to Sri Lanka. “During the searches, various incriminating documents, including books relating to Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a proscribed terrorist organisation, seven digital devices, including mobile phones, SIM cards and tablets, were seized. Further investigation in the case continues,” the statement said. Seventh accused in the case, Suresh Raj had stayed at the house where the raid took place in Ernakulam. Earlier, the Q branch of Tamil Nadu police had picked up Suresh Raj from the house where he was staying on rent, on July 3. It was earlier revealed that Suresh was a Sri Lankan citizen who was illegally staying in the country. Sources said that he had even obtained identification documents, including passport, driving licence, election ID card and Aadhaar card during his stay. NIA is also learnt to have examined other places where Suresh and another accused, Soundarajan, had stayed. As per the statement, the case was originally registered on April 5, 2021 in Vizhinjam police station under Section 27 of Arms Act and Section 34 of IPC. The case was then registered against six Sri Lankan nationals. These persons were intercepted along with consignments of 300kg heroin, 5 AK-47 and 1,000 live rounds by Coast Guard on March 18, 2021. NIA re-registered the case on May 1, 2021. During investigation, NIA found the involvement of Suresh and Soundarajan and they were arrested by the NIA on August 2. Sources said that the NIA investigation has revealed that Suresh and Soundrajan had maintained contacts with a Pakistani handler who supplied the contraband. Based on a court direction, the duo was brought to Kochi and their NIA custody period ended on Friday. Earlier, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had arrested the six Sri Lankan nationals on March 25 after the Coast Guard interception.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/arms-smuggling-case-nia-raids-house-near-angamaly/articleshow/85336196.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Inform us about fever camps, say rural residents||Coimbatore: People in the rural areas in the district have urged the public health officials to inform them in advance about the fever camps in their localities. They said while many such camps were held in the past, they had missed most of them as they were unaware about the same. Things are, however, different in the city corporation limits, where the civic body shares details of fever camp venues with the residents a day in advance. Hence, city residents don’t face much difficulty in making use of the camps.While health officials plan fever camps based on the field survey on influenza-like illness, people in rural areas are often not communicated about the same. It is to be noted that more than 15 fever camps are organized in Thudiyalur block alone daily. But people are hardly informed about the camp venues. S Ravindran, 60, a resident of Pannimadai, who was down with fever last week, said he had a tough time reaching the nearby primary health centre (PHC). “There was a fever camp in my locality that day. But I wasn’t aware of that. Had I known, I wouldn’t have travelled all the way to the PHC to get tested.”A senior health official at Thudiyalur said panchayats were using public address systems to inform the public about the fever camps in their neighbourhood in the beginning of the second wave. It, he said, had helped many people consult doctors and give swabs for Covid testing, if necessary. “But it isn’t happening nowadays.”P Aruna, deputy director of health services, Coimbatore, said panchayats were informing the residents about the fever camps. “If the message is not reaching people, adequate steps should be taken to convey the details of fever camps to them.”She confirmed that the camps were conducted based on the door-to-door survey. “Fever camps are conducted in areas that have a high number of people with influenza-like illness to collect their swabs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/inform-us-about-fever-camps-say-rural-residents/articleshow/85338161.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Coimbatore||Only 3.6L of 18.9L vaccinated in district received both doses||COIMBATORE: While the health department vaccinated 40% of the district’s population with the first dose of Covid vaccines, only 10% of them have received both the doses. As per data from by the department, 18.87 lakh doses have been used so far in the district. Out of this, 15.25 lakh were first dose and only 3.6 lakh were second dose. With an estimated 38 lakh population, the numbers are not very convincing in terms of the rate of vaccination. While it is essential to have both the doses for effective immune response against Covid-19, more vaccination camps are being conducted to administer the second dose. “Roughly, 12,000-odd people are being vaccinated daily in the district. Apart from vaccinating people with the first dose, we are conducting exclusive camps for the second dose,” said deputy director of health services (DDHS) P Aruna. But the numbers are certainly not convincing, said Dr Varun Sundaramoorthy, infectious diseases (ID) consultant at Kovai Medical Center and Hospital (KMCH). “For good immunity, one dose of vaccine is not enough. The protection will not be long-lasting. Even with two doses of vaccine, sometimes you may not get adequate immune response if the virus is mutating and is completely different from the previous infection,” he told TOI. Private health care sector is vibrant in Coimbatore and vaccination picked up at private hospitals after the Centre allowed them to procure vaccines straight from the manufacturers from May. Being an industrial region, many industries prefer private healthcare facility to vaccinate staff. But different pricing and variation in the duration of first and second dose of the two available vaccines are said to be reasons for delay in vaccinating the maximum number of people. The two most popular vaccines are priced differently. While Covaxin is available for Rs 780 at the private hospitals, Covishield is priced around Rs 1,250. Since most people prefer the cheaper vaccine, the time between the first and second dose is almost three months. Most young people and large families prefer Covishield. But the time between the first and second dose is 84 days. Sri Ramakrishna Hospital, a private Covid vaccination centre (CVC), was vaccinating over 1,000 people daily a couple of months back. It has come down to 500. Many of those who were vaccinated in the last week of May or the first of June are likely to come back for vaccination in the next few weeks. “The government has given exception by reducing the time between two doses of Covishield for those travelling abroad. It should include Covishield also to increase the vaccination rate,” said Poornima Raja, head operations of Sri Ramakrishna Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/only-3-6l-of-18-9l-vaccinated-in-district-received-both-doses/articleshow/85338150.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Surat||VNSGU gets edu policy rolling||Surat: Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) senate on Saturday approved the Multiple Certification Policy (MCP) as part of the drive to implement the National Education Policy (NEP). Major changes in academic formats are being introduced in the university aimed to benefit students. Students, so far, were awarded a certificate of undergraduate or postgraduate course only upon clearing exams of all the semesters. But under MCP, a student will get a digital certificate after completion of each year. The digital certificate will be verifiable online by persons concerned. In a six semester UG course, students who clear two semesters will be awarded certificate for completion of a certificate course. In case of clearing four semesters, a student will get a certificate for diploma course. Similarly in the case of a PG course, a student will get a digital certificate if they clear the first two semesters. Students can get a transcript for the completed semesters which can be used for admission in any other higher education institute. “We are working to enable a flexible curriculum that enables multiple entry and exit for students. A student can take admission or leave anytime without much adverse impact on academic records,” said K N Chavda, vice-chancellor, VNSGU. As part of NEP, a PhD student can carry out research in areas requiring in-depth study of multiple subjects. In such cases, a student can complete the research under multiple co-guides. With the implementation of NEP, the university teachers will have to bring major changes in course structure for which, various boards of studies will start the process. “We have 44 boards of studies and minute details to implement NEP will be worked out. NEP has come into force in VNSGU and students can take advantage of it now,” Chavda added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vnsgu-gets-edu-policy-rolling/articleshow/85336202.cms||---

The mother used to work as domestic help while their father had passed away a few years ago. The boys stay with their septuagenarian grandmother at Juni Mangalwari. With the government schemes yet to be implemented, the orphans are in lurch. Their poor relatives and even neighbours are barely able to help. They are among the 51 children from Nagpur district who are waiting to turn 18 years to become eligible for Rs10 lakh aid from Central government's PM Cares Fund. The state government has promised Rs5 lakh for which government resolution was issued on June 17. In addition, another 1,699 children, who have lost one of their parents to Covid, are supposed to be inducted into the ‘Balsangopan’ scheme through Women and Child Development (WCD) department. As per women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur, proposal has been mooted before the state cabinet for monetary assistance of Rs1,100 to such children. According to her, around 15,000 children in the state have lost one of their parents due to Covid. Thakur said that WCD is already giving monetary assistance to the orphans. On state government’s special monetary assistance of Rs five lakh to Covid orphans, she said that the scheme was budgeted this year. “The file is currently with the finance department and should be cleared soon,” she said. According to Thakur, there are about 500 Covid orphans in the state. As per a source in the WCD, government has asked the respective district units to open joint bank accounts of the orphans along with the district WCD officer. “There is a minor who had discontinued studies and picked up a job to sustain himself and his grandparents. Another 17-year-old girl from Satranjipura is keen to study further but Covid left her devastated after she lost of her parents,” said the WCD source. The source said that sometime he children don’t even have enough cash to get photocopy of documents. “We offer them help,” the source said. Former mayor Sandip Joshi has initiated a ‘Sobat Palaktatwa Prakalp’ to help Covid-affected families, especially children. He has taken up the responsibility of 250 families where 400 children are now under his care and watch. Joshi said they have so far paid Rs 9.50 lakh in school fees for these children. “Women have been given skill development training, especially in jobs like masala-making and such projects. We will have their own brand of ‘Covid Swayam Siddha’ and an exhibition would be held during Diwali,” he said. The former mayor had also created special ‘Family health card’ for free medical treatment and formed a panel of counsellors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/promises-aplenty-for-covid-orphans-but-help-still-afar/articleshow/85336204.cms||Soumitra Bose

The incident took place around Friday midnight, said cops from Ambazari police station. Following the incident, senior inspector Narendra Hiware has sought details of sandalwood trees under the jurisdiction of Ambazari police station. After receiving the list, the police station will intensify its patrolling near the spots of sandalwood trees. Though responsible to conserve all trees in the garden premises, the private security agency Garuda has been unable to protect trees, especially sandalwood, which is high-risk tree. In the past too, at least 10 sandalwood trees had been stolen from the premises of Ambazari garden. It also indicates the possible involvement of guards from the private security agency deployed there. “In the midnight, the guard deployed there said he heard noise of tree felling and ran towards it. As it was dark, he could not see anyone and found the tree missing,” said police sources. On Saturday, the supervisor of the security agency formally lodged a complaint with the Ambazari police station. NMC’s garden superintendent Amol Chorpagar admitted that the theft of sandalwood trees in the city has increased manifold. In the last couple of years, at least 20 such thefts across the city have been reported and most of them are from Civil Lines — where NMC’s headquarters are located — and its adjoining areas like Sadar, Ambazari and Maharajbagh. Two thieves had recently been nabbed for stealing a sandalwood tree from the official bungalow of deputy commissioner of police (zone-V) Noorul Hasan. It seems a gang is involved in all the cases as it is very difficult to identify a sandalwood tree, said Chorpagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/another-sandalwood-tree-stolen-from-ambazari-garden-cops-seek-details-of-other-trees-spots-from-nmc/articleshow/85336224.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

KPCC president K Sudhakaran was not able to submit a final list to the party high command after “A” and “I” group leaders expressed their dissatisfaction with it. Even as the attempts to find a consensus among group leaders in the selection of candidates to be appointed as DCC presidents continue, Sudhakaran submitted a list of “probable candidates” to Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi on Saturday. Former chief minister Oommen Chandy and former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala are reportedly unhappy with the KPCC president’s list. The “A” and “I” group leaders have informed the high command that the list was prepared without taking them into confidence. Former KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran too has expressed his dissatisfaction over the way the DCC revamp is taking place. According to sources, Sudhakaran left for New Delhi with the promise that the DCC revamp list would be finalised only after he comes back from Delhi, after attending a dinner hosted for MPs. However, after reaching Delhi he contacted Chennithala and Ommen chandy and asked them to send their list. This irked both the leaders who refused to do so. Expressing their dismay over the way a new power centre is emerging in the Congress, both leaders informed the high command that they felt side lined. Rahul Gandhi had earlier assured both Chennithala and Chandy that any organisational decision would be taken only after holding discussions with them. Chennithala and Chandy were learnt to have told Tariq Anwar, who is in charge of Kerala affairs, that attempts were on to create a new group in the party in the name of eliminating the groups that have dominated the party in Kerala for long. At no point in the discussions for choosing candidates to head the DCCs, the “I” and “A” group leaders were consulted, they said. Meanwhile, Sudhakaran told reporters in New Delhi that KPCC secretary P S Prasanth who unsuccessfully contested in Nedumangad assembly constituency in the last election has been suspended from the party for raising “baseless allegations” against the party. He has been suspended for six months, pending inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/resentment-brews-in-cong-over-dcc-rejig/articleshow/85336264.cms||---

Police officers said that the accused, Gauri Patel, told them that she had also killed her own 11-year-old son 15 years ago. She married Hardik’s father Rajnikant about seven years ago. Hardik’s younger brother, Umang Patel, who runs a dairy in Kanbha, stated in his FIR that Gauri and Hardik often fought over money. “My stepmother used to take money from our relatives and my father’s friends in the name of investing in our dairy business, but never spent the money on it,” he said in the FIR. She had borrowed Rs 25 lakh from relatives saying Hardik had suffered losses in the dairy business due to Covid-19 pandemic, the lockdown and curfews. When these relatives began asking Hardik for the money, he objected to her taking money from them and spending it on herself. On Tuesday morning, when Hardik was asleep alone at home as Umang had gone to his dairy, Gauri along with her three relatives from Nashik — Sanjay, Anil and Dinesh — strangled him with a rope, said DySP K T Kamaria. They then packed his body into a sack and dumped it on Chosamia Road in Kanbha, he said. When Umang returned home and did not find Hardik till late in the evening, he inquired with Gauri about him, but she did not give any clear answers. On asking his neighbours, Umang found that Gauri and her three relatives had loaded a sack into an autorickshaw on Tuesday afternoon. Meanwhile, Kanbha police inquiring into the missing person’s complaint on Wednesday found the body in bushes near Chosamia Road. It was later identified as Hardik. On questioning, she confessed to having killed Hardik with the three men. “During her questioning, she also confessed that she had in 2014 killed her 11-year-old son when she was working as a domestic helper in Nashik,” said Kamaria. She and two male friends had killed her son as he witnessed them breaking into the house where she worked. They strangled the 11-year-old boy and she cooked up a story that burglars had broken into her employer’s house, tried to rape her and killed him when he tried to intervene. She married Hardik’s father in 2015, said a police officer. Kanbha police registered a complaint of murder and criminal conspiracy against Gauri and her three aides for killing Hardik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/murderous-moms-2nd-case-surfaces-in-a-week/articleshow/85338207.cms||---

Presently, the app is being used by the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) unit officials, who upload the photos of criminals, rowdies and anti-social elements on their server, which would be linked to the app.The plan is to install the app on the mobile phones of special sub-inspectors of police, sub-inspectors, inspectors, deputy superintendents of police and assistant commissioners of police.According to an official source, the CCTNS unit officials have been using the app on a trial basis for the past 10 days.Usually, the source said, police upload the photos of the accused in murder cases, burglaries, vehicle thefts, chain snatching on CCTNS. “Whenever cops detain an accused or a suspect, they have to take photo on their mobile phones and upload the same on the face recognition app, which is linked to the CCTNS server. If the accused or the suspect was caught in some cases in the past, the app will display all the case details. In short, cops could have the criminal background of the accused/suspect at their fingertips.”City police commissioner Deepak M Damor confirmed that CCTNS unit officers were working on the face recognition app. “It will help cops get all the details of the accused easily.”All the 38 rural police stations in the district have deployed a constable to upload the first information report details and photos of accused on CCTNS.

Apart from household waste, meat waste is also being dumped there, inviting packs of stray dogs to the busy residential area.Residents say they are forced to dispose of waste in the open as corporation workers are not carrying out door-to-door waste collection regularly. “My wife is very particular about cleanliness and asks me to get rid of garbage daily.

These nuggets about the tricolour and many more about the freedom movement will be shared on the inaugural day of UP’s first Military Literature Festival on Sunday. The festival, which will be hosted virtually, will see Army veterans turned authors, journalists, writers, historians among others, discussing various facets of the freedom movement. On August 15, Lt Gen Rameshwar Yadav will be in conversation with Sadan Jha on his book ‘Reverence, Resistance and Politics of Indian National Flag’, along with leading vexillologist Shekhar Chakraborty. On August 22, Lucknow-based author Mehru Jaffar will be in conversation with historian and author Rosie Llewellyn-Jones and Lt Gen Milan Naidu on the topic ‘Bhopal and Lucknow: Tales from two grand cities’. The next two sessions on August 28 will cover the excerpts and experiences of army veterans turned authors on the 1971 Indo-Pak war, followed by the last session on August 29 on ‘Creative ways of remembrance and memorialisation’. “There will be something for everyone during the fest. The aim is to bring together people of the nation, of the world, military and thinktanks, authors, creative people, researchers and journalists to debate, discuss and enjoy the diverse field of discourses and programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/military-lit-fest-to-offer-nuggets-of-past-freedom/articleshow/85339172.cms||---

The Annur police too had carried out a separate investigation.The panel had held inquiry with Kalaiselvi, Muthusamy and 38-year-old K Gopalsamy, of Gobirasipuram, who the VAO and her assistant said had created unruly scenes at her office on August 6 when he came to question her about transferring patta of his father’s property to his uncle.The panel sent its report to the collector and based on the same both Kalaiselvi, Muthusamy were directed to lodge complaints against Gopalsamy with the Annur police, who booked him for forcing the dalit village assistant to prostrate before him and not allowing the VAO to perform her duty.Based on the new video evidence, revenue officials have transferred Muthusamy and Kalaiselvi to two other villages in the district. “During the inquiry, they furnished false information before the committee.

---||Delhi||‘May jump bail’ can’t be ground to keep in jail: Court||New Delhi: A Delhi court has granted bail to a man arrested for allegedly subjecting his wife to cruelty and unnatural sex saying an apprehension that the accused might jump bail was not sufficient to decline him the relief. Metropolitan magistrate Shilpi Singh said, “This ground cannot be considered for denying bail to the accused as the surety is sought for this very purpose, i.e, to ensure the appearance of the accused, and an apprehension that the accused may jump the bail is not sufficient to decline the application, especially where the accused has clean antecedents,” the court held. It said the investigation regarding the accused was complete and granted him bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 50,000 with one surety of like amount. The court noted that no medico-legal case record was filed along with the reply of the investigating officer (IO) to substantiate the allegation of “unnatural offences,” and that he could not form an opinion that the allegations were true or false at the present stage. The court directed him to cooperate in the investigation and appear before the court concerned whenever summoned. It further asked him not to contact the complainant or visit her under any circumstances. The accused’s counsel had argued that the investigating officer searched the premises of the accused and found nothing incriminating. Police had opposed the bail plea saying the accused was arrested as he was not cooperating in the investigation and the allegations were serious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/may-jump-bail-cant-be-ground-to-keep-in-jail-court/articleshow/85336295.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC interim stay on new IT rules on code of ethics for publishers||MUMBAI: In an interim order, the Bombay high court on Saturday stayed some provisions of the government’s new Information Technology rules that pertain to the code of ethics for publishers of online content. The HC stayed rule 9 (1) and rule 9 (3) of the Information Technology (Guidelines For Intermediaries And Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, saying the rules seeks to regulate something the IT Act does not. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni pronounced the interim order on PILs that challenged the constitutional validity of the new IT rules. The HC gave the Centre three weeks to file its reply. “For proper administration, it is healthy to invite criticism of those in public service... but with the 2021 rules in place, one would have to think twice before criticizing any such personality, even if the writer/editor/publisher may have good reasons to do so without resorting to defamation or inviting action under another law,” the order said.Rule 9, which is partly stayed, seeks “observation and adherence” by publishers to the code of ethics and norms of conduct for journalists under the Press Council guidelines and Cable TV code. The HC said it “goes beyond the substantive Act and rule 9 prima facie was an intrusion of the rights of the petitioners under Article 19 (1) (a) (freedom of speech and expression) of the Constitution.” The rules now stayed are 9 (1), which says, ‘A publisher shall observe and adhere to such code’ and 9 (3), which set outs a three-tier structure for dealing with complaints against such publishers. The three-tier structure comprises level I self-regulation by publishers, level II self-regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the publishers and level III is an oversight mechanism by the Central government. The order said, “Dissent in democracy is vital. It is, however, the checks and balances that make a democracy work. There can be no two opinions that a healthy democracy is one which has developed on criticism and acceptance of contra views. Opinion based on criticism reinforces its acceptance in a democratic society,” said the order. The court posted final hearing for September 27. The HC said, “The operation of the 2021 Rules in its form and substance to operate would result in the writer/editor/publisher standing the risk of being punished and sanctioned, should the inter-departmental committee be not in favour of criticism of any public figure,” the HC said. “It is, therefore, quite possible” that a person on contravention of rule 9 (1) but without even transgressing the boundaries of reasonable restrictions under the Constitution, may expose himself/itself to punishment/sanction under the 2021 Rules.” However, the HC has not stayed rule 9 (2), which says that publishers who contravene or violate any other law can be proceeded against under that law. The HC also did not stay another rule, 16, which empowers ‘blocking of information (content) in case of emergency’ without hearing the person, publisher or intermediary. “No case is made out to stay Rule 16,” said the HC. The HC said the petitioners had not challenged it and lived with a similar provision in the earlier 2009 rules under the IT Act. And the HC said it was at this stage not delving into rule 14, which provides for action to be taken by an “inter- departmental committee” as such a committee has not yet been appointed. The HC granted liberty to both the petitioners to seek relief as and when any need arose regarding rule 14. On Friday, when the HC had reserved the matter for interim orders, the bench during the hearing had raised several questions to the Centre, including, “How can protection under substantive law be taken away by a delegated legislation (rules are delegated legislation, not made by the Parliament)?” The two PILs, one by the owner of a digital portal and another by mediaperson Nikhil Wagle, said the new rules intended to control ‘online content’ and would have a chilling effect on speech. Senior counsel Darius Khambata, appearing for the portal, had said the urgency for stay was even more pronounced since the chilling effect was already being experienced via self-regulation. While, at an earlier hearing, he had sought a stay of three rules—9, 14 and 16— on Friday he sought a stay on at least rule 9, which calls for adherence to code of ethics by publishers. Wagle’s counsel Abhay Nevgi had sought a stay of the entire rules. The Central government, represented by additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh, had opposed such a plea, saying the rules provide primarily for self-regulation and government oversight, the committee for which is not yet set up. The HC on Friday, citing an example from the journalists’ code of conduct which expects accuracy in reporting, and also for photo-journalists to be humble and unobtrusive and treat all subjects with respect and dignity, said, “If he is not humble, does he have to be penalized? You are restricting the liberty of thought.” The rules have incorporated what are mere guidelines under the Press Council of India and the Cable TV code and made them mandatory, stepping beyond the rule-making powers under the IT Act besides breaching the reasonable restrictions permissible under Article 19 (2) of the Constitution, argued Khambata. He said the rules are “manifestly unreasonable” and do no good to democracy. The bench too had said during the Friday court hearing, “The Press Council guidelines are norms of behaviour. How can you put it to such exalted status of mandatory compliance? Let us know if you are restricting it to Article 19 (2) (reasonable restrictions on free speech).” Singh said the main grievance of the petitioners is against government oversight but added that the proposed inter- departmental committee—which can even block public access to content in emergent cases--under the new IT rules is not yet notified; the ministry is to constitute it, and it is at the final stage of finalization, hence no action is likely to take place in any case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-interim-stay-on-new-it-rules-on-code-of-ethics-for-publishers/articleshow/85339174.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Thane||Shiv Sena may okay land transfer for bullet train project in Thane||THANE: Eight months after taking a firm stand against the crucial Mumbai Ahmedabad bullet train project of the central government, the Shiv Sena-led Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) seems to have softened its stance. The general body that had rejected a key land transfer proposal four times in the past is likely to review the same later this month. “The general body had junked the land transfer from the corporation to the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited for the Mumbai Ahmedabad bullet train project last December and will now discuss the same at the forthcoming meeting next week. The proposal entails approving transfer around 3,920sqm land at Shil required for constructing tunnel entry point tunnel of the high speed rail corridor,” informed an official. It is believed the transfer proposal has been falling through repeatedly in the Sena-led house apparently as fallout of the brewing unease of the state with the centre over the metro 3 yard issue. However, with the tensions eased over the last several months, the project is now likely to sail through, hint Sena insiders. The NHSRCL had requested the Thane corporation for transferring the land title that is presently owned by the latter in its name and also agreed to pay compensation as per market value. Accordingly, a proposal was drafted early last year and presented before the general body but it continued to face opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-sena-may-okay-land-transfer-for-bullet-train-project-in-thane/articleshow/85339181.cms||Manoj Badgeri

The second phase of work, which they said is to start from September 1 onwards, will be done on the stretch from Ganesh Talkies towards Girish Park for which they will take a road closure from August 27,” said KMC board of administrators chairman Firhad Hakim on Saturday, following a meeting at KMC. City traffic police said it is preparing its final traffic diversion plan for Vivekananda Road before the second phase of dismantling work begins. Police sources said that KMDA had sought blockade of Vivekananda road, lying between Ganesh Talkies and Girish Park, on August 27. According to Jorabagan traffic guard sources, the cops will be diverting vehicles coming from Posta and towards Girish Park from the Ganesh Talkies crossing. “All vehicles will turn left onto Beadon Street instead of going straight. They will again turn right and reach CR Avenue. The traffic diversion - as compared to the Strand road one in the first phase - is a minor one. With no major commercial activity in the area, the diversions should not come as a major challenge,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-dwaipayan-posta-flyover-14-08-21/articleshow/85336381.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Jaipur||When freedom fighters shut Rajasthan's Kota for three days||JAIPUR: The erstwhile Kota state was under siege for three days by freedom fighters in protest against the arrest of renowned freedom fighter Rameshwar Dayal Saxena by the state police during the Quit India Movement in 1942. Over 200 freedom fighters shut down the city demanding the release of Saxena who was close to Mahatma Gandhi. The untold story of Saxena documented by the Rajasthan State Archives Bikaner (RSAB) revealed the valour and courage displayed by a graduate from Allahabad University. Not enough material was available on the movements led by Saxena in Kota until RSAB did an extensive research on the 220 freedom fighters including him. A poster from Bikaner archives giving information on SaxenaSaxena plunged into the freedom struggle in 1937 after the Kota state introduced a law making it compulsory for people to take permission of police before holding assemblies. Even if somebody was coming from outside for taking part in the freedom struggle, he had to take the permission from the local administration. “The fresh graduate found the law yet another step to suppress the freedom struggle. He started holding public meetings in Kota, Sangod and Bara defying it. He along with other renowned leaders – Chappan Lal Chaturvedi, Mathuralal Meena and Ramgopal — were sent to the prison for a year,” said RSAb director Mahendra Khadgawat. The initial success in Kota had made the freedom fighters upbeat. They went to Delhi for a larger role and met Mahatma Gandhi. “The briefed Gandhiji about the freedom movement in Kota and other 21 Rajputana states. Gandhiji supported their movement of raising their voice against the Kota state. This gave them much-needed support space in the regional freedom movement,” said Khadgawat. Narrating the unprecedented incident, he said by the beginning of Quit India movement, they all became popular in Kota region. During the movement, they came to Kota to mobilise people and were arrested. “The move sparked a major outrage among citizens, which led to massive protests in the city. The city was surrounded by gates and protestors locked the gates from inside. For next three days, protestors didn’t budge to the pressure and remained ready to take on police. On the third day, the imperial army marched in the city and fired indiscriminately. After some hours, they were successful in opening the gates,” said Khadgawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/when-freedom-fighters-shut-kota-for-three-days/articleshow/85336345.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Poisoned child, then had sex with lover’||AHMEDABAD: A 26-year-old woman from Naroda, who had killed her three-year-old son with her paramour’s help at a city guesthouse, allegedly had lunch and sex in the room after poisoning the child. The incident took place on August 6. “Accused Jyoti Parmar and her boyfriend Bhupendra Parmar had booked a room in a guesthouse near Civil Hospital for four hours to execute their murder plan. They gave her son, Yuvi, poisoned milk and waited for him to fall unconscious,” said a Shaherkotda police officer. “They gave the milk to the boy in the first hour itself, and had three more hours to spend at the guesthouse. So, they ordered lunch. They kept checking if the child was just sleeping or had fallen unconscious. After talking for a while, they had sex. They left the guesthouse once the child had lost consciousness,” he added. During questioning, they narrated the entire sequence of the crime. Cops said that as Bhupendra worked as a sanitation worker in the postmortem room at Palanpur Civil Hospital, he knew about various poisons. “So, he went to a shop and bought a poison that he mixed in the milk and gave to the kid,” said the cop. Jyoti had been in a relationship with Bhupendra, a native of Palanpur, for the past 8-9 years. “Her husband Ajay found out about the affair a while ago and the two had a big fight. However, they reconciled later. Meanwhile, Jyoti and Bhupendra decided to get rid of Yuvi as they felt that he was an obstacle to their relationship,” said police. On August 5, Yuvi had high fever. Jyoti got the idea that if she killed the child while he was unwell, then no one would suspect her or her lover. She spoke to Bhupendra who told her to take Yuvi to the guesthouse where they poisoned him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/poisoned-child-then-had-sex-with-lover/articleshow/85338252.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Anti-Hindutva stand fuelled victory: CPM||Thiruvananthapuram: In a post-poll review, CPM central committee has identified the party’s strong anti-Hindutva stand and the entry of KC(M) into the LDF fold as the key factors that helped the Left front retain power in the assembly elections. “The people appreciated the LDF government as being the bulwark of secularism and the communally-harmonious character of Kerala society. The firm stand of the LDF government against the Citizenship Amendment Act and other Hindutva measures of BJP-RSS increased support amongst the minorities and people at large,” it said. The report said the elections saw the unprecedented use of central agencies like ED and CBI to target the chief minister and the government in connection with the gold smuggling case, and the ‘patent’ falsehood in right wing media reports displeased the voters. It, however, expressed concern over the fall in voting percentage. “Our voting percentage in 2021 is less than our voting percentage in 2006. We must seriously consider the reasons for this and to make efforts to expand our influence. We have to identify all factors that hinder our efforts to get more acceptability among people and take measures to find solutions. We have to attract ordinary people, who rallied behind UDF and BJP, towards us and try to increase our mass influence. Appropriate corrective steps are necessary in certain areas where we lag behind. It has to be noted that BJP has come in second place in nine constituencies. BJP is in second place for some time in the linguistic minority constituencies in Kasaragod. We have to pay more attention to the constituencies where BJP has reached second place,” the report said. In the section that deals with organisational steps to be taken by the party state unit, the report said: “New sections, including middle class, are coming to the party in Muslim areas. Steps should be taken to recruit the best among them as party members and build Party in those areas. Also, attention should be given to recruiting more members from amongst the Christian community and increasing awareness of party members and units about the political-ideological design of the Hindutva forces.” The central committee asked the state unit not to undermine the strength of Congress-led UDF. Despite the loss, UDF’s vote share has increased slightly compared to the 2016 assembly elections. It was 38.8% in 2016 and it is 39.4% now. Muslim League, with its big influence among the Muslim community, is giving strong support to UDF. The anti-communist media in Kerala is also backing UDF. UDF also commands considerable influence among the upper middle classes, the report noted. The central committee cautioned the party state unit to take steps to check the saffron party’s growing influence in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/anti-hindutva-stand-fuelled-victory-cpm/articleshow/85336409.cms||---

The Rajasthan State Archives Bikaner has traced a set of his poetries and chapters reflecting his understanding of different phases of freedom movements. “His credentials as a freedom fighter are known to many. But few know him as a prolific poet and writer,” said Mahendra Khadgawat, director of Rajasthan State Archives Bikaner. Calling his writings extraordinary, the director said so far they had collected 100 writings of him from different sources such as libraries, his extended family members, newspaper clippings, books and magazines. “His writings were in different Rajasthan languages — Rajasthani, Marwari and Dhundheri,” said the director, who elaborated that his poem, ‘Pidito Ka Panchdi’ writes a tale of a common man living in British Raj. “The poem, Bhanda Na Neeche Jhukana’ has beautifully narrated the sentiments in the country post-Jallianwala Bagh tragedy. His writings captivate pain and sufferings while keeping the motivation of people high,” said Khadgawat. His writings have been kept in the archives’ centre at Bikaner. Pathik was active in the freedom movement since 1915. He participated in movements like Quit India, etc. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pathik-was-a-great-writer-and-poet-too/articleshow/85336326.cms||---

The meetings of the two committees witnessed heated debate and a secret ballot was held. In the admission committee meeting, the VC’s proposal was rejected by seven out of 11 members and in the examination committee, nine out of 14 members voted against it. Earlier, teachers had rejected VC’s direction to adopt the state government’s common minimum syllabus. The VC had created four posts of dean — one each for academics, recruitment, research and admissions — last year, saying it will make functioning smoother and more transparent. The teachers’ association opposed it on the grounds that the post of dean is a statutory position whose eligibility criteria has been defined in State University Act, hence any deviation from it is illegal. LUTA also wrote to the chancellor and chief minister in this regard. On Saturday, the proposal to make these four deans ex-officio members of the two committees was tabled under section 50 (3) of the Act. LUTA president Prof Vineet Verma said, “Section 50 (3) states that for creation of a new post it is necessary to first take opinion of those whose power will be affected by it, but it was not followed in this case. Hence, most teachers, including office bearers of LUTA and LU Associated College Teachers' Association (LUACTA) rejected it.” LU spokesperson Prof Durgesh Srivastava admitted that the proposal was rejected in both the meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-teachers-defeat-vcs-proposal-to-induct-four-new-deans-as-ex-officio-members-of-exam-ac/articleshow/85339185.cms||---

In due course of the conversation, Chauhan said that he had quite some difficulty in hearing. Within an hour, personnel from the civil hospital at Asarva reached Chauhan’s house and handed over the 89-year-old freedom fighter a set of hearing aids, providing an example of pro-active governance. “When I went to Chauhan’s house and was speaking to him, I observed he had difficulty hearing. I got in touch with authorities at the civil hospital, who provided the freedom fighter with a hearing aid quickly. I am fortunate to have been able to help a freedom fighter,” Sangle said. He added that it takes about two to three days for a person to adapt to hearing aids and hospital personnel will help Chauhan get used to the aid. On the eve of Independence Day celebrations, collectorate officials visited homes of freedom fighters and felicitated them for contributing towards India’s freedom. Laxman Chauhan’s son Jitendra said that his father used hearing aids, but they got lost about a year ago, when he misplaced the bag in which they were kept. “We are thankful that the government has provided him the hearing aid,” Jitendra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/freedom-fighter-gets-hearing-aid-in-an-hour/articleshow/85338339.cms||---

In Mumbai, the BMC’s vaccine update said 2.19 lakh people had been inoculated, but the tally included shots given by the private sector on Thursday and Friday as well (when the BMC had to cancel its drive due to shortage of vaccines). The previous records were 8.11 lakh for the state on July 3 and 1.54 lakh for Mumbai on June 26. State officials said that Saturday’s feat showed that Maharashtra continued to be at the forefront of vaccination in India. It is now closer to becoming the first state in the country to give out 5 crore shots. “Till 7pm, we had vaccinated 9.36 lakh people and the numbers may increase,’’ additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradip Vyas said said. State officials have maintained that there is adequate infrastructure to give out nine to 10 lakh shots each day. “The state has a capacity of at least 10 lakh vaccinations per day and this has been proved by the record number of vaccinations given today,’’ Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said. Tope said, “Vaccination is an important weapon to prevent corona, and if supply of vaccines is maintained, a similar number of citizens can be vaccinated in the state.’’ The BMC’s vaccine update on Saturday said the 2.19 lakh tally includes cumulative figures of vaccinations done on previous two days and Saturday until 7pm. Of the 2.19 lakh shots given in Mumbai on Saturday, 90,102 were given at public centres, while the remaining 1.29 lakh were administered at private centres. The numbers include 370 bedridden beneficiaries who were vaccinated at home. Vaccination at public centres, which had stopped for two days, resumed on Saturday in Mumbai after BMC received 1.7 lakh doses from the state. “We are scheduled to get more vaccines later in the day,’’ said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani, adding that the stocks should last for three days. He said BMC had decided to give out the highest number of vaccination whenever stocks are available. On Sunday, BMC vaccination centres will be shut and resume work on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/record-9-4-lakh-vaccinated-in-state-on-saturday-city-tops-2l-in-3-days/articleshow/85339190.cms||---

In the forms sent by school authorities, a majority of parents wrote that due to the fear of a third wave of Covid-19 they are not ready to send their children to schools. Schools have been closed since March after the second wave of Covid-19 claimed many lives. After almost five months, following government directions, the schools will be reopening from Monday for the offline classes.

---||Pune||Pune: Duo float car rental scheme & dupe 22 people; booked||PUNE: The Loni Kalbhor police on Friday booked two men who allegedly cheated 22 people of more than Rs 2.5 crore in a fake car rental scheme. As per an FIR registered by one of the car owners, Avinash Kadam of Phursungi, the duo ran the scam between March 15 and July 27, wherein they promised huge profits if the victims rented their cars to a private firm in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. The fraud was discovered when the duo — one of whom claimed to be a retired Army officer — went missing with the vehicles; the car owners never got the promised profits and lost their cars. Kadam told TOI he had become acquainted with the duo when they travelled in his cab in March. “They tempted me by claiming a road infrastructure company in Noida wanted a large fleet of cars on a rental basis. I signed an agreement with them leasing my car as my cab business was not doing well and I was looking for extra income,” Kadam said. Kadam said he introduced the suspects to other cab drivers and acquaintances and helped them secure 20 cars to meet the so-called company’s growing need for cars. “I helped them secure seven more cars ‘on a rental basis’, this time for a company that was supposedly based in the Marathawada region,” Kadam added. He said the duo promised to start payments after two months. “After pursuing them for two months, they finally paid us Rs 5.5 lakh. They later gave me a copy of a cheque for Rs 50 lakh, but till date we have not received the actual amount,” Kadam said. After repeated attempts to get their money bore no fruit, Kadam and his acquaintances went to Noida, where found that no such firm existed at the address that was mentioned in the agreement. “We realised then that we had been cheated. We borrowed money to meet our travelling expenses and returned to Pune. I immediately approached the crime branch and lodged a complaint,” Kadam further said. The 28 cars were worth Rs 2.4 crore, while the victims said they were owed Rs 15 lakh in rent. A case related to criminal breach of trust and cheating has been registered under sections 406, 409 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. “The suspects removed the GPS system soon after taking delivery of the vehicles. They signed agreements with some of the victims before the fraud came to light, We have formed a police team to track down and arrest both men at the earliest,” senior inspector Ganesh Mane of the crime branch (Unit VI) said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-float-car-rental-scheme-dupe-22-people-booked/articleshow/85336444.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Mumbai||Drunk driving: Plea bargaining helps 22 men get away with fines in Mumbai||MUMBAI: In a rare instance, 22 city men, caught in separate drunken driving cases, have used plea bargaining to get off with lighter punishment. While the maximum term under the Motor Vehicles Act for first-time offenders is 6 months’ jail, the court levied fines of Rs 5,000-10,000. The 22 orders were passed by the Andheri magistrate’s court between August 4 and 7. In plea bargaining, an accused can plead guilty for a lesser sentence. The court gave the order after finding that a “mutual satisfactory disposition” was reached between the prosecution and the accused, but they could not get off on a bond of good behaviour. “Since there is a need for punitive checks and the amended Act of Motor Vehicles has the objective of enhancing penalty for traffic offenders specifically for driving dangerously, so also due to concern to road safety in it, therefore, this court is not inclined to release the accused person as per the provisions of Probation of Offenders Act,” the court said. While the youngest accused was around 20, the oldest is 38. The court said that considering the age and the fact that there are no criminal antecedents against the accused, concessions that are available must be given to them. “Therefore, considering all the facts and peculiar circumstances of the case, the plea bargaining made and the mutual satisfactory disposition reached between the parties and the fact that there is no minimum punishment provided in the principal substantive law, ie Section 185 of MV Act… this court is inclined to pass sentence... to only the fine amount as provided,” the court said. The cases were registered between 2019 and 2020. In one instance a 38-year-old Jogeshwari resident was caught in MIDC on the afternoon of March 10, 2020. The youngest among the 22, a 20-year-old man from Andheri (E), was found driving under the influence of alcohol in the early hours of November 7, 2019. Once each of the accused moved pleas for plea bargaining, the court issued summons and spoke to them. After finding that each accused had moved the application voluntarily, further proceedings were set in motion and they ended with the sentencing. If the fine amount is not paid, the accused could face between four to six months in jail, as specified in each order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/drunk-driving-plea-bargaining-helps-22-men-get-away-with-fines/articleshow/85339224.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Lucknow||British policy pushed us into fire of communal hatred: Uttar Pradesh's Gandhi Rajarshi Tandon||LUCKNOW: Disheartened over widespread communal violence before and after the Partition of the country, in the first meeting of Vidhan Sabha on November 3, 1947, Speaker Purushottam Das Tandon gave a clarion call for peace, harmony and brotherhood between Hindus and Muslims. Popularly known as UP’s Gandhi and accorded the title of Rajarshi by people out of love and appreciation for his staunch belief in non-violence and movements he led in the freedom struggle, Tandon in his speech blamed the British colonial rulers for dividing the country after exploiting it for 200 years. Tandon was Speaker of the assembly for 13 years from July 31, 1937. He was conferred with the country’s highest honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 1961 at the age of 78. The leader’s historical speech recorded in the ‘Proceeding Index of the United Provincial Legislative Assembly from November 3 to November 10, 1947’, read, “...The British have pushed Hindustan into a fire of communal hatred because of their policy to make people fight over religious lines...the effect of which has become so widespread that our countrymen are engaged in destruction of each other… It is beyond the power of my words to describe the condition due to religious hatred that has been created in India in the last 4-5 months.” In an emotional appeal during the speech on the floor of the House, Tandon said, “Today the power of the country is in our hands and we have to think in a new way on the question of what should be done for the current situation of communal violence...Our country is surrounded by dangers. Last night, (November 2) our leader Jawaharlal Nehru mentioned some dangers too. I only request you to think deeply about this danger.” “Our dream of unity between Hindus and Muslims and to let our culture become one even after keeping our religious identity has been smashed into pieces. I am one of those people who want to see a single government in the world. It is in my heart to unite India and Pakistan, but considering the current situation, we have a lot of work to do. We cannot run away. I’m a dreamer, but I can’t escape reality,” he added. Suggesting what the future path should be, he said, “We have to stop this animalism in the country. I hope that our central government and state government will work strongly. Where there is no power, there is suffering and destruction, but the power of the government is based in the power of the people. It is my prayer that our Union and state governments try to increase the power of the people at this time.” Research officer of Vidhan Sabha Rajesh Kumar told TOI, “Though Tandon was a Congress member, as Speaker he was impartial. In fact, when he was questioned on this stand on the floor of the house, he offered to step down if any of the members of the House lacked confidence in him. This has been documented in the proceedings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/british-policy-pushed-us-into-fire-of-communal-hatred-rajarshi-tandon/articleshow/85339220.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Goa||Goa: Dhirio organisers hoodwink police, conduct bullfights||MARGAO: Aware of plans by a politician to organise bullfights (dhirio) at various places along Salcete’s coastal belt, ostensibly to mark the birthday celebration of a member of his extended family, Colva police, led by senior police officials maintained a hawk-eyed vigil on popular bullfight venues throughout Saturday. While the police did manage to thwart attempts by dhirio organisers at a couple of places in Fatrade, Varca and at Colva, sources said bullfights were indeed held by hoodwinking the police at a number of other places. Colva police later booked two separate cases against a total of four bull owners under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. They also maintained that strong police presence along the coastal belt, under its jurisdiction, helped prevent organisers from holding more number of bullfights, and dhirio lovers from assembling at the venues. Fallow paddy fields are generally used to organise bullfights. Though Colva police had booked a number of cases against several people over the last few days for organising the banned animal sport, sources said that the “bailable” nature of the offence, and the fact that a paltry Rs 50 is the maximum amount of fine liable to be paid in case the accused is proved guilty, fails to deter people from committing the crime in pursuit of their passion for the animal sport. Political patronage enjoyed by bullfights worsens the situation. A police inspector of Colva who had cracked down on bullfights a few years ago, and had booked cases against organisers including against those close to politicians, had written to his higher ups stressing on the need for tranquiliser guns and an accompanying vet with a view to immobilising the bulls and impounding them. While his requisition was not acted upon, he was soon transferred from Colva, a pointer to the political clout enjoyed by dhirio organisers. Bullfights are banned by an order passed by the Goa bench of the Bombay high court in 1997, which was also later upheld by the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dhirio-organisers-hoodwink-police-conduct-bullfights/articleshow/85338631.cms||---

At least five new flights have begun operations at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad in past 10 days. The new flights include those to Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Indore and Kolhapur. Yet another flight from Goa to Ahmedabad has also been launched recently, according to sources. An Ahmedabad-Pune flight is also expected to start in the days to come. “New destinations are being added as the passenger footfalls are gradually beginning to increase at the city airport. The uptakes for domestic travel have surged significantly since July as the number of Covid-19 cases has begun to recede. The trend is seen since July itself,” said a well-placed source at the city airport. Airport sources confirmed that in past one month, the number of passenger footfalls went up by 40% at the city airport. “Against an estimated movement of some 10,000 passengers every single day at the SVPI airport in May, the footfalls have increased up to 14,000 passengers since July. Flights operating out of the city airport to various destinations are running fairly full,” the source further said. Besides domestic movements, the uptakes for international flight movements has also shown a significant surge. “As UAE and other middle-eastern countries opened up for transiting passengers flights moving towards gulf countries have witnessed greater uptakes. At present, a majority of international passengers in Gulf-bound flights are students who are transiting from these countries to the US, Canada or other European countries for higher education,” said an airport source. Other passengers comprise resident visa holders of Dubai and other middle-eastern countries as well as those headed to Europe or the US. Sources said that if restrictions are lifted, the direct flight connecting Ahmedabad and London also may resume.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/five-new-flights-start-ops-from-abad/articleshow/85338410.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Mumbai||Independence Day triggers nostalgia for I-Rock, the ‘Woodstock of India’||A little before the stroke of midnight every Independence Day eve in the 80s and 90s, priests residing in a South Mumbai college awoke to what an Azad Maidan cop liked to call the "devil's music". Shrieking guitars, throbbing drums, swearing vocalists and strange herbs would saturate the heady air at Dhobi Talao's Rang Bhavan annually on August 15 and 16 as thousands of teen metalheads and grey-haired admen converged on Independence-Rock, the iconic rock festival that was often dubbed the 'Woodstock of India'. Organized by diehard rock-and-roll fan Farhad Wadia--whose six-foot-tall Obelix-like frame would scare away ticketless fans trying to climb the boundary wall of Rang Bhavan for a glimpse of their favourite bands--the event, that was born in the 1980s, offered an aspirational stage to fledgling campus rock bands for well over two decades. Days before its preceding talent contest--where amateur bands would vie for a chance to perform with popular bands ranging from Rock Machine (now Indus Creed) and Pentagram (which gave Bollywood Vishal Dadlani) to Parikrama and Down Sterling (the band in which a certain AR Rehman started as a keyboardist)---several unsolicited cassettes from exposure-starved canteen bands would land up at the homes of organizers. "Many times, we were offered money by bands who wanted to perform at I-Rock," recalls Wadia's friend and "partner in crime" Joji George, whose own college band 'Short Circuit’ was invited to play at the show once. "It was like getting invited to play at Wembley," says George, who misses the cultish annual surge of adrenaline that came from sticking posters all over the city until 3 am, picking bands, haggling with venue suppliers, watching Farhad's dad man the busy ticket counter, seeing security guards lift up drunk audience members who had passed out after the event and the unfailing post-gig dinners at Delhi Darbar in the red light district. "That was the only restaurant which was open at 2 am," he says. What embellished I-Rock's anti-establishment aura even as Indipop and colas confluenced in the backdrop of the fizzy liberalisation era, were the show's many run-ins with the culture police. "I find it rather odd that Independence Day, which marks our liberation from the west, is celebrated with western music," then minister of cultural affairs Pramod Navalkar had said. Navalkar had formed a Stage Performance Scrutiny Board to ensure that public performances were "devoid of vulgarity". Wadia would have to submit the lyrics of songs for vetting before every show and enlist top cops in his mission to ensure the show went on. In 2003, I-Rock was allowed to be staged after a band called Moist Vagina changed its name to Stigmata. Organisers of I-Rock had almost come to expect to be held to ransom by "unscrupulous" men who would book the venue in advance and sell it to them at a higher price. In the late 90s, with Indipop and mainstream Bollywood colonizing musical charts, one music channel reportedly refused to cover the festival saying it would "rather cover the elections than a rock concert". Early obituaries of rock music were written when prominent band members moved abroad.  Later, noise pollution concerns played spoilsport. On various occasions, Wadia had to limit the number of musical instruments and shorten timings. Even as the six-foot-tall organiser chafed at the campaign against rock music in Rang Bhavan in 2004, a reader asked in a letter to this paper: "would Wadia endure music played at such ear-splitting volume near his house, if it was not rock music but a type of music he abhorred?" After Rang Bhavan was declared a silence zone, I-Rock limped on in the western suburbs. "When we moved to Andheri Sports Complex, sustaining the event through sponsorship became a huge issue," says George, recalling having to build a stage here unlike Rang Bhavan which offered a readymade stage. "Costs spiralled and we couldn't raise ticket prices, making it non-sustainable," says George. I-Rock saw its last show in 2012. Then, the curtains dropped and the metalheads went their separate ways. Does he miss Rang Bhavan? "Can you ever forget your first cigarette?" says George.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-independence-day-triggers-nostalgia-for-i-rock-the-woodstock-of-india/articleshow/85338454.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

The timetables belong to East Indian Railway and Eastern Railway for the years 1869, 1891, 1903, 1906, 1917 and 1948. These years were chosen because of their historic significance and political backdrop. For instance, the oldest timetable of East Indian Railway was available in 1869, the one published in 1891 was after promulgation of Indian Railways Act, in 1906 the Railway Board was formed, 1917 was the year when East Indian Railway and Eastern Railway were bifurcated and the first timetable was published in 1948 after India’s Independence. Officials said Eastern Railway (ER) has 114 old timetables of heritage value. They have turned brittle over the passage of time. In 2019, the zone took expert advice for their restoration. On Friday, celebrating the advent of India’s 75th Independence and 167th anniversary of running eastern India’s first train, ER general manager Arun Arora dedicated the digitized timetables to the customers and railway men of East Indian Railway and Eastern Railway. “Worldwide, railway timetables have a fascinating history since their advent in England in 1839. East Indian Railway, which ran the first train in eastern India on 15th August 1854 from Howrah to Hooghly, would publish timetables featuring a host of information, including train routes, stoppages, passenger fares, amenity at stations and tourist information,” said ER spokesperson Ekalabya Chakraborty. The timetables will now serve as testimony of Indian Railways' glorious past, he said. Although rail services in India were initially proposed in the 1830s, historians cite 16th April 1853 as the beginning of India’s passenger rail revolution. On this date, the country’s first passenger train set off on a 34km journey between Bombay’s Bori Bunder station and Thane. The rake consisted of 14 cars being hauled by three steam locomotives. It carried 400 passengers. The line was built through an alliance between the Great Indian Peninsular Railway (GIPR) – incorporated in 1849 – and the East India Company, which at that point ruled large swathes in India. Its success spurred subsequent launches of railways in Eastern India (1854) and South India (1856). Following the opening of the Calcutta-Delhi line in 1864 and the Allahabad-Jabalpur line in 1867, these lines were linked with the GIPR to create a 4,000-mile network spanning the width of India. This early era of passenger travel was primarily funded by private companies under a guarantee system created by the British Parliament, which ensured they would receive a certain rate of interest on their capital investment. Eight railway companies were established between 1855 and 1860, including Eastern India Railway, Great India Peninsula Company, Madras Railway, Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rail-time-table-digitized/articleshow/85336518.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Lucknow||Lucknow turning into city of dreams for homebuyers||LUCKNOW: Until three decades ago, a plot of land was probably the one asset most people saw as a life goal. Apart from being their “permanent address” after construction of a house, it was an investment and a security for their future generations. The dream was guided by the factors of budget and location—in that order—for most middle-income families. Indiranagar, Aliganj, Alambagh and Mahanagar were among the sought after residential colonies. Plot sizes ranged from 2,000 sqft to 8,000 sqft and gardens adorned the frontage of houses. The basics of good road, effective drainage and proximity to public transport used to be primary concerns. To have a park in front of the house meant you were lucky! As the city grew, more residential colonies started to develop and planned housing became affordable in other localities. With population came the real estate boom and the ‘apartment culture’ seamlessly took over the city. With young professionals settling in the city, it wasn’t a “big house” that they wanted but a manageable and safe one. “Convenience of a ready-made house, security, affordability, independence and amenities such as sports for children and safe spaces for the elderly gave a boost to community living over single-dwelling,” said Khalid Masood, managing director of Shalimar Corp Ltd. With that came the “add-ons” which had no limit, said Ashish Singh, a legal expert in property matters. “Now, apartments offer personal theatres, swimming pools, cafes and a shopping complex all within a minute’s distance from your house,” he said. While Lucknow Development Authority remains a trusted developer, many private players have made a name for themselves with quality construction. Societies have come up in Gomtinagar Extension or Shaheed Path, a little away from the main city, but people do not mind as distances are manageable and homes are worth the effort. In fact, the look of large open spaces, wide roads and quaint cafes often elicits the expression, “This doesn’t look like it’s in Lucknow.” It is because of these varied options which are making Lucknow the preferred choice of young professionals as well as retired couples. As a centrally located city which has excellent connectivity to Delhi, it is a wise option for home buyers. The city has very good schools, markets and health facilities to offer to residents, said Masood. “On top of that, the warmth and culture that Lucknow offers is unmatched in north India. That makes it the first choice for settlement of people from other cities too,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-turning-into-city-of-dreams-for-homebuyers/articleshow/85339228.cms||Rashi Lal

Though the talk in political circles is that the TRS may not wish to join an alliance comprising either Congress or the BJP at the national levelgiven the fact that it is fighting against the two parties in Telangana, TRS parliamentary party leader K Keshava Rao told STOI that it was too early to rule out the role of TRS in national politics. “The TRS will decide at an appropriate time. The TRS is a party which will weigh options and take decisions which would be in the larger interests of Telangana and its people,” he said. The TRS did not attend the breakfast meeting convened by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi recently to chalk out opposition plans on cornering the BJP government on Pegasus phone hacking scam, anti-farmer laws and rising fuel prices. “There is no need to link this meeting with future plans of formation of a federal front to take on the BJP in the 2024 Parliament elections. We did not get an invite and as such we did not attend it,” said Keshava Rao. However, TRS MP G Ranjith Reddy had recently said that how can one expect their party to attend the meeting when Congress was part of it. Given the two different statements by two TRS MPs, political analysts said it was not at all surprising. “When CM KCR had set out for the formation of a front comprising anti-Congress and anti-BJP parties, the political situation in Telangana was different. While BJP was not a threat and Congress was a weak opposition. But now the BJP is a bigger threat than Congress in Telangana for the ruling party. As a result, it perfectly suits the TRS to wait and watch the developments before taking a leap in national politics,” said a senior political observer. KCR had mooted the idea of a federal front before the general elections in 2019. He flew from one state to another to discuss the idea with regional satraps like MK Stalin of DMK, Banerjee, HD Deve Gowda of the JD(S) and Naveen Patnaik of the BJD. However, the proposed front could not take off.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Mapping of villages using advanced drone technology soon||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state has kickstarted the ambitious survey of villages abadi and mapping with improvised technology in village areas (SVAMITVA scheme) project launched by the Centre, that intends to provide an integrated property validation solution for properties in rural areas using advanced drone survey technology. As per the order issued by the revenue department in this regard, the state government has formed the state steering committee, district monitoring and review committee, taluk-level committee and panchayat and urban local monitoring committees, as part of implementing the scheme in the state. The additional chief secretary (revenue), district collector, tahsildar and the panchayat president or the municipal chairperson, will be the chairman of the four committees at the four levels, respectively, in the state. There are 1,670 villages in the state. The accurate survey using the drone technology as a result of which the village household owners will receive the ‘record of rights’ of their properties as property cards, would enable them to use their property as a financial asset for taking loans and other financial benefits from the banks. The project that is covering all villages across the country, is being implemented as a joint initiative between Survey of India, national informatics centre, taxes department, revenue department and the survey and land records department. The survey director will be the nodal officer for the project in the state. The initiative is expected to ease the determination of property tax for the plots by the local bodies, ease the custody and maintenance of public and government land parcels and reduce property-related disputes. Parallel to the survey using drones, the state government have been asked to undertake other activities like engagement with banks to ensure that the property cards are recognized by them, ensuring that the property cards are linked to the state’s land records, ensure that the registration department allow creation of registered mortgage and sale of such land, create and geotag the spatial record of the property with the property cards, etc. The scheme that was launched at the national level last year, has till now generated property cards for 7,376 villages across seven states, including Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. Also, the drone survey has been completed in 54,023 villages across the country under the scheme. Once the drone survey is completed and the digital maps generated, the respective state governments would be responsible for future update of the property and map data. The update frequency of re-survey would also be decided by the respective state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mapping-of-villages-using-advanced-drone-tech-soon/articleshow/85336557.cms||KP Saikiran

On Saturday, 54 out of 75 women convicts were released and invited to Raj Bhawan where Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel gave them gifts. The governor told the women convicts to take a pledge not to commit any crime in future. She also asked them to forget their past and avoid being revengeful which is possible only when they decide to change their thinking. “Try to move forward by doing your work and get rid of wrong thoughts. Adopt skills that you have mastered during your sentence in prison to move forward in life and be self-reliant,” the governor told the convicts. The convicts have been released following the Uttar Pradesh government’s policy of August 2018, ratified under Article 161 of the Constitution, empowering the governor to grant the pardon. A jail official said that the convicts, who were sentenced for life and have served 14-15 years in jail with good conduct, become eligible under this policy of the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lead-a-crime-free-life-guv-tells-women-convicts/articleshow/85339232.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: TRS leaders to meet every beneficiary in Huzurabad||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who is leaving no stone unturned to ensure TRS win in Huzurabad bypoll, has now set party leaders the target to meet every beneficiary of welfare schemes in the constituency. The mission is to get across a simple message: All welfare schemes are due to the tireless work of TRS government and not because of KCR’s friend-turned-foe Eatala Rajender. There are over one lakh beneficiaries of Rythu Bandhu, Aasara pensions, sheep and fish fingerlings distribution, Rythu Bima, Rs 1 kg rice, new pensions, ration cards and fee reimbursement in addition to the proposed Dalit Bandhu scheme in the poll-bound constituency. CM KCR has now directed his ministers, MPs, MLCs, MLAs and local leaders to meet at least two members from each beneficiary family. TRS hopes its welfare schemes would deliver the message of KCR’s magnanimity that the state not only continued with sops despite Covid hitting revenue but also rolled out a new plan in Dalit Bandhu. There is a promise to start more welfare schemes if TRS wins. Finance minister T Harish Rao is also leaving no opportunity to explain to the people in the constituency that despite a loss of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore to the state due to the pandemic, the CM has given clear instructions to continue all welfare schemes. Ministers Gangula Kamalakar and Koppula Eshwar, who are mostly camping in the constituency, have repeatedly reminded voters that schemes would continue at all costs while countering BJP claims that the state would stop them if people voted for Eatala. There is also a proposal to send SMS, letters and pamphlets to every voter on behalf of CM KCR seeking their support. A similar strategy was adopted even in Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll where TRS’ young leader Nomula Bhagat defeated Congress veteran K Jana Reddy. The TRS has fielded another young leader in Gellu Srinivas Yadav for the Huzurabad bypoll against the formidable Eatala Rajender of the BJP. Both of them are “udyama nayakulu” who participated in statehood agitation. The mission is to get across the message that all welfare schemes are due to the tireless work of TRS government and not because of KCR’s friend-turned-foe Eatala||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-leaders-to-meet-every-beneficiary-in-huzurabad/articleshow/85336509.cms||Roushan Ali

The police team found it tough to bring the accused Akash Dodhe (19) to the police station as he overpowered them after consuming narcotic substances, officials claimed. The stolen phone has been recovered. The woman, Julie Jaiswal (24), had boarded the Virar-bound train from Borivli to go to Vasai. With data of calls received on the stolen phone and from CCTV footage, the police tracked down Dodhe from Vasai on Friday. “He does not have any record of crime,” said DCP Pradeep Chavan. Jaiswal had boarded the train at around 8am. In the complaint, she said, “I was alone in the ladies compartment when the youngster entered just as the train moved from the platform. He caught me by my neck, touched my face, temple, earlobe before punching me on the chest and snatched the cellphone and then jumped off from the moving train.” Jaiswal, who works as a domestic help, was left in shock after the incident. She managed to go to the police station and lodge a complaint. Dodhe hails from Harihareshwar in Ratnagiri district and does odd jobs for al iving. “He pushed and overpowered the police team when they tried to nab him. He was not ready to accompany the cops,” said a police officer. Dodhe is in custody for causing hurt while committing robbery and criminal intimidation.

---||Pune||Darkness reigns on many stretches of Pune's Baner Road as street lights go kaput||PUNE: Street lights on several stretches of Baner Road are on the blink, posing a danger bikers and cyclists, especially on dark, rainy nights. The problem has spread to several upmarket locales in the Baner area, verified by a TOI visit on Saturday — hundreds of street lights are either missing entirely or lack light bulbs. There are no street lights on the Mhalunge-Mann Hi-Tech City Road In fact, some roads connecting main roads or even those leading to service roads of NH-48 (Bengaluru highway) are covered in darkness, making it very dangerous for pedestrians. Angad Ghule, a resident of Baner, said a kilometre-long stretch starting at University Chowk on Baner Road has no street lights. “I have even seen a person fall from his bike at this junction as he couldn’t judge the turn during heavy rainfall in to absence of street lights. Then there is an area near Joshi Vadewale, between Baner Road and Balewadi Phata, which is again utterly dark at night. These areas have had no street lights for the past many months, but considering the rains, it becomes even more dangerous at night,” Ghule said. Rajeev Shah, another resident, said the area from Dasara Chowk to Mitcon is another such stretch. “The street lights have been non-functional here for over six months now. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) staff showed up when we complained about it on the app, but we were told that the area comes under the Smart Cities Mission, so they left without repairing it. This dispute in jurisdiction is also affecting quick repairs of street lights,” said Shah, who added that the lights were repaired once they took up the issue with Smart City officials. Amey Karambelkar, also a resident, said the area near Platinum society, between Baner Road and Murkute Garden road, suffers from the same problem. “This area is extremely accident-prone as there is a dispute over land acquisition between PMC and the landowners, due to which condition of the road is poor. This, and a lack of street lights, is a perfect recipe for road accidents,” said Karambelkar. Smart City officials told TOI that the area was in their ambit, but the poles were installed by PMC back when it had jurisdiction. The officials said PMC was responsible for maintenance, a suggested dismissed by civic officials, who passed the buck back to Smart City officials. A visit showed that street lights were not working between University Chowk and the office of the Pune rural police. Bus stops too were in darkness, as was the stretch between Baner-Pashan Link Road Chowk and Amar Arma Genesis. Similar is the case with the Baner-Balewadi Road stretch from Fatcook restaurant to the NCP office, and portions till Bharati Vidyapeeth School. While the list goes on, PMC officials blamed “various problems beyond their control” for the issue. “Whenever we get a complaint, we immediately deploy a staffer to check and get the light repaired, if it comes under our department. However, in Pashan, street lights are off because roadsides were dug up for a new footpath. Similarly, on the link road, there are street lights on only one side because there are high tension cables on the other. Similarly, unplanned digging of roads and footpaths is another problem ” a senior PMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/darkness-reigns-on-many-stretches-of-baner-road-as-street-lights-go-kaput/articleshow/85336522.cms||Ardhra Nair

Nodal head of the mission, Laxmi Singh (IPS), said the aim of the third phase is to provide police service at the doorstep of every woman, including those living rural areas. She said for the first time women cops are being assigned beat duties like their male counterparts. “In the system we will include 3 or 4 villages and make it a beat for women constables/head constables. They will have to visit the area twice weekly and note the problems being faced by women and then resolve them with the help of senior officers. The women cops will also spread awareness about the government schemes which benefit women,” said Singh. “Now with responsibility of beat, women constables will feel empowered like their male counterparts,” Singh said. Singh said Mission Shakti ‘kakshas’ (rooms) are being opened in Panchayat Bhawans where women cops will meet survivors of heinous crimes of the past three years and find out whether they have got justice. If the accused are absconding then women cops will inform senior officers to enure the arrest of the accused at the earliest. Another step taken under Mission Shakti is weekly care of single mothers and elderly by Women help desks at police stations, both in urban and rural pockets. She said on the instructions of CM, women cops will also coordinate with other government agencies to rehabilitate women/men who are mentally deranged and roam at bus and railway stations, and markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mission-shakti-3-0-focus-on-women-safety-in-rural-parts/articleshow/85339236.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

Since BEG’s Training Battalion (TB2) area and accommodation complexes share boundaries with the firm, we have urged the forest department to take necessary measures,” a senior Army officer told TOI. Establishments such as the General Reserve Engineering Force centre — which trains personnel of the Border Roads Organisation — BEG’s field training and the College of Military Engineering are located in and around Dighi. “All these establishments are surrounded by trees and open areas, and we don’t know about the leopard’s route,” said the officer. Deputy conservator of forest R Patil confirmed the presence of a leopard in Dighi. “The CCTV footage of the private firm captured the image of the animal. We are ascertaining its route as it was spotted in this area for the first time,” Patil told TOI. Patil said the forest department has intensified night patrolling in the areas. “We have also installed trap cameras at different locations to watch the leopard’s movement. Our first response team has been patrolling the area for the past few weeks but has not seen any sign of the animal so far. Some residents sent us images of pugmarks, but we confirmed those were of dogs,” he said. Meanwhile, citizens of Bhopkhel village and Dighi asked the forest department to install cages to trap the leopard. Bhopkhel resident Santosh Bhandare said citizens in Gangeshnagar and the vicinity were afraid of stepping out at night. “People have also stopped going for evening walks,” said Sachin Vatane, another Bhopkhel resident. A senior forest official said installing cages was not permitted immediately. “Standard operating procedure has to be followed. In this case, there has been no attack on humans and the leopard has not entered residential pockets. We are, however, pursuing the matter with senior officials in Nagpur.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/leopard-spotted-near-beg-ground-in-dighi/articleshow/85336543.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Hyderabad||Huzurabad bypoll: K Chandrasekhar Rao & surprises go hand in hand||HYDERABAD: Will TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao’s gambit of fielding a TRS student wing leader in Huzurabad to take on his once trusted lieutenant and four-time MLA Eatala Rajender pay off? In fact, KCR sprang a surprise by announcing the party candidate much before the Election Commission sounded the poll bugle in Huzurabad. KCR announced Gellu Srinivas Yadav as TRS candidate for Huzurabad when the bypoll schedule has not been announced yet. Usually, KCR waits till the last minute before announcing party candidate’s name. In the by-elections held for Nagarjuna Sagar, KCR announced the party candidate’s name after the nomination process began. In Dubbak by-elections, the party candidate was announced after the poll notification. But, KCR took everybody by surprise by not only making an announcement but also the choice of the candidate. The opposition thought the TRS will field a senior candidate to cross swords with Eatala. Political analysts said KCR’s surprise moves have paid off earlier — whether it was advancing the assembly polls in 2018 or going for GHMC polls immediately after the debacle in Dubbak bypoll or MLC polls. When KCR chose to first implement Dalit Bandhu scheme from Huzurabad assembly constituency as a pilot project, everybody thought the pink party was going to field a Dalit to fight against Eatala. There was speculation that the party could field either L Ramana or P Kaushik Reddy but KCR opted for Yadav. “KCR is banking more on the welfare schemes than the candidate. Dalit Bandhu was announced mainly to capture Dalit votes and sheep rearing scheme for BC voters in the upcoming bypolls. Both the schemes will definitely help the party’s prospects in the elections. Srinivas Yadav belongs to Yadav community. These two castes constitute about 80% of the voters in the assembly segment,” a political analyst said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-surprises-go-hand-in-hand/articleshow/85336520.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Pune||Pune: Race heats up for seats in top colleges & popular courses||PUNE: Junior college principals are anticipating a tough competition among students for contemporary courses including arts, science and commerce apart from a cut throat contest in popular colleges in the city as a result of higher pass percentages and improved number of students falling in 95% and above category. Colleges have also demanded additional seats on an unaided basis to overcome the high demand of applications. The FYJC admissions are set to begin from Monday. Principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, said, “We have to turn away some talented set of students just because there is a difference of one or two marks. Instead, the education office should give us extra seats which we will run on our own responsibility on an unaided basis. The intake will increase and we will ease competition to some extent.” Colleges in the city have been demanding extra divisions for a very long time,but there has been no have not been sanctioned. The Pune district recorded a pass percentage of 99.95 % this year. Former principal of the St Mira’s College, Gulshan Gidwani, said that, “I would say the education department must seriously think of increasing the intake of every top college by almost 20% to resolve the college popularity issue in comparison to the scores of SSC students. There is going to be blended learning anyway for some more time and a few more months so it would make sense to increase the capacity in the colleges.” The trend seen in the admissions to FYJC, last year had arts faculty recording a higher cut-off than science faculty in almost all top rung and popular junior colleges in the city. Fergusson College had recorded the highest cut-off of 97.40% for Arts English medium while their science faculty cut-off was registered at 97%. The changed evaluation pattern mainly riding on internal assessments and performance in Std IX had led to a record success rate in SSC results this year as 99.95 % students passed the exam. The state government had cancelled offline examination due to the pandemic and the performance of students in Std IX and X was considered assessment of students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/race-heats-up-for-seats-in-top-colleges-popular-courses/articleshow/85336521.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The KRMB had sought a detailed project report on the project. The three-member committee visited the site on August 11. However, the team said two batching plants were installed at the site. Coarse and fine granular materials and sand were stacked at the batching plants, the members said in their report. The team members said due to submergence of the approach channel, they could not ascertain the extent of excavation undertaken in the approach channel. However, it was observed that a major portion of the forebay with the full length of 237 metres and width had been excavated to varying depths. A delivery cistern had also been dug up. “It is observed that 10 tunnels out of the total 12 have been excavated for erection of a 5 metre diameter pipeline (delivery main). The excavation of tunnels for a short length of 35-50 metres has been carried out,” the report said. The KRMB team visited the RLIS site following the directions of National Green Tribunal, Chennai, and submitted its report to the NGT. The NGT had ordered the site inspection by KRMB a few months ago after Gavinolla Srinivas, a resident of Narayanpet, filed a complaint with the tribunal questioning the validity of RLIS taken up by the AP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/works-in-excess-being-taken-up-at-rlis-says-krmb-team/articleshow/85336523.cms||Koride Mahesh

His friends and family have alleged that Suresh died following harassment and torture at the hands of a group of people who were reportedly indulging in moral policing. Vengara police have registered a case of unnatural death under Section 174 CrPC. Police said that the man was found hanging in his room on Saturday morning and he was suspected to have died in the early hours. “There are reports about altercations happening in connection with the school where he was working. However, we haven’t got a complaint in this regard and hence a case has not been registered. We have now registered a case of unnatural death and a probe is on,” said an official with Vengara police. Meanwhile, a friend of the deceased said that the man was assaulted by a group of people who came to his house on Thursday. “He was a UP school teacher and used to take online classes. The attack happened over him having an online chat with a student’s mother. On Thursday, these people came to his house and assaulted him in front of his family. He was dragged onto the vehicle and later thrashed. Again, on Friday he was taken away in the guise of mediation to solve the issue and was thrashed at a house. He had sustained severe injuries in the assault,” said a friend of Suresh. He added that the attack happened only a day before and no complaint was filed yet. “He was a very creative person and a good artist. He was the art director of movies like Udalaazham. It seems like he died after 2pm. The continuous attacks in the past two days seem to have made him take the extreme step,” he said, adding that a campaign has been launched demanding the arrest of the attackers. Suicides are preventable and help is just a phone call away. Those in distress can call Maitri at 0484-2540530, Disha at 1056 or Emergency Medical Services at 0471- 2552056.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/man-found-dead-kin-friends-allege-moral-policing/articleshow/85336612.cms||---

Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy and senior leaders N Uttam Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Ali Shabbir among others participated. Revanth said a large section of Muslim community is economically backward than the Scheduled Castes. It was the previous Congress government in the combined state that provided 4% reservations to Muslims.

---||Pune||Greener City, Changing City & Joy Of Living||When India began its tryst with destiny on August 15, 1947, homes in Pune did not have electricity, radio or even clocks. There was no public transport. But there was simplicity. Telephones were rare and unaffordable then. Roads were poor. Foodgrain and clothes had to be bought from ration shops. People had to wait for the wedding season if they desired to relish jalebis. Blood samples had to be sent to Mumbai for tests. But there was the joy of living. The famous Parvati hill was “outside the city limits” in 1947. There was nothing beyond Erandwane. The now-bustling Kothrud did not exist! There was tranquility. Seventy-four years after independence, Pune and Puneites have prospered and changed almost in all aspects, barring the pothole-riddled roads and the lack of efficient public transport. There have been other constants too — the desirable ones — like the quality of education, research institutes, excellence in art, music, culture and theatre. Now there is nothing that is not available in Pune. The queen of Deccan is not just an education hub, it is an information technology and industrial centre too. History scholar Mandar Lavate says life in Pune was difficult in 1947 because of the after-effects of World War II. “Pune was very small. A majority of Puneites lived in wadas as tenants. The only mode of transport was the tonga. Bicycles came to Pune only after 1950. Very few families had radio sets, for which a licence was required then. TV came only after 1970. Puneites referred to clocks installed at four-five public places like the S P College to check the time, which incidentally never matched!” he said. Pune now has a thriving construction industry, rapidly expanding even in the fringes and every type of real estate is on offer — from affordable to luxury. But this was not the case in the 1970s. “When I was transferred to Pune in 1977, getting a house was most difficult and there were no constructions like today. I rented a bungalow in Bibvewadi, which was like a jungle because there was nothing much beyond Swargate. There was no municipal water supply and we used to get water from the Nanasaheb Peshwa era water channels coming from the Katraj lake. In monsoon, we used to put buckets on the roof to collect rainwater,” recalled Vasant Kalpande, former director of education. Lavate said Pune’s first apartment, “Bendre Blocks”, was built only in 1980 at Nagnath Paar near Laxmi Road. Foodies would find it difficult to digest that the city which now serves practically every cuisine — authentic or their Indian ‘tadka marke versions’ — did not offer much choice earlier, said Kalpande. “Eating out meant having a masala dosa. It was much later that Mona Foods came up in Camp and introduced us to chhole-bhature,” he said. Kalpande said Pune’s profile, eating habits and culture had changed over the past 74 years but some things remained unchanged — the helpful nature of people, safety, abundance of opportunities and the openness to assimilate all cultures and people. “I never found Pune orthodox. It was only in Pune, not even in Delhi, that I saw so many women first riding cycles and two-wheelers or driving cars. Nobody is afraid to commute even in late night hours,” he said. Social worker Anand Saraf feels the city changed rapidly after the 1961 Panshet flood. “The wada culture marked by warmth, generosity and close bonding eroded rapidly. I miss that in the rich and prosperous Pune of today. Now every field — right from education, politics, social work, sports — is dominated by money and commerce. But Pune’s spirit to lead from the front when it comes to social transformation, freedom struggle, pursuit of intellect and easy acceptance of change is intact,” he said. Lavate felt Pune has become greener too — a view endorsed by amateur botanist Shrikant Ingalhalikar. “I have a photo taken in 1950, where the campus of S P College did not have a single tree. Now, there are almost 900,” said Lavate. Pune and Puneites might continue to be the butt of many jokes, but the rapidly diminishing tribe of true blue Puneites — born and brought up in this charming city — maintain that it is just the case of “neighbours’ envy, owners’ pride” syndrome.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/greener-city-changing-city-joy-of-living/articleshow/85336558.cms||Manjiri Damle
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh cops bag 9 gallantry medals for killing goons||Lucknow: The UP Police will be decorated with nine gallantry medals on Independence Day this year. Among the prominent awardees is SP, Jaunpur, Ajay Sahni, who, during his stint as SSP, Meerut, led the encounter of Shiv Shakti Naidu, kingpin of Delhi’s notorious Naidu gang, involved in Rs 8 crore heist, carrying Rs 1 lakh cash reward. Several cases are registered against him in Delhi, UP, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan. In Delhi alone, he is wanted in connection with over 12 cases. On February 18, 2020, Naidu was killed in encounter in Kankerkhera area of Meerut. Naidu shot to infamy following Rs 8 crore heist in Lajpat Nagar on January 28, 2014. Along with Sahni, inspector Bijendra Pal Rana was also awarded a PMG in the case.

---||Pune||Pune: Trio assault car driver over minor accident in Yeolewadi||PUNE: A car driver suffered serious injuries to his head, ears and knee after three men brutally attacked him with stone over a road rage dispute at Yeolewadi in Kondhwa on August 12. The driver, Ram Kumbhar (27) from Chinchwad, registered an FIR related to the incident with the Kondhwa police the next day. Kumbhar said, “I picked up a client from Hinjewadi and dropped him at Yeolewadi. I switched on my indicator while taking a right turn, when the three men riding triple seat on a motorcycle came from the opposite side and suddenly applied brakes.” He said, “The bike skidded, and the trio fell on the road near Nirman Square apartment. The car and the bike did not collide because there was a gap of around 40m. The suspects held me responsible for the incident.” The driver said, “The suspects pulled me out of the car and hit me with stones on my back, head and other bodily parts around 12.45pm. When I sought reasons for attacking me, they tore my clothes, abused me and threatened me with dire consequences. The passers-by did not come to my rescue.” Kumbhar said, “The trio were communicating with each other in Marathi, but they did not allow me to speak. They snatched my cellphone and damaged if after I clicked their photographs. They robbed my wristwatch, gold ring and Rs 2,500, and sped away.” He said, “I reached the Khadi Machine police chowky with difficulty, but the police referred me to the Sassoon hospital for treatment. After I was discharged from the hospital, I visited the chowky and registered the complaint against the suspects. But the police did not mention details of the articles stolen in the FIR for reasons best known to them. The road rage incident had deep impact on my mind and I don’t feel like visiting Yeolewadi again.” Inspector (crime) Shabbir Sayyed from the Kondhwa police said on Saturday, “This is a case related to road rage and not robbery. Kumbhar did not share details of the articles stolen at the time of recording his complaint. In such cases, articles often get lost in scuffle between two parties. If investigation establishes that his articles were robbed, we shall invoke robbery charges.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/trio-assault-car-driver-over-minor-accident-in-yeolewadi/articleshow/85336571.cms||---

Addressing a press conference along with civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar on Saturday, he said the state government had approved Rs 2,000 crore budget for the scheme this year which would benefit 20,000 families. “This scheme (Dalit Bandhu) is not election sop.

Solar power project companies being set up in various parts of Jaisalmer district are encroaching upon pasture lands and fields, irking the locals. Meanwhile, BJP leaders supporting the villagers, submitted a memorandum to ADM Hari Singh Mena and demanded action against the company. The protesting villagers said the private solar company is doing injustice with poor farmers by forcibly encroaching the ‘khatedari’ land. The villagers alleged that through wrong measurement at khasra no.106 and 107, the tanks, fencing etc made in the ‘khatedari’ land of Jagmalram, Dalaram, Durgaram, Jhabraram and Devaram were damaged and the company forcibly possessed the land and started work there. The villagers alleged that when the women working in the fields protested, the company officers misbehaved with the women and started work there by scaring them. The villagers protested along with the BJP on the matter. BJP district president Chandra Prakash Sharda said that the private company officers were in connivance with local tehsil administration and that police tried to forcibly possess the ‘khatedari’ land of one Chutraram and Gumanaram and others at khasra no. 106 and 107.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/villagers-protest-encroachment-of-farmers-land-by-solar-company/articleshow/85336565.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||At 3,272, Telangana’s ventilator numbers up six-fold in a year||HYDERABAD: Telangana has the sixth highest number of ventilator beds among 37 states and Union territories in the country. Telangana has 3,272 ventilators, Maharashtra with 1,37,238 has the highest number, while the tiny Lakshadweep with 10 has the lowest, according to latest details put out by the Union government. With ICU beds too, Telangana is at the sixth position, as per the latest details on beds and ventilators availability revealed in a Rajya Sabha reply by Union health ministry. As compared to a similar answer in the Rajya Sabha earlier in 2020, the number of ventilators in Telangana has increased from 518 in September 2020 to 3,272 now, a six-fold jump. The jump in numbers is considerable when compared to many other states as Telangana went from the 15th position to 6th now. Currently, other states which have a high number of ventilators are Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. While the increase in ventilator to the current strength is remarkable, the improvement is largely on the equipment side only, say experts. “Although there is tremendous improvement on the equipment front and the numbers are enough to deal with future requirement in case of another wave, when we talk of ventilators and oxygen beds, self-sufficiency of oxygen production is equally important. Unless that happens, these will not be fully functional. The Centre had sanctioned 56 PSA oxygen plants, but so far only nine have been commissioned,” Dr Kiran Madhala, in-charge head, department of critical care, Nizamabad Medical College, said. Also, maintenance of these equipment is another important issue point out insiders. “During the peak of the first and second waves, we found many crucial equipment not functioning due to lack of maintenance. In most government hospitals, maintenance contracts are routinely flouted either for want of payment or because of shoddy work by contractors. Also, favouritism to hire contractors has left us in the lurch during the peak,” a senior doctor from the Gandhi hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/at-3272-states-ventilator-numbers-up-six-fold-in-a-yr/articleshow/85336578.cms||Amrita Didyala

The move has come after discussions with the vice-chancellor of SPPU and other representatives on Saturday. A one-member committee will look into the academic and infrastructural up-gradation and other aspects of the institute before the report is submitted to the ministry. “There are also legal matters regarding the land where the institute stands.

College reopening Reiterating his statement on college reopening, Samant said that talks are underway between vice-chancellors of various universities, joint directors and district collectors regarding feasibility of reopening. A report will be submitted for approval by the disaster management cell. Fergusson College fee issue After some students complained about an increase in fees in third-year undergraduate courses at Fergusson College, Samant said that he has ordered the joint director of higher education to look into the matter. However, Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal of Fergusson College, said, “In 2019, all course fees were revised and the batch that joined paid the revised fee. Now that, the same batch is entering its final year, the revised fee has been applied.

The labour department had assured the court of preparing the draft for the same and submitting it to the state government. The department will also take private stakeholders into confidence before finalising the draft. Hemant Bhai Goyal, national vice-president, Divyang Adhikar Mahansangh had filed a petition in this regard in the court for specially abled persons. “This is a step in the right direction but unless guidelines are prepared, this direction is not going to bring positive results,” he said.“When 5% reservation can be given to PwDs in private sector jobs in Bihar, then why not in Rajasthan? There are very limited opportunities in government jobs. Also, PwDs face a lot of difficulties in finding a government job. In Rajasthan, 5% reservation has already been given to disabled persons in the training schemes of skill development and Rajeevika. Hence, 5% reservation in private jobs should also be ensured for PwDs in the state,” Goyal had earlier argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/advise-private-employers-to-give-5-quota-in-jobs-to-disabled/articleshow/85336595.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The two talented girls from UP’s Aligarh are sports shooting champions who are set to represent the country in the Junior World Cup (shotgun) championship in Kazakhstan later this month and in Junior World Championship in Peru in September. Sabeera Haris will make her international debut this year. She scored 112.63 out of 125 in the trials of trap events and improved it to 116 in the subsequent trial. Her father, Haris-ul-Islam, is a skeet shooter. Sabeera developed interest in shooting in 2018 and succeeded in making a mark for herself in three years. Areeba, a BA (second year) Fine Arts student from Aligarh University, has topped the selection trials in skeet shooting with an average of 117.13 points out of 125. “Shooting is in my family. My father Khalid Khan and brother Mohd Umair Khan are also into shooting and I used to accompany them to the shooting range. I developed interest in shooting in 2013,” said Areeba. While her father is the secretary of the District Rifle Association, her brother has participated in the Junior International Shooting Championship. “I feel blessed to be able to represent my country abroad and win medals. My family has been very supportive and helped me achieve my dreams,” she said, adding that sports persons were not getting the appreciation they deserve and should be encouraged to give their best. “I am lucky to have Olympian Mairaj Ahmed Khan as my coach,” she said. Speaking about her challenges, she said it was difficult for girls to get licences even after being international shooters. “Sometimes it’s even more difficult for us than it is for the normal public. Another thing I would like to say is that it’s very important to encourage women in sports or any other field. During the Tokyo Olympics, women have shown their true potential. “Even in my own event, women’s performance is not inferior to men, sometimes they are even better,” she said. Areeba’s coach Mairaj Ahmed Khan said, “I have been training Areeba since her childhood and she is like a family member to me. She is one of the best shooters in the country and would certainly win a medal for the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/two-up-girls-set-to-gun-for-glory-in-junior-world-shooting-championship/articleshow/85339280.cms||Fazal Khan

Full vaccination is now a must for citizens hoping to access places or services such as malls or local trains. But shortages have meant longer waits for the second jab. Many industries and businesses also have to wait until staff and customers are fully vaccinated.

Deshmukh, with an experience of 36 years, will retire from service on August 31. He said he was happy to be recognized. “Police commissioner Amitabh Gupta recommended my name for the police medal after a friend filled a form and took my signature. I am happy,” he said. Anthony, in 34 years as a police officer, solved many cases including under the Foreigners Act and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

---||Mumbai||Show compliance of NGT order on effluents, SC tells BMC civic chief||MUMBAI: The Supreme Court has directed municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal to personally file an affidavit before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to show compliance of its order for effective discharge of effluents after treating these to prevent coastal water pollution. The commissioner was directed by the NGT on July 16 to appear before it in person on September 28, but the SC waived that requirement. TimesViewMumbai’s coastline is among the most polluted in the world and the BMC must prioritise this environmental problem without the courts having to push it. The apex court has clearly warned the corporation to show what corrective action it has taken so far. The onus is on the municipal commissioner to quickly submit the compliance report.“The discharge of untreated sewage and waste from Mumbai is a matter of serious concern and needs to be attended to with the highest priority. The protection of the environment is a matter of universal concern. The municipal corporation and the municipal commissioner must respond to the notice which has been issued by the NGT. At the same time, recourse to coercive steps against the municipal commissioner is not appropriate, particularly when the official is engaged in a herculean effort to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic for protecting the residents of the metropolis,” said a bench of Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice M R Shah on Friday. The SC said reasonable time should be given to the BMC and civic chief to apprise the NGT of steps taken. The NGT principal bench in New Delhi had said in its order by a bench of of Justices A K Goel, chairperson, and Justices Sudhir Agarwal and M Sathyanarayanan, judicial members, and Dr Nagin Nanda, expert member sought the BMC civic chief’s presence while hearing a plea for execution of its October 2020 order.  It sought a compliance report from the civic chief on each of its directions on an application filed by environmental NGO Vanashakti for execution and compliance of the tribunal’s October 2020 directions to the BMC, to curb coastal pollution in Mumbai. The NGT order had said: “The municipal commissioner may explain why coercive measures under Section 25 of the NGT Act, 2010, read with Section 51 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC), may not be taken.” The BMC had gone in appeal against the NGT order and sought a stay from the SC. Its counsel Mukul Rohatgi said the NGT had passed the order without notice to the civic body. There is an appeal before the SC against the last October order, said the BMC. In part relief for the municipal commissioner, the SC order said: “Pending further orders, however, no coercive steps shall be taken against the municipal commissioner or the municipal corporation.” The SC said, if the corporation does not make a good-faith effort to place before the NGT a full schedule of steps taken and those which are proposed to be taken, “we may be constrained to vacate the stay on the direction (on coercive steps)” and added that its directions “should not be interpreted as a carte blanche to the municipal corporation to continue to violate the prescribed pollution control norms”. The SC directed the municipal commissioner to file an affidavit categorically indicating the steps which would have to be taken to comply with NGT directions, particularly regarding standards of discharge of effluents including municipal waste and sewage”. “The affidavit shall set down a concrete plan of action for the future,” directed the apex court. The NGT principal bench in New Delhi had said in its order by a bench of of Justices A K Goel, chairperson, and Justices Sudhir Agarwal and M Sathyanarayanan, judicial members, and Dr Nagin Nanda, expert member sought the BMC civic chief’s presence while hearing a plea for execution of its October 2020 order.

The members of All Cantonments Citizens Welfare Association (ACCiWA) have also decided to meet the SCOD members and bring other major issues such as civic issues, unauthorised closure of civilian roads in Secunderabad Cantonment to the SCOD’s notice. “The ministry of Defence (MoD), which is preparing CLAR-2021, is adversely affecting hundreds of owners of the OGBs in Cantonments across the country. No bungalow should be declared as OGB unless documents are forthcoming to show the grant and its terms,” Jeetender Surana, general secretary, general secretary, ACCiWA, told TOI. Being deemed municipalities, all rules as applicable to municipalities must be made applicable to Cantonment boards too, and for this, cognizance has to be taken of the 74th Constitutional amendment in this regard, said Surana. Meanwhile, SCB CEO B Ajith Reddy has invited former vice-presidents of the SCB for a discussion on various issues with the SCOD team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ogbs-to-protest-against-clar-2021-before-scod/articleshow/85336601.cms||Sunil Mungara

A team of officials from the SRA and the PMC conducted a survey in Wagholi recently. The officials said that inspections will be carried out in a phased manner in all areas merged into the PMC limits. Ashok Pawar, the local MLA, said that slum rehabilitation will be part of Wagholi’s overall development. “We are in touch with the SRA officials and the civic administration,” Pawar said. The residents of Manjari, another village merged into the city limits, are also looking forward to rehabilitation. Local resident Sunil Ghule said, “The PMC and the SRA should conduct a detailed survey and come up with a proper rehabilitation plan to prevent illegal encroachment by slumdwellers.” The officials said the surveys will help prepare a list of slum pockets and probable sites to execute the rehabilitation projects. Sanjay Tupe, a Hadapsar resident, said that the officials should initiate a process to identify slums from merged areas as “declared slums”. Rajendra Nimbalkar, head, SRA Pune, said, “We held discussions with all stakeholders, including local gram panchayat representatives, slumdwellers and others.” Nimbalkar said that similar surveys will be conducted in other merged areas as well. “We also want local representatives to come up with proposals,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-sra-survey-for-slum-rehab-in-merged-villages/articleshow/85336609.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Information of 1 lakh pensioners on Jan Soochna portal for correction||JAIPUR: In order to rectify the errors in the bank accounts of 1.03 lakh pensioners, who have been deprived of their pension, the social justice and empowerment department has uploaded the names, telephone numbers and bank details of all these beneficiaries on Jan Soochna portal.  They will also be asked by the department to update their Jan Aadhaar cards with fresh account numbers or IFSC codes so that they start getting benefits under the state’s pension schemes. “These pensioners will be informed about this by sending SMSes on their mobile numbers. Having uploaded their details on Jan Soochna portal, they will know they are required to update their Jan Aadhaar cards,” said Samit Sharma, secretary, social justice and empowerment department. The department has launched a campaign to reach out to these beneficiaries and update their bank account details on Jan Aadhaar cards. “We will also have a meeting with India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) and will request them to open accounts of those beneficiaries in post offices who are not receiving money through money orders from the department. The districts have also been directed that with Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan’s (MKSS) assistance, they should personally visit those beneficiaries whose phone numbers are not available in our records and educate them about the errors,” he added. Due to several errors in the bank accounts of 1.03 lakh pensioners, under the social justice and empowerment department, they have been deprived of their pension amount which usually gets transferred to their accounts directly through DBT (direct bank transfer). “These errors have occurred due to changes made in the bank’s ISFC codes (because of merger of banks) or their bank account numbers. Due to this, their Jan Aadhar cards have not been updated with fresh account numbers or IFSC codes. Hence, the money doesn’t get transferred to their bank accounts,” an official had earlier said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/info-of-1l-retirees-on-portal-for-correction/articleshow/85336613.cms||---

She began scouting for a same sex couple in India for doing a photo-shoot.“My friend’s family is highly educated but they still had that narrow-minded view. So, I thought of doing something to make people talk about it openly here,” said Parmar. “Surprisingly I found many same-sex couples but none of them were ready to get clicked,” Parmar, 34, told TOI. Determined to get a photo-shoot of homosexual couple, Parmar travelled all the way to the US where she could finally click one gay couple. “I came in contact with Fernando and Austin in Ohio who were married for last two years. They immediately agreed for the photo shoot. Interestingly, despite same sex marriages being legal in the USA, many people there too don’t accept it easily. Their family members were also against the relationship initially,” Parmar,. added.Parmar said that through initiative she intends to bring the topic of homosexuality out of the closet in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/lenswoman-captures-happy-moments-of-a-same-sex-couple-in-the-us/articleshow/85336623.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Pune||Key indicators show Covid vaccinations slowing in Pune||PUNE: Low vaccine supply and limited participation by private hospitals in the region have caused a slowdown in Pune district's Covid vaccination coverage, data from the state health department showed on Saturday. One indicator of the slowing pace is the widening gap between Pune and Mumbai's coverage - both cities have been vaccinating the most number of people since the Covid vaccination programme began on January 16 (the state capital is still leading). Over the last couple of months, Mumbai — with the bigger population to cover — had a lead of at least 10 lakh cumulative vaccinations over Pune. But over the past few days of August, that gap has widened to 13 to 14 lakh doses. Overall, by July 21, Mumbai had given close to 67.98 lakh doses, while Pune was at around 57.04 lakh. By August 14 (as per CoWIN), Mumbai’s total was at 82.36 lakh, but Pune’s was 68.67 lakh, which means Mumbai now leads Pune by nearly 14 lakh doses. Another indicator of the slowdown is the number of people vaccinated per session in Pune, which dropped to 108 in the start of August from at least 123 in early July. As for vaccine shortages, limited supply earlier this month had left more than 300 civic-sites unable to launch sessions. The district had received only about 90,000 doses during the first 10 days of August. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle said, "The number of private hospitals conducting Covid vaccinations is much higher in Mumbai than Pune. Of late, many small hospitals in the state capital have also joined the vaccination drive. Again, their numbers are higher than Pune's, where vaccination pace slowed down during the first 10 days of August." Deshmukh said except for two days, August 14 and August 12 — when the district received 1.2 lakh and 2.26 lakh doses, respectively — most of the month, so far, has seen limited supply. He said that there was a difference of just a few thousand cumulative doses between Pune and Mumbai till the end of May. That gap widened in June and July and expanded further in August due to bigger participation by private hospitals in Mumbai. Pune was also allocated a lower number of doses, he added. "There were also more corporate drives in Mumbai, which has more companies. The private sector then helped it get a bigger lead over Pune. But if one compares vaccinations by government centres in Pune and Mumbai, the two cities are almost equal," Deshmukh said. On Friday, nearly 50,000 people got their Covid shots from private hospital sites in Mumbai. In Pune, private sites were able to cover only 13,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/key-indicators-show-covid-vaccinations-slowing-in-pune/articleshow/85336642.cms||Neha Madaan

Ghose was born on August 15, 1872 in Kolkata. A better part of his education took place in England as his father moved there for a better future for his children. While the family wanted Ghose to join the Indian Civil Service, he is said to have disliked the idea and ensured that he did not qualify. It was during this phase that he met Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad and joined the Baroda state service in 1893. He stayed in Vadodara for 13 years during which he began working as an official in Baroda state administration, but was later made a professor and, finally, the vice principal of the Baroda College. During the agitation against the partition of Bengal in 1905, Ghose started visiting Bengal and eventually shifted there in 1906. Ghose, who used to stay in ‘Bungalow Number 10’ located right opposite the Lakdi Pul in Dandia Bazar at one point of time, has been renamed as ‘Arvind Ashram’ now as Ghose stayed there for five years. During the course of the year, the ashram will be holding a series of events beginning a meditation session on Sunday. Three plays have also been planned during the course of the year, said vice chairman of Shri Aurobindo Memorial Trust, Narendra Patel. Other centres in the state will also hold similar events. The ashram in Vadodara will be coordinating efforts throughout the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/aurobindos-150th-birth-anniv-celebration-begins/articleshow/85336667.cms||---

Changanassery police recorded the woman’s statement and collected her call details after chief minister Pinarayi intervened in the issue. Police said a few of the callers have been identified and they have been asked to appear before the police. The woman had raised a complaint with police some days ago about the lewd calls but with the police refusing to act she had posted a video on social media highlighting her plight. Her husband had left her and she has been doing tailoring works to look after her four children. Ever since some miscreants circulated her number saying she was a sex worker she has been receiving calls from unknown people, at times up to over 50 calls a day, she said, adding that the callers continue to indulge in obscene talks even if her children pick up the phone. Since, people contact her for tailoring purpose on this number she feels changing it will affect her work. Earlier in the day, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who came to know about woman’s plight through a section of media, wrote in his Facebook page that stringent action will be taken on the woman’s complaint. The CM promised action will be taken against those who circulated the woman’s number. "Modern communication technologies should be used for the progress and welfare of the society. However, the criminal tendency to misuse technology to trouble or insult others cannot be allowed, Vijayan said in his post. Vijayan also said that stricter laws will be introduced to prevent the misuse of technology, adding that such anti-social activities will attract severe punishment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lewd-calls-cops-act-after-cm-steps-in/articleshow/85336675.cms||---

People associated with tourism are content to some extent but are feeling the pinch as foreign tourists are completely missing. A major part of the tourism revenue in Udaipur comes from the foreign tourists. Nevertheless, the hoteliers are happy as the domestic tourists are making up for the loss that was incurred by the industry during the lockdown. After different phases of unlock and relaxation in guidelines the tourists, mainly from adjoining Gujarat have made Udaipur their favourite destination. On weekends tourist spots are mostly crowded as tourists prefer driving down from Gujarat. The budget hotels are banking on domestic tourists while the premium hotels and event companies are still awaiting relaxation in wedding celebration rules so that destination weddings can be carried out freely. The monsoon season has played a major role in attracting tourists. Though the rain god has not been kind enough on Udaipur this season, the greenery surrounding Udaipur is a treat enough for the tourists. The parking problems and the smart city infrastructural work has irked the tourists. The traffic management during the weekends has emerged as a big challenge for the administration as streets of the Walled City are dug up and lack alternate routes. Tourists were seen flocking to Kumbhalgarh on Saturday after the Rajasthan government eased Covid restrictions recently. Dozens of cars were caught in a jam in the city. After the recent rains, tourists are heading to the greener city with a historical heritage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/weekend-tourism-gets-boost-in-udaipur/articleshow/85336651.cms||---

Bookings opened from August 8 for all the 44 seats in the coach. The bookings from Mumbai to Pune, on the other hand, have not been that great. Railway officials said the train’s timing for the journey from Mumbai to Pune is the primary reason for less bookings. “The train leaves Mumbai in the evening hours and reaches Pune in the late evening hours. When the train travels through the ghat section between Karjat and Lonavla, it is already dark and passengers cannot enjoy the view,” a Pune rail official told TOI. All seats are booked on August 15 and 16 and there is a waiting list for the Pune-Mumbai journey. Around three to 12 seats are available for the Pune-Mumbai journey from August 17 to August 20 (no seats available on August 19). However, six to 31 seats are available from August 16 to 20 for the Mumbai to Pune journey (train number: 02123). A Central Railway official said all seats for the Mumbai-Pune journey have also booked but the IRCTC website showed otherwise. A senior rail official (Mumbai) was contacted for clarity but his answer was awaited till the time of going to press. Before this, the Central Railway had introduced the coach aboard the Deccan Express on June 26 and the seats have been booked fully on most days. The fare of a seat in the Vistadome coach of the Deccan Queen is Rs 915 and aboard the Deccan Express it is Rs 835. “I will definitely take a ride from Mumbai to Pune on the coach once and see it for myself,” Kailash Dixit, a regular commuter, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/deccan-queens-vistadome-coach-fully-booked-from-pune/articleshow/85336641.cms||Joy Sengupta

According to the statement, the sanction for prosecution against Rao has already been given by the state government and it recommended the Centre for the same under the Prevention of Corruption Act. In the case of Aggarwal, the FIR against him was registered on January 18, 2021. After preliminary investigation, he was arrested on February 2, 2021 and investigation started. Prosecution proposals have been sought by ACB against him on July 9, 2021 and accordingly the personnel department discussed the matter with the investigating officer of ACB on July 16. The Anti-Corruption Bureau has clarified that keeping in mind the principle of natural justice, Aggarwal was given an opportunity to present his case. Though he had sought 15 days’ time, he was yet to present his side. During the examination of the case, the desired additional documents related to the case were sought from the ACB, which the personnel department received on August 6, 2021. After the examination, the prosecution proposals will be presented for decision at the competent level, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-blamed-for-prosecution-sanction-delay-against-officers/articleshow/85336633.cms||---

The sender turned out to be a student “traumatised” by the delay in results. He was let off with a warning and a notice after cyber police tracked him down. The emails were received between July 9 and 10 before a first information report (FIR) was registered against an unknown person at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) police station on Friday. Sections of the Indian Penal Code for causing public mischief and criminal intimidation were invoked in the case.  Vinod Patil, director of examinations, told TOI these threats were received in July, following which all undergraduate results were declared. “A commerce student, we have come to understand, sent the university these threat messages from a cyber cafe,” said a university official. A university security officer lodged the case alleging the threatening emails were received by the director of examinations and evaluation. “The probe showed it was a hoax sent from an email ID registered with fake details,” said a BKC police officer. Manjunath Singe, deputy commissioner of police (Zone VIII), said a case was initially registered against an unknown person for sending the hoax emails. “It was a student who has created the fake email ID to send hoax emails,” said Singe. “The pandemic has left people traumatised and left many jobless. Such individuals have started making hoax calls due to their frustration,” Singe added. On August 4, BKC police had received a complaint from the US consulate that its security guard was told there was a threat to the consulate for lapse in the ‘work approach’,” said a police officer. On August 7, Mumbai police received a call from men who claimed bombs had been planted near actor Amitabh Bachchan’s bungalow at Juhu, another at CSMT (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus) and a third in Dadar railway station. Police arrested three inebriated men for making the hoax call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-university-bomb-hoax-mailer-turns-out-to-be-a-student/articleshow/85338607.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The four have been residing in a small room next to the tin shed.” Kalaskar said, “Nearly 39 cylinders were stocked illegally in the shed and no safety measures were taken. Around 11.30am, one of the employees lit a stove to cook some food when the domestic gas cylinder developed a leak and exploded.” Citing preliminary investigations, Kalaskar said, “The employer had taken the shed on rent but there is no written agreement. We booked the tin shed owner on the charge of negligence and causing grievous hurt under Sections 295, 337 and 338 of the IPC.” “We have summoned the employer for questioning because he should have stocked the cylinders in a godown instead of tin shed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/four-hurt-as-gas-cylinder-explodes-one-booked/articleshow/85336706.cms||---

Alleging that the police had damaged many tazias and misbehaved their makers, hundreds of people of Shia sect of Bhadi Khas and nearby localities staged night-long protest at Shahganj police station and performed Muharram mourning there till Saturday morning. ASP (city), Jaunpur, Dr Sanjay Kumar, said that in view of the ban on carrying out tazia processions during Muharram this year, the people of Muslim community had been asked during the peace committee meetings at each police station not to make tazias. On getting inputs that some tazia-makers in Shahganj were making tazias, a police team had gone to their places on Friday evening and asked them to avoid it, said ASP. Upset over it, the people of the community started levelling allegations that cops damaged tazias, the ASP added. Shia clerics condemn damage to tazias in Jaunpur, seek action Lucknow: Shia clerics on Saturday condemned the alleged police action and damage to taziyas (replica of Imam Husain’s shrine) kept inside houses in Jaunpur on Friday night. General secretary of Majlis-e-Ulama-e-Hind, Maulana Kalbe Jawad Naqvi, on Saturday morning announced the boycott of majlis held at Imambara Ghufranmaab in Lucknow from Sunday till the government issues guidelines for Muharram and unwarranted police action against mourners stops in the state. However, after the guidelines were issued in the evening, he made a U-turn saying that the majlis would continue as per schedule. “We condemn the oppression of Shias. Since the guidelines have been issued by the government on Saturday, the majlis boycott announcement is revoked but we demand action against the police officials who tore taziyas in Shahganj,” he added. Maulana Yasoob Abbas also condemned the alleged police act and complained to the police control room demanding suspension of the cops responsible for the act. Talking to TOI from Mumbai, Abbas said: “I have made a formal complaint about the incident with the police. Even in Agra and Hardoi, I have been told, police forced its way into a majlis and stalled it, which is unacceptable. Covid protocols are being followed by Shias, while people of other religions are continuing their activities unhindered.” Kalbe Sibtain Noorie, son of late Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, also appealed to clerics to come together on the issue for the sake of Muharram and its mourners. Maulana Saif Abbas also condemned the incident and action against the guilty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shias-accuse-cop-of-damaging-tazias-in-jaunpur-stage-protest/articleshow/85339288.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune to get 5 direct flights to smaller cities later this month||PUNE: Several airlines have introduced new flights connecting Pune to Tier II cities starting this month. Airlines sources said migration from smaller towns to bigger cities for employment, and ease in negotiating slots in smaller airports have encouraged airlines to take this step even during the pandemic. A little over a month after Pune got three new connections — Nashik, Belagavi and Surat — the city airport will have direct flights to Ranchi, Thiruvananthapuram, Amritsar, Gwalior (from August 20) and Tirupati. Further, the Pune-Goa flight will resume. “Ranchi is a new sector and there was no direct flight from here earlier. With Amritsar, Thiruvananthapuram and Tirupati also getting connected, we expect passenger traffic to rise,” an airport official said. “Airlines have been observing several people from smaller towns moving to cities, most likely for employment. An airline checks profitability before starting a new flight; profits don’t always come from an increase in passenger load,” an airline source said. “In smaller centres, airlines can find slots easily and use the airport’s infrastructure more efficiently compared to larger airports,” S K Jain, former chairman of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) and former head of iots civil aviation panel, said. Anant Sardeshmukh, former director-general of MCCIA, however, had different views. “I don’t think there is a direct connection between the pandemic and the new flights. The new connections are convenient points en route to other destinations,” he said. Aviation analyst Dhairyashil Vandekar said the airlines must have also factored in incentivization by the Centre to start regional connections. “Also, ease of entry to smaller airports, which usually do not insist on RT-PCR reports, must have been considered,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-to-get-5-direct-flights-to-smaller-cities-later-this-month/articleshow/85336669.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Vadodara||Azads of Vadodara chose ‘Freedom’ as their identity||VADODARA: While modern thinkers would dismiss the bard’s ‘What’s in a name?’ dialogue as cliched, a name, more particularly a surname in India, is the ‘be all’ of individual identity. Dignity, literally resides in the clan badge that is worn across sleeves with a vehemence. And if it reads anything like ‘Azad’, it’s definitely a stamp of being ‘part of freedom fighters’ lineage’. Welcome to Vadodara, where over seven decades ago, a couple of freedom fighters from the Banyan City had given up their filial surnames to adopt ‘Azad’ or ‘the unfettered’ as part of their identity, while choosing to devote their lives to the cause of freeing the country from British bondage. Baroda was a princely state, but inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s clarion call people like Rasik Shah, Chandrakantbhai and Padmaben gave up their names and plunged into the struggle for freedom. While not much is known about Chandrakantbhai Azad and Padmaben Azad now, Rasikbhai Azad is still a known name in Vadodara city as he had roped in many youths from the city to join the Gandhian path and even established an ashram in Savli taluka. In fact, much later Vadodara Municipal Corporation honoured the freedom fighter by naming the crossroads near Karelibaug water tank as Rasiklal Azad Chowk. “Although history remembers Chandrashekhar Azad, my uncle, who too was inspired by Gandhiji for the movement decided to drop his original surname and attach the word ‘Azad’ to his name. He had even taken a vow not to marry until the country becomes free,” Rashikbhai’s nephew Manhar Shah told TOI. Rasikbhai, who was working at Nyay Mandir, gave up his job to join the freedom movement and was even arrested from different districts of central Gujarat and jailed six times, where he continued his ‘satyagraha’ for better living conditions of prisoners,” said Shah, who runs Janjagruti Abhiyaan Vadodara for raising awareness on freedom movement. In 1987, Rasikbhai passed away. “A fund of Rs 30,000 was collected then to start a trust to continue his work, which I could only after Kargil War. It is still active,” Shah added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/azads-of-vadodara-chose-freedom-as-their-identity/articleshow/85336783.cms||Jay Pachchigar

TDB president N Vasu told TOI that according to a preliminary inquiry nine beads out of a total of 81 beads in a rudraksha were found missing during stock verification. The missing beads weigh 21 grams with a total of seven grams of gold plated over it. “I came to know about the incident at around 9pm on Friday and have ordered an inquiry,” said Vasu. He said the vigilance wing of TDB has already begun a probe. Meanwhile, the secretary of the temple advisory committee K N Sreekumar said that the board officials had come to know about the missing gold on July 5 during stock verification. The previous priest had handed over the Thiruvabharanam to the new head priest who took charge on that day in the presence of TDB officials. A primary investigation was conducted on the same day and a detailed probe on July 14. Sreekumar also said that the advisory committee has written to the board on the missing gold on July 23. However, no action was taken on the report filed by committee and now that the incident has been leaked to the media, the advisory committee is demanding a police investigation, he said. Reacting to the allegation, Vasu said that he has directed the administrative officer of the temple to file a police complaint. He said an internal probe will be conducted to find out why he was not informed about the incident and to ascertain whether there was an alleged attempt to hush up the case. The head priests of the temple is changed very three years. It is the custom that the priest will have to remain within the temple complex for the entire period of three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tdb-to-probe-into-missing-temple-gold/articleshow/85336760.cms||---

This is higher than the national average of 13.3%. In absolute terms, 16,96,414 people in Uttarakhand have been fully vaccinated and 68,89,741 vaccine doses have been administered so far. According to health department data, the pace of the inoculation drive has picked up considerably in the hill state in the past one month. Between July 12 and August 12, the state fully inoculated 8.9% of the state residents above 18 years of age. Significantly, 70.1% of the state’s adult population, 77,29,468 people, has been administered at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Speaking to TOI on the ongoing vaccination drive, Uttarakhand health minister Dhan Singh Rawat said, “The entire government machinery is working towards achieving the goal of vaccinating the entire Uttarakhand population by December 31 this year.” Among the 13 districts, Bageshwar has 33.6% of all the fully vaccinated people, followed by Chamoli (32.1%), Uttarkashi (30.1%), Almora (29.5%) Pauri (28.8%) Champawat (28.6%), Rudraprayag (28%), Dehradun (27.5%), Pithoragarh (24.1%), Tehri (24.9%), Nainital (23.5%), Haridwar (13.8%), and Udham Singh Nagar (12.7%).

According to a TOI source in the health department, Uttarakhand received 68,18,650 doses of Covishied and 5,95,640 doses of Covaxin till August 12. Meanwhile, Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation tracking the pandemic scenario in Uttarakhand since its outbreak, told mediapersons, “In the last ten days — from August 4 to August 13 — a total of 94,4518 vaccine doses have been administered. This translates to 94,452 doses a day. It is encouraging to see that the pace of vaccination has picked up in Uttarakhand.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/21-9-of-adult-population-fully-inoculated-in-ukhand-higher-than-national-average-of-13-3/articleshow/85332719.cms||Shivani Azad

BJP president J P Nadda was also present in the meeting. “Nishad community is committed to form government with BJP in 2022 to restore its lost glory,” said Nishad. It was Nishad’s second meeting with the duo after the one in June in which he had sought a Union cabinet berth for his son Pravin. Nishad later made his disappointment public saying, “I put my points before the Union minister and BJP president saying Kurmis are hardly 5% but got five berths while Nishads with 18% population were ignored. Let’s see if the Machhua community gets representation in state cabinet reshuffle.” NISHAD Party insists it is ‘friends’ with BJP but the frequency with which its president issues warnings to the ruling party for ignoring Nishads reveals that their relations are delicate. He has also asked the state government to restore the rights of Nishads on ponds and water bodies in every gram sabha.  “In 2007, the Mayawati government changed the provision. The government should restore it,” he said. He also demanded withdrawal of cases filed against Nishads in Agra, Gorakhpur, Jaunpur and Ghazipur during agitations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nishad-party-reiterates-support-to-bjp-in-polls/articleshow/85339295.cms||Neha Shukla

They wanted the police to take immediate steps to find the girl. The 13-year-old girl went missing about eight months ago. Her father is a local BJP worker. The BJP’s zonal president of 'Yuva Morcha' from Sambhal has also accused the cops of inaction. The family has been protesting for a month. On Saturday, the SP workers with placards joined the supporters of the rival party to protest against the administration. Both groups of workers demanded quick action. SP city Amit Kumar Anand said, “The investigation has so far revealed that a man who was a family acquaintance may have lured the minor girl. The family also suspects the same. The case has been taken over by CBI and all the matters related with the case are to be taken up by Sambhal police.” According to the girl’s family, their daughter, who was living at her grandparents' house in the Majhola area went out for some work and didn’t return. After the January incident, the family had lodged a complaint with Moradabad police against another BJP worker, a suspect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/sp-men-join-bjp-workers-to-protest-over-missing-minor-girl/articleshow/85330955.cms||Maria Khan
---||India||Amid Covid-19 pandemic, demand for e-learning on government portal soars||NEW DELHI: With over one crore enrolments in less than two years, the government’s online platform Swayam has seen a massive jump in demand as colleges were forced to rely on online teaching due to the pandemic. Over 1.6 lakh enrolled in four courses in July 2020, with courses like Machine Learning, Python for Data Science, Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms using Python and Programming each seeing enrolment of over 40,000 during the semester. These courses were offered by IIT-Madras, Chennai Mathematical Institute and IIT-Kharagpur. Data accessed by TOI showed that around 1.1 crore enrolments took place on the platform between July 2019 and January 2021. An average of 27.4 lakh joined courses every semester since 2019 to study in courses offered by institutions like IITs, Indian Institute of Science, BHU and IIMs. “Covid is one of the major reasons for this growth. Growth that would have otherwise taken a decade has now been achieved in two years,” said V Ramgopal Rao, director of IIT-Delhi. Enrolment in courses is expected to rise with the approval of credit transfers up to 40% from online courses towards the completion of degrees. Around 149 universities, including 26 central universities and 48 state-run universities will accept credits received on Swayam from 2021. Amit Khare, secretary for higher education in the education ministry, credited the new National Education Policy with facilitating the rapid growth of online learning. He said though Covid hastened the pace, “ultimately it is the new National Education Policy which facilitated the developments. The first step being allowing up to 40% credit via online courses, followed by UGC allowing 100 top universities to offer full online degree programmes. Soon, students will be able to take any course from the choice of their institutions, earn and deposit credits and complete their degrees.” The number of students appearing for Swayam exams and getting certified, or earning credits, has tripled since July 2018. Around 70,000 took the exams and nearly 65,000 qualified per semester in 2018; the number rose to nearly 2 lakh taking the exams in 2019 and 2020. An estimated 1.8 lakh students were certified per semester during this period. The number of courses offered on the online platform has more than doubled since 2017. There were 323 courses available in July 2017, which grew to 876 in January 2021. Career counsellor Pervin Malhotra said that the rise can be attributed to employers asking what students had done while colleges were shut due to the pandemic. Value addition and certifications achieved through Swayam helped increase students’ domain expertise in technical fields, she said. “Another plus is that the brand value of a course offered by an IIT looks great on your resume. Why would a learner from a second-rung institution miss an opportunity to learn from lectures of IITs or NITs, earn a certificate or credit? Most students from second-rung institutions need supplementary learning and if you are getting it from premier sources why not?” said Malhotra. Top institutes’ digital courses also witnessed significant growth over the past year. IIT-Delhi director Rao said that the institute had seen a marked increase in participation after it digitised 1,400 of its courses and made them available online. “We launched eVidya during our last convocation with support of five edtech companies. Not only has it helped us reach students from remote areas, but our revenue has also increased by 400% in the online learning space,” said Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-covid-19-pandemic-demand-for-e-learning-on-government-portal-soars/articleshow/85340541.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh updating boards' list after Army rejects AMU school candidate||AGRA: After the Army rejected an applicant because he had studied in a school affiliated to the board of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), which in their records was still "unauthorised" pending an updated list from the UP government, the administration in Uttar Pradesh is hurrying to fix the error. Mursalim Khan, 20, a commerce undergraduate student at AMU, had studied at the Saiyyid Hamid Senior Secondary School, affiliated to the AMU Board of Secondary and Senior Secondary Education. At an Army recruitment drive in Ajmer last month, he qualified on all parameters but was not chosen because the board was not among UP’s list of government-approved ones, TOI had reported on August 11. An Army officer who was part of the recruitment rally that Khan participated in had said that the list from which AMU’s board was missing was provided in January this year. The board had been set up under the Aligarh Muslim University Act, 1920, which gave the university power to “establish and maintain high schools and other institutions” within a “15-mile radius from the university mosque”. The board was recognised by the UGC in 1984. In a letter to the Army headquarters, asking it to intervene, registrar of the university, Abdul Hamid, said, “The Uttar Pradesh Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad accepted our certificate as equivalent to its UP Board certificates in a gazette notification on July 8, 1995. It can also be found in the extraordinary gazette of the UP government from 1990-93.” The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) recognises AMU board scores. And it is a part of the Council of Boards for School Education, membership of which is mandatory for all recognised school boards. So how did the problem arise? “Till March 2014, it was equivalent to the UP board but it got off the list after that for some reason,” a UP secondary education board senior official told TOI. “We are working to fix it.” Principal of Saiyyid Hamid Senior Secondary School Major (Dr) Syed Mohammad Mustafa said the government has asked for its syllabus and other information about the curriculum. “We have sent everything,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-updating-boards-list-after-army-rejects-amu-school-candidate/articleshow/85332731.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The duo has been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Sankalp Sharma, superintendent of police, said a departmental probe was ordered after businessman Prince Gupta alleged that SI Ompal Singh and constable Prabhat Kumar had called him at the police station after “receiving a complaint against him on IGRS (integrated Grievances redressal system)”. When Gupta reached the police station for recording his statement, he was kept in the lockup for hours. The policemen threatened to send him to jail and extorted Rs 5,000 for releasing him. Gupta claimed that he was innocent but was ill-treated and humiliated in custody. “Departmental action will also be taken against the two policemen,” said the SSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/2-cops-suspended-for-extorting-money-from-bizman-in-budaun/articleshow/85330963.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Dehradun||Covid test fraud: Report says Kumbh scam was ‘planned conspiracy’||HARIDWAR: Delayed by a month and a half, the report of the three-member committee to investigate how close to one lakh fake Covid test results popped up during the Maha Kumbh in Haridwar was finally submitted to the Haridwar district magistrate on Saturday. The 2,400-page report, sources said, speaks of the “role” played by the Kumbh Mela health department and district health officials who were responsible for supervising Covid tests conducted during the congregation. The committee had been set up by the Haridwar district administration on June 13 and was supposed to submit its findings in 15 days. The deadline, however, kept being pushed. “We recorded statements of 40 people (involved in the case), including owners of Max (Corporate) Services and other labs implicated in the scam as well as officials of both the Mela and district health departments,” chief development officer Saurabh Gaharwar, who led the committee, told TOI. Max Corporate Services was one of nine private agencies the state government had engaged to conduct Covid tests in Haridwar during the Kumbh Mela in April. “We also checked all documents related to the scam and verified around 1.1 lakh phone numbers. That took a lot of time,” Gaharwar added. A district administration source, however, told TOI, “The role of Mela health department and district health department has surfaced in the scam. It was a well-planned conspiracy which could have been stopped had the departments done what they should have.” TOI had earlier reported that the Special Investigation Team probing the scam was looking into the role Haridwar chief medical officer Dr SK Jha may have played. It was under his watch that the “fake” tests were conducted by the agencies and documents showed that the process of choosing which labs got the contracts may have been compromised. And while Max Corporate Services did not have valid documents, it was still allowed to conduct tests by the Kumbh Mela administration. The DM will brief the media about the contents of the report on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-scam-panel-submits-2400-page-report-says-it-was-planned-conspiracy/articleshow/85332758.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Dehradun||Mussoorie tourist cap: 15,000 per day this weekend||DEHRADUN/MUSSOORIE: To prevent hordes of tourists coming to Mussoorie during the Independence Day weekend, the district administration of Dehradun announced on Friday that not more than 15,000 visitors will be allowed in a single day in the town. This has led to many hoteliers and shop owners in the Queen of Hills fuming at the decision. “Our economy is entirely dependent on tourism. Limiting the number of tourists is not a solution; instead, we should focus on upgrading our infrastructure,” said Sandeep Sahni, president of Uttarakhand Hotel Association. Echoing similar sentiments, Sanjay Aggarwal, secretary of the hotel association of Mussoorie, added, “All hotels are following safety protocols and risk of Covid is significantly reduced in this scenario. We do not agree with the decision of putting a cap on tourists. Moreover, turning away the tourists is going to cause inconvenience to them and give a bad name to the tourism sector in the state." Hoteliers also said that they would give a memorandum to the CM to reconsider this cap on the number of tourists. Notably, tourist activities had picked up momentum in the town since the last week of June after the second wave of Covid-19 had started to ebb. According to directions issued by Dehradun district magistrate R Rajesh Kumar, tourists need to register on the Smart City portal, carry a negative RT-PCR report and show advance hotel booking details to get entry to the hill town. Similar restrictions have been placed for tourists planning to visit Sahastradhara and Robber’s Cave in Dehradun. The entry of vehicles – including two-wheelers - of visitors has also been completely banned on Mussoorie’s Mall Road. The vehicle owners would be required to park their vehicles near Picture Palace or ahead of Library Chowk. Rajat Aggarwal, president of the traders’ association of the town, told TOI, “Limiting the number of tourists is against the policies and principles of tourism. It is also entirely against the interests of local businessmen who are dependent upon tourists for their livelihood.” Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal, when queried about the issue, said, “The government has already directed the district magistrates to take a call in their respective districts on Covid protocols. In various parameters, Uttarakhand has done well but at the same time, we need to remember that the Covid phase is not over yet. Therefore, the decision was taken for the safety of locals as well as the visitors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/not-more-than-15k-tourists-allowed-in-mussoorie-this-weekend-hoteliers-fume/articleshow/85332775.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Nagpur||Experts sound note of caution as FDA finds 52 of 86 honey samples adulterated||Nagpur: How safe is the honey you are consuming? The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) on Monday tested 86 leading brands, found 52 samples to be adulterated, and seized more than 3,480kg of honey stock worth over Rs36 lakh from a manufacturer in Mumbai. “The brands couldn’t pass the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) test, which revealed artificial sugar syrups mannose, maltose, and maltotriose. The possibility of adverse effects on health by consuming this type of honey cannot be ruled out,” the FDA officials said in a release. During Covid times, there has been a huge demand for honey by consumers to boost immunity. “As demand for honey is increasing, adulteration has also increased. Honey is the third most adulterated food product after milk and ghee,” says Pranav Nimbalkar, a well-known beekeeper from the city. In December last, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) claimed that 77% of samples from 13 top honey brands in the country were found to have been adulterated. “The raid in Mumbai is just the tip of the iceberg. As adulteration methods became more sophisticated, detection has become more difficult. Yet only laboratory tests can truly determine whether honey is authentic,” says Nimbalkar. Honey adulteration business is evolving and adultrators are misusing advanced lab set ups to come with new syrups that can bypass existing regulation tests. A section of experts agree that honey adulteration is done by using synthetic sugar syrups, and sugar and liquid jaggery (kakvi) is quite outdated these days as it can be easily detected. “These sugar syrups like high fructose corn syrup and rice syrup have high fructose content, which can harm the body. At least jaggery mixed honey was natural, but honey having fructose content increases the sugar level in the body though honey is being consumed to control sugar,” said Nimbalkar. Consumers may think forest honey might be the best but harvesting honey from natural hives takes place under difficult circumstances. It is quite impossible to check if the entire hive contains ripened honey. The product from honey hunting is usually a mixture that contains high water content honey. “It is processed and heated for moisture reduction, which destroys essential enzymes, antioxidants, and vitamins. That’s why most of the forest honey available in the market is not raw. Anyone mentioning raw honey should be asked to show on what basis the claim has been made,” Nimbalkar said. Factors like widespread usage of pesticides and decreasing tree habitat are impacting honeybee populations. Demand for more forest honey can only make this situation worse. Nimbalkar suggests consumers should only buy raw honey (unheated and unfiltered), which mentions source of nectar (flowers from which bees collect it). Ironically, no company makes a mention about it. “The honey available in the market is Rs400-500 per kg but the one which we produce is Rs1,300 per kg. This is the main reason why people end up buying sub-standard honey,” he says. How honey is adulterated Indirect adulteration * Bees are overfed with sugar syrups to increase honey yield in hives * Honey produced is just another sugar with hardly any medicinal values * Overuse of veterinary drugs * Besides disease control, antibiotics used as growth promoter too * Consumption of such antibiotic-laced honey may contribute to evolution of drug-resistant superbugs in human beings Direct Adulteration * Adulterated with C4 sugar-like corn and sugarcane syrups * Adulterated with C3 sugar syrups like rice and beetroot syrup to bypass laboratory tests that can detect C4 sugars * Advanced syrups that beat C3 and C4 tests * Honey adulterated up to 50% can bypass all tests including C3 and C4 tests, claim Chinese companies selling such syrups False Claims * Honey samples of many companies advertising their product as ‘NMR tested’ failed NMR tests conducted by Maharashtra FDA * Honey samples of brands that earlier passed NMR tests now failed in NMR tests conducted by Maharashtra FDA||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/experts-sound-note-of-caution-as-fda-finds-52-of-86-honey-samples-adulterated/articleshow/85336798.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The arrest was related to a petty case, they said and added that the guilty officers should be punished. Presiding over the meeting at Kottathara in Attapadi on Saturday, Rajendra Prasad, president of ‘Thampu’, a tribal collective, said that the tribal people had to conduct agitations for months together to file FIRs in incidents which tribal people have been killed. But here, in a petty case, the police filed an FIR and arrested the tribal chief and his son from their house in the early hours while they were sleeping. These sort of atrocities against tribespeople are in violation of the United Nation’s (UN) charter to protect tribal rights, he said. The meeting demanded the setting up of a commission to study the problems of Attapadi tribespeople, including the problems of their land, infant deaths and malnutrition.

The MLA, who himself drove the vehicle, was accompanied by Smart City Project chairman Bhavani Singh Detha and chief executive officer Awadhesh Meena. The inspection, which started from the New Gate, went to Sanjay Bazar, Chaura Rasta, Badi Chaupar, Hawamahal Road, Tripolia Bazar and Tadkeshwar Mahadev Temple to take the stock of the conditions. The officials had to face people’s ire after the MLA checked on the dilapidated condition of the facade. The work under the has been going on for the last 6 years. The work of façade and heritage protection were to be done in all the markets here at a cost of Rs 14 crore, but were stopped after spending Rs 7 crore. Local shopkeeper Jatin Khurana said, “The tender to protect the façade was invited again but no progress was seen. Moreover, roofs of the verandahs are falling and water drips in the rainy season.” The locals further complained for not taking up cleanliness work of narrow streets and repair of drainage in the Walled City area. “As per the proposal, the smart city had to spent Rs 6.5 crore, but work came to an grinding halt after spending Rs 2 crore,” said another shopkeeper. In the recent past, the state capital had miserably failed to attain good Smart City Mission’s ranking. In the latest online ranking, Rajasthan came first in the state-wise category. However, within the state, Jaipur stood last among the four smart cities. Out of 100, it attained the 28th rank, while Udaipur, Kota and Ajmer stood at 5th, 10th and 22nd, respectively. An official source at Jaipur said, “Under the smart city, priority is given more on beautification projects, rather than improving the basic infrastructure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mla-visits-walled-city-areas-to-inspect-development-projects/articleshow/85336838.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Confusion put to rest, Tricolour flutters high on St Jacinto Island||PANAJI: Defusing the tension at St Jacinto island through informal discussions with the villagers and fishermen, the Tricolour was jointly hoisted by Indian Navy personnel and locals on Saturday at noon. Naval officials and veterans met with the villagers, who had been misled by local politicians, and convinced them that there was no ulterior motive behind the Indian Navy’s move to hoist the national flag. Naval veteran (Capt) Viriato Fernandes described the tensions created by local politicians as “uncalled for” while former navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash called it a “storm in a teacup”. Scores of locals, including the elderly and children, turned out to salute the national flag and sing the national anthem at 2.45pm accompanied by the local chaplain. “After a slight misunderstanding on Friday, a team from Goa Naval Area and residents amicably participated in hoisting the national flag at St Jacinto Island,” said the Indian Navy in a brief statement. “The residents also sang the national anthem along with the naval team during the event.” Naval authorities had to abandon their plan to hoist the Tricolour on the picturesque island on Friday after a misunderstanding cropped up between the locals and the naval personnel. Nationalist Congress Party state president Jose Phillip D’souza added fuel to the fire with the outlandish claim that the patriotic event was a ruse to “capture the island” and drive away the locals. “This is a plan to try and test our reaction before they capture this island,” D’souza had said on Friday after mobilizing a few residents. While condemning the locals, chief minister Pramod Sawant described the locals as anti-nationals and directed authorities to initiate an inquiry. “These attempts of anti-India activities shall be dealt with an iron fist,” said the chief minister. Shedding light on the unfortunate event that occurred on Friday, Fernandes said that the villagers are wary of the government’s intentions ever since the homes of the islanders were dropped from the state government’s coastal zone management plan (CZMP). “They are afraid of losing their homes where the government has not shown their homes in the CZMP,” said Fernandes. “The villagers have been hoisting the Tricolour by themselves every August 15 at 8am. They asked the naval personnel that instead of hoisting the national flag by themselves, naval authorities could join the villagers on Sunday,” said Fernandes. Former navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash said that the issue had been blown out of proportion. “A typical ‘storm in a teacup’? In a tiny island village in India’s smallest state, the villagers - all Indians - want to exercise their right under Art 19 of the Constitution, to hoist the national flag. They don’t need the navy’s help for this,” said Admiral Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/confusion-put-to-rest-tricolour-flutters-high-on-st-jacinto-island/articleshow/85338666.cms||---

CMC recently purchased a car for the chief officer and other staff since the existing 15-year-old one had technical issues. Opposition councillor Roopa Prashant Gaonkar told TOI that the chairperson had not taken all councillors into confidence and that the matter was not discussed at any council meeting. “We questioned chairperson Laxman Naik during the council meeting on August 6 about the lack of transparency.” Naik said that the resolution regarding the car was taken by the previous council. Councillor John Dias moved a resolution to provide petrol and mobile recharge allowance for all councillors and supervisors. The chairperson assured the council that their demand will be met based on availability of excess money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/councillors-fume-after-civic-body-buys-new-car/articleshow/85338649.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: More than a year after Covid lockdown began, mountaineering activities resume in Uttarkashi||UTTARKASHI: A mountaineering group of 15 members from Assam began their expedition to the Jogin-1 (6,465 metres) and Jogin-3 (6,116 metres) peaks — situated in Gangotri Himalayas — on Saturday. While trekking activities had resumed in the district months ago, this is the first group to go on a mountaineering expedition in the region after the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic struck the state in 2020. Meanwhile, members of the Uttarkashi Mountaineering and Trekking Association have expressed happiness over the return of mountaineering groups to the region. Jayendra Rana, president, Garhwal Himalaya Mountaineering and Trekking Association (GHMTA), Uttarkashi, told TOI, “Finally, the first mountaineering group has arrived in the district after a year-long gap. This 15-member group from Assam was officially flagged off by the Uttarkashi district magistrate on Thursday. Several trekking agencies in the district have received bookings for the post-monsoon season, triggering hopes for the revival of adventure sports in the region.” Echoing a similar sentiment, Manoj Rawat, secretary, GHMTA, said, “Uttarkashi is a paradise for mountaineering and every year, dozens of mountaineers from all over the world come here for adventure sports. This not only supports the local economy but also generates revenue for the state government. Local tour operators had to bear massive financial losses due to the Covid-19 disruption last year.” He added, “The trekking activities before the second wave of the pandemic were not enough to make up for the losses. Thus, the state government will also have to take some measures to attract tourists and support the tourism industry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/more-than-a-year-after-covid-lockdown-began-mountaineering-activities-resume-in-uttarkashi/articleshow/85332797.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala

On the occasion, Dhami said that the state government is providing jobs to the dependents of the personnel of the Army and Paramilitary forces, who have attained martyrdom, according to their educational qualification. He pointed out that 17 dependents have, so far, been given jobs in the state services. “Uttarakhand is the only state where an annual amount is given to soldiers decorated with gallantry awards for life,” the CM added. The sum given to the soldiers decorated with the Vishisht Seva Medal award has been increased, he said, adding that the grant given to the ex-servicemen and war widows of the Second World War has also been increased from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per month. Dhami added that computer training, up to six months, is also being given to make ex-servicemen, military widows and their dependents self-reliant. The CM announced that the soldiers residing in the cantonment area would also be given exemption in house tax. Dhami also hailed security personnel for keeping the country safe. “As a soldier’s son, attending programmes of the Army/security forces is emotional for me. I have closely observed the struggles of their family members. Despite this, a soldier does his duty with perseverance,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ahead-of-i-day-cm-felicitates-defence-personnel-war-widows/articleshow/85332817.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘If teacher assaults student, principal too responsible’||While refusing to quash proceedings against a principal, a sessions court in Nagpur ruled that being head of the institution, he had responsibility of anything happening on the school premises between teachers and students. Additional sessions judge P Y Ladekar maintained charges framed by police against Suyash Convent principal Anurag Pandey under Section 75 of Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act for alleged assault and misbehaviour by his teacher against female students. “Undisputedly, the accused is principal of the school. He, along with the managing body, employed the first accused teacher to teach dance. Being principal/headmaster, he was certainly having control over the students and teacher,” the judge said. The court was hearing Pandey’s application for discharge from the offences registered under Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons) of IPC and JJ Act by Hudkeshwar police against Manish Raut, a dance teacher, who had allegedly thrashed minor girls with an iron rod during practice, injuring them on November 30, 2011. The complaint was lodged by the father of a Std VII girl. After police filed a charge-sheet against both accused, Pandey moved an application for discharge from the crime before judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) through counsel Tejas Deshpande. While rejecting his plea, the JMFC held that though he was not present when the assault took place, being headmaster/principal, he was equally responsible for the offence against minors. The 38-year-old principal challenged this in the sessions court by filing a revision application through Deshpande. It was opposed by assistant public prosecutor Pankaj Tapase, who pointed out that four to five days prior to November 30, 2011, the parents had met the principal and complained against the teacher of alleged misbehaviour. But Pandey failed to take action. Pandey’s counsel contended that the JMFC had committed a grave error of law and evidence submitted by police was insufficient to make out a case against the accused. Deshpande said even the JJ Act was not invoked as the principal was not having actual charge of the students. “He has not assaulted, abandoned or neglected the girls. His involvement in the crime is not coming forward from the statement of witnesses,” he said, while stressing on quashing the JMFC’s order. While partly allowing Pandey’s application, Ladekar discharged him from Section 324 of IPC, but maintained proceedings against him under Section 75 of JJ Act. “Prima facie, there are reasonable grounds to proceed against the revisionist for the offence under JJ Act. The magistrate’s order cannot be faulted with,” the judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-if-teacher-assaults-student-principal-too-responsible/articleshow/85338717.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

As per the government figures, only 52% of the allotted strength of IPS officers and 62% of the allotted strength of IAS officers are available for service in state. According to a reply by CM Pinarayi Vijayan in the assembly, the cadre strength of IAS officers is 231, out of which only 144 are available. Similarly, the cadre strength of IPS officers is 172, out of which only 90 officers are available for service in the state. The availability of Indian Forest Service (IFS) officers are also no better –– of the 107 posts, only 62 (58%) are available. The shortage has multiple reasons- the shortage of officers allotted to the state cadre by the Centre over a particular period, the increase in number of posts over the years and the officers who chose to leave on deputation to the Centre and to their home state on inter-cadre deputation. Of the IAS officers allotted to the state cadre, 22 are on central deputation while two are serving in their home state. As many as six officers are in state deputation under the state government. Equal is the number of IPS officers who are on deputation out of the state. While 23 IPS officers are on central deputation, one is on inter-cadre deputation in his home state. Only two IPS officers are on state deputation under the state government. The state at present has one IAS, three IPS, and eight IFS officers who originally belong to other cadres, but have come to the state on inter-cadre deputation for three years. The chief minister has also replied that the government has initiated steps to increase the all India services, through direct selection and selection from other services. It is with this intention that the state government had introduced Kerala administrative services, the selection for which is in the final stage of recruitment. The state is running short of IAS officers, especially in the rank of secretary. The IAS officers from the batch 1997 to 2003 are presently in the secretary grade, in which there are only 10 now. While there are only 10 secretary-rank officers, there are only 12 officers in the ranks of principal secretary, who together are holding charges of portfolios that are more than thrice their total number. On an average, every officer in the rank of principal secretary or secretary grade is holding two to three additional charges in the state. Similar is the case with IPS as well, especially at the ranks of SPs and DIGs. Many officers are holding multiple charges in these ranks at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-facing-severe-shortage-of-ias-ips-officers-govt-data/articleshow/85336888.cms||KP Saikiran

Rajkumar Jain, who is into catering and labour supply business, lodged a complaint against the owners of the firm Nimesh Soni, Nilesh Soni and their father Nandlal Soni at DCB police station on Friday. Jain alleged that the trio had offered him a partnership in their business by asking him to invest Rs 2 crore in 2013. They took the money from him but did not give him any profit share as promised and fled in April after winding up their business. Jain in his complaint stated that he became acquainted with the trio as he used to regularly buy jewellery from them since 2010. In 2013, when they offered him a partnership as they wanted to buy a jewellery making machine, Jain agreed. Between 2013 and 2018, Jain gave the accused payments totaling to Rs 1.25 crore. Whenever he used to ask for his share in profit, Nilesh told him to first invest the entire Rs 2 crore. Jain then asked for written proof of his Rs 1.25 crore investment, following which Nilesh gave the same on the letterhead of the company. Nilesh also gave Jain four cheques as security deposit. In the last three years whenever Jain demanded his money back the accused kept dilly-dallying. On April 22, when Jain went to their shop, he found out that they had closed their business and fled away. As their phones were also switched off, Jain decided to approach the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/jewellery-firm-owners-dupe-bizman-of-rs-1-25cr/articleshow/85336885.cms||---

The reference to the continuous protests by the farmers at the national capital and extending solidarity to it reiterated the firmness of the DMK government in taking on the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. DMK has been taking on the union government over issues surrounding NEET, New Education Policy and three languages policy. The latest friction between the DMK and the central government was caused by the DMK calling them ‘Ondriya Arasu’ – the union government. Over 1,000 farmers owing allegiance to CPI affiliated Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam from various districts in Tamil Nadu reached Delhi on Saturday and joined the protesting farmers at then Singhu border. “The dedication of the agriculture budget to the protesting farmers makes us proud. By supporting our protest, DMK is sending a strong message to BJP that the party is with the farmers,” said Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam Trichy district secretary Ayilai Sivasurian, from Delhi. Sivasurian also said that members of the agriculture wing of DMK also joined them in the protests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dmk-uses-budget-to-hit-out-at-centre/articleshow/85338622.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Norms issued to name new roads, rename existing ones in Jaipur||JAIPUR: As city limits expand and many roads in the new colonies have not been given identity, the state government has issued guidelines to decide the names of existing and new roads, streets and roundabouts. To prevent the major roads from encroachments, width of the roads will also be defined. An official said, as the width of the roads is not earmarked, the local bodies several times face problems in approving the building layout plan, identify encroachments and the assessment of urban development tax. “In absence of names, the tourists and local residents also face difficulty to reach their destination. As names get fixed by the authorities, it will avoid confusion. It will also be geo-tagged to help people find correct location,” he said. Roads and streets will be named after prominent persons, freedom fighters and martyrs. Before this, suggestions and objections will have to be taken from local public representatives. Sources said naming roads or streets always invites controversies. In presence of a fixed criteria, the local bodies can follow the process smoothly. In 2017, the BJP moved a proposal to name roads after prominent personalities, leaders and philanthropists from different communities. Acting on the direction, many elected representatives and officials have initiated work on ground to implement the proposal. However, it was soon shelved after controversy was ignited. An official source said, “It was alleged that the political party was making an attempt to woo voters in abundance as family members of many prominent personalities have strong influence over their communities. Now, such controversies can be avoided.” After defining the width of the roads, the local bodies will ensure the setback of the structures and houses. “Many developers and plot owners violate the building bylaws and norms, in the absence of a defined width. This will check illegal construction and promote systematic development,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/norms-issued-to-name-new-roads-rename-existing-ones/articleshow/85336860.cms||---

Palkulamkudiyil Suresh Soman,40, of Maniyankudi in Chinnakkanal was booked after the postmortem of the elephant, a lactating mother, confirmed that the death occurred due to electrocution. The postmortem was conducted by the forest department’s veterinary surgeon. The elephant was found electrocuted on Friday morning. According to forest officials the jumbo was around 45 years old and it came into contact with a live wire used for fencing the farm areas near forest lands. Forest officials said the elephant has a two-year-old baby and along with a herd of sex elephants they were camping in Chinnakanal area. Chinnakanal section forest officer P Sreekumar said the cables and fencing wires have been seized from the home of the accused. "The man had connected a cable from the direct power line to the fence," said the official. Elephant expert Dr P S Essa said the normal feeding period of wild elephants was three to five years. "There is a chance that the baby could still survive in the absence of its mother. Normally, the elephant herd will take over the protection of the baby elephant," said the official. Man-Animal conflict has been a major issue in Chinnakkanal region, including in 301 Colony. Three wild elephants have been electrocuted in the Chinnakkanal region alone in the past four years, said the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/case-against-one-for-jumbos-death/articleshow/85336962.cms||---

He said that the detailed project report and administrative sanction for the project will materialise at the earliest.“Based on the DPR, we will narrow down the extent of the bus stand and the cost required. A commercial complex will also come up at the facility,” the collector said. This was the first time that the district administration openly acknowledged Panjappur as the proposed site for the facility. Addressing reporters on the 100 days of the new government, the collector said that interest among people for vaccination is declining as the number of fresh cases are down. “We have vaccinated 7.50 lakh people of the total 20.93 lakh eligible population. We have to vaccinate at least 10.50 lakh people. Interest among people to get the second jab has also declined, and we have planned to vaccinate 3 lakh people through the vaccination drive in August,” Sivarasu said. When the cases were peaking recently, there was a serpentine queue at the camps to get the jab, people should encourage their friends and families to take the jab, the collector said.On average, Trichy district is recording 63 cases per day now and with 1.4% test positivity rate, the district is placed at the 10th spot in the state as far as active cases and fresh infections are concerned. When the second wave was peaking, the district had reported 1,750 cases per day, the highest since the pandemic. “We will resume doorstep screening to identify the cases at the earliest. Both rural and urban administrative blocks will be covered. As we are unable to predict the third wave, people must come forward to vaccinate and ensure social distancing at public spots,” the collector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/115-acres-identified-for-bus-terminus-in-trichy-collector/articleshow/85338705.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Organic farmers welcome agri budget initiatives||Udhagamandalam: The announcements in the agriculture budget regarding organic farming are a boon to farmers in the Nilgiris. According to farmers here, the announcement of a separate wing for organic farming under the agriculture department would enhance the importance of organic farming and speed up procedural formalities while obtaining subsidies and other technical expertise. They also welcomed the plan to set up an integrated village agriculture market in the Nilgiris. Organic farming has been promoted and encouraged by the Nilgiris district administration under ‘Organic Nilgiris Mission’ for the last two years. Though the hill district lacks a separate agriculture department, the horticulture department covers cultivation of vegetables, millets and tea plantations. According to joint director of horticulture department Shiva Subramaniam Samraj, the district tops the state in the number of organic farmers. As many as 4,800 farmers here have bagged Scope Certificate from the Tamil Nadu organic certification department under the collective farming scheme. Farmers have to reach Mettupalayam in Coimbatore district to market their produce. “An integrated village agriculture market in the Nilgiris is the need of the hour,” said Samraj. “We had sent a proposal to the government for the market. The announcement in the agriculture budget session in this connection is welcomed by Nilgiris farmers.” A seven-acre land at Bettatti Sungam in Coonoor taluk has been identified for the market, which will have an exclusive market for organic produce and sales outlets for value-added products. The proposed market will attract buyers from across the state, said K Ramdass, an organic farmer in Dimbatty village. “We request the government to give more subsidies for organic farming,” he said. Four labs have been established in the district to produce biofertilizer. As many as 200 vermicompost units have been set up by farmers under schemes of the horticulture department. The department is also producing liquid fertilizers such as dasakaviya and panchakaviya for farmers engaged in organic cultivation. As many as 800 small tea growers attached to the Kinnakorai Indco Tea factory with a total acreage of 600 acres have been brought under the umbrella of Scope Certification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/organic-farmers-welcome-agri-budget-initiatives/articleshow/85338726.cms||---

Police tried to stop the villagers but to no avail. They somehow managed to take him out from Sisauli, the village of Tikait brothers and a stronghold of BKU. Meanwhile, the BKU accused the MLA of creating chaos in the village. Dharmendra Malik, BKU’s media in-charge, said, “Farmers were just demonstrating and raising slogans, but the supporters of the MLA created trouble and started a fight with the farmers. The MLA visited the village to provoke the protesting farmers.” Legislator Umesh Malik with VM Singh, leader of a breakaway farmers’ group who is considered close to BJP, had gone to the village to take part in a programme held by local residents, when the incident happened. The MLA alleged, “BKU has staged this attack on me. I'll file an FIR soon.” After the incident, the MLA and his supporters approached the Bhorakalan police station and filed a complaint against members of BKU. District magistrate CB Singh and SSP Abhishek Yadav rushed to the Bhorakalan police station. Muzaffarnagar MP and Union minister Sanjeev Balyan and several BJP leaders also approached the police station.

A group of young interns and junior doctors have started the pilot project in Anand which will be showcased as a model district before it is scaled up to state and national level where each PHC is equipped with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) machines. After installing the first digital ECG machine at Bamangaam PHC in Anklav taluka, the group is set to equip three other PHCs in Anand and two in New Delhi with digital ECG machines next month. “Our target is to install 250 digital ECG machines in five states including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi, Karnataka and Assam within the next six months,” said Dr Priyansh Shah, founder and president of World Youth Heart Federation (WYHF) — a youth led non-profit social enterprise that has launched the project. “After establishing the model district of Anand, we will expand to over 24,000 rural PHCs of the country. Gujarat itself has 1,500 rural PHCs which will be the next milestone,” he said. Like Priyansh, Dr Adnan Vohra and Dr Nidhi Shah — all intern doctors at state-run SSG Hospital in Vadodara are volunteering for the project with a team comprising Dr Pankti Shah, Dr Harshraj Vaghela, Dr Priyal Thakkar, Dr Keshav Shah, Dr Smit Shah, Dr Devarsh Shah and Dr Dhrumil Patil. Nationally, the group has 600 volunteers of interns and junior doctors in 58 cities. Initially, the group is using its own funds but plans to scale up the initiative with a hyper-local model involving local businessmen and community leaders. WYHF has already trained healthcare workers at three PHCs and one community health centre in Anklav. “It was during the screening camp at Bamangaam during which we found that six patients out of 71 needed treatment at higher centres. Three of the six patients were asymptomatic. It was only because of the digital ECGs that the problem was identified,” Shah added. Deployment of ECG machines at PHC will help in diagnosing many more such cases and in turn save thousands of lives, he said. Companies manufacturing digital ECG machines have their own mobile applications through which sending digital ECGs to cardiologists becomes easy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/young-medicos-keep-hearts-in-rural-gujarat-beating/articleshow/85336917.cms||Prashant Rupera

In addition to the existing capacity, 20,000 additional beds will be made available, with 3,000 reserved for children. Currently, government hospitals have 15, 339 beds, of which 5,526 are general, 7,670 are equipped with oxygen supply, and another 2,143 are in Intensive Care Units ( ICU) Nodal hospitals will be Gandhi and Niloufer. The government is also working to establish pediatric oxygen plants. Extra rooms are being built in several district hospitals, mostly in areas where more cases were reported during the second wave. Though officials are confident that a probable third wave will not be severe in the state due to increased immunization, preventive measures are being made in view of the indications from Indian Medical Council Research (ICMR) about the third wave. “There were no deaths due to oxygen shortage during the second wave, and we will deal with it better this time,” a top official said. Few days ago, the state government ordered that all private hospitals install required Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) oxygen plants in various categories based on their bed capacity. The health department is attempting to increase vaccine campaign in addition to enhancing bed capacity. Though the state government has resumed administering the initial dose of Covid-19, stock in many vaccination centres is restricted, and only a few people are able to get their first jab. Mobile vans were deployed in the GHMC area to vaccinate those who had not yet received their first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-braces-for-3rd-wave-ups-no-of-beds-o2-capacity/articleshow/85336905.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The reason — a state government stipulation making a Covid negative report or double vaccination certificate mandatory for travellers heading to popular travel destinations and the urge from responsible travellers to choose destinations closer home where test reports are not mandatory yet. “Our resorts at Raj Kutir in the city and Ganga Kutir in South 24 Parganas are completely booked over the weekend. We are in any case accommodating 50% of patrons and taking all necessary Covid protocols,” said Nitin Kohli, director, Ambuja Neotia Hospitality. At Ibiza, The Fern Resort & Spa, authorities said the turnout of guests was satisfactory since the beginning of ease of restrictions following the second wave, but the footfall has certainly peaked over the Independence Day weekend. “We are quite hopeful that it will prevail during the run up to the Puja and on the Puja days,” said Subhadip Basu, general manager of the resort. Eco resorts closer to the city like Breathing Earth in Usthi, Bongheri in Kultali and Kotrakhali in Canning also have all their rooms and cottages booked. Biprodas Chakraborty of Digha Hoteliers Association said that to lure tourists over the weekend, hotels across the beach town has started accepting rapid antigen test reports. “But we need to be careful. We are not encouraging unnecessary travel and most importantly people should always have their masks on,” said virologist Rahul Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weekend-getaways-near-city-a-hit-as-citizens-want-short-safe-vacation/articleshow/85336920.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Hyderabad||Many afflicted with breakthrough infection after first vaccine dose||Hyderabad: Covid-19 breakthrough infections (infection after being vaccinated) are being reported across many private hospitals in the city, but the severity of the infection is often mild to moderate. On the plus side, no deaths have been reported in vaccinated people thus far. According to Telangana Super Speciality Hospitals Association (TSHA) president Dr B Bhaskar Rao, 2 to 3 per cent of Covid-19 admissions are due to breakthrough infection. “However, those who follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour after vaccination will not be infected. Vaccines have proven to be effective against mortality,” he said. Doctors in private hospitals observe that most people develop a breakthrough infection after the first dose. “Infection is less in individuals who received the second dose and finished one month after the second dose with full antibody protection than in those who just had the first dose,” said Dr Y Sridhar, critical care expert at Apollo Hospitals. “We began a study to understand the pattern of breakthrough infection,” he said. A few other private hospitals are also currently engaged in conducting studies on the breakthrough infection. Former director of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology Dr Rakesh Mishra said most occurrences of breakthrough infection are mild. “In collaboration with a private hospital, we are also looking into the pattern of breakthrough infection,” he said. He said there was no need to be concerned about the emergence of breakthrough infections because their number is very small in comparison to the total number of people vaccinated. Another recent trend in private hospitals is the administration of an antibody cocktail to patients with breakthrough infections as a quick measure. “Those who can afford it and have a mild infection seek this treatment,” Dr Sridhar explained. Officials from Gandhi Hospital also said that they are monitoring the impact of the cocktail dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/many-afflicted-with-breakthrough-infection-after-first-vaccine-dose/articleshow/85336928.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

But these issues can be resolved. We can’t risk their lives showing these as reasons to reopen the school,” said Venkat Sainath K, joint secretary, Hyderabad Schools Parents Association. He said that the state should first conduct physical classes for students over the age of 18 who are already vaccinated and then the state should monitor the situation and make a decision accordingly. Parents said that schools should take feedback from parents on whether or not they are willing to send their wards to school amid the pandemic, especially ahead of an impending third wave. “I don’t think many parents want to send their children to school. We are already seeing quite a few cases of children getting tested positive for Covid-19 in other states which have resumed physical classes. I don’t think such a decision should be taken in haste,” said Shantha K, whose children are class 10 and class 4. She added that children have already adjusted to online classes. Some parents, however, said that it is not a bad idea to open schools at least on alternate days or twice a week for school students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-person-classes-for-those-vaccinated-first/articleshow/85336950.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The flying squads led by the designated officer - the deputy collector and SDM Bicholim, Deepak Vaingankar noticed no active sand extraction in progress and no labourers on site, but only found stacks of sand which were put back into the river with the help of a JCB machine, he submitted to the high court. The raids were conducted in Camurlim, Pernem, Amona, Bicholim, St Estevam, Chorao, Siolim, Odxel. The high court called for a report from the officer after it received complaints that no action was being taken against illegal sand mining in North Goa. One complainant also wrote to the court providing particulars of sand extraction taking place. In contrast, the designated officer for South Goa and deputy collector Dharbandora, Kedar Naik submitted to the high court that it seized 28 unregistered canoes, ten trucks, five suction pumps attached to canoes and one JCB machine. The canoes seized have been handed over to the captain of ports for action. Three persons were also arrested under Section 379 IPC for theft of public goods. The raids in South Goa were conducted at various sites in Ponda, Sanguem, Quepem and Curtorim. Both the officers stated that registers are maintained of the complaints received. Once received and noted, appropriate action is taken. If illegal sand extraction is found, the extracted sand is dumped back into the river. “I say that in most of the inspections/raids, no active sand mining was noticed. However, at certain places, stacks of sand were found. I say that wherever such stacks were found, the team used the JCB machine to put the sand back into the river. I say that the raids to ascertain whether there is still any activity going on will continue further,” Vaingankar stated. “… though the monsoon season has set in and during such times, instances of sand mining are very rare, I will ensure that if there is any information received about any such activity going on at any particular place, raids will be conducted with the help of the flying squad and appropriate action will be taken in the matter,” Vaingankar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/not-found-active-illegal-sand-mining-flying-squad-tells-hc/articleshow/85338863.cms||---

Now that the requirements in education, policies and others are changing, Pune needs to regain its status as a thought leader. Institutions need to offer holistic education in line with the National Education Policy. The offerings must not be skewed towards just STEM, but also towards humanities and social sciences. Pune should ultimately become a global city for knowledge Bhushan Patwardhan | national research professor, AYUSH, Savitribai Phule Pune University What I would love for this city’s future is for it to retain its special culture and also grow into a prosperous metropolis over the years, out of Mumbai’s shadows. With its strong base of education, manufacturing industry and software or IT talent pool, Pune deserves to grow into a top commercial centre in India. What is needed is world class infrastructure. A unique prosperous metro with a special soul that is rich in culture is my vision for my Pune Sulajja Firodia Motwani | founder and CEO, Kinetic Green The city has and will continue to have good educational institutions, as well as new activities like shopping malls in the next 75 years. But I fear about basic infrastructure not matching up with all this. I have lived in Pune for 72 years now. Pune had a wonderful opportunity for growth and development after the floods on July 12, 1961. Then municipal commissioner S G Barve had proposed a master plan for the city, to spare 100 feet on either side of the river bank where there would be no construction. Satish Alekar | actor, playwright I want Pune to be the cultural capital of the world, not just Maharashtra. I wish traffic becomes more organised and we move to electric transport and have small concert halls and more green areas in every ward to showcase art and talent. Some things, like Vaishali, Roopali, Chitale and Shreyas, that have been there since my childhood should not change. Seems like a dream, but I am an optimist Rahul Deshpande | vocalist, composer, actor How do you wish or predict for a city that already is so liveable and lovable; has commendable history and its residents are constantly making history.

The staff, who alleged a lack of transparency, said that even during the previous months they were paid only a portion of what was promised.Corporation sources said that they had invited nursing graduates and diploma holders to work for the civic body on contract during the second wave of Covid-19. In the mid of April, 12 staff nurses and nine lab technicians were recruited for taking samples for RT-PCR test from the vulnerable areas and 18 urban primary health centres.The contractual workers said that they had executed all the duties as carried out by the regular staff. While monthly salaries for April and May were disbursed, the staff nurses and lab technicians said that the salary for June 2021 and a half of July 2021 is still pending. “Our service was terminated by the end of June, but later we were asked to report back on July 19 for the vaccination programme. We are content in serving people during the pandemic but we find it difficult to support our families owing to the delayed and reduced wages,” a 28-year-old staff nurse said on condition of anonymity.Another staff nurse, who has vaccinated hundreds of residents in the recent week, said that they were paid only Rs9,500 in May, while Rs14,000 was promised at the time of recruitment. “There is no clarity in the salary deduction. We were told that the deduction was for the provident fund. Around Rs4,500 was deduced from our monthly pay,” another staff nurse said. The health workers said that they are afraid of demanding the salary with the authorities fearing backlash.“The issue was not brought to our notice so far.

It has made inclusive progress on several fronts. But the apathy and inadequacy of government and public policies towards art have often forced artists to seek the common man’s support for survival. It is sad that there is no provision for mass education in performing art. There is also no national cultural policy.

I am confident that India will emerge as one of the top five countries in the world in healthcare in the near future. We need to bring our healthcare services within the reach of the poor and needy.

When I am still in a state of osmosis to comprehend the long-term consequences of the paradigm shift in our socio-cultural-political values over the last decade, this fresh alarm is deafening. The common element underlying these shifts is that both are human-caused. When we are celebrating our 75th Independence Day, I am in no mood to endorse despair or abandon hope. That we have survived through a catastrophic pandemic and global lockdowns itself invigorates hope. Let us hold hands and lead ourselves to the constitutional reality articulated by the framers of the Indian Constitution, ensuring equality, secularism, egalitarian justice, freedom from hatred based on caste, religion, gender and the basic right to exist. Wish: Idea of Bharat was not a delusional belief but was indeed a reality. Let us restore it Secularism, social harmony key Lt Gen B T Pandit (retd) Vir Chakra awardee for contributions to 1971 Indo-Pak war As an independent nation, the country has made progress on many fronts. But I still feel we could have done much better than. The gap between the below poverty line and the middle class is huge even today. We need to bridge it at the earliest. Though we brought in reservation in each sector, we haven’t achieved the desired results. Today’s demand for more reservation validates that a big section of society is still behind. We need to overcome this issue. Our neighbour China, despite having the population issue, has made tremendous progress. India also should progress rapidly to become a superpower in the region.

No action has been taken so far against the alleged land grabbers. TDP’s GHMC minority vice-president Mohammed Ahmed told STOI that such encroachment showed the carelessness of the concerned departments towards protecting public properties. He also demanded immediate action those behind the demolition. “While the matter was brought to the notice of all concerned authorities, no action has been initiated in this regard,’’ he said Locals said that they had objected to unlawful demolition of the public toilet in the area and called for authorities to intervene. “I have seen a shed come up to hide the old structure. The debris was removed and other structures will surely come up if authorities fail to take action,’’ said Zubair, a resident of the area.

M/s. Aatash Norcontrol Ltd. is a joint venture between M/s Aatash Computers and Communications P Ltd. (Indian company) and M/s Kongsberg Norcontrol IT AS (Norwegian company). This company is engaged in construction and operation of vessel traffic and ports management system (VTPMS) and it provides navigation services to the vessels,” mentioned a note by ED. The ED registered a case of money laundering on the basis of an FIR registered by CID Crime against ANL and others for committing a fraud of Rs 134.38 crore against Gujarat Maritime Board. GMB had awarded a contract to ANL to build and operate ‘Vessel Traffic & Port Management System’ (VTPMS) for Gulf of Khambhat. During investigation, it was found that ANL had submitted exaggerated cost of the project to GMB and thereby “misled the GMB into fixing higher tariff rates for navigation of vessels”. The VTPMS infrastructure became operational in August 2010. ANL started collecting VTS fees from vessels as per the concession agreement. By resorting to the false and fabricated cost of the project, ANL allegedly received excess payment to the tune of Rs 134.38 crore during the concerned period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gmb-scam-ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-134cr-of-anl/articleshow/85337012.cms||---
---||Agra||Over 800 ineligible ‘farmers’ benefited under PM Kisan scheme in Agra region||Agra: During a cross-verification of the beneficiaries under the PM Kisan scheme ordered by the state government, more than 800 ineligible beneficiaries have been identified in Kasganj district. Each of these individuals availed at least one instalment of Rs 2,000 under the central government scheme. According to the agriculture department officials, in the majority of cases, both husband and wife received the scheme benefit. People who had died or had no agricultural land also enrolled for the scheme. Recovery notices are being issued now, and the district administration has ordered a probe. Under the PM Kisan scheme, financial benefits of Rs 6,000 per year were announced for small and marginal farmers having total cultivable holding of up to two hectares. The amount is provided in three equal installments of Rs 2,000 each in four months during the financial year. Kasganj district agriculture officer Sumit Chauhan said, “Total 2,09,088 farmers registered under the PM Kisan scheme were credited with Rs 2,000 in their bank accounts. During the cross-verification process ordered by the state government, 804 ineligible beneficiaries have been identified. These people had provided wrong details to avail the Kisan Samman Nidhi. We are issuing recovery notices to them. The entire matter is being investigated in detail.” “There must have been major flaws in the verification process that the ineligible applicants managed to avail the benefit of the scheme. Suitable action will be taken to ensure such cases do not surface again,” Chauhan said.Besides Kasganj, such cases have surfaced in Agra, Firozabad and Etah districts. Here the cross-verification process is yet to be completed. Last year, 15,000 ‘ghost beneficiaries’ of the PM Kisan scheme had surfaced in Firozabad district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/over-800-ineligible-farmers-benefited-under-pm-kisan-scheme-in-agra-region/articleshow/85332999.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Mumbai||Mallakhamb didn’t make it to the Olympics but sport soars in Japan||Not transition. Transaction. That's what the interval between one gravity-defying position and the next is called in mallakhamb, Dadar-based Himani Parab tells us. As one of two mallakhamb world champions from Mumbai who had been chosen to demonstrate the native sport at the Tokyo Olympics this year, 20-year-old Parab had spent the last month practising signature transactions on a rope at Shivaji Park along with 24-year-old fellow athlete Deepak Shinde who collapsed from his trademark handstand into a shoulder plank on top of the nearby teakwood pole in the run-up to the closing ceremony. But when the invitation from Tokyo never came, the hopes of these rubber-bodied athletes, too, needed a crash mat. "It was in the 1936 Olympics in Germany that India had last demonstrated mallakhamb," says Shinde, referring to the time an unofficial team of musclemen from Amravati had impressed Hitler with their indigenous moves. "He had even given them a medal," says Shinde, dejected at the loss of an opportunity that had come after 85 years. Had things gone according to plan, Shinde, who had won two gold and three silver medals at the 2019 Mallakhamb World Championship (MWC) in Mumbai, would have headed the men's team while Parab, who won four gold and two bronze medals at MWC, would've led a seven-member women’s squad in Tokyo last week. As per the proposal of the Mallakhamb federation of India (MFI) which along with the non-profit mallakhamb federations of USA (MFU) and Japan (MFJ) had approached the international Olympics committee about the possibility of demonstrating the indigenous game in Tokyo, a 22-member double-vaccinated squad of 14 players, eight coaches and officials from the nooks of Rajasthan, Amravati and Chattisgarh was prepared to impress the world with the game that Vivek Sable of MFJ calls the "perfect exercise". "Unlike gyms where you use various machines for various body parts, here, two pieces of equipment work on the entire body--the pole and the rope," says Sable. At the moment, Japan boasts 15 trained mallakhamb athletes thanks to MFJ which was registered as a non-profit earlier this year. If logistical challenges mean that the country has just one eight-foot teakwood mallakhamb pole imported from India, language barrier makes importing Indian coaches redundant. What helps promote the sport in this scenario, is the recent celebrityhood of cheese-naan-loving acrobatic pole dance gold medallist Keiko Takemoto. After she returned from Mumbai in 2019 with three mallakhamb world championship medals – two golds in women’s short and long set pole mallakhamb, and one bronze in the all-round category--major Japanese news channels took notice while some Japanese schools screened a video of her mallakhamb world championship journey as part of "lessons on Indian culture". A staff member at Tokyo university, Takemoto was deep in the pursuit of stamina and muscular strength when she stumbled on mallakhamb on a video-sharing platform in 2012. The spell of its controlled yoga poses was immediate. "Between 2012 and 2015, I travelled to India six times for training," says Takemoto, who found herself executing the Bajrangi among other "elements" (poses) at academies in Mumbai and Pune even as her washboard tummy performed cultural dismounts. "I made sushi for an Indian family and tasted pani puri," says Takemoto, who now allows herself to eat cheese naan and butter chicken masala at Indian restaurants in Japan twice a week while sticking to an otherwise strict diet during her prep for the next mallakhamb world championships. Set to be in 2022 in New York, the audience at this event might include members of the International Olympic Committee, hints Sable. Despite this international spotlight--PM Narendra Modi even spoke about the growing appeal of the sport in the US in his recent Mann Ki Baat broadcast--finding a job remains a struggle for most mallakhamb athletes in the state, points out Shinde, who has been doing the rounds of offices of sports authorities with his resume since last year. "In states like MP and Karnataka, national-level mallakhamb athletes automatically qualify for government jobs but in Maharashtra, where the sport was born, mallakhamb has not yet made it into the list of games that promise direct recruitment," says the 24-year-old who finds his distinction in MCom as financially useless as his shiny mallakhamb world championship medals. Would things be different if mallakhamb makes it into the Olympic roster as a participating sport just as Japan's skateboarding did this year? Shinde doesn't know. "But at least, our medal tally would improve," he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mallakhamb-didnt-make-it-to-the-olympics-but-sport-soars-in-japan/articleshow/85338766.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

---||Kochi||Lakshadweep gets satellite connectivity of high capacity||Kochi: In a bid to provide a fillip to connectivity facilities in the Lakshadweep archipelago, BSNL on Saturday launched a high capacity satellite-based connectivity facility for the islands. Lakshadweep administration claimed that with the launch of the project, islanders will have better accessibility towards various broadband services and e-governance initiatives of the Lakshadweep administration. The administration, in a statement, said that BSNL has now installed and commissioned new hardware which will allow 1,500 Mbps capacity. “With this, Lakshadweep’s bandwidth is set to increase by 70%, taking the available bandwidth to 1.71 Gbps. The increased bandwidth will translate into better telecom services, with lesser call drops and fewer call congestion. The improved data services will benefit islanders as well as tourists visiting the islands. Further, it will allow Lakshadweep administration to provide services electronically, and students will also have greater learning platforms online,” the administration said. Minister of state for communications Devusinh Chauhan dedicated the project to the nation. “This is only the beginning of a new era in Lakshadweep. Already BSNL has started working on laying the submarine cable between Kochi and Lakshadweep and also on another project of augmentation of satellite connectivity from 1.71 Gbps to 3.46 Gbps. This shows the commitment of the present government under the leadership of our Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi to digitally integrate all parts of the country into one Digital India platform,” Chauhan said. The project was inaugurated through a video conference which was attended by the minister of state, administrator of the Union Territory Praful Khoda Patel and various senior officials of Lakshadweep administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lakshadweep-gets-satellite-connectivity-of-high-capacity/articleshow/85337040.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand government tapping our phones: BJP leader Babulal Marandi||RANCHI: BJP leader Babulal Marandi on Saturday stirred a hornet’s nest by accusing the Hemant Soren government of tapping the phones of his party colleagues illegally but it was met with a vehement denial from the ruling parties in the state. Marandi’s allegations, which were without any substantive evidence, came at a time when his own party government at the Centre is charged with using the Israeli spyware Pegasus to illegally snoop on telephones of several people in the country. Talking to TOI over the phone, Marandi said, “I have been hearing that of late the ruling dispensation has increased its surveillance of big and small workers of BJP in the state out of political vendetta. Many who are connected with me have expressed fear about it saying how the government is using phone tapping as a tool to track their whereabouts and activities. “Officials working at the direction of the government on such illegal activities must always remember that no government is in power for eternity. They must also take lessons from history that anyone doing such illegal acts will have to pay sooner or later,” the former chief minister warned. While Marandi did not provide any proof to back his claims, he, however, said he will bring it out at the right time. In the past, former minister Saryu Rai, who was part of Raghubar Das cabinet in the previous BJP regime, had accused his own government (read chief minister Rabhubar Das) of surveillance using the special branch of police. Denying Marandi's charge, JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharjee asked him to file a complaint before a competent authority if he has proof of his allegations. "Babulal ji must also reveal the names of all those whose phones are being tapped if he has the information. He must also complain before a competent authority on this issue rather than just making baseless allegations. The reality is that all BJP leaders are today terrified because of their wrongdoings by their past governments. BJP is only putting Babulalji on the front to rake up non-issues," Bhattacharjee said. Marandi, however, said his brand of politics has always been based on issues and maintained that any government resorting to illegal surveillance of politicians is bad in democracy. Citing an example of surveillance in the early 2000s when he was the CM, Marandi said, “Once I learnt that some MLAs were huddling in Tamar for a secret meeting. A senior official of the state police then suggested to me that he secretly puts them under detention and keep constant vigil over them to prevent any untoward incident. But I had strongly rejected the idea as I believe that politicians must never be kept under any kind of such surveillance, irrespective of which government is in power. I am okay if the police keep criminals and Naxals on their radar.” He, however, didn’t comment on the Pegasus row which broke last month. In the past, Marandi had dubbed the controversy as an attempt by anti-BJP and anti-Modi camp’s to defame the country and the prime minister. Meanwhile, Congress advised Marandi to question their leader (Modi) on the surveillance rather than make accusations against the state government. Party spokesperson Alok Dubey said, “Babulal ji doesn’t have to be wary about the JMM-Congress-RJD government in this state as it is for the people and by the people. Rather than levelling baseless allegations, he along with the state BJP unit must question Modi ji if and why his government resorted to illegal surveillance using the Israeli software. Even the Supreme Court has recently expressed concern over it and stated that a detailed probe must be done if the reports of the Pegasus Project were true.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-govt-tapping-our-phones-babulal/articleshow/85337456.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Union minister Nitin Gadkari flays Shiv Sena for ransacking NHAI contractor’s vehicles||NAGPUR: A month after Shiv Sena activists allegedly ransacked vehicles of a NHAI contractor in Washim, and also set machinery on fire, Union transportation minister Nitin Gadkari has dashed off an angry letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, requesting him to seriously look into the issue. Warning that NHAI would need to stop all work if such illegal activities continued, the senior BJP cabinet minister leader squarely blamed local Sena leaders and activists for obstructing works that led to inordinate delay in road construction, said NHAI officials. “It came to my notice that these leaders are making unauthorised demands from the contractors. They are harassed and threatened in case the demands were not fulfilled. They’re creating hurdles in many projects, particularly in Washim district,” the city MP mentioned. After the letter was received by the chief minister’s office (CMO), Thackeray ordered home minister Dilip Walse Patil to conduct an inquiry and act against the culprits. Subsequently, the state DGP was asked to act immediately and the local police booked several persons, including Sena activists, under various offences. The home department had sought a complete report from the DGP in this regard. Gadkari’s July 25 letter was reportedly leaked from the home department. The Union ministry of road transport and highways had sanctioned a large number of projects in Maharashtra. Many of those have been completed and others are in progress. Four lanes of Akola to Nanded 202km national highways are being constructed in four packages. Package-2 from Gedshi to Washim also includes construction of a bypass (length 12km) for Washim city. However, the Shiv Sena leaders allegedly stopped the work on the bypass and the main road. “The work on Malegaon to Risod highway has been completed except for one bridge on the Painganga river. The contractor has been stopped completing it by public representatives. Whenever he restarts work, the activists threaten him. We’ve urged the contractor to finish remaining work as early as possible in available resources,” the BJP heavy weight mentioned in his letter. The Union ministry has also undertaken works of Rs 135 crore on highways passing through Pulgaon-Karanja-Malegaon-Mehkar and Sindkhedraja, which is in worst condition and even a PIL has been filed in Nagpur bench of Bombay high court in this regard. “I was informed that the work in Washim district, especially the road work passing through Selu Bazar village, was stopped by Sena workers. When the contractor resumed work as per the people’s demand, the Sena workers set the contractor's machinery on fire that led to panic among his officers, employees and workers. It led to stoppage of the work again,” Gadkari said. In the backdrop of such incidents, Gadkari said they need to reconsider whether NHAI’s various works in Washim should be continued or not. “If we leave these works midway, those would be unsafe for the road users and lead to accidents. Eventually, the public would suffer. If these works need to continue, you need to intervene and find a way out,” Gadkari told Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkari-flays-sena-for-ransacking-nhai-contractors-vehicles/articleshow/85337091.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||In a first, Nagpur Municipal Corporation blacklists advertisement agency over pending dues||NAGPUR: Probably for the first time, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has blacklisted an advertisement agency for not clearing its arrears. The action is part of the plan to increase civic body’s revenue from advertisements. NMC deputy commissioner Milind Meshram terminated the contract and also blacklisted M/s Yash Outdoors on August 6. Meshram told TOI, “NMC has 550 advertisement banner stands on footpaths across the city. Yash Outdoors was given contract for displaying advertisements on these banner stands on December 14, 2018. After a grace period of one month, the agency was supposed to pay revenue finalized as per the tender conditions to the NMC every quarter. The agency paid revenue for two quarters and then stopped,” he said. Meshram added Rs3.32 crore is due from the agency. “Notice was issued to the agency directing to clear arrears within 30 days on March 12. But the agency did not pay. Yash Outdoors on April 7 requested for 60 more days. However, the agency failed to clear the dues even after that. Therefore, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B ordered action against the agency,” he said. The NMC advertisement department has sent letters to all 10 zones to ensure no more advertisements of the agency are displayed on the banner stands. Instructions have also been given to initiate action in case of continuation of advertisements by the agency there. This is probably for the first time in the history of NMC’s advertisement department that a private agency has been blacklisted for arrears. Many agencies are yet to pay arrears for last many years. Meshram said action will be initiated against all agencies to recover dues. As per directives of Radhakrishnan, Meshram and his team from NMC advertisement department has floated a tender for appointing a private agency for conducting survey to identify new sites for hoardings, banners etc. The agency will also suggest offset value of the existing and new hoardings, banners as per current market value as the same was not revised by the civic body for the last 20 years. The agency will also be responsible to identify illegal hoardings and inform the NMC about it. The NMC is also expecting the agency to give measures to increase the revenue from existing hoardings, banners etc. The revenue of the NMC from advertisement sources is less than Rs5 crore per annum, which is very less in a city spread in 222 sq.km area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-a-1st-nmc-blacklists-ad-co-over-pending-dues/articleshow/85337188.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

He was speaking on ‘India’s integrity and Urban Naxals’ at a webinar organized by department of humanities of Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University. Agnihotri, who has authored a book ‘Urban Naxals: The making of Buddha in a traffic jam’, explained how Naxalism started from Naxalbari, a village in West Bengal, in 1960s. He said, “Today, India’s biggest problem, which should be the country’s strength, is our youth. India has the world’s largest youth population. There is bubbling energy among students that keeps the country young. The youth belonging to middle class are aware of the hardships their parents go through. But when they enter college, the proponents of Left leaning ideology “brainwash” them, just like the Taliban groom children to become suicide bombers.” “Thus colleges become the door to Urban Naxalism,” he claimed, adding this is the condition of all universities in metro and mini-metro cities. “Slowly, they start focusing only on the fault lines in the country like casteism, poverty, women’s rights issues etc. They fail to acknowledge the country’s greatness, where it stands and what the future holds because they have been “brainwashed”. This is India’s biggest threat,” he said. Agnihotri added, “The style of communism to sprout internal war in a country is by planting the seeds of revolution. The fire of revolution is set in a way that it continues to burn and communist countries like China dominate with fuelling anarchy and keep an administrative influence on internal security.” RTMNU pro vice-chancellor Sanjay Dudhe chaired the online lecture. Senate and management council member Vishnu Changde and former city mayor Kalpana Pande were also present. Dean of humanities Prof Nirmal Singh was the convener. Dudhe said, “Country faces two types of threats — internal and external. External forces can be dealt with as these are recognizable. But it is not easy to tackle internal ones. Earlier, presence of Naxalites was limited to tribal communities living in forests. But now they are pervading cities in order to advocate their ideology among the masses and they are targeting students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/urban-naxalism-bigger-enemy-of-india-than-pak/articleshow/85337245.cms||---

The progress and prosperity of Goa can be attributed to the atmosphere of peace and harmony prevailing in the state. The people of Goa are renowned for their warm hospitality and social amity,” the governor said on the eve of Independence Day. Further, he said that the government is eager to revive the economy particularly the tourism and mining sectors once the pandemic subsides and is taking necessary steps in this direction. “The state government has worked energetically for the development of the state by providing infrastructure in the form of roads, railways, airports and bridges,” he said, adding, “Over the last one year, the grid separator at Dabolim Airport, the floating jetty at river Mandovi and the high court complex at Porvorim have been completed and commissioned. Besides several major projects under the Japan International Corporation Agency to expand water supply and sewage treatment have been completed and commissioned.” Pillai added that the new eight-lane Zuari Bridge is under completion and the first lane is planned to be opened in December 2021. “The work of construction of the new international airport at Mopa is progressing at a rapid pace and it is expected to be completed by December 2022. The historic Aguada Jail has been converted into a heritage museum and is scheduled to be inaugurated shortly by the Prime Minister,” he added. He further said that while aiming for the betterment and development of the state, it is important that we also protect our forests and the environment. Pillai conveyed his wishes on the 75 years of India’s Independence. “The state government, under the able leadership of young and dynamic chief minister Pramod Sawant has managed the Covid situation in Goa well.I would like to applaud all health workers and frontline warriors who have worked hard and tirelessly in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. I would also like to appreciate the support and cooperation given by the people of Goa in combating the virus. The vaccination programme in Goa is progressing well and nearly 80% of the eligible population has been covered with at least one dose. It is extremely important that even after vaccination, people must follow Covid appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks, adhering to social distancing and maintain hygiene.” “Today we can take legitimate pride of the fact that Goa is reckoned among the most developed states in the country. It is a matter of great satisfaction that Goa enjoys the highest per capita income. The uniform civil code of Goa has drawn praise not only from the President of India but also from former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, S A Bobde,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-committed-to-safety-of-all-guv/articleshow/85337429.cms||---

The move comes after Calangute sarpanch Shawn Martins had a meeting over the issue with ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo and chief minister Pramod Sawant. “These touts were everywhere on the main road, in Calangute and Baga, specially near the Piety chapel on the Baga road. They would stop the tourists and pull them to some dubious places, offering them all kinds of shady services. We had informed the police, but they were not doing anything about it,” Martins told TOI. “We met the CM and he immediately instructed the police to take action against the touts. On the same night, they rounded up a few,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-calangute-cops-crack-down-on-touts/articleshow/85337505.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Online classes on, but some HSS classes see textbook shortage||PANAJI: Teaching for the academic year 2021-22 for Class XI state board students has begun recently after Class X results were declared late last month. However, while classes have begun in the online mode, students are facing a shortage of some subject textbooks. Bookstore owners said there is a shortage of Class XI Hindi and English textbooks. For other classes too, textbooks are in short supply such as biology, chemistry and Hindi for Class XII. “In the case of Class IX, stocks of history textbooks have run out. And for Class X, Hindi textbooks are not available in the market as of now. So far, we had some books from the previous year in stock, which we have sold to students. But now we have to turn away students as no more textbooks in these subjects are available,” a Panaji-based book store owner said. Last year too, there was a delay in printing and supply of textbooks meant for state board school students from the state authorities. Book store owners maintain that it is an annual affair, while state officials have said that the pandemic has had an impact. Though the shortage is not as acute as last year, and textbook crunch is being faced only in the case of few subject books, students are photocopying these textbooks to tide over the crisis. Textbooks for Class I to VIII are printed by a Maharashtra-based agency and are provided to students directly by the Goa government under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/online-classes-on-but-some-hss-classes-see-textbook-shortage/articleshow/85337574.cms||---
---||India||GIC reports Rs 771 crore loss due to Covid deaths||MUMBAI: The second wave of Covid-19 has taken a major toll on the earnings of the General Insurance Corporation of India. The national reinsurer has recorded Rs 999 crore of claims in its life reinsurance book during the first quarter of FY22 as death claims surged due to the second wave of the pandemic. The spike in deaths resulted in a sharp jump in the combined ratio to 340%. The combined ratio reflects the percentage of claims and expenses to premium. In addition, the corporation provided an additional Rs 500 crore for losses on account of cyclone Tauktae and cyclone Yaas. The corporation has reported a loss of Rs 771 crore as compared to a profit of Rs 1260 crore in the quarter ended March 2021. Speaking to TOI, GIC chiarman Devesh Srivastava said, “The life insurance industry has had a setback due to Covid, although the future looks brighter, we took a very conservative approach as the aftermath of Covid is not fully known”. Although GIC Re does business with general insurers it also provides protection for life insurance companies if life claims spike. “Life insurance is a stable business and we will continue to underwrite it. This is a once in a hundred-year event,” he added. The corporation — in its results filing — said that it has had to shut down its Dubai office as its licence was not renewed by the Dubai authority. Following this, the corporation has decided to carry out its operations from GIFT City India. “GIC Re decided to place its Dubai branch into runoff because of non-renewal of licence by Dubai authority, non-compliance in solvency requirement etc,” the company said in its filing. The company said that it has already informed the Indian regulator of its decision on July 6. The corporation’s board also approved the decision on July 7 and decided to continue the activities relating to the Dubai branch from GIFT City. “We have major plans for growing operations in GIFT city,” said Srivastava GIFT (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) is the only International Financial Services Centre in India, which is the financial services equivalent of special economic zones focusing on exports. Companies here function like offshore entities and do business that would otherwise be done offshore. The GIFT IFSC regulator had recently issued regulations permitting Indian and foreign reinsurers to set up offices there. GIC had set up its international operations in Dubai in 2007 and had been providing reinsurance to the African continent. GIC also has permanent offices in UK, Malaysia and Russia. It also has three subsidiaries - GIC Re South Africa, GIC Re Corporate Member, London, and GIC Perestrakhovanie LLC, Moscow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gic-reports-rs-771-crore-loss-due-to-covid-deaths/articleshow/85340673.cms||---

The website will enable them to showcase their products and connect them with buyers not just from Goa, but also across the world. Chief minister Pramod Sawant will launch the website for the District Rural Agency (DRDA), North Goa, on Sunday. The website will be operated by the department of rural development through GSRLM state mission manager and the buyer will directly contact the SHG members for the delivery and payment of the products. A maximum of Rs 40,000 is being released under Pradhan Mantri Formalization of Micro Food Processing Enterprises Schemes (PMFME) to each beneficiary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/38-5k-members-of-self-help-groups-to-get-website-to-sell-products/articleshow/85337673.cms||---
---||India||Covid: Private hospitals seek nod for jabs at home||NEW DELHI: The average uptake or utilisation of anti-Covid shots in private hospitals is around 60-70%, while on some days it is even less than 10%, industry executives said raising concern about certain states and UTs not allowing door- to-door vaccination which, they say, can help in significantly expanding the coverage. With free vaccines available at government centres, private hospitals say their target audience is limited and therefore, innovative measures are needed to push the uptake and reach out to those who are still unvaccinated. A total of more than 53 crore doses were administered till Friday 9pm, of which 41.53 crore were given as first dose – covering over 46% of the 90 crore adult population. Nearly 13% of this population group has been fully immunised against Covid-19. “The private sector can play a very important role in ramping up the coverage, especially by reaching out to those who have restricted mobility. Around 7.2% of the population requires vaccination at their doorstep and is not getting it. Allowing private sector to take the vaccines to these people will help expansion of coverage at once,” said Dr Charu Dutt Arora, consultant physician and Covid care expert at Asian Institute of Medical Sciences.  States like Delhi and Haryana are yet to allow door-to-door vaccination against Covid-19, even as some like Maharashtra – which have recently started – are witnessing major gains in terms of coverage. Private hospitals are also for innovative measures and tools to reach out to those who are left. However, this may require hospitals to incur additional costs. “At the current service charge of Rs 150, it is not viable for most private hospitals to make extra efforts and organise camps in housing societies, corporates campuses etc because that includes several overheads,” a senior executive from a Delhi hospital said. Experts also underline the need to aggressively pursue those who are hesitant about vaccination. “There is a need to incentivise people for vaccination and disincentivise those who are not getting vaccinated since it can have socio-economic implication. Besides, also incentivise private sector so that they make efforts to reach out to those who are still remaining. Celebrity campaigns can also help address the hesitancy issue and instil confidence in many people,” says Commander Navneet Bali, Regional Director, Northern India, Narayana Health. Currently, out of the total 45,000-47,000 vaccination sessions per day, only about 2000-4000 are in the private sector, which has 25% of the total locally manufactured Covid vaccines earmarked for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-private-hospitals-seek-nod-for-jabs-at-home/articleshow/85340709.cms||Sushmi Dey

There was a strong gale and a high tide when the mishap occurred. The police have identified the deceased as Pukkala Yerayya (27) and his father Pukkala Gannaya (50) and Rayathi Narayana Swamy (55). The police said that the three fishermen went to the sea on Saturday morning for fishing in their country boat. While trying to sail through the high tide to go deep into the sea, they lost control over the boat due to a strong wind. The boat turned upside down drowning all the three. The fishermen attempted to swim towards the coast but drowned in the strong current. The police said the bodies of two fishermen washed ashore near Gullavanipalem under Polaki mandal. The body of Yerrayya was found near the coast. A pall of gloom descended on fishermen villages in Gara mandal. Animal husbandry and fisheries minister Sidiri Appalaraju spoke to senior officials and also assured the kin of the victims that the state will extend financial assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/3-ap-fishermen-die-as-boat-capsizes-at-sea/articleshow/85334052.cms||---

Inspector Renuka JM, 37, and her subordinates — sub-inspector Naveen Kumar, 32, assistant sub-inspector Ganesh N, 37, and constable Hemanth Kumar — are facing charges of accepting Rs 5 lakh bribe from Sudeep VV, an interior designer and accused in a cheating case. The officials are also facing charges of demanding more bribe from Sudeep to ensure he didn’t face arrest. Sudeep had recorded a mobile call in which one of the accused cops allegedly demanded the bribe and filed a complaint with ACB on July 20. “The petitioners appear to have engaged in extracting money from the informant (Sudeep) and if this is allowed to happen, people will lose faith in police,” judge Lakshminarayana Bhat K, special judge (PC Act), stated on August 9.  Hemanth and Ganesh had contended that they did not demand or accept any bribe. The duo admitted that they had brought Sudeep to the station in a cheating case but said the same cannot be termed illegal. Renuka argued that she had taken charge as inspector of Whitefield CEN crime police station on July 14 and the cheating case against Sudeep was registered on July 6 and she was not aware of the facts of the case.  The prosecution said there was evidence that the suspects demanded Rs 10 lakh as illegal gratification not to arrest Sudeep in a case registered against him and had collected Rs 5 lakh from him already. Renuka, Naveen, Ganesh and Hemanth were suspended on July 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-bail-for-four-cops-in-bribery-case/articleshow/85336147.cms||Santosh kumar.B

The department had already got a report from the health wing on the Covid-19 situation prevailing across the state before planning the road map for reopening of schools for the new academic year. School education director Vadrevu Chinna Veerabhadrudu issued orders directing schools, including corporate educational institutions, to provide free education to students, who lost their parents to Covid-19. The schools have also been directed to provide necessary books, study material, uniforms and shoes for free to students, who lost their parents during the pandemic. The government has assured that it will reimburse the amount spent on providing quality education for these students. The education department has also directed the school managements to conduct class works with only 50% of students on alternate days. The remaining 50% students will attend online classes. Parents call for continuing with 30% fee concessionPrivate school managements have been asked to focus on vaccinating their teaching and non-teaching staff as a preventive measure. Meanwhile, the school education department is yet to take a call on continuing the 30% concession given on school fees last year due to the pandemic. Parents are demanding the AP school education reforms and monitoring committee (APSERMC) to continue the fee concession for the current academic year. “The second wave has badly affected the middle class and poor families. Many of us have lost jobs and are facing severe financial crisis,” said Harish Chandra K, a parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/schools-to-reopen-tomorrow/articleshow/85334055.cms||Venu Lanka

Their complaint: Police patrol vehicles or Hoysalas are disturbing their sleep due to repeated blaring of sirens and tooting of horns. In July last week, police commissioner Kamal Pant had directed cops that patrolling Hoysalas should not spend over 10 minutes at any particular point, other than in emergencies. The direction was to ensure more visible policing, especially at night. At present, the city has 272 Hoysalas, including 108 pink ones dedicated to women-related issues. Equipped with GPRS, they are monitored from the command centre located on the premises of the top cop’s office. Earlier, Hoysalas would be parked for more than 30 minutes at designated points. “For two weeks, Hoysalas are not stopping at one particular point for more than 10 minutes, unless there is an emergency to attend to. Every police station jurisdiction is divided into four parts and one Hoysala has been assigned to roam around in each. If the vehicle is parked for more than 10 minutes at a point, we seek an explanation from its staff. As a result, physical movement of these vehicles has increased threefold,” a senior cop explained. “Besides visiting fixed points, Hoysalas can move around in desolate places and on areas like outer ring roads. However, they should keep command centre staff in the loop about their extra movements,” he said. An aged couple from Fraser Town recently called the police control room, saying the siren of police patrol vehicles was disturbing them. “Our neighbours are heart patients. Sudden honking and loud siren will cause panic at night,” they said. A couple of techies working from home in Banashankari II Stage too raised objections. “They stepped out and interacted with our Hoysala staff, requesting them not to honk or use the siren at night,” a police officer said. Crew told not to honk unnecessarily: Police Asked what remedies have been found for the complaints, the officer said: “We will not stop or decrease the movements of Hoysala vehicles. Instead, we have directed its crew not to honk or use sirens unnecessarily.” The new direction has enabled Hoysalas to reach the incident spot in around five minutes, another officer said. “Earlier, the target given to Hoysala vehicles to reach the place was seven to 10 minutes. This was not possible in all cases due to many reasons. Now, since Hoysalas are on continuous rounds, we can send the vehicle which is nearest to the scene of crime,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/siren-blaring-hoysalas-disrupting-sleep-residents/articleshow/85336208.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Despite having a staff crunch of over 50%, it has stood 6th by making 60% of disclosure, for all the indicators and information furnished by SPCBs and pollution control committees (PCCs), of the nation, with the public, in Kannada and English. A study, ‘Transparency Index: Rating of pollution control boards on public disclosure,’ conducted by Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), and released on August 11, has observed that KSPCB is the only pollution control board to provide detailed information on regulated entities in the state. KSPCB has provided information on a number of red, orange, green and white category industries, separately under industry, stone crushers, townships and residential areas, infrastructure projects, hospitality sector, mines, coffee estates, and numbers of telephone towers and offices having DG sets. The 60-page report, a copy is available with STOI, has said the disclosure of information in the public domain is one of the important functions of state pollution control boards, to increase public participation and public awareness in this realm. It critically evaluates the information shared by SPCBs and PCCs from 2016-21, and uses several indicators that provide a broader indication on the type and amount of information shared. It also aims to improve transparency in sharing information in the public domain by SPCBs and PCCs. However it has also noted that KSPCB and the West Bengal PCB have not made continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) data accessible to the public, but that it’s password protected. “Along with Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the KSPCB has adopted Xtended Green Node (XGN) software for sharing consent information. KSPCB has shared all information like industry name with the name of regional office under which it exists, category of industry, type of consent like fresh,renewal and expansion, the status of consent, inspection ID and CTO or CTE certificate,” the report stated. When it comes to information on compliance, only Karnataka has shared detailed information on the compliance status of water and air polluting industries, zone-wise, the report stated. The report has also noted that KSPCB has 334 working staff, and 52% vacant posts, against its total sanctioned strength of 709. Karnataka has stood one among 10 good performers in the state, in the transparency index.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/kspcb-hailed-for-giving-info-on-regulated-entities/articleshow/85334426.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Kochi||1947: Kochi royals recall India’s tryst with destiny||TRIPUNITHURA: “Memories of the first Independence Day celebrations are still afresh in my mind. Young princes of Kochi royal family gathered at Princes’ Palace located at Foreshore Road near present Kochi Fine Arts Hall,” recalled 95-year-old Mrunaalini Thampuran of Chandra Vilasam Palace, who is the present Valiyamma Thampuran (senior-most female member) of Kochi royal family. Though the majority of small provinces were against the concept of Independent India, the Kochi royal family embraced the much-awaited golden moment, Thampuran said. According to her, Kerala Varma, who was ruling Kochi state in 1947, was popularly known as Aikya Keralam Thampuran as he sowed the seeds of integration by patriotically arguing for a united Kerala even before the formal declaration of independent India in Delhi. “It was raining heavily on that day. There was heavy rain for about four days, but that didn’t douse our spirit of celebration,” said 92-year-old Subhadra Thampuran of Lakshmi Thoppu Palace, who is the Ilayamma Thampuran (second eldest female member) of Kochi royal family. “My history teacher at Maharaja’s College joked that it was raining heavily to wash off the 150 years of slavery that we suffered under the colonial rule,” said Krishna Rao (94). Mrunaalini Thampuran of Kochi royal familySoon after the official declaration of Indian independence at midnight of August 14, 1947, the Kochi king celebrated the landmark event at Thrissur Town Hall. The celebrations had already started on April 27, 1947. Even the three Royal educational institutions — Palace Girls school, Princes’ branch and Government Boys school — celebrated the first Independence Day in a memorable way. “The Congress leaders including Mahatma Gandhi were really surprised when they got a message from Aikya Keralam Thampuran citing his wish for the integration of Kerala by combining three provinces — Kochi, Travancore and Malabar,” said Dr Kocha Varma, the founder president of Cochin Royal Family Historical Society (CRFHS). The Kochi kings never desired any wealth or personal favours for merging with united India. “Years after the first Independence Day, when the last Kochi king Rama Varma Pareekshith Thampuran, a scholar among the Kochi kings, signed the merging treaty, the only thing he asked in return was just a ‘Panchankam’ ( an ancient astrological calendar),” recalled Vijay Kerala Varma of Valiya Padinjare Kovilakam, a young member of the royal family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/1947-kochi-royals-recall-indias-tryst-with-destiny/articleshow/85340760.cms||Sivadas Varma
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Communication device shoots down din of war||AHMEDABAD: King Henry says in Shakespeare’s ‘Henry V’: “When the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger…” But in the clamour of modern warfare even that advice will often transmit faintly in soldiers’ ears, so an IIT-Gandhinagar post-doctoral fellow has developed a device that helps communication leap like a tiger over the overwhelming din. Ceaseless fusillades of noise is a feature of today’s battles. It comes from the thunder of helicopter rotors, the guttural remorselessness of machine guns, and the crushing howl of artillery. But now, Chandan Kumar Jha, a post-doctoral fellow at IIT-Gandhinagar, has sought to give freedom to Indian soldiers to communicate clearly with their team members even in war zones, pounding with the reverberations of conflict. He has created a microphone thinner than a hair and an accompanying device the size of a phone that cuts out ambient distractions and allows clear communication. Jha was recently contacted by the DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) to submit an expanded proposal for further support to develop the product. In October 2019, Jha had won the first prize of Rs 5 lakh, besting 3,000 applicants, for this innovation at the DRDO’s Dare to Dream Contest where he had submitted a proof of concept. He was also invited to showcase his work at the DefExpo exhibition organized by the ministry of defence in February 2020. ‘Field testing likely this year’We have been improving the design and making it more sensitive and user-friendly. Field testing is expected to take place this year,” said Chandan Kumar Jha who earned a PhD in electrical engineering from IIT-Gandhinagar. According to several websites, soldiers in operations face an intense barrage of sound: ranging from 110 dB inside a helicopter to 190 dB when a howitzer is fired. To put the figures in perspective, the normal conversation takes place at 60 dB and the level inside a moving car is about 70 dB. “Having a background in biomedical engineering, my research after my doctoral studies focused on optical fibre technology and its applications,” said Jha. “It’s often a challenge to relay commands and information clearly when there’s so much noise in combat areas. Conventional microphones are unable to selectively pick up human voice or suppress the background noise.” Thus, his technology relies on sound directly emanating from the voice box and reduces ambient noise up to 120 dB. “The sensor itself is a piece of optical fibre and thinner than human hair and thus weighs nothing,” said Jha.

---||Nagpur||‘Signature and handwriting can reveal one’s personality’||Handwriting, like nature’s law, is unique to an individual. Just like no two things are identical in this world, so is handwriting. And here’s where the expertise of Rahul Puranik comes into play. This 45-year-old graphologist from Nagpur has scripted a special place for himself in the art and science of scrutinizing signatures. He can spot a difference between two handwritings without missing out even the minutest of details with immaculate precision. A television programme on Discovery Channel cracking criminal cases drew him towards graphology and that’s how he turned his curiosity into a profession. His services are often sought by the police in deciphering handwritings, letters and signatures of criminals, scamsters and terrorists. On routine days, professionals, businessmen, those suffering from depression etc seek his help in resolving their problems. He claims 90% success by suggesting alteration in their signatures. He has an impressive record of analyzing over 45,000 signatures and is recognized by the World Book of Records. He has worked with Gomantak-Goa, Hyderabad forensic lab, Nagpur crime branch and various nationalized and cooperative banks and analyzed signatures of over 500 celebrities and individuals across India and overseas. In a tete-a-tete with TOI, Puranik speaks about various aspects of graphology. Excerpts... Q. Is it true that you got attracted to graphology after watching Discovery channel? A. Watching overseas detectives cracking murder mysteries by analyzing handwriting or signature evoked a keen interest in me. It was a rare field then and not heard of, at least in the city. After my diploma from the British Institute of Graphology, I worked with Dilip Ahilwale, who’s an expert from Mumbai since 2005. Q. Which are the sectors where graphology is used? A. Apart from police and forensic investigations, many banks regularly invite graphologists to detect forgery in the signature on cheques. This field is basically related to psychology based on scientific evidence. My help is sought in cracking many high-profile cases but I can’t name them due to the sensitive nature of my work. Currently, I’m working for the Goa government. Q. Can you recall any memorable instance where you helped crack a case? A. I was once invited by an MP-based bank to find out their lost funds which belonged to unclaimed accounts. After scrutinizing the documents and signatures, I pointed out the role of a senior official from the same branch. It later came to the fore that the branch manager used to siphon off those funds to fake accounts and was arrested. Q. Do people approach you with personal issues? A. I’ve counselled men and women having suicidal tendencies. I analyze their handwriting and suggest ways, including a change in signature, to come out of depression. Many parents approach me with their wards for counselling about career choices. Even businessmen consult me to sort out monetary and other disputes. I’m invited by various companies when they conduct their interviews. Their human resource staffers are in touch with me. I’ve also resolved many matrimonial disputes by removing misunderstandings and trust deficit. They usually seek help in removing mental and even sexual anxieties. The biggest challenge is to explain to people what graphology is and how they can benefit. Q. You also advise politicians. A. I’m in touch with prominent political leaders, who often seek help, particularly during the elections. Q. Graphologists are often considered as fortune tellers. A. This is completely untrue. They can suggest ways like changing signatures and lifestyle but can’t predict the future. Our work mainly involves decoding alphabets, verification of writing specimens and documents among others. After 15 years of working as a consultant, I can explain 116 attributes based on signature like attitude, maturity, will power, confidence, mental state, worries, emotional stability and others. Q. You also guide clients regarding their handwriting. A. The handwriting and signature patterns mirror a person’s state of mind and his/her psychology and personality traits. A signature is a stylized form of writing, central to every individual’s identity. You sign your name thousands of times, so often that it becomes a completely automatic, mechanical act. As the subconscious mind is at work while writing, thoughts and emotions in the human mind have an immediate impact in the formation of handwriting. You can spot differences in your handwriting by comparing samples written in various moods — angry, happy, tired, or feeling sick. You will be able to see noticeable differences in the pen stroke, even though your handwriting style remains basically the same. Q. In what way do you guide your clients? A.

The government has so far recovered 1.4 crore, even as a departmental inquiry continues. It may be recalled that some officials of the revenue department indulged in the scam by selling fake challans and stamp papers in sub-registrar offices in several districts. The most number of such cases were detected in Kadapa and Krishna districts, said special secretary (revenue) Rajat Bhargava. The senior IAS officer, who is probing into the scam, told reporters on Saturday that the state incurred a loss of at least 5 crore due to scam. The department has so far found 10 officials guilty of the crime during the initial probe, he said. Bhargava said officials, brokers and buyers were involved in the scam and action would be initiated against all who are found to be guilty. The officials are now examining over 65 lakh documents on which transactions were carried out since March 2021 across the state. The intensity of the scam was more at Mandavalli sub-registrar office in Krishna district, he said, adding that the guilty would be severely punished. Brushing aside demands for a CID probe into the scam, Bhargava said once the departmental inquiry is completed, the police are capable enough to bring the culprits to book. He added that departmental inquiry has already identified those involved in the scam and more people would be taken into custody soon. “Fake challans were used in nine districts across the state to create fake documents so as to escape payment of tax to the stamps and registration department. The punishment would be severe,” Bhargava warned. He further said that chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is planning to launch registration activities at village and ward secretariats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fake-challan-scam-six-sub-registrars-suspended-in-state/articleshow/85334053.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Delhi||Vehicle scrapping: Delhi wants fitness as criteria||NEW DELHI: With the much-awaited national vehicle scrappage policy now in place, the Delhi government wants the criteria for scrapping or marking a vehicle ‘end of life’ in the capital to be fitness, and not age, as in the rest of the country. The state government is going to approach Supreme Court with a request to review its 2018 order prohibiting the plying of 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles in Delhi-NCR, in case the national policy doesn’t have a separate provision for the capital. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the national vehicle scrappage policy on Friday, with an aim of phasing out unfit and polluting vehicles. However, unlike Delhi-NCR, where driving a 15-year-old petrol or 10-year-old diesel-run car can invite penal action, with a fine of up to Rs. 10,000 or seizure and scrapping of the vehicle, the national policy requires 20-year-old personal vehicles and 15-year-old commercial vehicles to be scrapped, and that too only if the vehicle fails to pass fitness tests. “If the emphasis of the national vehicle scrappage policy is on fitness, why should Delhiites suffer?” Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI. “Once the policy is notified, we will study it and see whether it deals with the status of Delhi and the court order or not. If we find that it doesn’t deal with it, we obviously have the liberty to approach the court and request a review of the order,” he said. Supreme Court had on October 29, 2018, prohibited the plying of 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles in NCR and directed the transport department to announce that such vehicles will be impounded if found plying. Describing the pollution situation in Delhi-NCR as ‘very critical’, the apex court had also said that a list of such vehicles should be published on the website of the transport department. The transport department had issued ‘guidelines for scrapping of motor vehicles in Delhi’ in 2018 and had also authorised the first scrapper. Although the number of authorised scrappers is now five, the number of old vehicles scrapped till date is only around 3,000. While the national policy allows vehicles that have proper fitness to ply even if these are older, it will not be possible to implement this policy in Delhi because of the apex court’s order. Delhi government officials said they have been getting a lot of queries on the new policy from owners of vehicles that are nearing end of their life. They are being asked what it means for those whose vehicles are in a well-maintained and roadworthy condition. The government wants to apprise the court of the situation and request it for a review of its order. Although the Centre’s new policy allows re-registration of an old vehicle if it clears fitness tests, the cost of getting a fitness certificate for a 20-year-old vehicle is expected to be high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vehicle-scrapping-delhi-wants-fitness-as-criteria/articleshow/85335905.cms||Sidharatha Roy

It is for the first time that the tourist attractions in the suburbs are being shut down after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic when most of the facilities and tourist attractions remained out of bound for the public. Chengalpet collector A R Rahul Nadh said in a press release that entry will not be allowed for monuments in the coastal town of Mamallapuram as well as Kovalam beach, Mayajaal in Kanathur, Kandaswamy temple at Thiruporur on OMR and various temples on GST Road including Adhiparasakthi temple at Melmaruvathur and Vedanthangal bird sanctuary in the district for public on the day. The arrangement is an attempt to check the spread of Covid-19 cases, he added. The development comes in the wake of the district authorities contemplating the option of banning entry for tourists or reducing the visiting hours for attractions on ECR and Mamallapuram, after tourists thronged the attractions dotted across the entertainment corridor of the city during the weekend. Particularly, the footfalls for the monumenta maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had seen a spike since a fortnight ago. But, there was a significant drop in their numbers last week. R Stalin, a tourist guide based in Mamallapuram, said that the number of people visiting Mamallapuram had dipped by at least 50% during the past weekend. “This has further reduced on Saturday and there are absolutely no tourist vehicles from other states. Most of the travellers on Saturday were from neighbouring districts,” he said. Official sources said that revenue inspectors would coordinate with officials of other departments regarding the order pertaining to closure of tourist spots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/monuments-shut-in-tamil-nadu-no-getaways-today/articleshow/85340876.cms||---

The services had been suspended from May 1 after curbs were announced following rise in Covid cases during the second wave. Initially, the DHR will run six services daily, four with steam engine and two with diesel ones. DHR director Arvind Mishra said the decision to resume services followed the demand of tourists who were flocking to the Hills and the recent relaxations in restrictions announced by the state government. “We will resume the joy ride service from Darjeeling to Ghoom and back to Darjeeling from August 16. The other services will gradually resume as per demand. We will operate six daily joy rides. The steam locos will operate with two coaches and diesel locos with four coaches each,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dhr-to-resume-its-joyrides-tomorrow/articleshow/85337093.cms||Deep Gazmer

Bengal education minister Bratya Basu said: “People are crying and looking for shelter and support. They are facing state-sponsored terror in Tripura and BJP torture.” Trinamool leaders would stay put in Tripura to celebrate Independence Day and organize ‘Khela Hobe Diwas’ the day after. Basu wondered why the Tripura government was worried about the proposed visit of Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee to the state. “Why are you worrying if people in Tripura are with the BJP-led government in the state? The Trinamool didn’t object to the frequent visits by the PM, the Union home minister and a whole lot of Union ministers when they made a beeline for Bengal ahead of the assembly polls. The fact of the matter was that Mamata Banerjee won a decisive victory,” he said. TMC MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar held that women were unsafe in Tripura. “BJP men and police are threatening women in eight districts. These women have been reaching out to villages to spread the Bengal CM’s development message,” she said. TMC Rajya Sabha member Santanu Sen complained that the Biplab Deb government was trying to stop Trinamool from entering Tripura. “Hoteliers and tour operators have been asked to not provide accommodation and transport to us,” Sen said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-says-tripura-people-facing-state-sponsored-terror/articleshow/85337154.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Kolkata||Hallmark hurdle for city gold hub||Kolkata: Amid pandemic panic, caratage has proved to be a bigger concern. Even as the city’s gold hub at Bowbazar is yet to recover from the economic slowdown, the implementation of new BIS Regulations in June — requiring a mandatory hallmark certification for gold jewellery and artefacts — has further jeopardised jewellery businesses. “Bowbazar has been Kolkata’s gold hub for centuries. However, because of the Covid restrictions, the market has remained devoid of its usual hustle and bustle. The introduction of mandatory hallmarking has further slowed down business,” said Bablu Dey, working president of Swarna Shilpa Bachao Committee. Gold hallmarking is a certification of the purity of the precious metal to safeguard buyers against lower caratage. The BIS has been running a hallmarking scheme for gold jewellery since April 2000. However, it had always been voluntary. “We welcome and support the scheme of mandatory hallmarking. However, the registration process has been made online without updating the BIS portal and without considering that smaller jewellers do not have the kind of infrastructure or technology needed to implement a scheme of this kind,” Dey said. “The new marking system also leads to wastage,” he added. Chandrakanta Roy Chowdhury, a partner of MP Jewellers, said: “Lower footfall, sketchy policies and the pandemic have paralysed the jewellery sector that is, till date, the government’s biggest revenue earner. We can only hope to see some good sales in the future. But now that seems to be a distant proposition.” Partha Roy of J K Roy Jewellers also said the new model would make things difficult for small jewellers. Dey said the uncoordinated implementation of the hallmarking regime has dashed the hopes of improved business in the festival and wedding seasons. The gold industry has reached out to the government with suggestions. “The government should implement the hallmarking scheme as per the recommendations of the NITI Aayog Report titled ‘Transforming India’s Gold Market’, which was finalised and submitted in February 2018 after in-depth consultations with various stakeholders,” Dey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hallmark-hurdle-for-city-gold-hub/articleshow/85338335.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Girl raped, cops rescue accused from mob in Malda||MALDA: A Class IV student was raped by a trader in Malda’s Harishchandrapur on Friday, the eve of Kanyashree Divas. The accused was thrashed by furious villagers and had to be rescued by the police. Two cops were injured in the clash and a huge force deployed to control the situation. Nazrul Islam alias Bhola of Chandipur village would illegally buy rice from the poor in the area, who received it from ration shops. He would hoard it and later sell it at a high price. On Friday evening, the family of a daily labourer approached Islam to sell their rice. Islam agreed but insisted on weighing it in his godown. As the labourer’s two daughters went to the godown with the rice, he made the younger girl wait and took the older one inside. He allegedly raped the child and forced Rs 350 into her hands, before fleeing the scene. Bleeding, the girl returned home crying and told her mother what had happened. The news soon spread and a mob dragged Islam out of his home and assaulted him. A force from Harishchandrapur Police Station reached the spot to rescue him, but angry villagers also attacked the cops. An ASI and a civic volunteer were wounded as stones were thrown at them. A huge force led by the SDPO arrived to control the mob and Islam was arrested. He was charged under the POCSO Act and produced in court on Saturday. He was remanded in jail custody for 14 days. Inspector in-charge Sanjoy Das said: “The situation is under control and the girl was admitted to Chanchal Sub Divisional Hospital. Her statement will be recorded after she recovers.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/girl-raped-cops-rescue-accused-from-mob-in-malda/articleshow/85337242.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Kolkata||The Midas Touch||Kolkata: The steep price of gold has been both a gift and a curse for the jewellery industry. Popular brands have been compelled to modify designs, go lightweight and embrace e-marketing tools, but at the same time the buyer’s ‘safe investment’ choice has handed them a golden ticket out of the pandemic slump. Every piece of jewellery usually tells us a unique story. Collections across brands are currently spinning one tale that loudly and proudly says success is how high you bounce after you hit bottom. The jewellery industry in Bengal is on the cusp of a major transformation. Players, big and small, are recasting business policies and embracing innovative marketing strategies. Staggered sales amid the pandemic-induced lockdown and continuing Covid restrictions have prompted leading brands to open online shopping windows and doorstep delivery. The average customer has been obliging no less, hoping to make “a safe investment for an unforeseen future”. While the demand for gold is higher, wedding and other celebratory purchases include both diamond and platinum jewellery. Former vice-chairman of Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) Pankaj Parekh feels soaring gold prices have forced the industry to go “lightweight” to fit the shrinking pockets of the middle class buyer. “Use of low-karat gold and design modifications have taken place. Orders are being taken online and home delivery is being ensured. Innovative approach is the key. One thing we can say firmly is that we have not lost customers and turnover has been stable even if volume-wise there has been a drop,” he said. Lightweight jewellery clicks with Gen Z while the computer-aided design and manufacturing technology has been a game-changer for the industry, joint MD of PC Chandra Jewellers Suvro Chandra told TOI. “We are adapting to changes. Despite the jewellery business reeling from the effects of the pandemic, there is a demand because people tend to cut down on spending elsewhere and buy gold, which they still see as a safer investment,” he said. Suvro ChandraOn future plans, Chandra said: “Our company is trying to roll out new schemes to woo more buyers. We’d like to grow pan-India and internationally, apart from boosting online sales.” The pandemic has shown the industry that there is no substitute for gold, said Annargha Uuttiya Chowdhury, the director of Anjali Jewellers. “We are selling our products via video calls and delivering them on the buyer’s doorstep. The idea is to allow customers to choose from our stock as they would during a visit in person. Offline business may be slow, but people are coming to our stores that maintain Covid protocol. We plan to open multiple outlets in the future,” he added. Annargha Uuttiya ChowdhuryTanishq, a Tata product, has unveiled an exclusive line of gold and diamond jewellery called ‘Little Big Moments’. It is said to be “an ode to moments requiring a special celebration”. The chic designs mingle well with our daily lives and can go unnoticed, said GM (Marketing) Ranjani Krishnaswamy. “Customers are being offered up to 20% off on diamond jewellery value. There are several micro moments in our lives that can be celebrated with our new collection,” Krishnaswamy added. Ranjani KrishnaswamyWhen business is challenging, thinking out-of-the-box is imperative, believes Senco Gold & Diamonds CEO Suvankar Sen. “We are video-calling customers who can’t come to the store. Those who need jewellery for wedding or investment are buying even amid the pandemic. In the past year, more than 50% of customers have been active and retained. Others are waiting for the market to stabilise. We plan to grow slowly and steadily, with a limited number of new stores,” Sen said. Suvankar SenChandrakanta Roy Chowdhury, a partner in MP Jewellers, has a more aggressive business approach. He said the retail company wanted to open more stores in new regions to boost the buyer base. Chandrakanta Roy Chowdhury“Though online marketing and selling products through websites or apps are becoming popular, jewellery largely is a touch-and-feel kind of a product. Customers would want to try them out before purchase. Buying jewellery involves the conventional process of precise selection, touch and try and, of course, haggling over the price. All these together make up the age-old relationship between brands and their buyers — a bond no pandemic can perhaps break,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/the-midas-touch/articleshow/85338838.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Now, driving tests at night to shorten waiting time||NEW DELHI: Want to get a permanent driving licence? You may have to wait for a period of two weeks to more than two and half months for a slot, depending on where you live in Delhi. The Delhi government now plans to conduct driving tests at night to shorten the waiting time. While Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) are on their way out with the Delhi government offering ‘faceless services’ for all transport-related transactions, applicants would still need to visit an automated driving test track to get a permanent driving licence. To curb the spread of Covid-19, the Delhi government’s transport department has reduced the number of slots offered at test tracks to ensure social distancing. This, however, has resulted in a long waiting period to appear for a driving test in most of the busy zones. If one fails the stringent test at the automated tracks, it means an even longer waiting period. As on Saturday, August 14, one can get a slot for a driving test on August 28 at the tracks near Sarai Kale Khan (South) and Surajmal Vihar (East II) RTOs. Slots at Mall Road (North) and Sarai Kale Khan (Central) are available on September 9 and 22, respectively. However, at most other busy RTOs, the latest slots are available from October 1 to 10 at Rajouri Garden (West II), Mayur Vihar (East), Rohini (North West II) and Vasant Vihar (South West) and as late as October 27 at Loni Road (North East). “The idea has been in the pipeline for some time now and many discussions have taken place in the department. What is first required to make the automated driving test tracks operational at night are high-mast lights,” a senior transport department official said. “Apart from sensors on the ground, cameras on high poles also capture the driving test. Both are needed for a computerised analysis and then finding if an applicant has cleared the test or not,” the official stated. “Very powerful lights are required at the centres to ensure that the cameras are able to capture images as efficiently as they do in daylight. Once the high-mast lights are installed, an assessment can be made of the viability of carrying out driving tests at night,” he added. At present, driving tests start between 8 and 8.30 am at test tracks and go on till around 2 pm, till all the applicants for the day have given their test. “There will be separate shifts in the near future to cater to more demand while ensuring there is no crowding at test centres. Initially, the timing of the tests will be increased to 8 pm and if possible, even up to 10 pm in the next phase,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/now-driving-tests-at-night-to-shorten-waiting-time/articleshow/85335958.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Speaking to ANI, Qatar-based spokesperson of Taliban Suhail Shaheen said, “What do you mean by military role? If they come to Afghanistan militarily and have their presence. I think that will not be good for them, they have seen the fate of military presence in Afghanistan of other countries. So it is an open book for them. And about their help to the Afghan people or national projects, I think that is something which is appreciated.” India has been assisting Afghanistan in capacity building, whether it is parliament, schools, roads or dams. India has infused more than $2 billion in assistance to Afghanistan. “We appreciate everything that has been done for the people of Afghanistan like dams, national projects, infrastructure and anything that is for the development of Afghanista,” Shaheen added. Fearing an escalation of violence between Afghan forces and Taliban, many countries, including India and the US, are evacuating staff from consulates located in provinces that had fallen under the Taliban. “About assurance to diplomats and embassies, there is no danger from our side to them. We will not target any embassy or any diplomat.... On India’s concerns, I think it is up to them. About us, our position is clear we are not targeting any diplomat or embassy,” Shaheen said. Asked about the safety of Sikhs and Hindus living in Afghanistan, the Taliban spokesperson said minorities will be allowed to practice their rituals. He also denied any link between Pakistani terror outfits and the Taliban and termed it as politically motivated and baseless allegations. He also added that Afghan soil will not be used against any foreign country, including India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-praise-india-for-development-efforts-but-warn-against-military-role/articleshow/85340924.cms||---

The one way fare remains high for travel in the coming week including for the weekend for a week's advance booking. Air fare on domestic routes have increased for travel on next Thursday as it's an extended weekend as Friday is a holiday. This is the first time air fares are up for an extended weekend from the city. Chennai-Mumbai one-way tickets sell at Rs 5,800 to Rs 6,000 while a ticket to Delhi sells at more than Rs 7,000. One way fare is Rs 5,000 to Kolkata. Air fares are more than Rs 6,000 for small towns like Goa, Ranchi, Jaipur, Mysuru, Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. Airlines used to charge this range of fares for one or two day's advance booking. The number of flights have increased at Chennai airport. So have the passengers. The airport now handles 80 departures and 80 arrivals per day with more than 10,000 people departing everyday. An airport official said that the flights are more because people have started to travel for business and leisure. "The government's move to allow people to travel inter-state with vaccination certificates will lead to a boom. None of the flights are going empty as it used to be before. The loads have increased in recent days." Nevertheless, the passengers are not able to enjoy the benefits as the airlines keep their starting fares high. Basheer Ahmed of Chennai Metro Travels said that airlines continue to keep the fare high. "This is affecting people flying abroad via Mumbai or Delhi as the domestic leg is expensive," he added. It looks like the air fares are set to remain high for weeks as airlines have suffered losses during the pandemic. Mohan Chandramouli a former Air India official said, "The number of flights must be increasing but the numbers are far lower than what it used to be in the pre-Covid days. The airlines have been incurring expenses for maintenance of aircraft, periodic changing of parts, fees for leasing, cost of staff and others even if planes are not being operated. The air fare is kept high to get the maximum revenue."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/air-traffic-up-so-are-fares-on-most-routes-from-chennai/articleshow/85340923.cms||---

Director of IMD, Amaravati, Stella S said that a cyclonic circulation is likely to form over the west-central and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal around August 15 and may lead to the formation of a low pressure area (LPA) over the same region during the subsequent 48 hours. Under the influence of the system, isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely over Odisha from August 15 to August 17 and isolated heavy rainfall over coastal Andhra Pradesh between August 13 and August 17. Coastal Andhra Pradesh has been reeling under hot and humid weather with high daytime and night temperatures for the past week, mainly on account of westerly and south-westerly winds prevailing over the state. Temperatures in the region have increased by one to four degrees Celsius above the normal. From June 1 to August 7, the state recorded 20% excess rainfall. However, the IMD said the southwest monsoon has been subdued in the state and is on a break. It will likely revive only after the formation of series of low pressures over the Bay of Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cyclonic-system-may-brings-rain-to-coastal-ap/articleshow/85335622.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Kolkata||Trinamool leader shot on BT Road in Khardah, 5 arrested||Kolkata: A 42-year-old Trinamool Congress leader, who was close to deceased Khardah candidate Kajal Sinha, was shot dead on BT Road in Khardah, North 24 Parganas, late on Friday. Five persons were arrested on Saturday, within hours of the shooting. They were produced in Barrackpore court and remanded in police custody for 10 days. While police are investigating if Ranajoy Srivastava — secretary of Trinamool’s Barrackpore unit Hindi cell — had personal enmity with his assailants, his death has quite expectedly triggered a blame game between the ruling and opposition parties. State forest minister and district Trinamool chief Jyotipriya Mullick called it “a preplanned murder by BJP-backed goons”. However, Barrackpore MP and BJP leader Arjun Singh said the murder was the fallout of Trinamool faction feud. Sources said the attack took place around 11.30pm on Friday, when Srivastava — a resident of Khardah’s PK Biswas Road — was on his way home from a party programme in Titagarh. He was travelling in a private car along with four party colleagues. Five youths on two bikes intercepted the car on BT Road and lobbed bombs. As Srivastava and the others got off the car and ran for cover, the bikers shot at Srivastava twice from close range and fled. Trinamool worker Sonu Sahoo, who was in the car with the victim, was visibly shaken as he recalled the horror. “The attack happened as we crossed the Barapatty area. The bikers came from the opposite flank of BT Road and blocked our car... They hurled bombs, chased us, caught Srivastava and shot him,” Sahoo said. Srivastava, who took bullets in the upper chest and neck, was first rushed to a local hospital and later shifted to a private one off EM Bypass, where he was declared brought dead. Police said the five arrested included a wanted criminal named Binod Mallick, alias Kana Binod. Two firearms were found on the accused. “All five are local residents and were known to the victim. The exact motive behind the murder is being ascertained,” Barrackpore police commissioner Manoj Kumar Verma said. Srivastava’s murder is the third killing under Barrackpore commissionerate in six months after BJP leader Manish Shukla and Trinamool’s Birati leader Subhrajit Dutta. There have been a total of seven gun attacks too. State minister Mullick said: “Srivastava was an active Trinamool leader in Barrackpore. He had built a strong rapport with the Hindi-speaking population of the industrial belt, which is why he was targeted. Barely half an hour before his murder, BJP-backed goons had called and threatened him.” Barrackpore MP Singh insisted that his party “does not believe in the politics of violence”. “There is no point blaming BJP. The deceased was a victim of Trinamool infighting over sharing of syndicate money,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trinamool-leader-shot-on-bt-road-in-khardah-5-arrested/articleshow/85337462.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

The rule on full vaccination or negative RTPCR report will apply to all those entering Punjab by road, rail or air, announced the CM, adding that if a person is found to not have either of these, RAT testing shall be mandatory, unless he/she has recently recovered from Covid-19. The directives came at a Covid review meeting chaired by the CM, who expressed concern about the positivity in Himachal Pradesh and other parts of the country, which has caused positivity in Punjab to also increase marginally to 0.2% in the last week, with RO going up to1.05%. The CM also directed that only fully vaccinated staff, or those recently recovered from Covid, should physically teach in schools and colleges and added that online learning option will be available to all children. He ordered at least 10,000 test samples of students and staff from schools be taken every day. Districts/cities where positivity is above 0.2 % have been asked to shut down offline education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/two-vaccine-shots-or-negative-rtpcr-report-must-for-punjab-entry/articleshow/85340927.cms||---

She had done the same last year too. The Chhatra Parishad programme will be the third big event of the Trinamool after Martyrs’ Day virtual rally on July 21 and Khela Hobe Diwas on August 16. The Trinamool chief, after the decisive victory of her party in the Bengal assembly polls, has set her eyes on the national plane. She is working for opposition unity ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Banerjee wants to infuse fresh blood into the party organisation, as she did earlier by bringing new faces at the helm. She herself had been a student leader from Yogomaya Devi College and rose from the ranks to where she is now. Banerjee has been calling on students to participate in politics to end division and hatred. All eyes are now set on the Chhatra Parishad rally to hear the Trinamool chief’s message to Bengal’s “yuva shakti (youth power)”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-to-e-address-aug-28-trinamool-student-wing-rally/articleshow/85337539.cms||---
---||India||Judges to get alerts for repeated adjournments||NEW DELHI: As part of “ease of doing business” reforms in the justice delivery system, for the first time judges will receive green, orange and red indicators depending on the number of adjournments given in a case. The government move is aimed at increasing accountability and professionalism in the justice dispensation as the record of adjournments will be taken into account during performance evaluation and elevation of a judge to superior courts. The measure is intended to improve India’s standing in the World Bank’s “ease of doing business” rankings. Beginning with commercial courts, the government has introduced a special feature in the software that runs the case management system of courts across India. The addition, rolled out by the law ministry recently, will track judges and automatically generate an alert when the “three-adjournment rule” is breached. As per rules notified earlier, no more than three adjournments are allowed in a case. Judges have, however, seldom followed the rule. 3.9cr cases pending in lower courts, over 1L for 30 yearsOver one lakh cases have been pending for more than 30 years. The total case pendency in subordinate courts reached 3.9 crore as on Friday. A study by Niti Aayog in 2018 had estimated that a backlog of 2.9 crore cases (at that time) would take 324 years to clear at the current rate of disposal. The pandemic has further extended this timeline. “Towards facilitating expeditious enforcement of the contract regime, the Case Information Software for commercial courts has now included a new feature whereby judges of commercial courts are being alerted about three adjournment status through colour indicators,” said Barun Mitra, secretary (justice). In a letter to cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba recently, Mitra informed that green light would indicate the case is listed at the same stage for less than three times; orange would mean the case is listed between three to six times and red would indicate that listing has exceeded six times. “This will assist judges in prioritising and deciding matters which have crossed the maximum three-adjournment rule,” he said. To enable the country to climb in World Bank’s ease of doing business ranking, the government is prioritising all judicial reforms through the commercial courts, including e-filing, e-pay and time-bound disposal. The government had earlier written to high courts to monitor and regularly provide figures on cases disposed of by district courts, where courts have adhered to the limit of three adjournments as mandated in Civil Procedure Code (CPC). The CPC and CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) mandate no judge can give repeated adjournments unless very unavoidable. In cases where more than three adjournments are given, a judge has to record reasons for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/judges-to-get-alerts-for-repeated-adjournments/articleshow/85341016.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||Kolkata||CAA will recognise refugees who fought for India’s freedom: Dilip||Kolkata: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh made an endeavour on Independence Day-eve to bring the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) back on agenda by saying that the Narendra Modi government at the Centre had promulgated the law to recognise refugees who had fought for the country’s freedom, but had become citizens of another nation. “The British divided the country with the stroke of a pen. The Congress and the Communists agreed to the Partition plan because they were eager to have a share of the power pie in truncated India. Thousands of people who fought for the country became Pakistani citizens overnight. They again became Bangladeshi citizens till they left for India amid torture and humiliation. The Modi government wants to recognise them even as some would want us to forget the past,” he said at a BJP programme. Ghosh said he feared Bengal was headed for pre-Partition days, when there was reservation of assembly seats based on religious identity. “The present Trinamool government has included Muslims under OBC category A and Hindus under OBC category B,” he said and referred to mini-Pakistan and mini-Bangladesh mushrooming within a 10km radius of Kolkata. The BJP leader said the porous Indo-Bangla border was allowing “unhindered entry” to Rohingyas, among others. “India shares a 2,219km border with Bangladesh of which 1,000km is unfenced. The earlier CPM and the present Trinamool government have been allowing people to enter Bengal for the sake of votes. This is posing a danger for our nation,” he said. Ghosh said such an “influx” might jeopardize what Syama Prasad Mookerjee had done for Bengal. “The great leader campaigned for a Bengali Hindu homeland when Calcutta was about to go to Pakistan. Leaders from the Right and the Left supported the demand. Their descendants deny it now.” He accused Trinamool leaders of causing pandemonium in Parliament. “They jumped on the table, threw paper at the speaker’s chair. Women MPs broke the Parliament door. Is this Bengal’s culture?” he said, adding that it was “the beginning of the end” of the Trinamool regime in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/caa-will-recognise-refugees-who-fought-for-indias-freedom-dilip/articleshow/85337639.cms||Rohit Khanna

---||Amritsar||Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh inaugurates second Jallianwala Bagh memorial||AMRITSAR: In memory of all those known and unknown people martyred in the massacre of April 13, 1919 chief minister Amarinder Singh inaugurated the Jallianwala Bagh Centenary Memorial Park on the eve of India’s 75th Independence Day. The family members of a few martyrs had also arrived at the new memorial. On the occasion, Amarinder said “This second memorial is a tribute to all those unknown martyrs who laid down their lives during the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, while the original memorial had been built to remember those who were known to have been killed at the site in this tragedy.” Amarinder said nobody knew the exact number of lives lost, although the deputy commissioner office had the names of 488 who fell to the bullets of the British force led by General Dyer, who fired on the orders of the then Governor of Punjab, Michael O’ Dwyer. The CM said with 1,250 bullets fired on that day, the number would actually have run in thousands. On the occasion, he informed that a special research team of historians and research scholars had been constituted by Guru Nanak Dev University for carrying out research on martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh and freedom fighters who were imprisoned at Cellular Jail, Port Blair. “Once the research is completed, the names of more martyrs might be discovered,” he said, adding that sufficient space had been kept on the columns of the memorial to incorporate more names in the future. The CM paid floral tributes to the unsung heroes and honoured 29 family members of the martyrs who died in the massacre. Move comes after legislationIn 1951, Parliament had enacted Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Act for the management of the national memorial. Under the 1951 Act, the trustees of the memorial include the Prime Minister as chairperson, president of the Indian National Congress, culture minister, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Punjab governor and Punjab chief minister as its permanent members. Three trustees are also nominated by the central government for five years.  However, the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial (Amendment) Bill, 2019 removed the president of the Indian National Congress as trustee. This probably is the reason why the Congress-run government came up with another memorial. Not all are happy with this development. “The sanctity of Jallianwala Bagh is in its soil where people gave their lives and it can’t be recreated anywhere else,” said Shwait Malik, one of the trustees of Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust. Former MP and another trustee Tarlochan Singh said, “Who will go to the memorial when Jallianwala Bagh is there?” Built at a cost of R. 3.52 crore, the new Centenary Memorial has five marble fins going up to the sky. Sant Murale Wale chair inauguratedChief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday inaugurated the Sant Prem Singh Murale Wale Chair at Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU). The state government has contributed Rs 1 crore in the current fiscal year for the chair comprising a professor and three research assistants. Amarinder also inaugurated the school of education, department of mass communication, department of hotel management and tourism besides laying the foundation stone of Golden Jubilee Centre for Entrepreneurship and Innovation and a shooting range.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/punjab-cm-captain-amarinder-singh-inaugurates-second-jallianwala-bagh-memorial/articleshow/85341087.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||‘For third Covid wave, Punjab set to scale up testing to 60,000 per day’||CHANDIGARH: With projections of new cases set to double in about 64 days at the present rate of growth, Punjab has decided to increase Covid-19 testing in the state to at least 60,000 tests per day. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday ordered the state health department to ensure high testing rate, while virtually inaugurating a children’s Covid ward as well as PSA oxygen plants in Ludhiana and Faridkot on Saturday. Reviewing the state’s preparation for an imminent third wave, Capt Amarinder directed the health department to undertake priority sentinel testing for OPD/IPD patients at government and private hospitals, travellers at entry points, government offices, industries and labour colonies, staff at marriage palaces, restaurants, pubs, bars and gyms. Based on this, districts should formulate strategies for micro-containment zones, he said, noting that GIS-based surveillance and prevention tool, with an auto trigger mechanism for localised restrictions, is now live in all districts. The Covid paediatric ward at Ludhiana civil hospital now has five paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and eight multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MISC) beds. The advanced ultra-modern PICUs were comparable with the best in the country, said the chief minister. With installation of PSA plants, the state’s dependency on oxygen supply from outside Punjab will substantially reduce, he said, adding that preparations were on to augment the oxygen capacity to 560MT, including 235 MT of LMO and around 328 MT from PSA plants, ASUs and oxygen concentrators. At the peak of second wave, Punjab was utilising about 308 MT oxygen. He ordered prioritisation of teachers and non-teaching staff for vaccination, with special camps to be held to ensure that all are covered with the first dose within this month and those due for the second dose to be also prioritised. Health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu suggested reducing the gap between the two doses to prioritise second dose for teachers and other school staff. On schools, which have recently reopened for certain classes in the state, the chief minister said while there were some reports of high positivity in schools, the fact was that intensive testing had shown that the positivity amongst school students is 0.1 % against overall positivity of 0.2 % in the past one week. Since 9th August, 41 students and 1 staff member in government schools have tested positive. Calling for strict vigil, he directed the departments concerned to ensure that only fully vaccinated teaching as well as non-teaching staff will physically teach in schools and colleges. The number of students should be suitably curtailed if enough fully vaccinated teachers are not available, ordered the CM. Amarinder said parents of school-going children should also be encouraged to immediately get vaccinated in order to enable the physical learning in schools without any interruptions. Even as he expressed satisfaction over commencement of operations at the whole genome sequencing lab at GMCH Patiala in association with Path, with none of the eight samples tested there so far showing only delta variant. Beginning Saturday, 92 samples will be sent every three weeks for genome sequencing. Noting that more than half of the eligible population of the state had already received one dose of vaccine, with the available stock being used without any wastage, the chief minister said he had, during his meeting with the Union health minister earlier this week, sought immediate supply of 55 lakh doses to inoculate Punjab’s eligible population. He had been assured of increased supplies, said Captain Amarinder. Incidentally, the first dose of Covid vaccine has been administered to around 82 lakh people (40%of state’s eligible population) and second dose to nearly 24 lakh people (11% ofeligible beneficiaries), which, said the chief minister, has the capacity to vaccinate eight lakh people per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/for-third-covid-wave-punjab-set-to-scale-up-testing-to-60000-per-day/articleshow/85341116.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: ‘As students, we donated our savings to freedom fighters’||LUCKNOW: In his roaring 20s then, ON Bhargava was a student of Lucknow Christian College in 1942 when Mahatma Gandhi had given a call for the Quit India Movement. Fresh as yesterday in the 94-year old’s memory, on August 10, 1942, Bhargava and a few other students reached the university campus after crossing the river Gomti near the university’s boat club since the British had blocked Monkey Bridge. Students had decided to take out a large procession from the university towards the main city, but they were stopped at the bridge by police as prohibitory orders under CrPC Section 144 were in place. “The British Collector was also present on the spot. Some girl students in groups moved out and returned to inform us about the presence of military vehicles with Tommys (British soldiers) parked on the then Imli Road ahead of Hazratganj. They warned us, but students insisted on taking out the procession,” recalled Bhargava, now managing secretary of Feroze Gandhi College, Rae Bareli. “After some commotion, the Collector ordered his men ‘two minutes, disperse or lathi charge.’ After two minutes, an Anglo-Indian sergeant grabbed a student standing right next to me and hit him with a baton followed by a cane charge by the remaining police on students,” he recalled. Students fled and took refuge within campus limits, but pelted stones on police, which retaliated by firing. The bullets hit the university students’ union building. Hearing gunshots, a number of teachers led by Prof NK Sidhanta and Prof Shanker Dayal Sharma intervened and told officials that section 144 does not ban movement in groups of three and four. University teachers commanded so much respect at that time that even the ruling British Collector when confronted had to submit to their plea of logic,” said Bhargava. Prof Sidhanta was in the English department and close to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Sharma was a faculty in the law department then and later became the ninth President of India. Between the Quit India Movement of August 1942 and 1946, the British were under tremendous pressure to leave India. This meant increased torture on freedom fighters and arrests. A lot of freedom fighters went underground, but continued their struggle. “I was living in a boarding house in Kaiserbagh near Victoria Park now called Begum Hazrat Mahal park with some other students. Prominent freedom fighters like Munshi Chandrika Prasad and Jitendra Nath Tewari were familiar to us. Often these freedom fighters would come to our residence during this period in the wee hours and would happily donate our savings to them to continue the strife,” he said. When the sky said, ‘We are free’“On August 15, 1947, processions filled the streets of Lucknow. The Governor’s House, now Raj Bhawan, opened its gates for the first time for Indians to come and celebrate the day together as soon as UP’s first Indian governor Sarojini Naidu took charge. Tiger Moth light trainee aircraft dropped leaflets from the sky that read ‘WE ARE FREE’. My friends and I visited the Governor's House, sat on the lawns of the campus and enjoyed sweets which we brought with us,” recalled Bhargava, painting a joyously vivid picture of the momentous day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-as-students-we-donated-our-savings-to-freedom-fighters/articleshow/85341106.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Business||India Inc must invest in startups to help retain local talent, ideas: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal||NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday suggested that Indian companies could make early stage investment in home-grown startups to help retain Indian talent and ideas within the country, while also getting themselves higher upside when valuations increase. The minister said several Indian startups had seen overseas investors enter early and exit after raking in high returns with the founders holding only a small stake. “It will also benefit Indian entrepreneurs to access capital,” he said. The statement, during an interaction with TOI on Saturday, came amid a controversy over his comments at a CII conclave earlier this week. Asked about his comment on the issue at the event, the minister said: “I can only appeal. Who am I to ask them to do something?” His comment at the CII meet came in response to suggestions from Banmali Agrawala, president for infrastructure and defence & aerospace at Tata Sons, and triggered a row with many interpreting it as reflecting Goyal’s annoyance. The Tatas are one of the most valued groups and they have a big role to play in the development of the country,” the minister said when asked about it. Goyal also made it clear that the consumer affairs ministry, which had recently released draft consumer protection guidelines for e-commerce, would be holding consultations with both Indian and overseas-funded players. “These rules are for all players. Everybody’s concerns will be taken on board. The government has an open mind on the issue and the effort is to balance the interests of the consumers and small retailers, while ensuring that the consumer gets the best deal,” he said. At the same time, he said, investors need to follow the law in letter and spirit, an issue which has been flagged by him to industry players in the wake of several “structured transactions” especially in the e-commerce space, where FDI is allowed in the business-to-business wholesale trading segment. “My doors are always open for anyone to come and meet,” Goyal said, adding that he is scheduled to meet representatives from the Tata Group. The minister also said the decision of the Tata Group to invest in the semi-conductor business was a major move. “Semi-conductors play a crucial role in the auto and electronics industry and Tatas getting in in that segment will send a very strong signal,” he said. Pointing to signs of a pickup in economic activity, he said investment in sectors such as steel, where several players have announced expansion, as well as in segments where production-linked incentives have been announced, is picking up. He said vaccination is crucial and the corporate sector could help reach out to the northeast and states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, in addition to inoculating employees. He also said he has reached out to large business houses to settle dues to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) within seven days since big businesses can access funds at a lower rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-inc-must-invest-in-startups-to-help-retain-local-talent-ideas-commerce-and-industry-minister-piyush-goyal/articleshow/85341097.cms||Sidhartha
---||Bengaluru||NEP dilemma: Mount Carmel College calls off first-year classes, JNC to take call post meeting||BENGALURU: The government’s decision to implement National Education Policy (NEP) from the upcoming academic year has created confusion among autonomous colleges, who usually follow a different calender. In fact, the government is yet to ready a syllabus and structures for the degree programmes. Mount Carmel College (MCC), one of the top arts and science colleges in the city, which started classes from August 9 for its first-year students has pressed the pause button. “Through this notification, we wish to inform all our first-year undergraduate students admitted this academic year that we are in the process of redesigning the curriculum and, therefore, need to reschedule our academic calendar in alignment with the university and UGC calendar. The degree classes which commenced on 9th August 2021 will be rescheduled to resume at a later date, which will be notified through this portal at the earliest,” said a circular from the college principal. Jyoti Nivas College (JNC), yet another top autonomous college in Bengaluru, that had plans to start orientation and life skill training programmes from August 21, said it will now finalise the dates after a meeting on Monday. “There are many factors that have to be taken care of before we implement NEP from the upcoming year. Teachers have to be trained and students oriented for the new structure. We will finalise the dates after the Monday meeting,” said principal Sr Lalitha Thomas. St Joseph’s College (Autonomous) said it will go ahead with the reopening on Monday. “We will start classes for first-year students and tweak the programmes as necessary when the government announces its plans. As of now, the complete roadmap is not ready and we are waiting for the same from the state government,” said principal Fr Victor Lobo. Karnataka is the first state in the country to roll out NEP. All state public universities and affiliated colleges are expected to follow NEP norms. The three-year degree programme is undergoing a change in structure. According to the NEP, which comes into effect from the 2021-22 academic year, students aspiring for a degree should opt for two subjects as discipline core. At the start of third year, they can opt for one subject as major and another as minor, or both as major subjects. In addition to this, they need to choose Kannada and one more language as language subjects. Students need to choose open and discipline electives as per the curriculum structure. They can get a maximum of 40% of the expected credits through official online courses and will have the option of multiple exits. The government has announced 33 committees for each subject. They have to submit the subject structures by September 6. After this, each university will have their board of studies forming the syllabus, before classes begin on October 1. “These committees will prepare model curriculum in their respective subjects. The same will be passed on to all universities as guidance. It is up to them to adopt with appropriate modifications as they deem fit. There’s no compulsion to adopt the same,” said B Thimme Gowda, vice-chairman, Karnataka State Higher Education Council. “The committees can concentrate on first-year curriculum during the first month. They will be given several months to prepare the curriculum for the remaining 2 years and for the masters degree,” he added. “It will be very difficult to come up with the structure in the next 20 days. There are a lot of things to be done before actual implementation on ground,” said a member of one of the committees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nep-dilemma-mcc-calls-off-first-year-classes-jnc-to-take-call-post-meeting/articleshow/85336155.cms||---
---||Nagpur||PARTITIONED DUE TO PANDEMIC||A Hindu family is getting restless to reach Pakistan and join their kin. A Muslim wants to return to India to be with his old mother. The pandemic has led to another partition of sorts for many. Each year many travel across the borders to meet their kin. Such movement not only hit a roadblock due to Covid but also left people stranded on either side. Away from their families, with businesses hit, going back is an endless struggle. TOI tracks members of families on either side of the border as both countries celebrate their Independence DayNagpur: When both India and Pakistan celebrate their Independence days on August 14 and 15 respectively, for some families it may also bring a sense of being partitioned from their loved ones. Living in Balaghat town of Madhya Pradesh, Ajeet Nagdev, a Pakistani citizen living in India, has made appeal after appeal to be allowed to reach Utsa Mohammed, his hometown in the Baluchistan province. In Karachi, Mohammed Faisal wants to return home to Bhopal to be with his mother who is unwell. Nagpur’s Umesh Kewalramani waits for his brother stranded at Ghotki city in Sindh to return. Umesh has obtained Indian citizenship and his brother holds a Pakistani passport, but was living in India. He had gone to meet his sick father and remains stuck. On a visit to meet his son in Indore, Darshanlal and his wife Sandhyakumari too want to return to Pakistan to join their kin. If not partition, Covid has left families separated across the borders. The crisis began with the first wave and continues till the time when the pandemic has ebbed in large parts of the sub-continent. Even as a number of stranded persons have been repatriated from time to time in the last two years, people continue to be stuck on both sides. Around 800 Pakistani citizens are estimated to be stuck in India. A number of Indians are stranded in Pakistan too.The movements that were curbed again during the second wave have not been eased yet.A crossover was scheduled on April 23, but before that Pakistan shut its border for Indians, laying down a stricter Covid protocol. Indians stranded in Pakistan too face uncertainty as repeated calls to the embassy seeking clarification have gone unanswered. Shanker Lalwani, the BJP MP from Indore, who has been taking up the cause, said he recently had a word with the home ministry. The Indian side has decided to take in those wanting to come. For that they will have to apply for an NoC from Pakistan. Sources said that Pakistani has made a list of emergency cases and such persons would get priority when a crossover is planned in coordination with India. Kapeel Kumar, a government servant in Pakistan and relative of Nagdev, said it’s time that the government should allow repatriation. If persons coming from other countries are allowed then why not India? Member of the senate defence committee Mushahid Hussain says both the governments must cooperate to solve the humanitarian crisis. Red tape and scoring political points must not come in the way of reuniting families on either side of the border. The two countries had stuck to their agreement of not attacking the civil population during the 1965 and 1971 wars. It’s time for both governments to rise to the occasion again and help stranded citizens. Stories of separationFor A fresh startAjeet Nagdev, 40, has been in India since nearly a decade on a long-term visa with plans to become a citizen. He earned a livelihood selling hosiery garments in village marts near Balaghat. His world was shattered this year when his wife, Rekha Kumari, passed away due to a kidney ailment. His eight-year-old daughter Laveena was born in India and her name was endorsed in her mother’s passport. With the mother no more, even the passport became invalid, hampering Laveena’s crossover to Pakistan. Rekha Kumari died just a few days before the crossover was scheduled but it got cancelled at the last moment. After TOI reported his case, the Pakistani embassy issued a passport to Laveena. However, borders remain shut. Having lost his savings due to lockdown and his wife’s treatment, Nagdev plans to start afresh back in his hometwon in Usta Mohammed. “Life is only getting tougher here. It’s difficult to work and also take care of children at home. I have a joint family in Pakistan. If I’m able to return, the kids can be looked after and I can start some business,” he says. Nagdev has been unable to pay the rent and hopes that the Pakistani authorities relent at least in his case. Anxious daysMohammed Faisal now spends restless days in Karachi.

According to the department of health and family welfare, the target population — those above 18 years of age — in the state is more than 4.9 crore. Of these, data accessed from the CoWin app as of 6pm on Friday (August 13, 2021) shows that nearly 53% or more than 2.6 crore people have received the first dose, while 77 lakh have been fully inoculated. Overall, Karnataka has administered more than 3.4 crore doses — more than 1.6 crore to women and over 1.7 crore to men — with more than 85% of them being Covishield. Bengaluru Urban district, including areas in BBMP limits, has administered more than 92 lakh doses. As per the government, BBMP limits has a target population of more than 94 lakh and the rest of the Bengaluru Urban district has about 10.6 lakh people. And, of the more than 1 crore people eligible for vaccination in the district (BBMP+rest of the district), more than 72 lakh have received at least one jab, while more than 20 lakh have got both doses. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said: “On average, we receive about 40,000 doses each day, and nearly 40% of the demand right now is for the second dose. Aside from what we are getting each day, private hospitals can also provide around 20,000 doses each day.” Pointing out that the achievement in Bengaluru, especially, in the BBMP limits has been commendable, Gupta said that the BBMP, however, will not be going easy on implementation of Covid norms. ‘Priority to contain fresh cases’“Given the chances of breakthrough infections and until we have a much higher percentage of people with both doses, we need to be very careful. Our priority is to contain fresh cases for which we need people to follow precautions,” Gupta added. CoWin data further shows that nationally, India has administered more than 53 crore doses covering more than 41 crore people. And, among 10 states with the highest number of Covid-19 infections, Uttar Pradesh has administered around 5.6 crore doses followed by Maharashtra (4.8 crore). West Bengal is the only other state to have used more than 3 crore doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/two-thirds-of-bengalurus-target-population-given-first-vaccine-dose/articleshow/85341179.cms||Chethan Kumar

All the medicos at the district hospital have undergone paediatric training as according to experts, children will be more susceptible to the virus. An oxygen generation plant from Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will soon be installed at the district hospital premises. According to the district hospital sources, more than 350 doctors, including 84 doctors who have recently joined under the one year mandatory service, are working at the hospital. Of them, 14 are paediatricians. The district hospital has 750 beds. Of them, 600 have oxygen supply lines. The hospital also has 140 ventilators. Two wards consisting of 100-150 beds are reserved for emergency purposes if the Covid cases surge in the district. “In the third floor, 200 beds are reserved for those below 18 years of age. Of these, 20 ICU beds are available anytime with 10 ventilators. Mothers will be given one or two separate wards on the same floor. In the district hospital, all doctors and nursing staffs were provided paediatric training for two weeks in July. They were trained about expected symptoms, drug dosage, complications expected, treatment,” district surgeon Dr Krishnamurty. “The oxygen generation plant provided by DRDO has reached the district hospital premises. The process of its installation is underway. This plant produces 1,500 litre per minute. There is 13KL oxygen storage tank. Another 20KL tank was ordered and is yet to arrive. Installation of oxygen generation plant is merely completed at Holenarsipur, Channarayapatna, Arsikere and Sakleshpur taluk hospital. In other taluks, the construction is planned to be completed within a fortnight. Those plants have capacity to generate oxygen in the range of 300-500 liter per minute,” he added.. “In the last two weeks, more than 150 children below 18 years have contracted the virus in the district. No one is critical. They are under home isolation,” said DHO Dr KM Sathish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/hassan-district-hospital-prepared-to-tackle-third-wave-of-pandemic/articleshow/85334648.cms||---

The collector has asked survey officials to submit a report on encroachments after fixing the boundary of the river in a week. The encroachers will be evicted after serving notice. Survey officials and local bodies will conduct joint inspections in the area to identify the encroachments. Notice will also be served to the firms which discharge waste into the waterbody. Building permit of such firms will be cancelled, the meeting has decided. The Kerala state pollution control board (KSPCB) has found hotels, houses, highrises and service stations discharging waste directly into the river, violating solid waste management rules . The rejuvenation project of the river will be implemented in two phases at an expenditure of Rs 20.85 crore. Survey and fixing of boundary is part of the first phase. The second phase involves long-term projects for the protection of the river. It is expected to complete the works in six months. The state government has given approval for the project of the irrigation department. The national bank for agriculture and rural development (Nabard) is yet to give approval. Haritha Kerala Mission and agriculture department will also formulate projects to do farming on the shores of the river. Suchitwa Mission and poverty alleviation unit will also envisage programmes. Steps to protect the shores will also be formulated. Public works department has been asked to submit draft report to reconstruct three bridges over the river. The 34-km long river is flowing through Mulanthuruthy, Chottanikkara, Udayamperoor and Amballoor panchayats and Tripunithura municipality. Survey on the 21.3-km stretch has already been completed. A meeting will be held again to review the progress of the work. Konothupuzha is a branch of Muvattupuzha river. An old report of the irrigation department had found that ecology on the 17-km stretch of the river was almost dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/collector-seeks-report-on-encroachment/articleshow/85341188.cms||---

Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute Dean and Director Dr CP Nanjaraj said a professor at MMCRI who was re-infected recovered faster than the first time. The professor may have developed strong resistance because of the presence of antibodies. MMCRI staff have treated many cases wherein recovered persons have contracted the virus after a few months. Nevertheless, the severity was less. Nanjaraj claimed less than 5% of patients treated at their institutes – KR Hospital, Trauma Care Centre, Super Speciality Hospital and Cheluvamba Hospitals contracted the virus according to their staff. These MMCRI-run hospitals had admitted and treated 2,248 patients in the second wave. About 531 died including seven at Cheluvamba Hospital. There were 1,011 ICU admissions of which 336 died, Nanjaraj said. In all, Mysuru district has registered 1.74 lakh positive cases in 16 months, which is approximately 5.5% of its total population. Though precise data of individuals being infected for the second time or after vaccination of first and second doses are not maintained, officials confirmed reinfection cases in the district. District surveillance officer Dr Shivaprasad claimed cases of reinfection of Covid in Mysuru is negligible.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh targets 75megawatt solar power generation by August 2023||CHANDIGARH: The UT administration has fixed a target of 75 megawatt (MW) solar power generation by August 15, 2023, undeterred by the coronavirus pandemic that had spoilt its earlier plans. The administration and The Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (Crest) has submitted its proposal to the Centre under ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ campaign. Debendra Dalai, UT special secretary environmentcum-CEO, Crest, said they have already started generating 45MW of solar power through different projects. They are aiming for additional 30 MW, including residential and government projects. The administration had recently asked for progress in solar project installation in the city and a roadmap for further installation of solar plants from the Crest. In a recent review meeting between the administration and department officials, the UT has asked the Crest to provide details of project in progress, in pipeline and those completed. The ministry of new and renewable energy had enhanced the city’s solar power generation target from 50 MW to 69 MW to be achieved by 2022. Recently, the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) had also turned down the administration’s plea of implementing Resco (Renewable Energy Service Company) model for solar plants installation in city. Resco model was rejected for the cityThe Crest moved JERC for implementing Resco model in city. The Crest had proposed this model after the approval of UT administrator V P Singh Badnore as residents were wary of the initial capital investment. Under the Resco model, the UT had planned that private companies will install solar-energy plants on private property, and in return, charge the building owner a much lower tariff than the normal electricity rate for about 15 years (or whatever period is agreed in the tender). Thereafter the house owner will get the plant. The building owner and the private company will sign a deal. The plant will be installed under the net metering mode, whereby a solar-energy unit is connected to the building's electricity system and the solar energy exported to the grid is adjusted in terms of units imported from the electricity department during a billing cycle. The UT administration last year had extended the solar installation deadline till next March 31, 2021. But recently, the UT had not extended the deadline. Last year, the deadline was extended as lockdown was in force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-targets-75mw-solar-power-generation-by-august-2023/articleshow/85341213.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Touts cash in on rush for Canadian student visas||BENGALURU: Visa aspirants from Bengaluru heading to join colleges in Canada are finding it tough to get appointment for biometric procedures, with agents allegedly pocketing Rs 35,000 to Rs 50,000 for a slot at the local facilitation centre for the North American nation. VFS Global, the visa facilitator, however, said it doesn’t charge customers for appointments to submit applications and all appointments are available online on a first-come-firstserved basis. “The visa agency and the Canadian immigration office here have warned visa-seekers against fraudsters, but getting an appointment is easier said than done,” said the mother of an aspirant. The woman’s son has been visiting the VFS Global office in the city following lifting of the lockdown, only to be told that cancellation by pre-booked persons could secure him a chance for an appointment. “Meanwhile, a few who are in a similar situation gave me contact numbers of some agents and I was told that they could get us an appointment for student biometrics with VFS. I contacted them and told them online slots are full, but they said they are confident of getting a slot for my son if I pay them Rs 45,000,” she added. When STOI dialled two numbers the woman provided, men on the other side identified themselves as operators of visa facilitating agencies and quoted sums between Rs 35,000 and Rs 50,000 for a biometrics appointment with the Bengaluru centre of VFS without fail. As per sources in the know, with limited slots being offered for biometric procedures towards Canadian visa now owing to the pandemic situation, many students are desperate to complete the process before the specified time to get visa. The ban on direct flights to Canada from India till September 21, 2021 also remains a big hurdle for them. With the facilitation centre in the city reopening in mid-June after the lockdown, visa processing has been limited and getting a slot is still difficult for students. Following the rush, the agency introduced an exclusive students’ counter mainly for biometric procedures, which was open only through prior appointment via online booking. “I have been trying to book an appointment for many days as some of my friends have got one by booking online as early as 4am. I went to the VFS office numerous times and was told that a cancellation could win me a slot for biometrics. But there are a few students who claim they got appointments through agents by paying large sums for a slot,” said Sameer (name changed), a student from Basavanagudi. Responding to an STOI query, the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the Canadian government’s visa and immigration authority, said Canada continues to remind its clients, including study permit applicants, to beware of fraud, and if an agent/representative claims they will expedite anyone’s appointment for a fee, it is not true.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-touts-cash-in-on-rush-for-canadian-student-visas/articleshow/85341221.cms||Petlee Peter

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Don’t panic & rush Covid positive children to hospitals, says BBMP||BENGALURU: Allaying fears of a dramatic spike in Covid positive cases among children in the state capital, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Saturday appealed to Bengalureans not to panic and rush infected children to hospitals. The move comes in the backdrop of reports claiming a sudden uptick in the number of kids, in the age group of 0-9 years and 11-19 years, testing positive for Covid-19. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta, who held discussions with the civic agency’s paediatric expert committee, categorically stated that no significant rise has been noticed in the past 20 days. “The city was reporting a daily average of around 450-500 cases earlier, but it has now reduced to an average of 388 per day,” Gupta said. The Palike, which evaluated paediatric cases (0-18 years) over the past four months, pointed out that such cases comprised around 11 per cent of overall Covid cases in the city. In fact, global data reviewed by the American Academy of Paediatrics showed that children represented 14.3 per cent of the overall cases. On the current scenario, the BBMP analysis added: “The total paediatric cases this month (as on Aug 13) stand at 511, which is 11.5 per cent of the overall cases. Moreover, if we look at the 0-12 age group, the total cases have reduced from 2,643 in June this year to 778 in July to 309 as on August 13.” Ditto with hospitalisation, with a few children requiring critical care beds. Data showed there were three children out of the 29 patients in high dependency units (HDUs) and no kids in ICUs and ICU-ventilators in the city. While14 children died in Bengaluru between April and June, there have been no deaths in the past two months. Gupta appealed to people to bring children, who are showing Covid symptoms, to the BBMP physical triage centres, primary health centres and community health centres for medical evaluation. Further, seven hospitals have been identified for paediatric care, including Indira Gandhi Institute Of Child Health. The civic agency is also coming up with a 30-bedded dedicated facility for paediatric care. Ensure kids mask up, wash hands: CommitteeThe paediatric expert committee has suggested parents ensure that children above three years follow Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks, washing hands and avoiding gatherings. “The overall scenario indicates that there is no need to panic or rush positive children to hospitals. Most of them will recover on their own showing mild symptoms,” the committee added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-dont-panic-rush-covid-positive-children-to-hospitals-says-bbmp/articleshow/85341273.cms||P Pavan
---||Gurgaon||Haryana: Girls raped, killed in front of her, says mother; wants to see 4 hanged||KUNDLI (SONIPAT): She was in the room, held down with brute force and a knife pointed at her face by a sinewy pair of hands, while three other intruders raped her two minor daughters, just 15 and 13 years old. On the intervening night of August 5 and 6, the most horrifying of sexual assaults happened in front of a mother’s eyes, inside their room in a colony in Kundli. The perpetrators were four neighbours living in the adjacent room on the ground floor of a single-storey building – one that stands out in a row of six for its blue doors. They had kicked open the door around 1am when the 37-year-old woman and her two daughters were asleep, startling them. They had no time to react. The men – Arun Pundit, Ram Suhag, Bhukhan and Phool Chand – had brought a bottle of pesticide with them, which they forced down the girls’ throats during the sexual assault, which went on for more than two hours, according to the mother, who was held at knifepoint the whole time. Her two sons were asleep right above, on the terrace, but seemed far away. “I watched my daughters turn blue. They were right in front of me, but I could not do anything to save them,” the woman told TOI on Saturday, lying on a charpoy in the yard of a nearby building, dazed and febrile. The yard has been her home since that night. She can’t go back to her room, not even bear to look at it. “I can’t go there. My heart races and my body shivers at the thought of what happened to my daughters there. I have moved my cot here. My sons bring me food,” she said. Broken and scared after that night of horror – she had initially told the police her daughters were bitten by a snake, just as the four assailants had told her to – there is now a resolve to see justice being done. “I have decided to return to my village (in Bihar), but only after I see the men who raped and murdered my daughters hanged,” she said. The two girls died soon after the savage assault – the older one on her way to Radha Harish Chand hospital in Delhi’s Narela, 23km away, and the younger one on the road to Baba Bhim Rao hospital, where she was referred. “They never spoke to anyone. They were quiet girls who kept to themselves. Both were bright, smarter than their brothers. I wish I had died before seeing them go like this,” said their mother. The family was new to the colony. They had moved to the Kundli village just a month ago. The mother did odd jobs for a living. The daughters helped.  The sons sought out daily wage work too. Her husband passed away 10 years ago, and she had single-handedly raised the four kids. Her older son is 18 and the younger 14. They moved to Sonipat from Gujarat. “This is our life. We move from one state to another in search of jobs. Last month, when my brother and I decided to move here, we thought it’s better to get our mother and sisters along. Otherwise, we keep worrying about them,” said the older son. Police said the four accused are also from Bihar and were working as daily wagers in the area. They were arrested on August 10. “The girls’ mother was threatened. She was, as a result, scared. So, she kept saying it was a snake bite case. But after the post-mortem reports made it clear that it was a case of poisoning and sexual assault, she told us the truth,” said Kundli SHO Ravi Kumar. The SHO said the four accused were hiding in the Kundli industrial area and arrested from there. The four are now in police custody. The rape-murders have cast a shadow of fear on the village of 450 people. Families have advised girls to stay at home. “If there is no work, why to step out unnecessarily? We are keeping an eye on them, wherever they are going,” said Salahuddin, a villager. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSCs) has, meanwhile, taken cognisance of the incident and sought an action-taken report from the Haryana government by August 19.

In addition to the facilities at Wenlock District Hospital and eight medical colleges, the district has reserved 50 beds in each of the four taluk hospitals. Meanwhile, 36 Covid Care Centres with nearly 2,700 beds have also been readied. The administration has directed 118 hospitals and clinics registered under the KPME Act to be prepared to manage cases. DC KV Rajendra said the positivity rate started increasing after July 28 with the opening of paramedical colleges, engineering colleges and other institutions for exams. We have been conducting an average of over 10,000 RT-PCR tests daily, he said. “We have 12,000-litre liquid medical oxygen plants at Wenlock District Hospital. Plans are afoot to set up a 13,000-litre plant there. We have been ensuring uninterrupted supply of oxygen to four taluk hospitals. Karnataka State Medical Supplies Corporation has agreed to supply dura oxygen cylinders to the taluk centres. We have already taken up an initiative to set up 16 oxygen plants for supply in rural areas — while seven have already been commissioned, the remaining will be completed by August 20,” Rajendra said. Each taluk hospital has reserved 50 oxygenated beds exclusively for Covid cases. Taluk centres have also been given five ventilators each. There are enough physicians and other staff in all taluk hospitals, the DC added. The district has 176 paediatricians and each taluk hospital has a paediatric primary care unit.

Hours later, they had arrested the accused and in three days, the two cops from Manesar women’s police station had prepared the chargesheet. On Independence Day, Poonam, the station house officer (SHO) of the women police station, and Kamlesh Devi, a sub-inspector, would be felicitated by the chief minister and the governor for showing extreme alacrity in investigating the case. It was on March 24 that the police control room received a call claiming that an eight-year-old girl had been raped. A police team rushed to the spot and took the child for a medical test. “Without wasting any time, we called a forensic team to collect the fingerprints and other evidence from the place of crime,” Poonam said. A case was registered under sections 363 (kidnap a person from lawful guardianship), 366 (kidnapping of female with wring intent), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and Section 4 (aggravated sexual assault) of the Pocso Act at the women police station. The cops recorded the statements of neighbours and other relatives and pieced together a sequence of events. They also worked out possible routes the accused might have taken to escape. Within hours, the accused was arrested from Manesar. “The speed was the key. Any delay in taking action could have provided time to the accused to escape from the city,” said Poonam. After the medical test was done on the girl, the police got her statement recorded before a magistrate. Commissioner of police KK Rao said, “While carrying out any investigation, we have to keep multiple things in mind. It also involves a lot of paperwork to make a strong case. They filed the chargesheet in record time by following protocols.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/rape-chargesheet-in-3-days-i-day-honour-for-2-cops/articleshow/85337234.cms||Bagish Jha

The city has been witnessing a dry spell since August 8, when it received moderate rain. While a drizzle was witnessed on Friday night in several places, it didn’t make much of a difference to the hot and humid weather conditions. On Saturday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 36.3 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature stood at 24.4 degrees. The relative humidity index was recorded at 81%. IMD officials said the rains are on a break with the monsoon trough likely to remain north of its normal position for the next few days. “The monsoon trough now runs close to the foothills of the Himalayas, which is resulting in subdued rainfall activities in the northwest region, including Delhi-NCR, Haryana, Rajasthan, and western Uttar Pradesh. The monsoon break is likely to continue till August 18, after which we are expecting rainfall,” an official said. Between August 1 and 14, the city received only 64.9mm of rainfall, a deficit of 34% compared to the normal of 98.6mm. Gurgaon, however, has reported 54% excess cumulative rainfall between June 1 and August 14 with 461.3 mm of rainfall, against the season’s normal of 299.6mm. According to the IMD’s weekly forecast, it will be partly cloudy on Sunday with the minimum and maximum temperatures likely to hover around 24 and 35 degrees Celsius, respectively. Meanwhile, the city’s air quality index (AQI) remained satisfactory on Saturday for the second consecutive day. The overall AQI reading was 91, compared to 99 on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/no-respite-from-heat-for-3-4-days/articleshow/85337239.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The organisers hope to vaccinate around 3,300 people during the vaccination camp titled 'Freedom at Midnight’, to be held at Town Hall, till Sunday noon, according to district medical officer Dr K J Reena. According to them, it was for the first time in the state that a vaccination programme was being held continuously for 24 hours. According to the organisers, people above 18 years can avail vaccines, and online registration for this can be done on the CoWin app. Spot registration will begin at 10pm on Saturday, and it will coincide with the 'midnight freedom’. Vaccination will be open for those availing first dose or second dose, Dr Joy Manjila, president of IMA Thrissur branch said. Apart from the DMO and IMA, the National Health Mission (NHM) Thrissur, Flood Team Thrissur, Rotary International, Indian Society of Anaesthesiologists (ISA) Thrissur, and KGMOA, have collaborated in this initiative which is coordinated by the Elixir Multispecialty Clinic, West Fort. About 25 data entry operators, 15 nurses and several doctors will be working in shifts for managing the camp, according to Dr Arun Krishna of Elixir Clinic. Nearly 2,200 people had registered for vaccination by Saturday morning after the communications about the programme were circulated through social media platforms. Even though the spot registration was set to begin at 10pm on Saturday, about 700 people had taken the token by 9pm. A cake cutting programme has been arranged when the vaccine is being administered at midnight, to mark the memory of the country becoming independent at midnight on August 14, 1947.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-marathon-vaccination-drive-to-celebrate-independence-day-in-thissur/articleshow/85341342.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||50 acres cleared of debris in Khori, forest to be restored||Gurgaon: The Faridabad Metropolitan Development Authority (FMDA) is planning to sow seeds in over 50 acres of Aravali land cleared of debris in Khori. Officials said seeds of species suitable for the Aravalis, such as khairi, dhak and ronjh, will be sown in the area. Around 100kg of seeds will be used, considering that only 50% are expected to germinate. There are also plans to develop the area as a city forest or biodiversity park, but due to shortage of funds for such a project, FMDA will start seeding, sources said. The exercise will begin after it rains in the area, as the land has now dried up. Most of the seeds will be procured from Arid Forest Research Institute in Jodhpur. The public will also be requested to donate plants and contribute financially, officials said. “Our main emphasis for the restoration of green cover in Khori village will be on seeding. The germination percentage of dhok (Anogeissus pendula), which is the most suitable for the area, is less and its seeds can’t be stored for a long time. Seeds of khairi, dhak and ronjh trees, however, germinate easily, have a better survival rate and don’t require as much maintenance,” said Subhash Yadav, divisional forest officer and head of FMDA’s urban environment division. “The seeds will be mixed with manure and pesticides and then sprinkled on the land,” Yadav added. At an FMDA meeting held on August 4, it was decided that the divisional forest officer would prepare a plan to transform the land into a forest area and explore the possibility of developing it as a city forest or biodiversity park at the earliest. A private firm, which was earlier keen to collaborate with the Faridabad authorities for the restoration of Khori, is no longer interested in going ahead with the proposal, officials said. Moreover, a proposal to use the demolition waste to fill potholes on roads or to construct boundary walls in Khori was also raised in the meeting. “It was also decided that the land vacated by the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) will be handed over to FMDA, which would then take over the responsibility of its development,” an official said. The Supreme Court had on June 7 ordered MCF to clear the eco-sensitive Aravali forest land in Khori of encroachments. The corporation was given six weeks’ time to demolish illegal houses built on the forest land. Following the order, MCF had started a demolition drive on July 14 and has finished razing all the illegal structures. The forest department of Faridabad is now demolishing farmhouses constructed illegally in other Aravali areas of the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/50-acres-cleared-of-debris-in-khori-forest-to-be-restored/articleshow/85337250.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Gurgaon||Farmers to take part in ‘tractor parade’ on I-Day||Gurgaon: Farmers in the state are gearing up for the proposed tractor parade on Independence Day. Scores of farmers from Jind, Nuh, Hisar, Bahadurgarh, and Gurgaon will come out on the streets on their tractors, bikes and cars to lend support to Samyukta Kisan Morcha's call for the parade at the block and tehsil levels. Farmers’ bodies across the country have decided to mark the 75th Independence Day as the ‘Kisan Mazdoor Azaadi Sangram Diwas’ to infuse fresh steam into their movement, which began last year to oppose the three contentious farm laws. Manjit Thakral, a member of Jai Kisan Andolan, told TOI, “On this Independence Day, we will exercise our right to be free from the chains of authoritarian and anti-people state. We will take out tractor marches on Sunday morning. Farmers will display tableaux related to farming and unity of the working class.” In Gurgaon, for instance, farmers and social activists will celebrate Independence Day by stepping up their agitation and raising anti-government slogans. Protesters will be joined by people from nearby villages. Santokh Singh, a senior SKM member, said, “If we can get rid of the British Empire, we can get rid of these laws too. Our demonstrations will be a message to the government that we are not backing down and that movement is only getting stronger.” Similarly, in Jind, some 20,000 farmers would take out the parade in over 5,000 tractors and celebrate the Kisan Mazdoor Azaadi Sangram Diwas. Farmers who have been protesting near the Khatkar toll plaza on Saturday conducted mock rehearsals with women farmers taking part in large numbers. Farmer leaders and members of the khaps have claimed that they are exercising caution to avoid any untoward incident that may tarnish the purpose of the protest. “We will take out tractor marches on blocks like Narwana, Khatkar toll plaza, Julana, and Safidon,” Virender Singh Sindhu, a member of Starol Khap. In Rewari also, scores of farmers and daily wagers, led by leaders like Yogendra Yadav, are expected to take out a march and reach the protest site at Shahjahanpur border. The parade will begin from the Tankri village in Rewari around 9am and will reach Shahjahanpur border later in the afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/farmers-to-take-part-in-tractor-parade-on-i-day/articleshow/85337566.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

Her father, an auto driver, found it tough to make ends meet during the second wave of Covid-19 and couldn’t buy her a smartphone. Like Jhansi, 15, several students have suffered due to the digital divide. Pramod Srinivas, 29, founder of youth nonprofit organisation Rashtriya Yuva Prathishtana (RYP), decided to help Jhansi and 20 other students up to 16 years in the Dhobi Ghat area in Padmanabhanagar by giving them free tablets. He also arranged an existing community hall for these children where they could comfortably attend online classes daily. The NGO plans to increase the number of beneficiary students in the near future. Pramod says he was always disturbed by the digital gap and when he came across the TOI report ‘1 out of 3 students in Karnataka lack internet access’ (July 2021), he decided to do something about it. “It motivated me to get tabs for the kids,” he said. “I took permission from hall authorities to make the arrangements,” he said, adding they roped in a teacher to clarify kids’ doubts. The organisation pays the teacher Rs 10,000 every month, he said. “The teacher gives free tuition to children in all subjects depending upon their curriculum,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/youth-outfit-donates-tabs-to-bengaluru-students/articleshow/85341391.cms||---

They claimed that the stretch connecting the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) to CHD Avenue 71 have no source of illumination whatsoever, while the streetlights on the stretch between the Behrampur and Fazilpur village remain non-functional most of the time giving jitters to motorists and pedestrians. The residents claimed that it has been over a year since the road connecting to SPR was developed, but the lack of streetlights is making it difficult for commuters to travel post-sunset. They alleged that several complaints have been made to the authorities concerned but all their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Unmukt Sharma, a resident of Andour Heights, “Both the stretches connecting to our society are poorly lit and posing a serious security risk to passersby and commuters while travelling on these roads. Out of 900, more than 350 families are currently living here. We have raised the issue multiple times at various platforms but to no avail. Besides the lack of streetlights, the road connecting to SPR does not have a footpath.” The residents claimed that many incidents of carjacking, snatching and harassment have been reported in the past due to dark spots. Gaurav Kalra, a resident of CHD Avenue 71, said, “Streetlights are yet to be installed in most places, while in the others the lights are defunct due to lack of maintenance by the civic authority. More than 750 families are being affected due to the callous attitude of the authority.” Similarly, the 3-km-long stretch between Tulip Violet in Sector 69 to Paras Irene in Sector 70A turns to pitch dark after sunset in the absence of streetlights. Rajat Srivastava, a resident of BPTP Astaire Gardens said, “For the last two years, we have been chasing the authorities but nothing has been done so far.” Meanwhile, Arun Dhankar, a superintending engineer at HSVP, said that the work on the installation of streetlights is underway. “The estimate for the installation has been submitted for approval from the headquarters”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/sector-71-linked-to-spr-a-year-ago-but-no-streetlights-on-stretch-yet-say-residents/articleshow/85337638.cms||Akanksha Gupta

---||Gurgaon||The return of khadi and what our brands can learn from it||By Shivanand Mohanty India celebrates 75 years of independence on Sunday. As brands fill your phone with messages celebrating this milestone, perhaps it’s worthwhile to ponder – what is it really about? Beyond the flag hoisting at Red Fort and in our neighbourhoods, the screening and streaming of patriotic films on TV, what is it all about? Independence is, of course, a celebration of our national identity. And for those a little confused on this subject, the government has helpfully identified a series of symbols that define our national identity — national animal to flower to bird to tree, we’ve got it all covered. I would like to propose an addition — the national fabric of India, khadi. Khadi was born of the freedom struggle. It was created to fight the Empire’s policy of taking cotton from India to the mills in England and then flooding the Indian market with finished clothes. Mahatma Gandhi encouraged fellow Indians to weave their own fabric and make their own clothes to defy the Empire. The freedom struggle is woven into every warp and weft of khadi. How many fabrics can claim to have played a starring role in a revolution? (Suddenly denim doesn’t feel so rebellious or revolutionary, does it?) Khadi’s journey became only more fascinating. As the official fabric of the Indian freedom struggle, it became a much-loved symbol of self-reliance, simplicity and more interestingly, a sense of “sartorial integrity”. Gandhi’s transformation from a three-piece-suit-wearing lawyer to a loincloth-clad revolutionary became a powerful political statement. The fabric became identified with the masses of India and challenged the idea that western outfits were more “civilized” than native ones. Gandhi adopted khadi and his loincloth to show his identification and connection with every Indian. And every Indian responded, swelling the ranks of the freedom movement and eventually, shaking off an empire. After Independence, khadi took on more of a symbolic role. Though khadi tugged at the heartstrings of every patriotic Indian, for years it wasn’t making much of an impact on the independent Indian customer’s purse strings. It became an “occasional” wear. Its revolutionary DNA lived on in a few campuses, sported by young people with long hair, long beards and “jholas”. Post-liberalisation, our craze for “foreign” almost buried khadi. India was ready to explore the world. Denims and western wear held us in thrall as we learnt to aspire for the “latest” looks sold to us through glossy double spreads and glitzy boutiques. Brands became shorthand for who we were, and nobody wanted to be dowdy “khadi”. It wasn’t the product’s fault. Khadi still remains one of the most versatile fabrics ever. It can incorporate a variety of materials — including wool and silk. It keeps the wearer warm in winter and cool in summer. Thanks to its handmade nature, every outfit made with khadi is one of a kind. And now, its time has come again. Thanks to the climate chaos raging across the world (floods in unexpected places, forest fires and rising pollution everywhere), there is an urgent realisation how every single buying decision of ours is impacting the planet. And fashion plays a critical role in this scenario. Consumers are slowly realising exactly how expensive a “cheap T-shirt” is for the environment. This is khadi’s second coming. Because it is made entirely by hand, its carbon footprint is negligible. It’s equally stingy with natural resources — a metre of khadi fabric uses up just 3 litres of water while a metre of mill cloth 55 litres. In addition, 70% of artisans who make khadi in India are women. As the world reacts to the mindless use and throw habits of fast fashion, khadi offers a slower, more measured, and more thoughtful way to clothe ourselves. Besides, being “Indian” is now fashionable. Even on social media, the barometer of everything “cool” and expressing one’s roots gets as many likes and shares now as the latest dance trend. We are now much more comfortable in our own skin, and not as easily tempted by the lure of foreign brands. A while ago, the #100SareePact had ladies proudly displaying their handloom sarees on social media and while it lasted, it generated as much fervour as jumping out of a running car to perform a dance. Designers have been quick to ride this trend and khadi now forms an important part of many collections. From freedom fighter to forgotten hero to fashion icon, khadi has had quite the journey. So, what does it all have to do with brand building? Khadi ticks off all the requirements of a thriving, modern brand. Brand purpose? Check. What could be a more inspiring purpose than fighting for India’s freedom? Great brand ambassador? Check. The father of the nation, himself. The resilience to thrive for more than a century? Check. Khadi is now building a new generation of fans, and this time, it is helping to fight the challenge of the century — climate change. What is truly great is that all this is not just some “brand story”. It’s history. And it’s the future. Happy Independence Day!

The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has completed laying pipelines for sectors 81-99 to supply potable water. RWAs and developers can apply for water supply from Monday.The project will be inaugurated on Independence Day by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and governor Bandaru Dattatreya. GMDA’s water supply wing will accept applications from RWAs and developers for water connections from August 16.According to GMDA officials, sectors 81-99 have a water requirement of 25 million liters per day (MLD) at present, which is expected to increase to 70.21 MLD in coming years. To supply water to these areas, GMDA has laid pipelines with a collective length of 51.3km at the cost of Rs 76.2 crore. They will supply water from Chandu Budhera and Basai water treatment plants.The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has issued around 229 licenses for residential and commercial real estate projects in these sectors, out of which around 56 have received occupation certificates. At present, the people living in these sectors are entirely dependent on groundwater and water tankers for their daily needs. The supply of canal water in new sectors was one of GMDA’s foremost projects. The project, however, missed several deadlines. “We have resolved all issues related to water supply in sectors 81-99 and completed the work of laying the pipelines. Developers of commercial projects and RWAs of residential societies can now apply for water connections,” GMDA chief engineer Pradeep Kumar said.Residents have welcomed the move. “People have been living in these areas for the past two to three years without regular supply. Water connection will be a big relief and we hope authorities will ensure water supply to the remaining new sectors at earliest,” Praveen Malik from United Association of New Gurgaon, a residents’ group.“We have been paying Rs 1,000-2,000 each every month for water.

Speaking at a memorial lecture on Justice HR Khanna, who stood firm on fundamental rights and liberties during Emergency, Justice Lalit struck a strong note, saying, “Regulations to prevent anti-national activities in educational institutions can, therefore, be considered to be reasonable.” It was as much in the interest of minorities as that of the majority to ensure that the protections afforded to minority institutions were not used as a cloak for doing something which was subversive of national interests,” Justice UU Lalit said. The remark assumes significance in the wake of the debate over the incidents at Jamia Milia Islamia during the anti-CAA protests and the action of authorities which were criticised as an interference in the rights of minority institution. Justice Lalit said, “The right under Article 30(1) is not absolute or above the law and that conditions concerning the welfare of students and teachers must apply in order to provide proper academic atmosphere, so long as the conditions don’t interfere with the right of the administration or management.” He added, “A balance must be struck between the two objectives of standard of excellence of the institution and preserving fundamental rights of minority institutions.” The judicial debate on the issue has been engaging the SC for decades — the rights conferred under Article 30 to the minority communities to establish and manage educational institutions of their choice and the government’s duty to ensure standards of education in these institutions. “While juxtaposing national interest and minorities’ interest, he (Justice Khanna) observed that minorities of this nation are as much a part of it as the majority and anything that impinges upon national interest must necessarily in its ultimate operation affect the interests of all those who inhabit this land,” he said. “Because the words ‘of their choice’ appearing in Article 30 have special significance, the management of a minority institution should be kept free from governmental or other interference. They would lose their value and utility if too much interference or unnecessary curbs are placed in the administration of their affairs,” Justice Lalit further stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/minority-tag-for-education-institutions-cant-be-cloak-for-subversion-says-justice-u-u-lalit/articleshow/85341437.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

In the process, the duo clocked 1 lakh km on their bikes. Meet Mohan Mallappa, 50, and BH Babu, 54, from Bengaluru. They have been on the road on their BMW 1200 adventure motorcycles more often than they’ve been at home in the last five years. Mallappa, a businessman, started his road trips in 2013 on his Harley and shifted to a BMW adventure tourer in late 2015.  Inspired, Babu, an architect, purchased the same model in 2016 and they soon became twin riders. In 2019, Mohan covered 1 lakh km on his bike and travelled 1.85 lakh km so far, a feat that could be challenging for other adventure bikers in India. Babu did not want to be left behind: he too completed 1 lakh km last week. There are 30 adventure motorcycle riders across the globe who have completed 1 lakh km on the same adventure bike, experts said, and two of them are from Bengaluru. “I had done a few endurance rides like 2,500km under 36 hours on my motorcycle and began serious long-distance riding after that. Babu joined me soon after and we became an on-road team,” Mallappa said. Pandemic challengeThe Covid -19 lockdown last year posed a different challenge for the two, who are members of Bengaluru-based Riders Republic Motorcycle Club. They became part of an eight-member team delivering life-saving medicines to remote parts of south India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/buddies-hit-road-on-identical-bikes-clock-over-1-lakh-km/articleshow/85336180.cms||Petlee Peter

The digital artwork is a veritable palatte of colours with dancers or the props held by them, representing the letters of 'Google'. The doodle made by Kolkata-based artist Sayan Mukherjee "celebrates India's Independence Day and its cultural traditions forged in centuries of historical progress," according to information shared by Google on its website. The six artistes, donning colourful traditional costumes, stand in a row, on a platform adorned with old heritage designs, to add to the festive atmosphere. The one portrayed on the extreme left of the doodle is a Bharatanatyam dancer in a resplendent dress and an evocative 'mudra' forming the 'G' of 'Google', while a Kathakali dancer in dazzling costume syabda is on the other end of the spectrum with folded hands. After the Bharatanatyam dancer, stands a woman in Bihu costume, holding a jaapi -- the traditional hat of Assam -- forming the letter 'O', followed by a Bhangra dancer from Punjab, beating a 'dhol', the percussion instrument forming the second 'O' in the search giant's name. Purulia Chhau dancer with the colourful headgear is the next in line followed by a 'garba' dancer from Gujarat with a pair of sticks in her hands, completing the line-up. “India is inhabited by one-sixth of the total global population and is characterized by the thousands of distinct languages and ethnic groups within its borders. Indians across the subcontinent's 29 states celebrate their freedom and multicultural spirit with customs such as traditional dance performances, which vary depending on regional culture," the search giant said. The doodle artwork illustrates these diverse forms of dance. Depicted on the far right, the masked reenactments from Indian epics known as Chhau dance have origins in the eastern state of Jharkhand, the Purulia Chhau, and the Seraikella Chau regions, it added. On Saturday, the US-based firm, known to commemorate key historic events and celebrate iconic personalities, had also showcased a doodle -- inspired by an ancient fort, marking 75th Independence Day of Pakistan. "In honour of this historic day, today's doodle artwork depicts the medieval Derawar Fort, a massive square edifice with a symmetrical perimeter of 40 massive circular bastions built in the 9th century," the search engine major wrote on the artwork on August 14. “Located in the vast expanse of western Pakistan's Cholistan Desert, each of these ancient stone fortresses rises nearly 100 feet from the sand and comprise an imposing symbol of Pakistani adaptability and antiquity," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/75th-independence-day-google-honours-cultural-traditions-with-unique-doodle/articleshow/85341604.cms||---

The ‘e-auction’ of Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco crop grown in Prakasam and Nellore districts has entered final phase. Overcoming challenges posed by the Covid second wave, Indian Tobacco Board successfully conducted the auctions. The auctions commenced on 11 platforms on March 15 and concluded sales in nine platforms. Nearly 68 million kg out of an estimated 70 million kg produced in the region had already been marketed and the rest of the produce will be handled in a couple of weeks. Pace of auction has been brisk despite a delayed start compared to previous year. The Tobacco Board put off the auctions for three weeks in May keeping in view of the safety of farmers, officials and the traders. In the early phase, the crop growth was ravaged by Nivar cyclone. However, the tobacco industry, board and Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) initiated measures to bail out growers to protect the crop. Favorable weather conditions in subsequent months helped the growers to produce record crop with quality needed by the industry. Interestingly, bright grades-considered to be the fine stock crossed 60% of the total production from the region, said an industry expert. “Higher production of bright grades after many years of poor quality crop, and stable market trends contributed to a significant increase in the average price realized by the farmers by more than 20%,” said a leading tobacco exporter. He said that tobacco farmers received nearly 143 per kg average price against just 116 per kg of last year. “There has been a significant increase in the prices of medium and lower grades. The prices of medium qualities were up by around 10% that contributed to a record average for tobaccos produced in the region,” he said. The farming community is, however, not fully content with the prices as they are of the view that the average prices could have been better had the exporters actively participated in auctions. Meanwhile, the Tobacco Board is set to meet on August 16 to finalise the crop size for 2021-22 season in AP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/tobacco-growers-hit-jackpot-this-season/articleshow/85334680.cms||Samdani MN

---||World||Timeline: The Taliban's sweeping offensive in Afghanistan||KABUL: The Taliban have taken more than a quarter of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capitals in less than a week as US-led foreign forces pull out of the country. Here is a look at the three months since their sweeping offensive began: In early May, NATO begins a final withdrawal of its mission in Afghanistan involving 9,600 soldiers -- 2,500 of them American. Intense fighting soon breaks out between the Taliban and government forces in southern Helmand province. A bomb blast outside a girls' school on May 8 in Kabul kills 85, mostly pupils. The deadliest attack in a year is blamed on the Taliban, though they do not claim it. US forces withdraw from one of Afghanistan's largest air bases in Kandahar, the country's second-biggest city, in mid-May. The insurgents then seize districts in Wardak province near Kabul, and in the key province of Ghazni, which straddles roads connecting the capital to Kandahar. By mid-June they have captured several districts in northern provinces, forcing military retreats. The Taliban take control of the main Shir Khan Bandar border crossing with Tajikistan on June 22, prompting the Central Asian country to check the combat readiness of its armed forces. Officials on July 2 announce the departure of all American and NATO troops from Bagram, Afghanistan's biggest air base, which served as the linchpin of US-led operations in the country for two decades. Two days later, the Taliban seize the key district of Panjwai in Kandahar, the insurgents' birthplace and former bastion. The Taliban announce the capture of Islam Qala, Afghanistan's biggest border crossing with Iran, on July 9. On July 14, the insurgents take control of the Spin Boldak border crossing with Pakistan, a major trade route between the two countries. The Taliban offensive escalates sharply with a new focus on urban centres as the insurgents attack the cities of Lashkar Gah, Kandahar and Herat. The United States and Britain say the Taliban may have committed war crimes, accusing the insurgents of "massacring civilians" in the town of Spin Boldak. Eight people are killed on August 3 in a coordinated Taliban-claimed bomb and gun attack targeting the Afghan defence minister and several lawmakers in Kabul. The Taliban shoot dead the head of the Afghan government's media information centre at a mosque in the capital on August 6. The Taliban capture their first Afghan provincial capital, the city of Zaranj in southwestern Nimroz, taking it "without a fight". The following days several other northern cities fall: Sheberghan, Kunduz, Sar-e-Pul, Taloqan, Aibak, Farah and Pul-e-Khumri. Despite the bloodshed and sweeping advances, US President Joe Biden gives no suggestion he will delay the withdrawal deadline. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani flies to the besieged northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif on August 11 to rally his forces. But his visit is overshadowed by the surrender of hundreds of Afghan soldiers in nearby Kunduz and the overnight capture of a ninth provincial capital, Faizabad. The Taliban capture Ghazni, 150 kilometres (90 miles) southwest of Kabul, on August 12. Herat falls in the west the same day, and a day later the Taliban capture Kandahar and Laskar Gah in the south. The cities of Asadabad and Gardez follow on Saturday with Mazar-i-Sharif, where President Ghani had visited just three days earlier. The Taliban are now camped just 50 kilometres away from Kabul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/timeline-the-talibans-sweeping-offensive-in-afghanistan/articleshow/85341662.cms||---

The video showing the woman performing puja to her husband’s idol has taken the internet by storm. According to sources, the woman, identified as Padmavathi (43), lost her husband Gurukula Anki Reddy in a car accident in 2017. In a bid to preserve his memory, the woman built the temple and placed a bust size marble statue of Anki Reddy in the sanctum. The woman also provides free food for the needy on Saturdays, Sundays and on full moon days. In the viral video, Padmavathi says that locals offer prayers at the temple for their well-being.

---||World||Afghanistan’s US-built military is crumbling. What went wrong?||KANDHAR: The surrenders seem to be happening as fast as the Taliban can travel. In the past several days, Afghan security forces have collapsed in several cities under the pressure of a Taliban advance. The offensive has resulted in mass surrenders, captured helicopters and millions of dollars of US-supplied equipment. This implosion comes despite the US having poured over $83 billion in weapons, equipment and training into the country’s security forces over two decades. It began with individual outposts in rural areas where starving and ammunition-depleted soldiers were surrounded by Taliban fighters and promised safe passage if they surrendered and left behind their equipment. As posts collapsed, the complaint was the same: There was no air support or they had run out of supplies and food. But even before that, the systemic weaknesses of the Afghan security forces — which on paper numbered somewhere around 300,000 people, but in recent days have totalled around just one-sixth of that, according to US officials — were apparent. These shortfalls can be traced to numerous issues that sprung from the West’s insistence on building a fully modern military with all the logistical and supply complexities, and which has proved unsustainable without the US and its Nato allies. Soldiers and policemen have expressed resentment of the Afghan leadership. Officials turned a blind eye to what was happening knowing full well that the Afghan forces’ real manpower count was far lower than what was on the books, skewed by corruption. In interview after interview, soldiers and police officers described moments of despair and feelings of abandonment. On one front line in Kandahar, the Afghan security forces’ inability to fend off the Taliban came down to potatoes. After weeks of fighting, one box full of slimy potatoes was supposed to pass as a unit’s daily rations. “These french fries are not going to hold these front lines!” an officer yelled. By Thursday, the line collapsed, and Kandahar was in Taliban control by Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghanistans-us-built-military-is-crumbling-what-went-wrong/articleshow/85341696.cms||---
---||Noida||Cyber cafe owner, aide forge RCs & marksheets, held||Greater Noida: The owner of a cyber café in Bisrakh and an accomplice have been arrested for allegedly forging marksheets of students of classes X and XI, driving licences, registration certificates and Aadhaar cards. Police said they had recovered 54 bogus Aadhaar cards, 51 fake driving licences, 14 forged marksheets of high school, 12 of intermediate and two of ITI courses, among other documents, from the cyber café that they searched on Friday. DCP (central Noida) Harish Chander said the prime accused, Saadab Alam (in his thirties), had been running the cyber café along with Sahil (26) for the past one and half year. “Under its garb, they had been forging documents such as Aadhaar cards, driving licences, high school and intermediate marksheets and even registration certificates of the transport department,” he added. Anita Chauhan, the SHO of Bisrakh, said that after receiving a tip-off, the police sent a decoy customer, who was promised a forged RC for Rs 7,000. She said that the accused would use a scanner to make copies of original documents and then make changes to them with software. As the police held a news conference, a female lawyer representing the cyber café owner in court entered the premises and accused the cops of framing her client. Aarti Gupta, the lawyer for Saadab, claimed that the accused had only been making “corrections” to the genuine marksheets. Gupta alleged that when Adil, the brother-in-law of Saadab, went to the Bisrakh police station, a constable allegedly demanded Rs 800 to allow him to meet the café owner. Rajeev Rajput, who works at a jan suvidha kendra where Aadhaar cards are created, said documents like Aadhaar and PAN cards could be reprinted with corrections but not transport-related papers. “To get a correction done in a transport-related document like an RC or a driving licence, one has to visit the transport department and get the details changed. However, if the phone number is linked with the Aadhaar card, its details can be corrected online. Details on PAN cards can be corrected too,” he added. Saadab and Sahil have been booked under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of a valuable security, will or authority to make or transfer any valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged 1[document or electronic record]). Lawyer Gupta said that she would apply for bail for her client in the Surajpur court on Monday. “The police wanted their custody but the court did not grant it. We will appeal for his bail on Monday,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/cyber-cafe-owner-aide-forge-rcs-marksheets-held/articleshow/85336615.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Noida||Crimes against women: 75% FIRs in May-July||Ghaziabad: The district has reported a slight rise in crimes against women this year. While 211 FIRs of offences against women were registered in Ghaziabad between January 1 and July 31 in 2020, the number was 222 in the corresponding period this year, a rise of 5.2%. Compared to 509 FIRs in 2019, this year has seen a 56.3% dip, according to police data. Last year saw a decline in crimes because of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown but the figures are slowly rising this year and may gradually reach pre-pandemic levels, police said. A total of 18 rape cases have been filed this year till July 31, compared to 15 in 2020. Cases of abduction, however, have reported a dip of 12% — 74 such cases have been reported this year, against 84 in 2020. Predictably, 2019 has the highest crime rates in three years — as many as 53 FIRs of rape and 175 of abduction were registered that year. “In over 90% of rape cases, the perpetrator is known to the victims. Out of this, the accused is a family member or friend in 40% cases and a neighbour in 20%. The survivor is or was in a relationship with the rapist in 20% of cases,” a senior officer said. He added that once the pandemic hit, most people went back to their hometowns, which could have led to the dip in crime last year. “Some criminals also died due to Covid. With lockdown restrictions being lifted and people returning this year, crimes are rising again. Around 75% of the crimes against women reported in the first six months of 2021 were committed between May and July,” he said. With 18 FIRs, dowry death cases witnessed a slight dip this year, compared to 20 in 2020 and 23 in 2019. DIG and Ghaziabad SSP Amit Pathak said police are working towards making the city a ‘crime-free’ zone for women. “We have taken steps to help women victims by opening a public grievance cell. In the past one year, we have seen that most complaints were resolved by counselling in the grievance cell. ‘Anti-Romeo’ squads are also functioning and around 1,050 men and boys have been caught harassing women by the squad this year,” he added. With many stepping out of their homes for office, studies or other work after the relaxation of Covid restrictions, crimes like snatching and loot have seen a sharp rise. A total of 35 cases of women being robbed when they were going home from offices or going to markets and other public areas have been reported this year, a 60% spike compared to 22 in 2020. In 2019, 65 such cases were reported. SSP Pathak said patrolling has been intensified. “In city areas, the response time of UP 112 patrol vehicles has been reduced to eight minutes. We are trying to improve our response time,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/crimes-against-women-75-firs-in-may-july/articleshow/85336701.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||World||Asians are fastest-growing racial group in US: Report||WASHINGTON: Asian Americans grew faster than any other minority group in the US in the last decade, rising to 24 million in 2020, according to the first detailed data released from last year’s census. The growth in the American population over the last decade was driven entirely by minority communities, according to the new data released on Thursday by the US census bureau. The number of white Americans declined for the first time since the United States’ founding in 1776. Non-Hispanic whites make up just under 58% of the American population, the first time since the census was first conducted that they have fallen under the 60% mark. By contrast, the 2000 census showed non-Hispanic whites made up just over 69% of the population, and 63.7% in 2010. The data revealed almost 20 million people identified as “Asian”, and another 4 million checked boxes as “Asian” combined with another race group, for a total of 7.2% of the population. Another 0.5% of the population identifies as “Native Hawaiian” and “Other Pacific Islander” alone or in combination with another racial group. The results make the Asian population the fastest-growing racial group in the US at 35.5%, NBC News said. According to the 2010 United States Census, there were a total of 17,320,856 Asian Americans in the US. “The US population is much more multiracial and much more racially and ethnically diverse than we measured in the past,” said Nicholas Jones, director of race, ethnicity and outreach in the US census bureau’s population division. Aggressive outreach in addition to the shifting demographics helped impact the group’s participation in the census, as well as overall population growth, Karthick Ramakrishnan, founder of AAPI Data, a policy and research nonprofit group, told NBC. The overall American population grew by 7.4% over the last decade to reach 331 million. The rate of growth was the slowest since the 1930s.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/asians-are-fastest-growing-racial-group-in-us-report/articleshow/85341742.cms||---

On the eve of Independence Day and with Raksha Bandhan just a week away, shoppers flocked to the markets in the twin cities as the UP government partially lifted weekend lockdown. Although customers had been trickling in for the past several weeks, traders and shop owners were heavily relying on the weekends, when the footfall is the highest. It was a welcome break for the shoppers too. Many of whom employed with private firms said they hardly got time on weekdays to go shopping. “It was so good coming out to the market on a Saturday after such a long time. I was very happy to see the usual scenes of people queuing up outside popular shops and eating their favourite food. I don’t get time to take my family out shopping on weekdays because I return home late from the office. For years, I had reserved the weekends to visit the markets. But weekend curfew had made it difficult,” said Ritesh Singh, a Noida resident. Sarojini Choudhary, another resident, was happy to be able to shop for Rakhi, which is next Sunday. “We were not sure if we could celebrate the festival at all because it is on a Sunday. I am so relieved that the lockdown has been lifted.” Not just customers, traders sported smiling faces too. “In the trans-Hindon areas of Ghaziabad, which has a sizable working population, it has been a trend to go out for shopping on weekends. The lockdown on weekends had hit our business by almost 40%,” said Anirudh Vasistha of the Vaishali Vypaar Mandal. As markets in UP remained shut on Saturdays and Sundays for so long, residents often went to neighbouring Delhi to shop or looked up the Internet. Although markets have been allowed to stay open from 6am to 10pm on Saturdays, they will remain shut on Sundays. However, this partial relaxation has given much hope to many shop owners to return to brisk business. Athar Siddiqui, who owns a meat shop in Sector 78, said, “I got some repair work done through July and thought of opening the shop after the month of sawan. But some people had been asking me about opening the shop. I think I will resort to full-fledged business by next Saturday.” SK Jain, president of the Sector 18 market association, said the decision to partially lift the weekend lockdown was much needed for business. “We suffered huge losses due to the pandemic. Families that used to visit our stores to buy garments have gradually shifted to online shopping. We hope to do some business before Raksha Bandhan,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/saturday-curbs-off-weekend-shoppers-return-to-markets/articleshow/85336756.cms||Shalabh

The oxyhydrogen-driven system, which was given to the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) by the MBDB, is gathering dust in Paoni. Information received by social worker Manoj Wahane under the RTI Act revealed that the board procured one oxyhydrogen-driven system for treatment of bamboo for Rs39.12 lakh on November 11, 2018, and handed it over to FDCM for operations. The National Bamboo Mission’s (NBM) guidelines have a provision of 100% grant for government sector purchase of bamboo treatment and seasoning plants under the head of promotion of bamboo treatment and preservation, but the maximum cost considered by NBM for one unit is Rs20 lakh. Wahane said, “It has been over two-and-a-half years since the oxyhydrogen bamboo treatment plant was delivered to FDCM by MBDB. However, it has not been used even once. It is lying idle at FDCM’s Paoni premises. There is no expertise to operate this equipment.” Pratap Goswami, bamboo expert and Sanghatan Mantri of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) who raised irregularities in MBDB, said, “The bamboo sector has never heard of or seen such oxyhydrogen bamboo treatment system. The machine has never been tried in the past and how this equipment was procured is not clear.” The RTI information further revealed that FDCM is now in the process of identifying around 2,000 sqft land on the 25 hectares non-forest land available at Gorewada for the oxyhydrogen plant. The divisional manager, Gorewada, has been entrusted to prepare proposals for obtaining permission from Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health. “Permission shall be sought under the Forest Conservation Act (FCA), 1980, for this unit. The process for selection of an architect has been initiated. The appointed architect shall select a suitable land for installation of the plant,” the RTI says. “This means the machine was handed over two years ago and the land is being identified to operate it now. There is no commitment when the oxyhydrogen plant will be operational,” said Goswami. Goswami demanded that performance guarantees be collected from suppliers of faulty and substandard machines should be invoked. He also demanded that new machines with proper specifications should be procured at the risk and cost of the defaulting suppliers and officials related to procurement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bamboo-treatment-plant-gathering-dust-at-fdcm/articleshow/85336791.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

It was also the first such drive conducted across the state on the UP government’s directives. A total of 7,521 jabs were given out, of which 6,735 were given to the ones who were eligible for the second dose. Officials said almost 90% of the jabs were given to recipients of the second dose while 786 individuals who had booked slots in advance also managed to get the first dose. For the past few weeks, people eligible for the second dose were struggling to get a slot. Officials said that due to a decreased supply of the vaccine, only a limited number of free slots could be offered. “Responding to their grievances, the government has dedicated Saturday for second doses only. This way, people will be able to maintain the vaccine schedule,” said an officer from the district. A resident of Sector Zeta in Greater Noida, Nitin Srivastava said, “My father was due for the second dose of Covisheild from July 3. However, I was not able to find a slot for him and ultimately took him to a private centre. On Saturday, I was able to send my domestic help for the second dose as she was also struggling to get a slot.” Meanwhile, a total of 7,876 people were vaccinated in Ghaziabad, of whom 5,246 recipients got their second dose. “As per a government order, Saturday was reserved for people eligible for the second dose and over 66% of the total people vaccinated got the second dose,” said an official from the Ghaziabad health department. “At 32 government centre, we also administered the first dose to people but that was after stipulated timing — between 9 am and 11 am,” added the official. In Ghaziabad, a total of 3,17,813 people have received the second dose so far while 13,67,395 people have received the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/2nd-dose-drive-begins-but-slots-for-free-vax-hard-to-get/articleshow/85336818.cms||Shalabh
---||Noida||9 more villages in Noida to get piped water||Greater Noida: The Noida administration has decided to provide piped water to nine villages soon. A survey conducted under the central scheme, Jal Jeevan Mission, found that only 12% of households in these villages had access to tap water. The district administration had in August 2019 listed 47,540 households in Dadri, Jewar and Sadar tehsils. So far, 5,331 households have been provided with piped water. In total, 97 gram sabhas were surveyed under the Centre’s mission. While 38 villages have already got water connections in houses, the remaining 59 will be covered in phases. “During the previous phases, Rs 82.6 crore was spent on providing water connections in these villages. The work had been commissioned by the Jal Nigam,” district magistrate Suhas LY said. The nine villages in the Dadri and Jewar tehsils are the next in line. A fund of Rs 24.3 crore has been set aside for this project, officials said on Friday. The villages that will be connected next are Dadupur Khatana, Jaitwarpur, Muthyani, Sainthali, Umcha Amirpur and Payali Tajpur in Dadri and Dhundhera, Changauli and Rajpur Kalan in Jewar. Anil Kumar Singh, the chief development officer of the district, said the detailed project report would be ready soon and tenders would follow next. The administration has set a deadline of August 14, 2024, to connect all rural households with piped water. The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA), too, will start work on connecting the remaining urban villages with piped water. GNIDA is responsible for providing urban services to 112 villages, of which only 44 have access to water connections. Some of the villages that will have a water supply network are Accheja, Haibatpur, Milak Lacchi, Kasna, Gurjarpur, Makoda, Ladpura, Khanpur, Roza Jalalpur and Patwari, among others. “A number of villagers have submersible pumps, while there are some families that rely on hand pumps for drinking water. Piped water is a basic necessity and GNIDA should have ensured this long ago,” said Ravinder Bhati of Roza Jalalpur village. Notified villages under the development authorities are not covered by the Jal Jeevan Mission. It is the local authority that has to provide civic services in such villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/9-more-villages-in-noida-to-get-piped-water/articleshow/85336871.cms||Shalabh

The gang operating in Delhi-NCR had had at least 12 cases of fraud registered against them in Delhi and Ghaziabad. Police have recovered 56 ATM cards and some cash from them and have also impounded an SUV that they used for the crimes. The accused, identified as Arun (36), Sarvesh Rajput (29), Rishi Kumar (27) and Ankur (29), were arrested on Saturday morning from Vaishali. Mahendra Kumar, SHO of Kaushambi police station, said, “Arun, a resident of Vinod Nagar in Delhi, is the mastermind in the case and has nine cases of ATM frauds registered against him in Delhi and Ghaziabad. He was also on the wanted list of the Delhi crime branch.” Kumar added that they have recovered 56 ATM cards, Rs 18,300, two fake vehicle registration plates, a country made gun and EcoSport SUV from them. Explaining their modus operandi, Kumar said that they targeted gullible people and the elderly. They would roam around ATMs that had less security. “While one of them offered help to the people facing difficulty in accessing the machine, two of them stood guard outside and the fourth would wait in the car. The accused would switch the original card with a fake one and after inserting the card into the machine, he would ask for the ATM pin. He would then hand over the fake card and say the machine is not working,” Kumar said. They would then withdraw money with the original ATM card using the PIN already provided by the victim, the SHO said, adding that to avoid getting caught, the gang constantly switched their vehicle’s number plate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/gang-behind-12-atm-frauds-in-gzb-delhi-busted-four-arrested/articleshow/85338676.cms||Abhijay Jha

---||Noida||UP, Haryana to share cost of Delhi-Mumbai expressway link to Jewar airport||GREATER NOIDA: Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments have decided to equally share the cost of building a spur route to connect the airport site in Jewar with the Delhi-Mumbai expressway. Earlier, arriving at the cost-sharing formula was proving to be difficult since a major portion of the link road falls under Haryana. However, the UP government has committed to share half the total project cost. This road is said to be important to boost connectivity in the Yamuna Expressway region.  Apart from catering to the flyers from Haryana, direct connectivity through a network of expressways-highways will also fillip the logistics business in the region. “We have to think about the overall development of the Ghaziabad-Noida-Dadri industrial corridor investment region. Having a direct link to the Delhi-Mumbai expressway will be helpful in the long term,” said a senior officer from the industries department. Earlier, the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) had given the task of checking the feasibility of building the spur route to RITES. Having analysed the study report prepared by RITES, YEIDA officials deliberated upon two options. The first option was to link the airport site in Jewar and Yamuna Expressway to Ballabhgarh in Faridabad. The second one was to provide an interchange somewhere close to the alignment of the Delhi-Mumbai expressway and Western Peripheral expressway. The second option was proposed to cater to the larger population, service providers and business operators active in Manesar, Sohna, Nuh and Palwal in Haryana. “Executing the spur route to Ballabhgarh seems feasible. The major portion of the work will be done towards the other side of the Yamuna river. We have sent the proposal about the project to the state government and are waiting for their decision,” said YEIDA's chief executive officer Arun Vir Singh. Sources said that the Uttar Pradesh government has agreed to share half the cost of the project and will reach out to the special purpose vehicle of the National Highways Authority of India that is executing the Delhi-Mumbai expressway project to take things forward. About 7.5km out of the total 31km spur route will fall in Uttar Pradesh while the remaining 23.5km will come on the other side of Yamuna in Haryana. A bridge will be constructed over the river and YEIDA will acquire the land required for the project. Officials said preliminary discussions have already taken place with NHAI and funds will be arranged within the next few weeks to start the tendering process. “We will ask NHAI’s SPV only to commission the work. Land and funds will be provided by UP and Haryana,” said an official of the authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/up-haryana-to-share-cost-of-del-mum-e-way-link-to-airport/articleshow/85338696.cms||Shalabh
---||Noida||Greater Noida green belts to get unique IDs||GREATER NOIDA: The green belts spread across Greater Noida will soon be given serial numbers. The decision to assign numbers and unique identities to the green belts was taken to improve their maintenance and to monitor the quality of the horticulture work. While residents had forwarded their grievances pertaining to green belts along with names of the nearest landmarks, a lot of confusion prevailed as more than one green belt had been developed near the busy crossings. Elaborating on this, a GNIDA official explained that various green belts in Alpha Sector will be numbered Alpha GB 1, Alpha GB 2 and so on. Green belts in Beta and Ecotech sectors will have similar numbers to avoid confusion. The official added that in such a scenario, it will be easier to identify the green belts. “We will also get to know the maintenance period of the contractor assigned the upkeep of the green belt and parks in a sector,” he said. Residents having complaints related to maintenance of parks and green belts can reach out to the authority on these numbers -- 0120 – 2336046/47/48 -- or send their complaints on the authority mobile app. A WhatsApp number (8800203912) has been also kept to redress grievances of the residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gr-noida-green-belts-to-get-unique-ids/articleshow/85338701.cms||---
