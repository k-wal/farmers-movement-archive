The tribunal heard that Ranger (73), chairman of Sun Mark and patron of Conservative Friends of India, had spoken to the woman on October 5, 2018 by phone when she told him she was raising allegations of sexual harassment against the head of finance at Sun Mark, Kapil Sharma. Sun Mark issued a statement saying it “strongly denied” allegations of victimisation, harassment and discrimination against Ranger and its CEO Sunny Ahuja and pointed out that the Employment Appeal Tribunal has granted them permission to appeal on numerous grounds. Sharma is applying for permission to appeal the sexual harassment findings against him. “The claimant gave the tribunal a highly distorted account of a part-recorded telephone call with our chairman, in which she shouted and deliberately goaded him with insults about his family and business before secretly recording the conversation. We believe the call amounted to entrapment,” Sun Mark said. “The tribunal agreed that many of the words attributed to him by the claimant’s translator were never said. The call was only part recorded after our chairman had been insulted and provoked.” Judge Alastair Smail dismissed many of the woman’s other allegations, stating she had “exaggerated matters and distorted matters considerably”. “She seeks to put a far more sinister interpretation on what happened, which is not credible,” he said. “That may be because she felt vulnerable as an Indian person on a visa only, hoping, eventually, to receive indefinite leave to remain. The claimant is not entirely a reliable witness.” The woman secretly recorded the phone call in which Ranger allegedly said: “You have no virtues whatsoever. You are a policewoman and coming over from Punjab you are behaving exactly like Jats do with men… I won’t spare you … I do not want to talk to you any further, I will meet you in court. Listen, I had mercy on you in the name of God because you were begging me, but what a scumbag you have turned out to be… I tell you what I have made a mistake by doing a good deed but from now onwards I will never help anyone… You are a big time lying woman." The tribunal found his remarks amounted to victimisation, harassment and direct discrimination. The tribunal also found that Sharma had subjected the woman to “unwanted sexual attention” via repeated requests for a sexual relationship from July 2018 until September 2018 and that Ahuja, CEO of Sun Mark, and son-in-law of Lord Ranger, had victimised the same woman by dissuading her from pursuing a complaint of sexual harassment by asking her to consider the implications for her job, visa and honour. The tribunal heard Ranger had appointed the woman having been introduced to her by a friend, but she had demonstrated performance issues, for example she had posted invoices to the wrong hotel and paid £3,000 to the wrong supplier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/tribunal-rules-british-indian-peer-victimised-and-harassed-female-employee/articleshow/82072792.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Patna city fire station officer Ajay Kumar Sharma told TOI at the spot on Wednesday that the building’s firefighting system was not working. “The water in the firefighting system was getting pumped only till the first floor while the fire was raging on the sixth floor. Had it been working, the crucial initial hours would not have been wasted. The hoses of the system were also missing,” he said. Another fire officer Indrajeet Kumar told this newspaper that besides the malfunctioning firefighting system, a large number of four-wheelers were illegally parked inside the campus. “Fire tenders were unable to enter due to these vehicles. We broke the glasses of a few cars, shifted their gear to neutral and pushed them out. Moving of these vehicles to make space for water tenders consumed almost two crucial hours,” he said. “Three water tenders were rushed from Hajipur and two more from Jehanabad looking at the situation. More than 80 firefighters were engaged in the several hour-long operations,” he added. Pankaj Kumar, a shop owner at the Bhawan, said they have repeatedly raised the issue of fire safety before the district board authorities. “We are never included in any meeting for the building. Nor are our concerns heard,” Kumar said. Building caretaker Uday Kumar said there are eight offices and 50 shops in the building. “At least Rs 3 lakh monthly maintenance is collected by the district board from these offices and shops. Rs 2.5 per square feet is the rate for maintenance,” he said. Another shop owner Ranjeet Kumar said travel agents park their cars and other vehicles illegally inside the building premises. “It was these cars which blocked the approach of fire tenders on Tuesday night,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/illegally-parked-cars-faulty-fire-safety-system-delayed-firefighting/articleshow/82071586.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Principal secretary (health) Pratyay Amrit on Wednesday said the army had set up a dedicated Covid-19 centre at the 500-bed ESI hospital at Bihta from the PM care fund during the last years’ pandemic. Currently, only 50 beds at the 500-bed hospitals are functional for the treatment of covid-19 patients. As per the agreement, the army provides doctors at the dedicated hospital, while nurses and other supporting staff were provided by the state government. “I have sent a letter to the defense secretary urging him to depute at least 50 doctors from the army, so that all 500 beds at the central government’s hospital could be utilized for the treatment of covid-19 patients,” Amrit told TOI. He said a team of DRDO on Wednesday visited Bihta hospital to assess the requirements. “Once, the army deploys its doctors, the state government will deploy its nurses and other staff,” Amrit said. He also said once all 500-bed at the Bihta hospital becomes functional, it would ease patients’ load from the Patna-based dedicated hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-19-bihar-government-seeks-deployment-of-50-army-doctors-at-dedicated-covid-19-hospital-at-bihta/articleshow/82072969.cms||Madan Kumar

A total of 1,99,620 new cases was recorded, just 380 short of the 2-lakh milestone, a mere 10 days after the single-day case tally had crossed 1 lakh, as per TOI’s data collated from state governments. Coronavirus: Live updatesThe US, the only other country to log over 2 lakh cases in a day, had taken 21 days to hit the grim milestone after crossing the 1-lakh mark. Cases in the US hit 1 lakh on October 30 last year and crossed 2 lakh on November 20. The country went on to record a peak of 3,09,035 cases in a single day on January 8, as per the worldometers.info website. Read AlsoNearly 1,300 test Covid positive at Kumbh in 5 days, 14 lakh take part in 3rd shahi snanWednesday’s shahi snan saw the lowest footfall among all three shahi snans (the figure was upwards of 30 lakh on each day). Inspector-general of police Sanjay Gunjayal, in charge of the Kumbh, said the low footfall had been a blessing of sorts as crowd management was easier.Such has been the second-wave surge in India that daily cases have hit a new high on nine of the last 11 days — the only two exceptions being Mondays, when numbers usually drop sharply due to lower testing and staff shortages over the weekend. The death toll from the virus was over 1,000 for the second day running as 1,038 fatalities were recorded on Wednesday, the highest daily toll since October 2. On Tuesday, India had reported 1,035 deaths. The pandemic continued to spread alarmingly through several states, particularly those in the Hindi heartland. As many as nine states posted their highest-ever rise in daily count on Wednesday. Uttar Pradesh logged 20,510 new cases, becoming the second state after Maharashtra to record more than 20,000 infections in a day. The state had recorded over 10,000 daily cases for the first time just four days ago, when the count had hit 12,787. The pandemic in Delhi was surging almost as sharply, with the capital reporting 17,282 cases on Wednesday, having hit the 10,000 mark just three days ago. Other states that saw daily cases at an all-time high were Karnataka (11,265), Madhya Pradesh (9,720), Gujarat (7,410), Rajasthan (6,200), Haryana (5,398), Bengal (5,892) and Bihar (4,786). In Bihar, active cases rose by 17.7% in the last 24 hours, going from 20,149 on Tuesday to 23,725 on Wednesday, with the positivity rate at 4.7%. The positivity rate in Kerala, which voted for a new assembly on April 6, jumped to a record high of 13.45%. The state recorded 8,778 new cases, the highest since October 28. Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, logged 58,952 fresh cases, a slight drop from Tuesday's count of 60,212. The state continued to lead the country in cases as well as fatalities, with 278 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. Chhattisgarh reported 120 deaths, followed by Delhi — where fatalities rose sharply to 104 -- Gujarat (73), UP (68), Punjab (63) and MP (51).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-daily-cases-double-in-10-days-to-just-shy-of-2-lakh/articleshow/82073906.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

After a goalless first half, Bengaluru turned the tide with a brace each from Rahul Bheke (51’, 65’) and Cleiton Augusto (61’,63’), while captain Sunil Chhetri (52’) also added his name to the score-sheet. Bengaluru now await the winners of the other preliminary tie between Abahani Limited Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Club Eagles (Maldives). The playoff will take place at the same venue on April 28. Bengaluru started strongly in new coach Marco Pezzaiuoli’s first competitive game. They moved the ball comfortably. It was a similar formation which they used in the Indian Super League but there were notable changes. New signing Yrondu Musavu-King came in defence while Harmanjot Khabra moved to the midfield. Tribhuvan, without any foreign players in their side, knew they had to soak in the pressure. Understandably, coach Nabin Neupane opted for a compact midfield with only captain Nawayug Shreshta leading the attack. It did work as Bengaluru found it hard to build up moves for strikers Chhetri and Cleiton. Tribhuvan had the first chance when Santosh Tamang fired a half volley, but it took a deflection and landed into the safe hands of Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. Bengaluru almost found the breakthrough in the 20th minute when Chhetri found Cleiton, but his left-footer hit the upright before brushing off the gloves of Biwash Chaudhary. Before the break, Cleiton came close again while Chhetri’s effort was stopped on the goalline. Bengaluru showed more intent when play resumed. The former AFC Cup runnersup finally broke the deadlock through a set piece in the 51st minute. Cleiton whipped in a perfect in-swinging corner and Bheke leaped highest to head in the opener. Tribhuvan hardly got time to reorganise as Bengaluru struck again with Chhetri finishing delightfully, thanks to an assist from Khabra. At the hour mark, Bengaluru scored their third when Gurpreet’s long ball was headed by Chhetri towards Cleiton who got the better of the onrushing keeper and defenders before calmly slotting into an empty goal. Three minutes later, Cleiton secured his brace after picking up a cross from Udanta Singh. In the 65th minute, Cleiton and Bheke executed another corner to perfection with the centre-back heading in the fifth goal. Bengaluru were dominant and had plenty of chances but could not increase their tally. Now they have one more hurdle to cross before they join the group stage of the AFC Cup, Asian football’s second-tier club competition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bengaluru-cruise-past-tribhuvan-army/articleshow/82074101.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

The positive cases came out of 1.08 lakh tests -- 73,915 RT-PCR and 34,619 rapid antigen – with the positivity rate recorded at 15.92%, the highest ever in the state. Earlier, on November 15, the city had recorded a positivity rate of 15.33%. “There are no ICU beds available in most big hospitals, both public and private. There is no sign of the outbreak ebbing either,” said a senior doctor at AIIMS, adding that if cases continue to grow at this rate, the city’s health infrastructure may collapse. Currently, Delhi has 50,736 active cases, of which 24,155 (50%) are under home isolation. Faced with an unprecedented situation, the Delhi government on Wednesday converted around 15 hotels into ‘extended Covid hospitals’ by linking these to private hospitals. It capped the price at Rs. 5,000 per day for staying at the five-star hotels and Rs. 4,000 for four or three-star hotels. This will add nearly 3,000 beds with the provision of transferring patients to the linked hospital if their condition became severe during their stay. The hotels include Crowne Plaza in Okhla Phase I and Shalimar Bagh, ITC Welcome in Dwarka, Radisson Blue in Paschim Vihar and Surya in New Friends Colony. The government has also ordered conversion of several banquet halls, one school and Yamuna Sports Complex into temporary Covid hospitals. This would make over 1,100 Covid beds available in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/17000-more-covid-cases-in-delhi-hotels-and-banquet-halls-turned-into-hospitals/articleshow/82074194.cms||---
---||India||Mamata Banerjee meets kin of Sitalkuchi dead, vows not to ‘spare anyone’||COOCH BEHAR: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday met the families of the five Sitalkuchi residents killed during polling in north Bengal's Cooch Behar last Saturday, including four in CISF firing, and appealed to people to not be "instigated and provoked" if they wanted "the five souls to rest in peace". Her visit came on the first day after the Election Commission's bar on entry of "political leaders" into Cooch Behar got over. All five deceased were Rajbanshis, Mamata said, alluding to BJP's criticism that she hadn't mentioned the ethnicity of the youth shot dead by bullet-borne assailants while focusing on the four deaths in firing by CISF on a mob. "One, Ananda Burman, was a Hindu Rajbanshi; the other four were Muslim Rajbanshis. But all five were Rajbanshis," the CM reminded villagers, while urging them to remain "peaceful and united". "Peace, justice and ballots would be the best response to central forces’ bullets," she said. Mamata and Trinamool Congress had termed the CISF firing on villagers "genocide". BJP, on the other hand, accused the CM of "instigating" people against central forces, "which led to the firing". BJP also questioned why Mamata hadn't spoken about the fifth death (Burman’s), insinuating that she was playing "vote-bank politics". Mamata met Burman’s grandfather and uncle on Wednesday and spoke to them for several minutes before delivering her appeal for peace and unity. The rest of the family did not meet the CM. The 18-year-old was gunned down by bike-borne assailants as soon as he exited a booth in Sitalkuchi after casting the first vote of his life. BJP and Trinamool have blamed each other for his murder. Mamata cradled a newborn in her lap and comforted a three-year-old girl — both orphaned in Saturday’s firing — and said, "We will not spare anyone, however big the accused may be. I can tell you this: the accused will be punished and we will do whatever is necessary. My brother Ananda Burman, too, has died. His killers won't be spared either." The CM said "the most unfortunate thing" was that all those who lost their lives were young. "One’s wife will deliver their child any time. Another has left behind an infant not even a month old. One has a little child. This is the condition of the families. These families deserve justice. They should get justice." Mamata said she would have visited the families earlier if she were allowed to. "But you know I was not allowed to come here for 72 hours. I managed to come here today. I have to complete five public rallies in Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Nadia before campaigning ends, but I somehow managed to find time to come here. I will not promise anything now because of the election. But we will ensure that families of all who have died in political violence in Bengal get help," she said. "Please consider me as part of your family," the CM told the bereaved families. She then asked Trinamool functionaries to "adopt" the families that lost a member each in the violence. "We will keep peace. We will respond to bullets with ballots. We will respond to bullets with peace. We will respond to bullets with justice," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mamata-banerjee-meets-kin-of-sitalkuchi-dead-vows-not-to-spare-anyone/articleshow/82074507.cms||---

---||India||Launch of India's new-age earth imaging satellite by May 15: K Sivan||NEW DELHI: The launch of the country’s most advanced earth observation satellite Gisat-1, which will allow India to better monitor the subcontinent, including its borders with Pakistan and China, is slated for launch before May 15. The launch of the 2,268-kg satellite was earlier aborted in the first half of this month due to a technical glitch. Indian space research organisation (Isro) chairman K Sivan told TOI, "The technical glitch related to a voltage fluctuation issue in the satellite is being fixed. Thereafter, the satellite will be assembled in the launch vehicle and tested again. All these things will take time and the launch is likely to happen in the first half of next month. The delay in the launch of Gisat-1 by GSLV-F10 and the Covid situation will, however, postpone other launches, including the first test-flight of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV or mini PSLV), this year." Equipped with high resolution cameras, Gisat-1 will allow the country to monitor the Indian landmass and oceans, particularly its borders, continuously as it will provide near real-time imaging of the large area region of interest at frequent intervals. It will also help in quick monitoring of natural disasters, episodic and any short-term events. The geo-satellite will also obtain spectral signatures for agriculture, forestry, mineralogy, disaster warning, cloud properties, snow and glaciers and oceanography. The satellite is configured around modified I-2k bus carrying multispectral and hyperspectral payloads in different bands with improved spatial and temporal resolution. Gisat-1 will be placed in a geosynchronous transfer orbit by the GSLV-F10 rocket. Subsequently, the satellite will reach the geostationary orbit using its onboard propulsion system. Sivan said Covid cases had been found among staff at the Sriharikota launch centre as well as at the Isro headquarters in Bengaluru. "But we are taking all precautions and following all Covid-related SOPs," he said. The Isro chief also told TOI that launches of Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya L1 solar missions will happen in the first half of next year as these "missions have a limited and specific launch window within which we have to launch them". On the first launch of the Gaganyaan unmanned flight in December this year, Sivan said green fuel will be used for the first time in the orbital module. However, switching rocket propulsion to green fuel in PSLV and GSLV will take some time, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/launch-of-indias-new-age-earth-imaging-satellite-by-may-15-k-sivan/articleshow/82074910.cms||Surendra Singh
---||India||Over 76% shortfall of specialist doctors in rural health centres||NEW DELHI: Though availability of allopathic doctors and female health workers in rural India has increased substantially in the last 15 years (between 2005 and 2020), there remains a severe shortfall of over 76% in terms of specialists like surgeons, gynaecologists, physicians and paediatricians in community health centres (CHCs), the latest Rural Health Statistics (RHS) 2019-20 says. The RHS, released by the health ministry, shows a serious gap in the country’s health infrastructure even as there are small improvements in various disciplines as compared to statistics provided by the Centre to Parliament in 2019, which had shown an 81% shortfall. Despite the Centre's efforts to boost the rural health infrastructure through programmes like National Rural Health Mission and measures to increase availability of doctors and specialists, the more remote and rural areas remain disadvantaged. Between 2005 and 2020, though availability of specialist doctors in CHCs increased from 3,550 to 4,957, the gap between required and available specialists was 6,110. The total requirement of specialists is estimated at 13,384. “Moreover, compared to requirement for existing infrastructure, there is a shortfall of 78.9% of surgeons, 69.7% of obstetricians and gynaecologists, 78.2% of physicians and 78.2% of paediatricians,” the RHS says. “Overall, there is a shortfall of 76.1 of specialists in the CHCs (community health centres) as compared to the requirement for existing CHCs,” it adds. Among states with significant shortfalls are Gujarat, lacking 996 specialists against a requirement of 1,088; Madhya Pradesh, with a requirement of 916, is short of 867; and West Bengal which requires 380 specialists but has fewer 247 specialists. Allopathic doctors in PHCs have, however, increased from 20,308 in 2005 to 28,516 in 2020, up about 40%. There is shortfall of 6.8% of allopathic doctors at the PHC level. The number of ANMs in sub-centres and PHCs has increased by around 59.6%. The overall shortfall (which excludes existing surplus in some states) of female health workers and ANMs is just 2% as per the norm of one HW(F)/ANM per sub-centre and PHC. The Centre recently allowed two-year postgraduate diploma courses that applicants can pursue after completing their MBBS, to address the shortage of specialists in district hospitals and in rural India. Candidates can pursue these courses by clearing the NEET-PG exam after completing MBBS. The data also shows that till March 31, 2020, there were 38,595 functional health and wellness centres in rural India. The target under Ayushman Bharat is to set up 1,53,000 health and wellness centres by 2022. There are 1,43,538 and 2,87,025 beds available at the level of sub-divisional hospitals and district hospitals, respectively. One sub-centre in India currently caters to an average population of 5,729, a primary health centre to an average population of 35,730, and community health centre to an average of 1,71,779 people, the data shows. According to norms, a sub-centre can cater to a maximum of 5,000 people, a primary health centre to a maximum of 30,000, and a community health centre to a maximum of 1,20,000 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-76-shortfall-of-specialist-doctors-in-rural-health-centres/articleshow/82075169.cms||Sushmi Dey

Fortunately, he had already bought a train ticket in black to UP’s Kushinagar and managed to board the train at 1am on Wednesday. “It was difficult to get into the station because of the crowds, but I managed because I had a ticket,” said Yadav, who ended up paying Rs 2,300 to a tout for a ticket worth Rs 450. As a daily wager, Yadav says it will be impossible for him to survive in the city without work, despite the state’s relief package. “I do not have a ration card, so I will not get free ration. My rent alone is Rs 3,000 per month. How will I pay that?” he asks. Through the day, huge crowds of migrants from UP and Bihar thronged the Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, desperate to return home. Among them were daily wagers who worked in shops, restaurants and markets. Besides, there were electricians, carpenters and drivers who found their work drying up. Tempo driver Rajesh Yadav said he earned just Rs 600 a week in March itself. “As Covid cases went up, barely anyone was hiring the tempo. Now, with the curfew, even fewer people will travel,” the Gorakhpur man said. “I just have Rs 500 left with me. Who knows if the government will extend the lockdown?” Yadav said. Activists working with the poor say the Maharashtra government’s Rs 5,476-crore relief package is too little given the enormity of the distress caused by the stringent restrictions. The state government is offering 3kg of wheat and 2kg of rice free of cost for a month for those who hold ration cards under the National Food Security Act. The state has 7 crore listed beneficiaries. “A large number of migrants do not have ration cards. Those who have cards in their hometown find it difficult to access grains in another state despite the portability scheme,” said Ulka Mahajan from the Sarvahara Jan Andolan. The state’s relief scheme will also provide two lakh Shiv bhojan thalis free of cost to the needy for a month. “The number of thalis is too small to have any impact. Two lakh free thalis will not even suffice for the deprived in Mankhurd area, let alone the entire state,” said Bilal Khan from the Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/job-loss-tense-future-spark-mumbai-migrant-exodus-despite-government-aid/articleshow/82075251.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||India||Forest fire claims 8th life in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: A retired Uttarakhand government employee trying to help put out a forest fire was charred to death on Tuesday — the eighth such death this season. Raghuveer Lal, 65, a former public works department man, was just done with the first round of work on his farm at Gadoli village in Chamoli when he noticed a blaze in the Soniyaala forest area. He rushed there, hoping to help. But after he got there, within minutes the fire surrounded him and he could not get out. “A villager from Gadoli, Vinod, came running to tell us a man had been burnt in the forest fire. Before he was charred to death, he had actually helped in dousing the fires,” SHO of Gairsain police station Subhash Jakhmola said. But by the time they got there, it was too late. He succumbed to the burns. Area ranger Pradeep Gaur said, “Around 9am, some unidentified persons are believed to have caused the fire.” It was not clear why. Chief conservator of forests (nodal officer of forest fires) Man Singh said, “The state forest department is yet to take stock of the incident.” Since January this year, Uttarakhand has lost eight lives to wildfires — five in Kumaon and three in Garhwal. So far, about 2,800 hectares of forest cover has been gutted across the state in over 2,000 wildfire incidents. The treacherous landscape makes it difficult to continue with fire control operations. But this season has been especially bad because of how dry it has been and how the wind has been behaving. “This time, the main challenge we are facing is wind. Its direction keeps changing,” Rudraprayag divisional forest officer Vaibhav Singh said. On Tuesday, he added, some 25 people had to be deployed to control a fire in the Rudraprayag forest division. And just as they thought the fire was nearly under control, the winds changed direction and started feeding the inferno afresh. “We don’t know why it is so this time, but it is acting as an obstacle in controlling the fires.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/forest-fire-claims-8th-life-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/82075612.cms||Shivani Azad

This was stated by Chanakya National Law University (CNLU) vice-chancellor Mridula Mishra while presiding over a webinar on ‘Dr Ambedkar and India’s Living Constitution’, organised jointly by the CNLU Debating Club and Patna University’s Ambedkar Chair on the occasion of 130th birth anniversary celebrations of Dr Ambedkar, on Wednesday.  The VC observed that the inception of the Indian Constitution in 1950 was a significant event not only in the political history of India but also in the history of social justice and human rights. “It has opened up new avenues of human welfare and development by providing equal rights and privileges to the citizens at large,” she said. Kurukshetra University’s senior faculty Ajit Singh Chahal said the Indian constitution is called a living document because it can be amended or changed. “Our Constitution accepts the necessity of modifications according to changing needs of the society,” Chahal added. Additional director general (police) Anil Kishore Yadav that the success of the Constitution lies in faithful implementation of all social and political values enshrined in it. All provisions made in the constitution for ensuring welfare of common men must be implemented sincerely, he said. At the outset, PU Ambedkar Chair professor Seema Prasad welcomed the participants and threw light on the recent initiatives taken by the chair in implementation of Ambedkar’s thoughts and ideas. CNLU’s dean of social sciences and Panhayati Raj Chair Professor SP Singh introduced the subject of the webinar by highlighting various provisions enshrined in the Constitution, while Pratyush Kaushik conducted the programme and PU research officer Hulesh Manjhi proposed the vote of thanks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/indian-constitution-is-a-living-document-expert/articleshow/82071648.cms||B K Mishra

Ramzan is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, and as per religious beliefs, the holy Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad during this month. Imarat-e-Shariah, the religious body, which has jurisdiction in Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, announced that the first ‘Roza’ (fast) of the month would be on Wednesday. Clerics have appealed to the community to perform all rituals at home amid the rising cases of Covid-19 in Bihar. The general secretary of Imarat-e-Shariah, Maulana Shibli Al Quasami, said the mosques would remain closed for the faithful. Only the imam (one who leads prayers), the muezzin (who gives the call for prayers), khadim and other staff would offer prayers at the mosques to fulfil the religious obligations. The religious heads exhorted believers to respect the sanctity of the month of Ramzan by engaging in prayers and extending a helping hand to the poor. Maulana Mohd Alam Quasmi, convenor of the Tanzeem Tehreek Aiemma Masajid, an association of Imams in Bihar, advised to perform five times namaz (prayer) and ‘Taraweeh', a special prayer involve reading long portions of the Holy book Quran during night hours. “People can read the Taraweeh at home by reciting the verses from chapter Al-Fil (elephant) to chapter Al- Nas (mankind). One has to read a total of 20 rakats, but it is not compulsory. Offering namaz, however, is a compulsory religious obligation,” Quasmi told this newspaper. Maulana Shamimuddin Munami, head of the Khanekah Munamiya, Mitan Ghat, said during Ramzan, people need to adopt healthy practices to keep Covid-19 at bay. “People need to follow the government’s guidelines and perform rituals with family members at home while maintaining social distancing,” he said. Soon after the announcement, there was hectic activity in several markets of the city, including Sabzibagh, Phulwarisharif, Alamganj and Shahganj and Raja Bazaar, as people began preparations. Many were seen buying food and essential supplies to stock up for sehri (meal at dawn to begin the fast) and iftar (evening meal which ends the fast). People were seen queuing up for essential items like nan roti, bakarkhanis, fruits, vegetables, dates (khajjur) and other food items. This year, the maximum duration of fasting will last for 14 hours as the ‘fajr’ azan (call for prayer) will be at 4.13 am and maghrib azan to be at 6.13 pm. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a health advisory for devotees asking them to drink 8-10 glasses of water and eat hydrating foods between iftar and sehri. “Eat unsaturated fat and avoid processed food. Avoid foods that are high in salt and sugar. Cook your meals at home to improve the quality of your diet,” says a part of the guideline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pray-at-home-advise-ulemas-as-ramzan-fast-begins-today/articleshow/82054418.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Kolkata||Every vote matters this time, say first timers who became eligible years ago||Kolkata: Several people who have not voted in the past despite being eligible — either because they never bothered to or felt their vote would not matter — are determined to exercise their franchise this time because they feel this election is too important for them to just sit aside and be passive onlookers. Suman Goswami could have cast his first vote three decades ago. But he finally voted for the first time on April 10 in the fourth phase of the assembly election. Film-maker Aniket Chattopadhyay, who had treated election days in the past as holidays and enjoyed mangsho-bhat, said he felt the urge to exercise his democratic right after a gap of 37 years. Bharatjyoti Roychowdhury, 73, also voted for the first time since 1977. Goswami has always believed that elections cannot change society. But he has cast his vote this year because he feels Bengal is standing at the crossroads of history. “This election is more important than any other in the past because our lives can fundamentally change if one party wins,” the Alipurduar resident said. Chattopadhyay had not voted till now because he felt “all political parties were the same — they are the different sides of the same coin”.  But this time, he chose to vote because the times are different now. “I chose to register my protest against divisive politics and against the government’s interference in personal issues, like food, clothing and love,” said Chattopadhyay. Once actively involved in the Naxal movement, Roychowdhury recounted the reason why he voted in 1977. “I was released from jail just before the Emergency so the 1977 election was a referendum for me. This time, I chose to vote because it is again a referendum against communalism and fascism,” he said. For Chhandak Chatterjee, the reason to exercise his right to vote after 10 years was so that he could make sure that every vote mattered at this critical juncture. Some in the state, though, stood by their beliefs and chose not to exercise their democratic right. “Fascism cannot be defeated by election,” said Tarun Basu. Echoing him, septuagenarian Krishna Bandhopadhyay added that she does not vote because she does not find any candidate appropriate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/every-vote-matters-this-time-say-first-timers-who-became-eligible-years-ago/articleshow/82073024.cms||Dipawali Mitra
---||Lucknow||Students cite virus, want exams put off||Lucknow: After the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced the cancellation of Class 10 and postponement of Class 12 Board examinations on Wednesday, UP Board examinees called upon the authorities to make a similar announcement for them. UP Board examinees said writing papers in May would be a double trouble for them as it would be the time of two peaks – Covid-19 and summer heat. The UP Board examinations, earlier scheduled to begin from April 24, were rescheduled from May 8 in view of panchayat elections. “With over 5,000 people getting infected daily, I feel that anyone who is venturing out is returning home with Covid infection. I am stressed how difficult it would be for me to write examination amid Covid scare. Mercury will also cross 40-degree Celsius which will pose a double challenge for us,” said Adarsh Singh, a Class 10 student of a prominent UP Board-affiliated school in Indiranagar. “Wearing gloves, mask and face shield in soaring temperature, and not drinking water in examination hall due to fear of infection is a stress that only a student will be able to understand. According to medical experts, the kind of spike the state is witnessing at present, it will take at least 3-4 months for the situation to improve,” he said. Students said they were also concerned about their parents and grandparents who would pick and drop them under such adverse conditions. “I am a single parent-child and my grandfather used to pick and drop me to school. During Board examination, no matter how much I request him he will not let me take the risk of using public conveyance to reach the examination centre,” said Rohita Gupta, a student of Class 10 at a school in Nishatganj. “He has just got one shot of vaccine. I am stressed about how I will manage to write the examination without risking the health of my family members,” she added. Students of Class 12 said when they appeared for Class 10 examination two years ago, the process got over in March but still it was tough to write their papers as school infrastructure was not good and even fans were missing at examination centre. They said taking examination in May would be tougher. “Majority of examination centres don’t have proper ventilation and fans, especially in Maal and Malihabad. Virus is not the only reason to worry. Under extreme weather conditions, we will have to ensure that we sanitize our hands often and also stay hydrated,” said a Class 12 student Rekha Tripathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/students-cite-virus-want-exams-put-off/articleshow/82074364.cms||---

Always considered a Left bastion, Chakraborty won for the first time from this constituency in 2011, defeating the Left candidate by a huge margin of 40,211 votes. Sanjib Chatterjee, however, had a 0.5% increase in vote share in 2016 and the BJP’s vote share also increased while Chakraborty, though comfortably winning, lost a vote share of about 9.8% BJP has been trying to make a dent in the Trinamool and Left vote share here. From a 3.3% share in 2011, BJP saw a 7.6% increase in the 2016 assembly elections with candidate Bithika Mandal. There was also a close contest between Trinamool MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and BJP’s Mrinal Kanti Debnath in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections where the former edged out Debnath. Locals said a lot of development has taken place in Barasat in the last 10 years. “The main thoroughfares have been widened, waterlogging is not a problem and the street lights have improved, locals said. The local Trinamool is confident of Chakraborty’s win. However, a section of voters feel he does not have a clear edge this time and that his opponent, Sanyukta Morcha’s Sanjib Chatterjee, has a fair chance. “I am banking on the blessings of people on the basis of the work I have done. I want to set up an international-standard stadium, a cultural hub, a coffee house and an incubation centre if re-elected,” Chakraborty said. The Sanyukta Morcha candidate said employment generation and arsenic-free drinking water were the priority issues of the area. “Thousands of youths are suffering due to lack of jobs. Besides, law-and-order situations must improve,” he said. BJP’s Shankar Chatterjee said, “There is resentment among many locals about civic issues, such as bad roads and poor quality of drinking water.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/battleground-barasat-trinamool-banks-on-development-to-keep-seat/articleshow/82073014.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The raids come in the wake of a case filed against Telematic and Biomedical Services Private Limited, a Bengaluru-based company and some government officials in the health department for allegedly misappropriating government money to the tune of Rs 18 crore. Sources said the CID is investigating medical device management across government hospitals to get a sense of whether maintenance takes place and was accounted for during the previous government regime. The raids have so far yielded discrepancies where bills were put forth, claiming exorbitant maintenance fees against the actual cost. In some instances, bills were submitted without maintenance having taken place at the hospital. Since April 10, CID officials have investigated 1,315 government hospitals and medical colleges across the state. The scam came to light after Indukuri Venkata Rama Raju, a resident of Kothapeta in East Godavari, filed a complaint with the CID.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cid-hospital-equipment-probe-reaches-vij-ggh/articleshow/82071810.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The decision was taken on Tuesday at a high-level meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi. Some students welcomed the decision saying it would give them more time to study at home and keep them safe from the Covid-19 pandemic, while others are worried that it would affect their future because of the delay in the academic year. Soumya, a Class XII student of Krishna Niketan, said she needed more time to prepare for the exam. “Besides, giving an exam in the present situation would have been very risky,” she said. “No matter what precautions we take, there are always the chances of becoming the carrier of the virus. So, I welcomed the CBSE decision of postponing the exam,” said Ashutosh Kumar of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Kankerbagh. Vaishnavi, a Class X student, said, “I’m happy with the decision, but there is also a nervousness because we don’t know how the Board will prepare our results. There is no clarity in the notice.” Jyoti Kumari of DAV Public School is also worried about what marks she would get for her Class X board. Welcoming the CBSE decision Seema Singh, the principal of St Karen’s High School, said, nothing was more important than the life of a child. “Under the present circumstances, it is a welcome step for so many parents, who are worried for their kids,” she told this newspaper. However, some students are apprehensive of the CBSE decision. Akansha Singh, a Class XII student of the Notre Dame Academy, is unhappy with the postponement. “The exams should have been conducted with precautions. If the CBSE had also postponed the competitive exams then it would not have been a problem,” she added. Purshottam, a Class XII student of Vidya Sanskar School, said the exam should not have been postponed as kids were mentally prepared to take the exam, besides competitive exams are also there. Sharat Kumar Singh, principal of Litera Valley School, said it is unfortunate that the exams will not be conducted, but it is for children's safety. “Now, it will be interesting how the CBSE will guide the schools to device a method to award the marks because pre-boards has not been conducted,” he said. A senior teacher of the NDA, Abha Choudhary, said Class X students are happy with the decision because they were scared to appear in the exam. But Class XII kids are worried as they were mentally prepared to take the exam. “Kids are also worried about the competitive exams,” she said. The Association of Independent Schools-Bihar and other associations were not satisfied with the Board’s decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cbse-decision-on-board-exams-evokes-mixed-response-from-students/articleshow/82071614.cms||Faryal Rumi

With Covid infections hitting a new high every day, there is a shortage of the antiviral Remdesivir. This is leading to emergency purchases of higher-priced drugs. As a result, insurers are now rejecting many more claims for cashless treatment than they used to earlier. General insurance companies like Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, Star Health and Max Bupa say the rejection rate of Covid claims have gone up from 2-3% last year to as high as 9%. Covid-related frauds have led to increase in rejection rates, where there are cases when patients who are not hospitalized for Covid treatment tend to apply for claim insurance," said Bhaskar Nerurkar, head of health claims, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, which saw Covid claim rejection rate up from 2-3% to 4-5%. Insurers have called for price controls for commonly used pharmaceutical products like anti-virals and anti-biotics on a war footing. Star Health and Allied Insurance is blacklisting a growing number of hospitals for price-gouging, its MD S Prakash said. “The MRP of important Covid drugs like Remdesivir is quoted differently by different hospitals, resulting in retail prices that are five-six times higher. Prakash said, “We know the true cost and the MRP of Remdesivir by the same company is fixed differently for different hospitals, although the cost price is the same. The hospital with higher infrastructure fixes a higher MRP on these drugs and could go as high as 5x-6x from its original retail price.” Insurers say that some unscrupulous providers are pushing patients into intensive care even when there is no requirement. All insurance companies are now facing a higher claims loss ratio, which has gone up by 4-5% YoY in April 2021. With the physical visit of hospitals by insurers suspended due to the pandemic, Covid-related frauds have gone up and turned the underwriter cautious. “In evaluating Covid claims, we are unable to see the patients in hospitals due to no physical visits and this has made insurance underwriters cautious,” its director underwriting, products & claims Dr Bhabatosh Mishra said. State authorities require that Covid patients isolate in a room with an attached bathroom. If such access to an exclusive bathroom is not available, state authorities require isolation in a facility. “We have seen many Covid patients who get hospitalised and discharged after three days without being given Remdesivir. According to ICMR guidelines, mild Covid patients are better to stay at home quarantine,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/volatility-in-remdesivir-prices-ups-claim-rejection/articleshow/82072852.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Patna||Hospitals face shortage of Remdesivir drug||PATNA: The demand for Covid-19 drug Remdesivir has shot up from 200 doses per day to 500 for Patna in the past four to five days, while the quantity of supply remains the same. Patna drug inspector Rajesh Sinha told TOI on Wednesday that four companies supply the Remdesivir drug in Bihar. “Against the demand for 500 doses per day for Patna, the supply is only around 250 doses. It may take ten days for the four-drug manufacturing firms that supply to Bihar to start meeting our demands,” Sinha said. He further said one dose of Remdesivir is given to one Covid-19 patient per day and it’s an institutional drug that is supplied only to hospitals. The drug inspector said another reason for the spike in demand is because Covid-19 patients, who might get well with normal treatment, are urging doctors to prescribe them Remdesivir. Sinha said the Centre issued orders on April 11 banning the export of Remdesivir. “This order would also ease up the situation,” he said. Dr Ashok Sinha, associated with a private hospital at Saguna Mor, said the suppliers were urging us till 10 days back to buy Remdesivir as they had extra stocks. “I don’t know what has happened but I suspect either they are hoarding or getting involved in black marketing of Remdesivir,” he said. Dr Sinha also alleged a short supply of medical oxygen in Patna. “Our supplying agency associated with us for 15 years, gave in written to us that they are unable to meet our required demands. We have around 30 Covid-19 patients,” he said, adding, the situation forced them to directly contact the factory in Fatuha which supplies oxygen. “The factory also expressed its inability to meet our daily demands of oxygen. Small private hospitals are contacting us and other bigger hospitals for spare oxygen cylinders,” he said. When asked about this scenario, the drug inspector said, “Due to the present scenario, they might not be able to provide oxygen cylinders. However, any hospital approaching them with an empty cylinder could get refilled.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hospitals-face-shortage-of-remdesivir-drug/articleshow/82071603.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Earlier on Tuesday, IAS officer Vijay Ranjan, posted as director in the Panchayati Raj Department, died of Covid-19 in Patna. The state’s social welfare minister Madan Sahni, too, has isolated himself at his official residence. “Sahni had gone to Baidyanath Dham at Deoghar in Jharkhand a few days ago. After returning from Babadham, he was suffering from fever. During the test, he was found to be Covid-19 positive. The doctor has advised him to remain in home quarantine till full recovery,” a close aide of Sahni told TOI over the phone on Wednesday. Health department additional secretary Ravi Shankar Choudhary, too, has tested positive and has been admitted at the AIIMS-Patna, Amrit said. Bihar seeks 50 Army doctors for Bihta Covid hosp: Because of the alarming rise in the Covid-19 positive cases, the Bihar government on Wednesday urged the defence ministry to depute at least 50 Army doctors at the dedicated Covid-19 hospital at Bihta to get the 500-bed hospital fully functional. Pratyay Amrit said the dedicated hospital at Bihta is currently functioning with only 50 beds. The state government provides nurses and other medical staff at the Bihta hospital while the Army provides its doctors. “I have sent a letter to the defence secretary urging him to depute at least 50 doctors from the Army so that all 500 beds at the central government’s dedicated hospital could be utilized,” Amrit told TOI. He said a team of DRDO on Wednesday visited the Bihta hospital to assess the requirements. “Once the army deploys its doctors, the state government will deploy its nurses and other staff,” Amrit said, adding, once all 500 beds at the hospital become functional, it would ease the load from the Patna-based dedicated hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-minister-2-senior-ias-officers-test-positive/articleshow/82071578.cms||Madan Kumar

However, the new cases of coronavirus infection continue to rise alarmingly. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma informed TOI that the number of vaccination centres would be increased further to vaccinate maximum number of people. Currently, vaccination is being done at 65 centres in the district. The number of RRT (rapid response teams) has also been increased from 32 to 80 to take care of people and supply medicines to those who are in home isolation, he added. The DM, who also held a meeting at the Kashi Integrated Command and Control Centre on Tuesday to review the situation, said all required measures are being taken to save people’s lives and check the spread of Covid-19. “Efforts are on to vaccinate maximum number of people of above 45 years age at the earliest. About 60,000 units of vaccine have been consumed by Wednesday, and more supply of the vaccine is coming,” he added. He said that six emergency numbers of command centre have been issued for the public so that people can arrange beds in hospitals and ambulances for the patients. The doctors deputed at the command centre are available for consultancy round the clock.

Meanwhile, the Varanasi division of North Eastern Railway (NER) has stopped the sale of platform tickets at all the stations to control the unnecessary crowds in view of coronavirus spread. According to the NER spokesperson Ashok Kumar, all the main stations of the division have been sealed, and the passengers with confirmed tickets only are allowed to enter the station premises. Thermal scanning of passengers is being done at the entry and exit points. With the help of the district administration, the corona test of the passengers coming from other states is being done at the stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/2-lakh-people-above-45-years-of-age-vaccinated-in-kashi/articleshow/82073720.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kalimpong voters demand focus on indigenous trade over infra issues||Kalimpong/Kolkata: As Kalimpong goes to polls this Saturday, demand for more focus on indigenous trade and stress on their export has taken over traditional issues, like water scarcity and better connectivity. Clusters of villages at Sangsay, Ecchay, Makhal Dara and Algarah, have, over the last few years, moved on from traditional forms of farming to cultivate and export a home-grown delicacy — Dalle Khorsani — one of the spiciest chillies that sell for over Rs 600 per kg. The maximum value stays around Rs 200 per kg. But a recent development has put farmers in a fix with the Centre awarding the GI tag to the product with a Scoville Heat Unit (SHU) in the range of 1,00,000 to 3,50,000 to Sikkim, leaving farmers in north Bengal fuming. The chilli is used in pickles and sauces. “The leaders need us only during votes. But what about our daily problems? After all the hard work, the GI tag for Dalle has gone to Sikkim. This would certainly depreciate the export value of our product. We will cast our vote, but it’s time the leaders focus on our indigenous trade,” said Suraj Ghimire, a farmer. Pranab Hazra, professor and dean of department of vegetable sciences at Bidhan Chandra Krishi Vishva Vidyalaya, said, “GI tags help establish effective agriculture brands, especially for lesser known ethnic products.” Dalle cultivated in north Bengal is exported to Malaysia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, USA and UAE, and traders like Sushma Pradhan and Passang Doma Sherpa fear the GI tagging will have an impact on the export numbers this year. Entrepreneurs associated with dairy enterprises, including manufacturing of lollipop, pickle, dried Gundruk (fermented and sun-dried mix of radish leaves) and Kalimpong cheese, also demanded more support from central and state authorities to keep the businesses alive. Samuel Yonzon, founder of Diary Makarios Bous, said the essence of Kalimpong cheese is missing and there is no real cheese in town any more. Kalimpong’s BJP candidate and educationist Suva Pradhan said, “If we come to power, we will revive the indigenous trade and farming of Kalimpong.” Ruden Sada Lepcha and R B Bhujel, independent candidates fielded by the Binoy Tamang and Bimal Gurung factions of GJM respectively, also said revival of traditional and indigenous trade tops the list of their priorities this election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kalimpong-voters-demand-focus-on-indigenous-trade-over-infra-issues/articleshow/82073010.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The ship had run aground on March 23, blocking the movement on the busy channel for 6sixdays before it was refloated again on March 29. The crew is said to be from AP, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and other states. Explaining what the ‘arrest’ of a ship means, National Shipping Board (NSB) member Captain Sanjay Prashar said the vessel with its cargo would not be allowed to sail further until the compensation was paid or the issue settled. “When a ship is formally arrested, the seafarers are placed under house arrest. They may be provided accommodation and that is where they will have to stay and not move out until the matter is resolved,” he said. While AISU working president Abhijeet Sangle said the crew should not be treated as hostages by Egyptian authorities. Sangle has also written to the Union shipping ministry and the director general of shipping urging them to ensure the Indian crew is treated well. Nearly two weeks after it was refloated, ‘Ever Given’ along with crew and Master (Captain) was ‘arrested’ by the SCA on April 13. SCA chairman Osama Rabie told Egypt’s state-run television that ‘Ever Given’ had been impounded as Shoei Kisen Kaisha Limited, the Japanese owner of the skyscraper-sized ship, had not agreed to pay the compensation that was demanded. UK P&I Club, which insured the vessel, also expressed disappointment. “We are disappointed at comments made by the SCA,” it said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/long-haul-for-ever-given-indian-crew/articleshow/82073315.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

However, a woman doctor of the hospital, who had earlier tested positive, recovered and joined her duty. Chief medical director (CMD) of the hospital, Dr R K Verma, said there are 34 doctors posted there and eight of them have been home quarantined. The number of patients at its outpatient department (OPD) has increased to 600 per day, he said, adding the doctors and paramedical staff are taking full precautions amid alarming rise in the Covid-19 cases this month. Verma said the hospital has limited number of isolation beds. But Covid patients are transferred to Danapur divisional railway hospital at Khagaul, which has been declared a Covid-dedicated hospital. To reduce the rush of patients at the superspecialty hospital, railways has started ‘telemedicine’ facility round-the-clock in the emergency cell of the hospital, he said, adding this facility has proved a boon to senior citizens and other ailing patients who consult their doctors over phone and get medical advice any time. According to Danapur divisional railway hospital chief medical superintendent (CMS) Dr Ranjeet Kumar, one doctor of the hospital has so far tested positive for Covid virus. Altogether 39 Covid patients, mostly railway employees and their dependents, were undergoing treatment at the hospital. “The hospital has sufficient equipment and medicines for indoor Covid patients,” he said. A loco pilot, Ravi Kumar Sinha of Danapur, died of corona on Tuesday while another ticket checking staff posted at Patna Junction also succumbed to the virus last week, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/8-railway-doctors-two-staff-test-positive/articleshow/82071634.cms||Kumod Verma

---||Patna||Bihar: ‘Exempt teachers from coming to colleges daily’||PATNA: Several teachers of different constituent colleges under Patliputra University (PPU) have tested positive for Covid-19. A few of them had to be admitted to the hospitals in Patna. The Patliputra University Teachers’ Association (PPUTA), at its meeting on Wednesday, urged the university to immediately suspend all university examinations and exempt teachers from coming to the colleges every day. The meeting was chaired by PPUTA president Prof A K Singh Thakur. “The alarming rise in the coronavirus cases in Patna has been worrying teachers. The university, instead of making physical presence of teachers in the colleges compulsory, must give them liberty to conduct their online classes from home like the previous year,” Thakur said. According to Thakur, the university should also reduce attendance to 33% in each college. He also questioned the rationale behind calling teachers to colleges every day when academic activities have been suspended by the university. PPUTA general secretary Prof Hridya Narain Singh said the university must revise its examination schedule in the larger interest of students. Keeping in view such an alarming trend of the virus, it is not safe for both teachers and students to come to colleges daily, he said. Nalanda Open University (NOU) registrar Prof P K Verma said the university was finding it difficult to hold undergraduate and postgraduate examinations for about 5000 students. These examinations being held at A N College, College of Commerce, Arts and Science and G D Patliputra School centres must be postponed immediately, he said. M D College Naubatpur principal Prof Kanhaiya Prasad Sinha said one teacher has tested positive for Covid-19. The college administration sanitised the premises on Tuesday on its own, he said. B D College principal Prof Praveen Kumar said the college was unable to deal with the present situation effectively mainly due to paucity of funds. The university or state government must provide financial assistance to the college to install ‘tunnel sanitising’ device at the main entrance. Sources said while A N College principal and several other staff have tested positive for Covid-19, teachers of T P S College, College of Commerce, Arts and Science, Sri Gurugobind Singh College, Arvind Mahila College and others in and around Patna are facing the same problem. Meanwhile, Purnea University held a massive inoculation drive at the university headquarters with support from the district administration on Tuesday. Out of the 114 teachers, eight have tested positive for Covid -19, said its media in-charge Rajnish Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/exempt-teachers-from-coming-to-colleges-daily/articleshow/82071675.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Patna||Bihar: Rs 14 lakh looted from courier firm in Muzaffarpur||PATNA: Unidentified criminals looted at least Rs14 lakh from the office of a private courier firm under Ahiyapur police station area in Muzaffarpur district late Tuesday night. The office was located on the state highway connecting Zero Mile to Bairiya bus stand in Muzaffarpur. Ahiyapur police station SHO (in-charge) V Krishtu on Wednesday said four armed criminals barged into the office with their faces covered. “Only four staff were present in the office. The criminals took them hostage at gunpoint and forced them to hand over the cash,” he said. “Two fled on a bike while the rest on foot,” he said. Office manager Pushpendu Dutta, in the FIR, claimed that at least Rs14 lakh had been looted. “Police got the CCTV camera footage but the images are of very poor quality,” the SHO said. Krishtu said police suspect the criminals must be from nearby area. He said the firm handles e-commerce courier packages in bulk and had such a large amount lying in its office. Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant said the criminals reached there when cash was being counted while keeping the premises open. “This was a major security lapse. Notice had been served to close the courier office timely amid the pandemic, but they didn’t listen and kept functioning till late in the night,” he said. Kant said police were trying to identify the criminals and the case was being investigated from several angles, including any insider’s role.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs-14-lakh-looted-from-courier-firm-in-muzaffarpur/articleshow/82071540.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||Paytm Payments Bank to enable international remittances||MUMBAI: Paytm Payments Bank (PPB) plans to expand into facilitating cross-border as well as domestic remittances. The bank’s CEO said that the new umbrella entity (NUE), proposed by PPB and other investors, will change the pace of digital payments in the country, if approved. Speaking to TOI, the bank’s MD & CEO Satish Kumar Gupta said that it has become the largest enabler of digital transactions in India at 970 million in March 2021. It has also become the largest digital-only bank with 64 million bank accounts and deposits of over Rs 3,200 crore, he said. According to Gupta, PPB’s digital transactions were diversified across many platforms including UPI, digital wallet, FASTag, and peer-to-peer transfers. As a result, the bank was not worried about the National Payments Corporation of India’s decision to cap market share in UPI transactions. “We also have the lowest technical decline rate at 0.1% among all UPI remitter banks and 0.04% among all UPI beneficiary banks,” he said. He added that the bank has been reporting a profit from the year 2018-19. This would enable PPB to seek conversion into a small finance bank (SFB). Although the RBI had said it will relax its rules to allow payments banks to convert into SFBs after three profitable years, it has yet to notify the relaxed norms. Paytm is seeking to convert itself into an SFB that will enable it to extend loans. The RBI’s decision to increase the end-of-day balance limits for payments banks to Rs 2 lakh will benefit small merchants who use PPB’s cash management services, he said. Gupta said that PPB has managed to grow transactions in number and value by nearly 25% despite taking a severe hit during the first three months of FY21 due to the Covid lockdown. “For the coming year, we have received approval for facilitating inward remittance from foreign countries. In addition to this, we are also growing our domestic remittance business,” said Gupta. Another new line of activity where the bank is seeking approval as an investor is the setting up of an NUE. While he said he could not share the details, Gupta said that the proposed entity, if permitted to operate, could change the pace of digital payments in India. PPB has also taken over the Bharat Bill Payment Operating Unit business from its parent One97 in line with the RBI directive, which will add to its numbers during the current fiscal year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-payments-bank-to-enable-intl-remittances/articleshow/82073478.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: PSU ex-staffer in search of bed dies inside car||VADODARA: Tuesday was a night of horror for the Parmar family, a journey that began with their unsuccessful battle for a vacant hospital bed for the head of the family till finally losing him in the race with destiny on the road — all within a couple of hours only. The car journey to the GMERS Hospital proved to be the final journey for retired PSU personnel Vinu Parmar, 66, who had tested positive of Covid-19, and was placed under home quarantine. The Panchwati resident had complained of breathlessness on Tuesday night and died hunting for a bed with oxygen. After all private hospital nearby denied having a vacant bed, the family approached former corporator Rajesh Ayre who asked them to rush to the GMERS Hospital at Gotri. The family was taking Parmar in a car to GMERS Hospital for admission, but he succumbed to the virus inside the car before he could reach the hospital. “The family had been calling up hospitals and was not able to find a bed. I told them that they should rush to the GMERS Hospital at the earliest,” said Ayre. According to Parmar’s son-in-law Jignesh Kapadia, Parmar had been sick for three days. “I was in the office on Tuesday night when this happened and the family had to seek Ayre’s help,” said Kapadia. Parmar is survived by his wife, a son and two daughters, who are married. Ayre said that the family left with Parmar in a small car to go to the GMERS Hospital. “But when they were on their way, Parmar breathed his last. They informed me about the situation and I asked them to stop at Jhansi Ki Rani Circle near my home. I confirmed that the man had died and we started the procedure of wrapping the body as per the protocol and taking it for cremation,” said Ayre. The former corporator said that the victim was a retired employee of a public sector unit and his son had also tested positive for Covid-19. NGOs floated by Ayre and like-minded people have come together to arrange for the last rites of Covid-19 victims. The volunteers of this initiative took care of the Parmar’s last rites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/on-bed-hunt-man-falls-prey-to-delay/articleshow/82071174.cms||---

From around 10%-12% composition of contract staff earlier, top-tier IT companies have almost 15%-17% gig workers now, they said. Sources in top-tier IT companies said that from comprising roughly 10% of total hires in October to December 2020, temporary staff now make up almost 30% in the current January-March 2021 quarter. The requirement cuts across hierarchies — from developers to project managers — and is not just for basic tasks but also for new-age digital skills. “Almost 85% of all new jobs in the sector are digital and temporary staff are in high demand to manage the surge. For some skill sets like Kubernetes, the pay scales for temp workers have almost doubled in recent months,” Mehul Shah, board member and IT chapter chair, Indian Staffing Federation, said. The jobs growth in the US tech sector in March has helped improve prospects for Indian IT, he added.Kapil Sharma, chief sales officer of IT staffing firm Collabera Technologies says uncertainty created by Covid has made IT companies reduce bench strength and their preference for ‘on-demand’ talent is on a high. “Projects with agile and shorter timelines are on a rise, and social taboo around being a contract worker have also broken down,” he said.Siva Prasad Nanduri, VP and business head of IT Staffing at TeamLease Digital says there is almost a 150% growth in demand from last year and full stack, dev ops, SAP Hana, and Service Now are in-demand skills. “The hiring is not restricted to just metros but has picked up even in tier 2 cities like Bhubaneshwar, Indore, Coimbatore and Lucknow,” he added. TeamLease claims around 25% share of the IT staffing market.Global captives too have also accelerated on temporary staffing options, and demand from GCCs has gone up by almost 50%-60% in recent months, Vijay Sivaram, CEO, Quess IT Staffing, said. The volume of contract staff signing up with Quess has gone up by almost 15%-20%. Sriram Rajagopal, founder and director of talent solutions firm Diamondpick says that with full-time permanent staff having 90-day joining timeframes, qualified temp staff who can join quickly are becoming key. Demand for Indian techies is also flowing in from Poland, Ukraine, UK and other European nations as these countries are finding it difficult to hire quality and economical digital talent, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/share-of-temp-staff-up-in-tech-sector-draw-pay-hikes-higher-than-permanent-techies/articleshow/82072812.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The NMCH claimed that the man from Lakhisarai was brought dead and there was no issue of his admission in the Covid ward. Health minister Mangal Pandey was on a visit to the hospital when the bereaved family members with the body were alleging neglect by the hospital as the reason of his death. NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said soon after the arrival of the ambulance carrying Vinod Kumar, the doctors and health staff on duty rushed there, examined and declared him ‘brought dead’. However, the aggrieved family members insisted on putting the person on the ventilator support with other emergency treatment. When the hospital denied all this, his kin alleged neglect and non-admission of Vinod as the cause of his death. He said the bereaved family itself admitted that they first went to AIIMS-Patna where they failed to get a bed and brought the patient to NMCH. “We think it was the delay in rushing him to any Covid care facility which led to his death,” Dr Singh said. The minister had also inquired about the incident. He further refuted the allegation of shortage of beds and said only 88 patients were admitted to the 116-bed Covid ward that time and there was no reason to deny admission. With further increase of 44 more beds, the NMCH Covid ward had 160 beds by Wednesday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-negligence-claims-nmch/articleshow/82071660.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Bihar: Covid mortality rate in 20-50 age group higher in second wave||PATNA: The second wave of Covid-19 is infecting and killing more people in the 20-50 years age group compared to the first wave last year when most of those who fell victim to the virus were either senior citizens or had comorbidities. The health officials of the city hospitals treating Covid patients claimed that earlier the patients succumbed due to comorbid conditions which made the coronavirus more lethal for the patients, but this time even healthy people were dying because of the infection. At least 17 people have died of Covid at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) in the past five days and 55% of them were between 30 and 50 years of age, while one was even 11-year-old. NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said on an average 3-4 patients died per day because of Covid-19 infection since April 9. “The mortality rate is much higher compared to around this time last year. Around this time last year, one or two patients died of Covid, but more than 17 people have succumbed to the virus in just one week. The peak of the first wave was in July-August, but the infection and mortality rate in the second wave has been increasing at a rapid pace from the first week of April,” he said and added: “Younger people are getting infected and turning critical this time.” The nodal officer for Covid at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Sanjeev Kumar also admitted that 80% of the mortality rate due to the coronavirus is among the people aged between 20 and 45. “Fifteen people died at the hospital in the past one week and only two of them were above the age of 60. Even most of the infected patients admitted at the hospital are young. Last year, senior citizens were more vulnerable to the disease,” he said. He also pointed out that in the first wave, people died because of their weak immune system, ailments such as diabetes, hypertension, renal and heart disease, kidney problem and other prolonged illnesses. “But this time, people are dying because of the Covid infection. The main cause of the deaths is the destruction of the lungs due to infection,” Dr Sanjeev told this newspaper. PMCH nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Ajay Arun, said infection apart, fatality rate is also rising at the hospital. “Around 30 people have died in a week and 30% of them were of young age. Most of the people died due to low saturation of oxygen level, destruction of lungs and pulmonary fibrosis. This year, people are dying because of Covid symptoms and not due to comorbid conditions, even in the senior age group,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-mortality-rate-in-20-50-age-group-higher-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/82071531.cms||Faryal Rumi

The decision has been taken in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the state capital. DM Chandrashekhar Singh has asked the Patna airport director to ensure that the passengers coming from Kerala, Maharashtra and Punjab will be allowed to board the flights for Patna only after furnishing a negative RT-PCR report not older than 72 hours. The district administration has also issued an advisory that all passengers who travelled from Maharashtra, Punjab and Kerala have to be in home quarantine for 10 days and self monitor their health over this period. The DM told this newspaper on Wednesday that the magistrates and district administration officials deployed at city airport will check the RT-PCR reports of flyers on reaching Patna from the three states. “Though 10 days’ home quarantine is not compulsory, but we have asked the airlines to instruct the passengers to follow the advisory for safety of flyers,” he said. “Due to space constraint, the medical team was not able to conduct rapid antigen test of all flyers coming from Maharashtra, Punjab and Kerala. Carrying negative RT-PCR report would make the process faster,” he said. Deputy general manager (air traffic management) at city airport, Santosh Kumar, said the AAI-Patna has instructed the airlines to comply with the order received on Saturday. “We have mailed the copy of the order to the headquarters and to different airlines,” he told this newspaper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/flyers-from-three-states-must-have-covid-ve-report/articleshow/82071546.cms||Faryal Rumi

YSRC, TDP and the BJP-Jana Sena alliance have deputed senior leaders from the community to woo fisherfolk. This time though, fisherfolk, who normally seek funds for construction of temples and community halls, are pushing for aid to buy modern boats. Initially, representatives of the parties were stumped by such demands as these would require large sums of money. Unable to convince the fisherfolk with promises to spare a few thousands for the development of the village, party leaders have now agreed to procure additional funds for the purchase of new fishing boats. “We have seen many elections and leaders. The leaders will not be keen to resolve our grievances after the elections. So we have decided to put forth our demands well in advance,” said K Anil Kumar, a young fisherfolk leader. Meanwhile, local fisherfolk are upset by the aggressive attitude of fisherfolk from Tamil Nadu. While fisherfolk from the Nellore coast are forced to use 10HP motors for trawling activities, the fisherfolk from Tamil Nadu are using China-made motors of 100HP and netting a huge catch. As per rules, fisherfolk should not use motors more than 10 HP. “Governments at the state and the Centre should resolve the issue,” said K Ananth, president, Fishermen’s Association. He said the government should invest in buying small processing mother boats that would help them earn good revenue from the sale of tuna. Although tuna is available in plenty along the Nellore coast, fisherfolk are unable to earn a profit as they have to sell the stock within a few days while their journeys in deep water continue for nearly 10 to 15 days. “The processing boats will have all the facilities, including reaching fisherfolk in deep waters, picking up stock, processing it and export,” said Ananth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/nellore-fisherfolk-seek-aid-to-buy-modern-boats/articleshow/82071690.cms||Samdani MN

However, the urban development authority has found several incomplete applications during the ongoing scrutinisation process. According to VMRDA officials, some applicants even uploaded white papers instead of the required documents. Layout drawings that accompanied some applications were technically faulty or incorrect. The VMRDA is expected to complete the scrutiny in the next two weeks before informing applicants about the shortcomings. Layouts that meet conformed norms will be regularised. According to VMRDA officials, penalisation charges would be fixed based on plot size and value of the land. The charges will be calculated based on the prevailing market value as of August 31, 2019. The scrutiny of single plot regularisation will be done based on the in-principle layout pattern approved by the concerned competent authority. Unapproved layouts not covered under the scheme will be treated as continuing offences and penalty levied as per existing municipal laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/incomplete-lrs-applications-a-test-for-vmrda/articleshow/82071842.cms||---

It took more than 10 hours of intense firefighting to douse the flames, which gutted the regional office of the Indian Oil Corporation Limited(IOCL). Indrajeet Kumar, a fire brigade official present at the spot, told TOI on Wednesday that the fire started at the computer server room in the IOCL office located on the fifth floor of the building. A short-circuit is suspected to be the reason behind the fire. “The fire was reported at 11.53 pm on Tuesday, after which fire tenders rushed to the spot. We were successful in containing the fire till the fifth floor. It didn’t spread to other parts of the building,” he said, adding, the server room and other sections with documents were reduced to ashes. Kumar said altogether 16 fire tenders, five mini tenders and a hydraulic ladder system were used in firefighting. Flames were seen leaping out of the fifth-floor windows even on Wednesday morning and smoke billowed till noon, an eyewitness said. Fire officials at the spot said the sixth and seventh floors have become extremely hot and filled with soot, while the walls of the seventh floor have cracked. IOCL sources said an internal committee would probe the cause of the fire and assess the losses incurred. “Work for Bihar and Jharkhand has been crippled. The entire office is destroyed,” a senior IOCL employee said, adding, real-time monitoring of fuel stocks in Bihar and Jharkhand would resume with the help of another server at a different location. “Altogether 90 permanent and 24 contractual employees were working at the state office,” the source added. The Bhawan, where the erstwhile Dakbungalow was located before Independence, is managed by the district board. While the entire fifth floor is occupied by IOCL, the sixth floor has the offices of HPCL, IFFCO and the regional office of the Central Groundwater Board. The seventh floor has an office of the superintending engineer of the Archaeological Survey of India (excavation branch-III) and a chemical laboratory of CGWB with imported scientific equipment worth several crores for monitoring of groundwater samples from Bihar and Jharkhand. The overall damage from the fire is estimated to be worth several crores, fire officials said. CGWB scientists Dr Suresh Kumar and AK Sinha said they fear that costly equipment such as the sensitive atomic absorption spectrophotometer and ion chromatography has been damaged from extreme heat and soot. “The spectrophotometer is worth Rs 50 lakh imported from England and the chromatograph is worth Rs 40 lakh imported from Germany,” they told this newspaper at the spot. IFFCO manager (accounts) Rajan Kumar Kesri said all computers and other electronic items in his office are destroyed from the extreme heat and soot. “It seems we won’t be able to come to the office for at least three to four days due to the overheated building,” Kesri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/major-fire-at-lok-nayak-bhawan-guts-iocl-regional-office/articleshow/82071556.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||Essential food items fly off retail shelves||MUMBAI: Essential food items are fast disappearing from retail shelves, as well as e-commerce platforms with supplies getting disrupted in some parts of the country due to the recent Covid-induced restrictions. Night curfews and a weekend lockdown implemented in many cities, including Mumbai, over the past few days and the partial lockdown in Maharashtra has impacted deliveries. Orders are being delivered with a lag of three to four days. Earlier, deliveries happened on the same day or the following day across e-commerce platforms. Deliveries of essentials by online retail platforms like Bigbasket, Amazon and Flipkart are being delayed across cities including Mumbai. And deliveries of non-essentials are being suspended in Maharashtra with new curbs coming into effect from April 14 night. When contacted for their response, Flipkart and Bigbasket chose not to comment. While e-commerce platforms have struck out places like Mumbai from their non-essential delivery list, those of essentials could be getting impacted due to what appears to be a shortage of manpower and curbs on mobility. Though deliveries of essentials by e-commerce sites are not banned in Maharashtra, the confusion at the ground level sometimes adds to the problem. Orders for clothes, electronics and even food items booked on e-commerce retail sites are not going through. For instance, while in Maharashtra the government has included e-commerce in the essential services category, these companies would be allowed to deliver “only essential goods and services”. Larger packs of biscuits, chocolates and other packaged food are more in demand, and hence many of these items are not available on e-commerce retail sites. The bottlenecks at this point do not seem to be due to supply disruption by the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. On its part, the industry seems to be better prepared this year. Fearing restrictions with the surge in Covid infections nationwide since March, companies including Dabur have stocked up on key raw materials. Last year, manufacturing and industrials came to a standstill within hours due to the nationwide lockdown, with companies facing disruption in the supply chain when factories resumed. Mohit Malhotra, CEO of Dabur with its flagship immunity booster Chyawanprash, told TOI, “Anticipating a fresh lockdown in view of the rising number of Covid cases with the fresh wave, we had started working towards building our inventory, both of finished goods as well as raw and packing material in March itself. We are also applying learnings from last year on streamlining the supply chain to ensure minimal disruption. We have also brought forward supplies to retail outlets and stockists to ensure that consumers do not face any shortage in the market.” Mondelez India, with brands including Cadbury, Oreo and Bournvita, “has taken proactive steps based on our learning from last year” to ensure uninterrupted supply of products according to Mondelez India senior director (sales) Praveen Dalal. He added, “We have seen trade start to stock up in states where restrictions are stricter. We continue to see a strong momentum on e-commerce across categories, as consumers prefer the safety and convenience of shopping from homes. Specifically, in traditional trade, we are seeing a strong uptick in biscuits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/essential-food-items-fly-off-retail-shelves/articleshow/82073467.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||Nashik||Nashik pvt hospitals get staff from other states||Nashik: Struggling with healthcare worker availability, private hospitals in Nashik city have started hiring nursing staff from other states. The salaries of the nursing staff, technicians and even conservancy staff in Nashik city have almost been doubled. There is still a demand for higher salaries. As a result, the hospitals have started recruiting people from neighbouring districts and even other states including Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu. These out-of-state health workers too come at a significant cost. “We have had to import staff from other areas to address the crisis in terms of employee strength as well as salary demand. We also have to arrange for hotel accomodation for the staff brought in from outside,” said Dr Raj Nagarkar, the vice-president of Nashik Private Hospital Owners’ Association. The local staff is opting for government-run Covid care centres and dedicated Covid health centres (DCHC) where they are being paid handsomely. “The government has increased the salaries from Rs 12,000-Rs 40,000 per month to Rs 25,000-Rs 80,000 per month. Our employees are obviously looking for openings in government facilities. We have now got some employees from Thane, Pune and even Kerala, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh,” he added. Dr Nagarkar also expressed the inability of the hospitals to manage all the expenses and treat Covid patients at the rates announced by the government, which according to him are very low. He pointed out that the treatment cost is directly proportional to the input cost. The association, which is also facing shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir injections, expressed reluctance to admit fresh Covid cases. The members met district collector Suraj Mandhare and NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav. Mandhare said the oxygen and the injection shortage issues are being resolved, but the staff-related and other issues must be looked after by the hospitals. “We have been facing some oxygen shortage and there are issues with Remdesivir. There are some oxygen transportation problems. We are planning to get some oxygen bottling plants functional and are sourcing carriers from neighbouring districts and state,” Mandhare said. Additional civil surgeon Dr Kishor Shriwas, NMC additional commissioner Dr Praveen Ashtekar and Malegaon’s medical officer Dr Sapna Thakre will consider the requirement for oxygen and place demands with resident deputy collector Bhagwat Doifode, who will, in turn, get the supply from industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-pvt-hospitals-get-staff-from-other-states/articleshow/82070642.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Chandigarh||On Ambedkar’s b’day, BJP & SAD aim for polls, both promise Dalit CM, deputy CM||Jalandhar/Chandigarh: Former coalition partners, SAD and BJP, on Wednesday promised to make a Dalit deputy CM or chief minister, if voted to power after the next assembly elections in 2022. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal announced to have a Dalit deputy chief minister in Punjab, when the BJP is already trying to woo the Dalits. BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh too made a similar announcement that if his party came to power in Punjab there would be a chief minister from the Dalit community. Sukhbir, who was in Jalandhar to attend a function dedicated to Dr B R Ambedkar at Nakodar chowk, also announced to establish a new Ambedkar university in Doaba region. The party’s scheduled caste MLAs, other leaders from SC communities and scores of workers were present on the occasion. Notably, out of four MLAs of Akali Dal from Doaba region, three are SCs. His announcement to establish a university named after Dr Ambedkar seems to be a counter to that of Congress government’s to establish museum in Kapurthala district. BSP workers who were present on the occasion raised slogans against the Akali Dal as well as BJP. BSP district urban unit president Vijay Yadav, who was among those raising slogans against Akali Dal, said that SAD had first supported the three ‘black’ farm laws before parting ways with the BJP. Meanwhile, reacting to Sukhbir’s announcement, Delhi-based senior BJP leader R P Singh retweeted his (Sukhbir’s) video statement, saying: “But the fact is you denied deputy CM-ship to Chaudhary Swarna Ram ji in 2007 and Chunni Lal ji in 2012.” BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh announced that the chief minister would be from the scheduled caste community if the party comes to power in Punjab. He Chugh lambasted the Congress and the SAD for trying to mislead SCs in Punjab by alluring them with false promises of giving the deputy CM seat. Ridiculing the SAD president’s announcement on deputy CM from the SC community, he countered, “Why not the CM?”. The Akalis should break the practice of picking up chief minister from a family and also from a particular community, he added. Chugh also ridiculed the Punjab chief minister for making a false promise during the last elections of giving the deputy CM post to SCs. “Both the Congress and the SAD want to use them as a vote bank, whereas the BJP promises to pick up a leader from them for the seat of the chief minister of the state,” Chugh said. Regarding direct payment to farmers during the ongoing wheat procurement, he warned farmers against giving blank cheques to anyone, saying the Prime Minister wanted to empower farmers directly and it was time they realised his dream for bringing change in agriculture practice. However, Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma hit out at SAD’s promise. He said SAD has a history of misleading voters and its announcement of having a legislator from the scheduled caste community as the deputy CM is nothing but a desperate move to gain lost political space. He said SAD is aware that it stands no chance in the elections in 2022. “It’s the 33% of the scheduled caste community which will decide its political course. Strangely, When in power, SAD never thought that the deputy chief minister should be from the SC community,” he said. Sharma said that the BJP is on record that it had requested the SAD to give prominent positions to the SC in ministerial berths and chairmanships. He added senior leaders of SAD did not listen to BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/on-ambedkars-bday-bjp-sad-aim-for-polls-both-promise-dalit-cm-deputy-cm/articleshow/82073332.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Police stations asked to remove seized vehicles||Kolkata: Lalbazar has ordered police stations to remove all seized vehicles that have been parked in front of their premises. All the OCs have been asked to ensure that the owners of the two-wheelers and cars are traced and the vehicles are returned to them. If cops are unable to find the owners, the vehicles should be auctioned at the earliest. The order will be in place for all 80 police stations under Kolkata Police, especially 55 police stations where elections are slated on April 26 and April 29. There are three reasons behind this move, according to the police. “With the second wave of the pandemic raging, it is necessary to sanitise the premises of police stations. Our special teams are facing a challenge sanitizing these vehicles. There is also the dengue and malaria threat in the coming months and so it is important that we start taking precautionary measures from now. Finally, with elections on, we need a lot of space to park the extra vehicles that are used for 24x7 watch. Hence, we need to remove these abandoned vehicles to make space,” said an officer. The instructions came after several senior officers — who were on rounds before elections — found these vehicles were dumped around the police stations. The order also asked cops to use covers for the seized vehicles. “All these vehicles are part of some important cases. Hence, they need to be preserved,” said an officer. Cops said that many of these cars don’t have legitimate papers and many of them are seized from accident spots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-stations-asked-to-remove-seized-vehicles/articleshow/82072458.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Jaipur||7 yrs after SC judgment, fight for identity continues||Jaipur: It’s been seven years to the judgment of Supreme Court in which transgenders were recognized as third gender in India, yet they are still waiting for their identity cards. Transgender identity cards will help the community members to avail benefits of social welfare schemes by the state government. The Supreme Court on April 15, 2014 in National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India, a landmark judgment declared trans people as third gender. According to election data, in 2016, as many as 16,517 transgenders are there in the voting list, out of which only 375 have voter identity cards. After the SC judgment, proper definition was given to trans people, which led to many people coming out of the closet declaring themselves as transgender. It is expected that around one lakh transgenders reside in Rajasthan. With the help of separate transgender identity card, any person of the community will be able to avail benefits of reservation, concession in transport, ration or housing schemes. Pushpa Mai, head of Nayi Bhor Sansthan, an NGO working for the transgender people in Rajasthan, said that they have been fighting to start the process to get trans persons their own identity card since a long time, but that has not been a priority of the government. “At present, we can call ourselves as third gender in voter ID and Aadhaar card, but are they sufficient to get all other benefits of social welfare schemes? Having our own identity card will help us get a special status and to get our rights,” said Pushpa. Even getting registered as third gender is not possible for every trans person due to lack of awareness and literacy rate in the transgender population. It is the job of social welfare department to implement the order of the apex court. States like Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh have already started giving transgender identity cards. In Rajasthan, Transgender Welfare Board was created in 2018 during BJP government which went defunct since Congress came into power as at present, there is no minister for social welfare department. During the pandemic, it became even more difficult to work for the welfare of transgenders. Nayi Bhor is trying to get permission from the government to get their own funding partners to start the process of giving identity cards to community members until the government starts the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/7-yrs-after-sc-judgment-fight-for-identity-continues/articleshow/82073317.cms||---

---||Delhi||At Your Service, Again: 15 Hotels To Double Up As Covid Centres||New Delhi: Covid-19 has brought the unrelated hospitality sector and hospital services together once again. On Wednesday, Delhi government ordered the conversion of around 15 hotels apart from banquet halls into extended Covid centres and associated them with major hospitals. The measure is meant to help augment Covid bed capacity by nearly 3,000, with the provision of transferring patients from the hostelries to their linked hospitals if their condition deteriorated during their stay in the hotel.Some of the hotels so requisitioned for Covid management in the city include ITC Group’s Welcome hotel Dwarka, some IHG properties like Crowne Plaza in Shalimar Bagh and Okhla, The Surya in New Friends Colony and a couple of Radissons. Their requisitioning would be implemented by the district magistrates of the respective districts and they would be taken over by the private hospitals with which they have been linked.The hotels will provide regular hospitality services, including rooms, housekeeping, disinfection and food for the patients. The government has capped the price at Rs 5,000 per day per person in the five-star facilities and Rs 4,000 per day per person for four- and three-star accommodation. All charges, however, will be collected by the linked hospital, which will make the payment to the hotel.The linked hospital will be paid a maximum of Rs 5,000 per Covid patient per day for medical services, included among this the cost of consumables, services of doctors, nurses and paramedical staff as per the norms. However, if there are any investigation charges, these will be billed at scheduled rates. For oxygen support, the hospital has been allowed to charge Rs 2,000 per day.According to government order, the linked private hospital will provide adequate manpower, including doctors and nurses and also manage the required oxygen supply, either in the form of oxygen concentrator or oxygen cylinder in case the hotel patient requires oxygen support. The hospital will also provide all consumables like PPE kits, N-95 masks, gloves, medicines and medical equipment, including pulse-oximeter and thermometer, etc. The hospitals will also have to make the necessary arrangements to provide resuscitation services, including equipment, drugs and medical consumables in the hotels in case of a deterioration in the clinical condition of the patient.Delhi government also increased the number of beds for Covid patients in 11 of its hospitals on Wednesday, taking the number of Covid ward beds in these facilities from 4,503 to 5,221.

---||Delhi||Ordinance on Delhi-NCR air quality management repromulgated||NEW DELHI: The ordinance on air quality management in NCR and adjoining areas has been repromulgated, sparing farmers from hefty penalty (of up to Rs 1 crore) and jail terms (of up to five years) for stubble burning. Besides, the tweaked provision of the legislation also includes stakeholders from three sectors, including agriculture, industry and transport in the expanded commission which will be reconstituted to decide issues linked to air pollution. The repromulgated ordinance, however, gives power to the commission for air quality management (CAQM) to impose and collect penalties (environmental compensation) from farmers causing air pollution by stubble burning at a certain rate and manner, which may be prescribed later through rules of the legislation. The hefty penalty provisions for industries, power plants or other polluters, as mandated in the original Ordinance, will continue as an “offence” punishable with jail term up to five years or with fine, which may extend up to Rs 1 crore or both. The original ordinance, lapsed due to curtailment of the budget session of the Parliament last month, was re-promulgated on Tuesday evening, making its provisions effective immediately. It was initially promulgated on October 28 last year. The CAQM under the original ordinance ceased to exist on March 12 as it could not be replaced by an Act within six weeks of convening of the budget session of the Parliament. Environment secretary R P Gupta had told TOI last week that the re-promulgated ordinance would be replaced by bringing a bill to this effect in Parliament in the monsoon session. The tweaked provision of the re-promulgated Ordinance has expanded the CAQM from 18-member to a 21-member body by giving three additional representations to stakeholders from agriculture, industry, transport or construction sectors as members of the body. The body will soon be reconstituted, keeping few of its earlier members on board. Justifying the Ordinance route when the Parliament is not in session, the Centre argued that the continuation of the Commission was necessary for “effective management of air quality” in the NCR and adjoining areas spread over four states – Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab. Since farmer organisations from Punjab and Haryana had expressed concerns over the hefty penalty provisions of the original Ordinance and demanded the government to withdraw such clause, the re-promulgated Ordinance while referring to penalty (up to Rs 1 crore) and jail term (up to five years) under section-14 of the legislation specifically mentioned that “the provisions of this section shall not apply to any farmer for causing air pollution by stubble burning or mismanagement of agricultural residue”. It, at the same time, clarified that the “Commission may impose and collect environmental compensation from farmers causing air pollution by stubble burning, at such rate and in such manner, as may be prescribed”. The new Ordinance also made it clear that “anything done or any action taken” under the ceased Ordinance will remain in force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ordinance-on-ncr-air-quality-management-repromulgated/articleshow/82074384.cms||Vishwa Mohan

---||Chandigarh||HP hoteliers near bankruptcy as second Covid wave spells doom||Manali: With the number of tourists visiting Himachal gradually decreasing and hotels reporting cancellations of bookings, the hoteliers and others associated with the tourism industry say they are very close to bankruptcy. A day after Himachal government had announced that tourists from seven highly-affected states and union territories will need to bring negative RT-PCR report to visit Himachal from April 16, the tourism stakeholders held a meeting in Manali on Monday. They reached a conclusion that if government does not work on attracting tourists in May and June, most of them, who are already defaulters in banks due to lockdown last year, will go bankrupt. Himachal Pradesh Travel Agents’ Association president Budhi Parkash said, “Tourists are in panic. A lockdown-like situation in many states is already weighing heavy on our industry. RT-PCR tests are not available easily at many places. And sometimes it is taking too long to get the report. Tourists are also hesitating in travelling in buses. These reasons are enough for most tourists to cancel or postpone their trips.” The number of tourists in Himachal used to increase from April. Most hotels and other service providers used to charge full seasonal amount for the services from mid-April to June 30. As there is very thin tourist flow, most hoteliers and others are offering discounted rates even for May and June. Volvo buses used to be the main mode of transportation for tourists between Delhi and Manali. These days most tourist buses are parked without passengers and some others are plying half-empty. “We shall support government in its fight against Covid-19 pandemic. But at the same time, we are concerned about the loan repayment. Last year, we availed moratorium and then rescheduled the loan. Many hoteliers are getting phone calls from banks to settle the dues.

---||Noida||Ordinance on Delhi-NCR air quality management repromulgated||NEW DELHI: The ordinance on air quality management in NCR and adjoining areas has been repromulgated, sparing farmers from hefty penalty (of up to Rs 1 crore) and jail terms (of up to five years) for stubble burning. Besides, the tweaked provision of the legislation also includes stakeholders from three sectors, including agriculture, industry and transport in the expanded commission which will be reconstituted to decide issues linked to air pollution. The repromulgated ordinance, however, gives power to the commission for air quality management (CAQM) to impose and collect penalties (environmental compensation) from farmers causing air pollution by stubble burning at a certain rate and manner, which may be prescribed later through rules of the legislation. The hefty penalty provisions for industries, power plants or other polluters, as mandated in the original Ordinance, will continue as an “offence” punishable with jail term up to five years or with fine, which may extend up to Rs 1 crore or both. The original ordinance, lapsed due to curtailment of the budget session of the Parliament last month, was re-promulgated on Tuesday evening, making its provisions effective immediately. It was initially promulgated on October 28 last year. The CAQM under the original ordinance ceased to exist on March 12 as it could not be replaced by an Act within six weeks of convening of the budget session of the Parliament. Environment secretary R P Gupta had told TOI last week that the re-promulgated ordinance would be replaced by bringing a bill to this effect in Parliament in the monsoon session. The tweaked provision of the re-promulgated Ordinance has expanded the CAQM from 18-member to a 21-member body by giving three additional representations to stakeholders from agriculture, industry, transport or construction sectors as members of the body. The body will soon be reconstituted, keeping few of its earlier members on board. Justifying the Ordinance route when the Parliament is not in session, the Centre argued that the continuation of the Commission was necessary for “effective management of air quality” in the NCR and adjoining areas spread over four states – Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab. Since farmer organisations from Punjab and Haryana had expressed concerns over the hefty penalty provisions of the original Ordinance and demanded the government to withdraw such clause, the re-promulgated Ordinance while referring to penalty (up to Rs 1 crore) and jail term (up to five years) under section-14 of the legislation specifically mentioned that “the provisions of this section shall not apply to any farmer for causing air pollution by stubble burning or mismanagement of agricultural residue”. It, at the same time, clarified that the “Commission may impose and collect environmental compensation from farmers causing air pollution by stubble burning, at such rate and in such manner, as may be prescribed”. The new Ordinance also made it clear that “anything done or any action taken” under the ceased Ordinance will remain in force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/ordinance-on-ncr-air-quality-management-repromulgated/articleshow/82076042.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Lucknow||RSS campaign to promote cow based non-chemical farming||Lucknow: The Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) has embarked on a countrywide campaign to encourage farmers to adopt cow-based agriculture practices. The four-month long campaign, Bhoomi Suposhan Abhiyan, was launched on April 13 and has brought on board organizations like Patanjali Yog Peeth, Gayatri Parivar, Eklavya Foundation, Art of Living, Shri Ramchandra Mission and others to cover two lakh villages in the country. The campaign is the result of discussions held by RSS in 2018 on harmful effects of chemical fertilizers and poisonous pesticides, used in modern day agriculture practices, on soil. “It is an awareness programme aimed at soil conservation, cow conservation, water conservation and reclamation and restoration of lost and threatened natural water resources like ponds. All these are interlinked,” said Awadh Prant Sanyojak (environment), RSS, Vishnu Dutt Bajpai. One of the major objectives of the campaign is to encourage organic farming and find out which plants will grow better in which type of soil, carry out classification of plants based on its basis and encourage its plantation. Organisations supporting the cause took up the campaign in Mohanlalganj, Lucknow, on Tuesday. In Sitapur, locals cleaned Kathina river, a tributary of Gomti, as part of the campaign. Similar initiative was taken up in villages of Unnao, Lakhimpur Kheri and other districts. “We start the campaign with bhoomi pujan and gau pujan. We ask farmers to bring in soil from their fields and mix it with cow dung, cow urine and jeevamrut. We ask them to spread the same soil in their fields and see the change,” said Brajendra Pal Singh of Lok Bharti, a self-help group running the campaign along with RSS in Uttar Pradesh. “We are explaining to farmers a simple science which will transform them into prakratik krishak,” said Singh. Office-bearers linked with campaign claimed one gram of cow dung has 3,000 crore to 5,000crore microorganisms which help plants and crop draw nutrition from soil. A cow yields about 10kg cow dung every day. The cow dung, when mixed with cow urine, jaggery, gram flour and soil from peepal roots, gives ‘jeevamrut’ which is a natural pesticide for plants, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rss-campaign-to-promote-cow-based-non-chemical-farming/articleshow/82074387.cms||Neha Shukla

Supporters of former block president Kulwant Singh Aulakh -- the younger brother of BJP state minister Baldev Singh Aulakh -- clashed with accomplices of Samajwadi Party-backed contestant Ujjawal Deedar Singh in Bilaspur area on Tuesday night. Ujjawal is also the husband of incumbent block president Ravinder Kaur. He is a contestant for block development council from ward number 21 in Bilaspur. It has been alleged that Ujjawal was campaigning in Ramnagar village when Kulwant and his aides attacked him. Sources said that a few rounds of fires were also exchanged and the vehicles of the SP leader were vandalised. Police received complaints from both the parties. But only one FIR was registered on the complaint of the driver of Kulwant. The BJP leader's supporters went to Ramnagar village after getting news that the SP candidate was “distributing money” among the voters. Earlier, UP minister Baldev Singh Aulakh was not allowed to enter the village while he was trying to campaign for BJP-backed candidates in Bilaspur on Sunday. According to police, Ujjawal was campaigning along with his supporters in Ramnagar village and was offering money, illicit liquor to the voters. The supporters of opposition candidate Kulwant had rushed to the village and were trying to stop them. “On seeing them, Ujjawal opened fire from his pistol and driver Vicky sustained a bullet injury in his hand,” a police officer said. On his part, Ujjawal shared a video on social media claiming that he was attacked by Kulwant and his aides. His damaged vehicles were seen parked inside Bilaspur police station. SHO of Bilaspur police station, Brijesh Yadav, told TOI, “The FIR was registered on the complaint of Kulwant’s driver Vicky. We have slapped IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapons), 149 (unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult), 171-H (illegal payment in connection with elections) and 307 9attempt to murder) along with the SC/ST Act. The accused are absconding and they will be arrested soon. The vehicles of the accused were damaged by locals after the incident and we have seized them.” Additional SP Sansaar Singh added, “We have not registered the FIR under any political pressure. The victim has sustained injury and we will ensure proper investigation in this case. We have not received any written complaint from the other party. Circle Officer Satish Kumar will be the investigating officer of this case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-rural-polls-clash-between-bjp-ministers-brother-and-sp-backed-candidate-in-rampur-leaves-5-injured/articleshow/82071397.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Devotees are purchasing fruits in the day time due to Covid restrictions on sale after 7pm. Wholesale traders said that for next one week the prices will continue to increase, however, after than prices are likely to be stabilised. “Usually people come to the markets in the evening before discontinuing their fast and purchase fruits. But due to Covid-19 and its restrictions since Tuesday evening, we saw increase in the demand for fruits. Also we saw a good number of customers in the morning. The sudden spike in the demand increased the prices in wholesale and retail markets,” said Mehmood Qureshi, a wholesaler of fruits at the Muhana Mandi. Vikas Jhalani, a wholesale fruit trader at Sodala vegetable market, said, “Earlier, we were selling grapes between Rs 60 and Rs 70 per kg. Now, prices have gone up to Rs 100 per kg. Similarly, papapya and watermelon were Rs 20 per kg and are now sold in Rs 40 per kg in the retail market. Customers are purchasing fruits in bulk amid rumours of lockdown.” Similarly, safeda variety of mangoes were earlier sold at Rs 60-70 per kg. Now, they were available for Rs 80-100 per kg. The prices of muskmelon till Tuesday were Rs 15 per kg and now it has gone up to Rs 25 per kg on Wednesday. “I think the prices would be stabilised from next week onwards.

Wildlife SOS assisted the state forest department in the successful rescue and release of the big cat. Villagers were startled on hearing the roars echoing from deep within an open well on Tuesday. It turned out that a leopard was struggling to stay afloat in the waist-deep water and the effort had seemingly left it exhausted. The villagers immediately alerted the forest department. A four-member rescue team operating out of Wildlife SOS running leopard rescue centre in Junnar was also dispatched to assist the forest officers. In the meantime, a group of villagers trained by Wildlife SOS and the forest department in conflict mitigation and rescue operations lowered a wooden ladder into the well so that the leopard could hold onto it for temporary support. Once the rescue team arrived at the scene, a trap cage was lowered into the well with its door angled towards the leopard. The big cat jumped into the cage and was gradually lifted. The animal was taken to the Manikdoh leopard rescue centre for a medical examination. Dr Nikhil Bangar, wildlife veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS, said, “The leopard is a female, estimated to be two-year-old. She had sustained minor cuts and bruises from the fall. After a few hours under observation, the leopard was released back into the wild.” Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder & CEO, Wildlife SOS, said, “Despite years of experience on our hand, our rescuers always take into consideration the possible risks and challenges while conducting such rescue operations. Open wells are a major threat to wildlife as most often animals end up drowning or succumbing due to starvation and injuries. Satyanarayan further said that Wildlife SOS conducts many awareness workshops to educate villagers on the threats to wildlife, and on a positive note, “these volunteering workshops have achieved great success”. “We are grateful to the villagers and forest officers for making this rescue a success,” he said. Otur RFO Yogesh Ghodake said, “The animals trapped in such dangerous situations are already much stressed, so ensuring their safety and comfort is our priority. Open wells are a common threat to wildlife around villages. Our teams are on constant vigil to provide any assistance when it comes to rescuing animals in distress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leopard-trapped-in-open-well-rescued-using-ladder/articleshow/82088918.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Goa||AIFF wants action against Persepolis for offensive posts||Margao: The All India Football Federation has asked the Asian Football Confederation to initiate disciplinary proceedings against Persepolis FC for their “unjustified aggression against the AIFF and Indian people at large.” The Iranian champions are in Goa to take part in the group matches of the AFC Champions League, Asian football’s top-tier club competition. Even before they set foot in India, Persepolis accused AIFF of “sabotage” after failing to obtain landing slot for their charter at the Goa international airport on time. Persepolis then put up a post on their official social media account, comparing their ACL campaign with the invasion of India by Persian emperor in the 18th century. The club later apologised and deleted the post. “One of the posts made by the club was contemptuous and offended the dignity of the people of Indian origin which concerns national origin. It is a shame that the history and culture of a country, which deserves the epitome of respect was offended,” AIFF general secretary Kushal Das wrote in his complaint to AFC disciplinary committee on Wednesday. The AIFF wants disciplinary action against Persepolis for blatant breach of relevant AFC rules, citing provisions of Articles 50 and 58 of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Code. While Article 50 deals with bringing the game into disrepute by “insulting someone in any way” (50.2.1) and making clubs liable when individuals cannot be identified, Article 58 relates to discrimination. The penalty for a club who “offends the dignity of a person or group of persons through contemptuous, discriminatory or denigratory words or actions concerning race,” is ban order to play a match with no or a limited number of spectators and a monetary fine. “The posts hurt the sentiments of Indian people at large. The posts showed an unjustified aggression against the AIFF and Indian people at large, which is totally outside of any sports ethics,” said Das. Since their arrival in Goa, Persepolis have complained about the lack of training facilities and delayed test results for Covid-19. Coach Yahya Golmohammadi said they “expected better facilities and better protection of players’ health.” On the field, though, the Iranians have been a cut above the rest. In their opening game, Persepolis accounted for Al Wahda 1-0 with captain Jalaleddin Hosseini scoring the only goal of the match. Persepolis have made it to the final twice in the last three years and are now chasing their maiden Asian title. They are favourites to top group E –which also has Al Rayyan (Qatar) and FC Goa – and qualify for the knockout stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aiff-wants-action-against-persepolis-for-offensive-posts/articleshow/82091523.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The fact that the state is not imposing a lockdown does not mean we are not in a critical situation. The only reason a lockdown is not being imposed is because it will impact livelihoods and the economy of the state. But if we continue like this, Telangana will soon become like Maharashtra,” he cautioned. Stressing the need for being extra careful for the next few weeks, Rao advised people to wear masks both inside and outside the house. “The virus is spreading rapidly in close settings. Entire families right now — from infants to the elderly — are getting infected within a matter of hours,” Rao said. He said people should avoid going out unless absolutely necessary. “Also, wearing masks inside as well as outside the house is advisable, especially for the elderly and those most vulnerable to the virus” he added. “People who go outside need to wear the mask around their family members when they come home. Maintaining social distance at the dining table and other common areas is important. We need to do these in order to save ourselves from contracting the the virus.” While Hyderabad is already reeling under an acute shortage of ICU beds, Dr Rao said that if cases continue to surge at the current rate, there will be no beds available in the future, despite upscaling the infrastructure and adding more beds. “So, we need to be more cautious now and impose a lockdown on the virus by wearing masks, maintaining social distancing at all times and avoiding going out,” he reiterated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-will-face-maha-fate-soon-if-people-roam-without-care/articleshow/82074399.cms||Amrita Didyala

According to the health officials of the ZP, the number of patients in rural areas is increasing rapidly. There are times when the high-risk contacts fail to get the test despite being told, hence spreading the infection unknowingly.“We often tell the high-risk contacts about the need to get tested. But they skip it for reasons like lack of acceptance, being afraid etc. Hence the testing is being carried out in the hotspots. The swab samples are collected immediately and the people are told to remain in their homes till the reports are out,” said district health officer Dr Kapil Aher.However, since the ZP does not have enough lab technicians, healthcare workers, staffers from the private laboratories are being included in the programme. “We have also trained the Asha workers in to collect swabs of the suspected Covid patients,” he said. “There are times when the private laboratories do not have enough people for the process. But on requests, they loan us their employees for a day or two. Since the testing is carried out in the areas together, the staffers engaged are freed after a couple of days,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/zp-starts-conducting-tests-of-high-risk-contacts-in-hotspots/articleshow/82070646.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On the eve of polling, the State Election Commission directed all polling officers to ensure all Covid protocols are strictly followed at the polling booths, even though critics slammed the decision of going ahead with polls at a time when the second Covid wave is threatening to shatter previous records. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is himself down with Covid, and so is his predecessor Akhilesh Yadav. Nearly 20 IAS officers, including those in chief minister’s office are also infected and are undergoing treatment. State law and justice minister Brijesh Pathak had recently warned against the fragile state of the burdened health system during the pandemic, while the high court had asked UP government to consider imposing lockdown to check the spiralling graph. The state government employees had also petitioned State Election Commissioner Manoj Kumar to reconsider holding panchayat elections amid raging crisis in vain. Former state election commissioner, Satish Kumar Agarwal said that panchayat elections have been deferred in the past in normal times. Therefore, in these extarordinary times, there was no reason to hold them in the middle of the pandemic. “The entire machinery involved in combating the pandemic will be totally preoccupied with their constitutional responsibility of holding free and fair elections,” he said. “The system is under tremendous pressure right now due to the pandemic. The SEC should take an independent and practical decision and postpone the polls,” said Agarwal. “The elections were due in December 2020 and are already delayed and could have been postponed further. Two panchayat elections had been delayed in the past without any reason. So, why this hurry amid an unprecedented pandemic and a humanitarian crisis staring at us,” asked Agarwal.

As per the official announcement, the remaining examinations for degree courses would be held from May 3, whereas those for postgraduate courses are scheduled to begin from May 5. Sanjay Shinde, the Bamu public relations officer, on Wednesday said the exams have been postponed given that the majority of students had opted for the offline option over online exams. “The examinations have been deferred considering the possible inconvenience to students because of the stricter curbs declared by the state government. All candidates are requested to follow the revised time-table for the examinations,” he said. The university administration has also appealed to the students to go for the online exam option when they resume next month. “Students can easily switch from the offline option to online by visiting the official portal. Although the pattern of examination for both is same, the online version is advised considering the pandemic situation,” Shinde said. While the examinations for the undergraduate courses for traditional streams had started from March 16, those for professional courses had commenced from April 6. The examinations for all postgraduate courses were slated to begin from April 27. Bamu, which has jurisdiction over Aurangabad, Beed, Osmanabad and Jalna districts, has over 410 affiliated colleges and 40 university departments with a collective student strength of over 4.4 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bamu-postpones-all-ongoing-upcoming-exams/articleshow/82071399.cms||---

According to data from the CoWin portal updated till 9 pm, as many as 1,00,23,991 doses of the vaccine have been given in UP. With this, UP became the third state in the country to have dispensed one crore-plus doses. Maharashtra and Rajasthan have already crossed the mark. Nationally, 11.16 crore doses have been given so far. This means that 8.9% of the total vaccine doses were given in UP. Also, 1.31 crore persons are fully vaccinated in the country of which 10.7% are from UP. The number for UP speaks for 86,02,525 recipients of the vaccine of which 14,21,466 have taken both the doses of the vaccine. The data also indicated that 14,34,836 doses were given during the four-day ‘Tika Utsav’ that began on April11 and concluded on April 14. Expressing satisfaction over the achievement, health minister Jai Pratap Singh said: “All the eligible people must take advantage of the opportunity given by the state government on vaccination. The numbers must be increased to achieve the desired herd immunity.” Earlier, he urged social organisations, industry bodies and social influences to convince people to shun their inhibitions and get vaccinated. Describing the development as ‘encouraging’, experts said that vaccination was the only other tool against pandemic virus besides prevention protocol. “The best takeaway from this data is that while millions have been vaccinated, only a handful – in fact less than a 100 – adverse events following immunisation have been recorded. This must be used to drive people to take the shot of life and hope,” said Dr Praful Bharadwaj, health officer, UNICEF UP, which is helping the state government with the Covid-19 vaccination programme along with the WHO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-crosses-1-crore-vaccination-mark-3rd-state-to-achieve-feat/articleshow/82074400.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The incident sparked tension in the area with a large number of people demanding action against the policemen. Taking cognizance of the incident, police commissioner Nikhil Gupta immediately transferred inspector Dilip Tare, sub-inspector Pravin Wagh and constable Sandeep Bharme of the Osmanpura police station to the control room. “We have initiated an impartial inquiry, which will be headed by inspector Avinash Aghav of the crime branch. If any policeman or officer is found guilty, appropriate action will be initiated,” said Gupta. The family of the deceased, Feroz Khan (50), and his staff claimed that Wagh and Bharme saw the salon open and asked Khan to come out. When he did, the policemen allegedly hit him. The family and the salon staff said the incident has been caught on CCTV camera installed at the salon as well as at neighbouring shops. “During the commotion, Khan fell on the shop’s shutter and sustained a head injury. He was taken in an unconscious state to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), where he was declared brought dead,” said the family members . Khan’s relatives brought his body to the Osmanpura police station and demanded registration of a murder case against the two policemen.

District collector Suraj Mandhare said the private hospitals should place their orders judiciously.At a time when relatives of Covid patients are rushing from one part of the city to another in search of remdesivir injections, one private hospital had recently procured 1,000 doses of the drug. Two other hospitals had procured 200 doses each, hampering the supply to other hospitals.Mandhare said as per certain sections of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, hospitals have the leverage to procure drugs directly from manufacturers. Therefore, the private hospital had placed a huge order of remdesivir. The collector said though the hospital concerned had not done anything illegal, given the current drug shortage, it is not right to hoard the key injection.He said the Food and Drugs Administration (Drugs) has been instructed to take necessary action (under the Disaster Management Act) on the excess stock of remdesivir the hospital has procured. Moreover, manufacturers have been instructed to not make an irrational supply of remdesivir to any hospital. This is to ensure that there is more remdesivir available for distribution through a centralised system. Mandhare said they have started a remdesivir quota system for every Covid hospital, and it is showing good results.Dushyant Bhamre, joint director of FDA (Drugs), Nashik, said that a centralised control room at the district collectorate would be monitoring the supply of the drug.NMC has received the first lot of 2,500 remdesivir injections from the Bengaluru-based pharma company. “Our requirement is 600 injections per day for patients in Covid hospitals of the civic body. This stock will last the next three-four days. We expect the next batch of 2,500 injections by April 17,” said Avesh Palod, Covid officer of Nashik city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/place-remdesivir-orders-judiciously/articleshow/82070651.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The accused also locked the victim in a room after the assault. The incident came to light after a purported video shot by a local was shared with police and an FIR was registered against four persons on the instructions of Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan. According to police, Ompal, Krishpal, Dharmendra and Sanjeev, all relatives of the village head candidate, went for campaigning to one Shiv Kishore's house.

The district administration has also advised pilgrims and tourists from across the country to avoid visiting the holy city for pilgrimage in view of the booming figures of new Covid-19 positive cases. Amidst challenges of arranging beds in level-3 and L-2 facilities for the critical Covid positive patients, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal and district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma took the decision to issue the advisory so as to discourage people from gathering at prime shrines, religious and tourist sites. Agrawal said, “Now, producing RT-PCR repot with negative remark has been made mandatory for people thronging prominent temples, including KVT, Annapurna and Sankat Mochan. Similar provision has been mandated for hotels for accommodating guests. The step has been taken in view of the continuous influx of pilgrims from southern, western and eastern states.” Sharma said, ”We are also appealing to the pilgrims to avoid visiting Kashi in view of the fresh wave of Covid-19 pandemic. People from other cities are also being advised to visit the city only in case of urgency only. The district administration has already imposed a ban on visiting ghats along river Ganga between 4 pm and 6 am apart from clamping night curfew.” Varanasi has been hit hard in the fresh Covid-19 wave, especially in the past 10 days, as over 1,000 cases are being recorded daily while the number of active cases is also nearing the 10,000-mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/negative-rt-pcr-report-must-forentering-temples-get-hotel-rooms/articleshow/82073724.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Nagpur||Severe Covid-hit moms advised MTP by doctors||NAGPUR: Getting infected with Covid-19 in the first trimester of pregnancy is proving devastating for some women, especially those who need ICU care. With steroids and heavy anti-viral drugs being administered as part of Covid treatment, such expectant mothers are being advised to terminate their pregnancy. Leading gynecologists in city told TOI that the number of such women is very low at present, but the way pandemic is taking grip of all, it may rise. The doctors have advised pregnant women to take utmost care in any phase of their pregnancy and avoid contracting the infection. On record, there are only a few cases of medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) due to Covid-19 complications in city so far. “Because we don’t have studies proving safety of anti-viral drugs and steroids, we are advising such women, who need to get these higher-level medicines, to terminate pregnancy safely,” said Dr Vaidehi Marathe, immediate past-president of Nagpur Obstetric Gynaecological Society (NOGS). “There are certain conditions when we advise to terminate pregnancy. But, not to everyone,” said gynecologist Dr Payal Agrawal, from Kingsway Hospital. According to her, decisions of early pregnancy termination is considered after evaluating risk factors like viral load, transmission generations, range of lung lesions by CT (more than two lobes), maternal age, and coexisting disorders like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases etc. One of the seniormost embryologist in the country Dr Natchandra Chimote said it’s a universal fact. “It’s not only about MTP, but Covid-19 infection in third trimester can cause pre-term deliveries even in 28 -30 week of pregnancy,” he said. Taking such risks into consideration, doctors are now advising select severe patients to terminate pregnancy by getting over emotions and thinking rationally, said Dr Chimote. It has become difficult in Covid-19 situation to get beds in hospitals where they can stay protected from hospital infection. According to global figures of pregnant women with Covid-19 infection, during 2020 peak (April to September), roughly half of the women (47%) were asymptomatic, 27% had mild symptoms, 14% had moderate symptoms, 8% had severe symptoms and 4% were critically ill. Those with more severe symptoms tended to be older, with a higher than average body mass index and underlying health issues, such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension, liver disease and seizure disorder. These figures also indicate that a fit expectant mother can deal with Covid-19 too, without having any problem. What Doctors SayEarly period of pregnancy is challenging and makes women vulnerable Viral infection at this stage could potentially affect embryogenesis and fetal organ development There is still no evidence for vertical transmission of Covid-19 For pregnant patients with mild symptoms, doctors avoid using teratogenic drugs near the fetus For severe patients during early pregnancy, first priority is to ensure maternal safety||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/severe-covid-hit-moms-advised-mtp-by-doctors/articleshow/82073351.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||India||S Jaishankar signals wider sphere of influence for India||NEW DELHI: India’s neighbourhood stretches beyond the Straits of Malacca in the east and the Gulf of Aden in the west and the Indo-Pacific concept overcomes artificial faultlines imposed in the post-World War II era, foreign minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday. The minister’s formulation expands India’s intended sphere of influence into the South China Sea as a theatre of Indian foreign policy. In a trilateral discussion with French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Australian foreign minister Marise Payne at the Raisina Dialogue, Jaishankar described India’s new view of its role as a “return to history”, saying that this placed the country’s neighbourhood across a greater swathe of the globe. Interestingly, Jaishankar’s remarks signal a desire to break out of India’s own definition of its ‘strategic backyard’ or extended neighbourhood that former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee had articulated back in 2000 — of stretching between the Straits of Malacca and the Gulf of Aden. The formulation, though presented in terms of historical connections, is unlikely to please China, which not only sees its immediate neighbourhood, but the entire Asia-Pacific as its strategic zone. Jaishankar added that global multilateral regimes were not delivering, security alliances did not always work and bilateral relationships were falling short — in other words, the present system of global governance may have outlived its usefulness. What he left unsaid was that the rise of China, India and other powers as well as the relative decline of the West had placed strains on the multilateral system, and it was important to rewrite it to reflect current realities. The world, he said, was moving to plurilaterals or mini laterals — smaller groups coming together with shared interests, shared goals and natural complementarities in their structures — like the Quad. “Multilateralism has fallen short. And bilateral delivery is not what it used to be. World moving towards multipolarity, rebalancing and plurilateralism. Shared values and comforts are creating new combinations. Will not fall for mind games,” he tweeted. The three ministers were actually supposed to hold an in-person trilateral dialogue on the sidelines of Raisina but that was postponed because the conclave went virtual in the light of India’s steep Covid-19 surge. While France is not a member of the Quad, the India-France-Australia trilateral is an extension of the Quad, given that France is a big player in the Indo-Pacific, as a resident power, with territories in its control. Answering a question on the importance of Indo-Pacific, Jaishankar said it was a historical reality, in a more seamless world, as evidenced by the old trading routes that stretched from the western Pacific to the Mediterranean. “Indo-Pacific is a strong message. India will not be boxed between Malacca Strait and the Gulf of Aden. Our interests and activities go way beyond. Australia and France are part of that canvas. It’s a return to history,” he said. “What broke this were empires and the politics of post-World War II. Today, because of rebalancing and multipolarity, they are all coming back together,” he added. Emphasising the centrality of Asean in the Indo-Pacific, Jaishankar pushed back against the Chinese accusation of the Quad as an Asian Nato. In the past few meetings, he said, Quad discussions focused on climate, HADR, vaccines, resilient supply chains, emerging technologies and maritime security.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/s-jaishankar-signals-wider-sphere-of-influence-for-india/articleshow/82075621.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Not the sole panacea against Covid’||Pune: Remdesivir is not the lone life-saving drug against Covid-19. A careful mix of oxygen therapy, vitamin supplements, steroids and blood thinners have been helping patients recover faster, say medical experts. The state task force, in an April 12 meeting, made it clear it is “absolutely possible” to save patients without even using Remdesivir. “The drug is being rampantly prescribed. And people have developed this impression that the anti-viral will save lives,” Sanjay Oak, chief of the state task force, stated in an advisory released on April 13. Critical care expert Dr Prasad Rajhans, chief intensivist of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said patients and families should not put pressure on doctors to use Remdesivir. “Oxygen therapy, vitamins, steroids and low molecular weight heparin (blood thinners)... make for an excellent recovery rate. People should not panic over the shortage of Remdesivir,” he said. Dr Parikshit Prayag, infectious diseases expert, said, “Remdesivir only shortens the duration of illness in carefully selected patients—like those with early hypoxia (low blood oxygen saturation) or high-grade fever with lower respiratory involvement. This impression that it is life-saving makes a patient desperate and anxious when she or he does not get it. Unfortunately, many people are being unnecessarily put on the drug.” Antiviral drugs such as Remdesivir and favipiravir prevent viral replication. “So it is not Remdesivir alone that helps. It’s when the drug is given along with oxygen therapy, steroids and blood thinners that it benefits recovery. While Remdesivir reduces the viral load, other drugs ease inflammation triggered by the virus,” said physician Dr Aniket Joshi from theAssociation of Physicians of India (API), Pune branch.  “Remdesivir is certainly efficacious in the early phase of the infection, to control virus replication. Similarly, Tocilizumab in select critical patients also helps tame the abnormal immune response called ‘cytokine storm’. But these drugs’ indiscriminate use should be absolutely discouraged,” said Ruby Hall Clinic’s chief intensivist Kapil Zirpe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-not-the-sole-panacea-against-covid/articleshow/82072511.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Delhi||Hospitality units trying to assess upshots of move||New Delhi: After Delhi government requisitioned hotels and banquet halls to turn them into Covid care facilities under the supervision of major hospitals in a step taken to manage the sharp surge in Covid-19 infections in the city, the hospitality units are still assessing the ramifications of Wednesday’s government order.An executive of two luxury hotels — one was attached to a hospital both last year and this year, the other in 2020 only — said no patients were lodged the last time after the situation improved soon after the units turned into Covid facilities. The executive disclosed, “Our hotel was listed in the initial days of Vande Bharat Mission when paid quarantine for international arrivals was mandatory. We had a couple of floors reserved for such people. Right now, we do not know if we will be required to dedicate some floors or the entire property for Covid patients. It will perhaps depend on the patient flow to the attached hotels.”Another executive conceded that the requisitioned hotels could shift their guests to other units in the chain. “Once a hotel/banquet hall is declared as being attached to a hospital, not many will want to visit it, neither for a stay or for meals. So regular business, which had crashed during the current surge, will anyway be affected.” He also pointed out that the hospitality staff was not trained to function as hospital workers and would, therefore, need orientation.What hotels have so far understood is that patients will first approach hospitals for treatment but will be sent to the hotels or banquet halls if bed are unavailable there and if their condition does not warrant a hospital bed. While the government has specified who needs to do what, many requisitioned properties are not sure about the dynamics of this dual-care centre setup. “Hospitals are operating to capacity. The doctors there are already overworked and the medical staff is struggling to cope with patient load. How will they arrange spare medicos to send to the listed hotels and banquet halls?” wondered a hotel official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospitality-units-trying-to-assess-upshots-of-move/articleshow/82074407.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The citizens were also going to non-essential shops to get their vehicles repaired, buy clothes and eat at eateries. Since the morning, the petrol pumps witnessed a huge rush of vehicles. The pump staff were not filling up the tanks full so that everybody in the queue gets fuel. In the evening, roads were crowded with citizens rushing back to their homes. The entry points of the city were filled with vehicles as the citizens were returning to their native places as most shops and offices, both private and public, will remain shut for the next 15 days. Shailesh Balkawade, the superintendent of police in the video message said, “As many as 1,200 policemen and women will be on streets each in two shifts.

---||Chandigarh||Capt calls it ridiculous poll optics||Chandigarh: Terming it as poll optics, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday ridiculed the SAD and BJP for promising to appoint a Dalit deputy chief minister or chief minister, respectively, if voted to power. “Given the shockingly poor track record of both the parties, which did nothing for the SC community during their term in power,” Amarinder said SAD and BJP had failed to ensure the welfare of Dalits in the state for 10 years, and were now resorting to political gimmickry to woo the community with an eye on the 2022 elections. “Sukhbir Badal is now promising a deputy chief minister, but has nothing to show what he or his party, in alliance with the BJP, ever did for the community,” said Amarinder, terming it a political antic aimed at misleading the people with an eye on votes. It was ridiculous the way the BJP had also quickly jumped on to the wagon to promise a Dalit chief minister if elected by the people of Punjab, he added. Given the angst against the BJP in the state over the farmers’ issue, even finding one winnable candidate would be a challenge for them, he said. Amarinder said that for 10 years during the Akali regime, the SC community was struggling to survive under the rule of the most apathetic government ever in the state. The Akalis did absolutely nothing for them, he added. Soon after his government took over, it went on to implement all the poll promises made to the SC community, one by one, said the chief minister, speaking earlier at the virtual state-level function to celebrate Ambedkar Jayanti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-calls-it-ridiculous-poll-optics/articleshow/82073358.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Situation wouldn’t have worsened had beds been added’||Lucknow: Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday said that had the UP government increased beds in hospitals in the last one year, it wouldn’t have to increase the capacity of crematoriums. Speaking to UP Congress leaders in a virtual conference on the pandemic situation in the state, particularly in Lucknow, Priyanka said: “The situation in Lucknow is unimaginable. People are queueing up at crematoriums and burials grounds to perform the last rites of their dear ones from morning till night. This is an outcome of UP government’s misplaced priorities. Had the government invested in increasing beds in hospitals last year, it would not have to increase the capacity of crematoriums.” “The condition in UP is appalling. Surprisingly, there is a sense of complete negligence on part of the government. Testing is not being allowed in private labs. You need a letter from the CMO to get admission to a hospital. It is a double attack on the people,” she alleged. Expressing concern over non-availability of ICU beds, shortage of medicines and testing kits in Lucknow (the centre of maximum pandemic activity), Priyanka said being an opposition party, it was the responsibility of the Congress to keep working for the welfare of the people amid rising Covid-19 cases. “It is the duty of the opposition to fight for the rights of people and the Congress party is committed to it. Congress is ready to extend all possible help to people,” she said. Priyanka also referred to the letter written by UP’s cabinet minister Brajesh Pathak in which he exposed the sorry state of affairs in Lucknow. “It is an irony that respected persons like Yogesh Praveen died waiting for an ambulance despite several efforts made by state’s law minister,” she said. The Congress leader listed out a charter of demands for the state government in public interest. “The government must allow private labs to function freely, ensure that people get their reports in 24 hours, the system for admission is simplified, shortage of oxygen, medicine and testing kits is addressed immediately,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/situation-wouldnt-have-worsened-had-beds-been-added/articleshow/82074413.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Even though some restrictions were enforced from April 5, there was no clarity on tourism and hence it was business as usual and tourist activities were being carried out unhindered. Some parks like Pench and Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) were closed for two days — Saturday and Sunday. Tourists, guides and even resort owners said flow of tourists had already gone down in parks like Tadoba and Pench, which are usually packed during summer, even before the new curbs were announced. “The fresh order issued by the government on April 13 clearly makes a mention about closure of public and open places. Therefore, we have decided to close all ecotourism activities in Tadoba and its buffer zone,” said Jitendra Ramgaonkar, conservator of forests & field director, Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). “Entire advance booking amount for the period between April 15 and 30 shall be deposited in the e-wallet of the respective account on www.mytadoba.org. TATR has also opened a helpline for tourists (9579160778 / 8010539472). Apart from TATR, Pench Tiger Reserve too has decided to suspend tourism from April 15 till April 30. Hence, Umred-Karhandla and Mansinghdeo sanctuaries and Bor Tiger Reserve (BTR) will remain closed. NNTR and Tipeshwar will also remain closed till April 30. Madhya Pradesh side of Pench, which witnesses most tourists from Nagpur, had already decided to close down the park from April 8, following complete lockdown in Seoni district of the neighbouring state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tadoba-pench-other-parks-to-remain-closed-till-april-30/articleshow/82073359.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Goa||Point is good but we need to improve: Ferrando||Margao: As the referee blew the whistle to signal end of play after 94 minutes, FC Goa coach Juan Ferrando punched the air with delight at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda late on Wednesday night. Ferrando was pleased with the goalless draw against Al Rayyan SC in their AFC Champions League debut, a first for any Indian club. While many expected the Qatar heavyweights to toy with an inexperienced Goan side, the hosts took them by surprise. Goa were competitive. In the first 45 minutes, for example, they had an almost equal share of the ball. They even managed to stitch passes together, play good football and, when needed, defend in numbers. This was impressive stuff. “The job that the players did was perfect,” Ferrando told TOI after the game. “I am happy for this. It was important for us to control the space in the first 20 minutes. There was a lot of stress on the players. This is the Champions League and we played after more than a month. “In such games, if you control the space, keep the ball, then step-by-step, you can grow. In second half, it was important to work (harder) and control the space. Al Rayyan, while pressing, is a very good team, they know the timing. This is a good experience for all of us.” The point is a good start for Goa but Ferrando is not done yet. There are five more games, and the next one is against Al Wahda (UAE) on Saturday. While the hosts have had a great start, for Ferrando that is clearly not enough. “This point is important because it brings positivity before preparing for the next game. We have five more games. The first game went well, the new target for Saturday is to further improve in attack. We have to go step by step and continue improving. This is not our limit. We have to improve more," said Ferrando. In the build-up to the game, during every training session, Ferrando said players were told what to expect from the Qatar Stars League side. “We were talking about concentration. We have to be a team because we know, one against one, Al Rayyan is better than us. But as a team (we can compete). This is the concept of football,” said Ferrando. Goa next take on Al Wahda on Saturday. The UAE side lost their opening game narrowly against group favourites last year’s finalists Persepolis FC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/point-is-good-but-we-need-to-improve-ferrando/articleshow/82091628.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Pune||Oxygen supply to industries to be ‘nearly nil’ initially||Pune: Regional and industrial officials on Wednesday admitted that manufacturing industries would get little oxygen supply, at lease in the initial days of the enhanced restrictions, due to the rising demand for the gas in the health sector. The industries directorate issued a circular confirming that any non-essential industry, which was a net consumer of oxygen, would not be allowed to operate till May 1. The circular, however, did not mention if the shops selling raw material or tools essential for industries would be allowed to function from April 15 to May 1. The officials said the issue would be reviewed on the basis of the situation. “We are waiting for the situation to stabilize after the implementation of the orders. After two or three days, we will review the situation and decide if the shops selling raw material will be allowed to open. As for oxygen supply to industries, the situation is that nearly all of the gas is being consumed by the health sector. That will continue to be the case for a few days, or at least till the pressure on the health sector eases. We will then decide about supplying oxygen to industries,” said a senior official of the industries department. The demand to keep raw material shops open, as well as concerns about the lack of oxygen supply, has been expressed the most by the micro, small, and medium-scale (MSME) industries. These industries are key suppliers to big automobile and engineering services firms, both in Pune and the rest of the country. “I don’t know why the state government is discriminating between export-oriented and other industries. Many automobile and engineering firms in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, and in the rest of the district, have export components. But not all of their products are meant for export. If we do not get raw material like oxygen, or welding rods, because the shops are not being allowed to open, we have to shut down operations completely. We will losing orders to other places in India supplying to the automobile manufacturers,” rued Sandip Belsare, president of the Pimpri Chinchwad Small Industries Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/oxygen-supply-to-industries-to-be-nearly-nil-initially/articleshow/82072600.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Lucknow||UP Def Corridor: A National Imperative||Defence manufacturing in India remained a mostly restricted and over-regulated area till the current NDA government had to face up to the security reality of self-reliance in defence as a strategic imperative. Since 2014, the government has made a concerted effort to woo the private sector to boost the defence-industrial capabilities and provide a much-needed competition and complementariness to defence PSUs. Some examples are the Strategic Partnership Model and the Innovations for Defence Excellence Programme (iDEX). But there are hiccups and ‘miles to go.’ As a good impetus, the Union Defence Ministry has earmarked around 64% (over Rs 70,000 crore) of its modernisation funds under the capital acquisition budget for 2021-22 for purchases from the domestic sector. It marks a large increase from 2020-21 (Rs 52,000 Crore). Along with measures like widening the negative import list, this is part of the ‘push’ under the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign, where the defence sector core area for Make-in-India. The defence corridors in UP and Tamil Nadu are the two mega projects to drive the Atma Nirbhar campaign. The UP government fully understands that the capability and viability of the defence and aerospace industry is built on the strength of supply chains, in which the MSMES are intricately intertwined. UP leads in the number of MSMEs among states, and these can play a crucial role in this ecosystem. The UP government has been putting special focus to provide special incentives to this sector in the policies in-line with Union guidelines. The UP Defence Industrial Corridor is planned across 6 nodes -- Lucknow, Kanpur, Jhansi, Agra, Aligarh, Chitrakoot, which spreads across Central, East, West region of UP and along the Golden Quadrilateral connecting Delhi – Kolkata supported by networks of expressways i.e. Yamuna, Agra–Lucknow, Purvanchal, Bundelkhand, Gorakhpur and Ganga Expressway. IIT Kanpur and IIT Banaras Hindu University Varanasi have been approved by the UP government for establishment of Centre of Excellence related with Defence Industrial Corridor and allotted with the amount of Rs 2.00 Crore each against total approved amount of Rs 50.00 crore and Rs. 69.00 crore respectively in the financial year 2018-19. Many technical institutes have started working in collaboration. Creation of industry ready land-banks for setting up of infrastructure for defence-Aerospace industries is a priority area for the state government. Almost 5071.19 hectares of land is to be acquired for the corridor. A guideline/procedure for allotment of Industrial Plots in Defence Corridor has been published for seamless land allotment procedures. A proposal to establish the Defence Park as a joint venture of UPEIDA and IIT, Kanpur on a 30-acre plot is being considered by the government of UP. Similar ones in corridor nodes like Kanpur, Jhansi, Aligarh, Chitrakoot, Agra and Lucknow and its expansion in other districts is planned. Criticalities A key for success of the defence corridors will be leadership across the spectrum. Innovative leaders who know how to find and nurture talent that is comfortable with handling quick, and even disruptive change. Leadership will have to be aware of design iterative processes and can build organisations that allow the free flow of communication and ideas. The bureaucratic structure and defence services must value these innovative traits and select and promote such leaders to critical innovation positions. An environment that advocates and follows a culture, values and processes that encourage the discovery of innovative ideas; and, where questioning and failure are accepted is needed. The political leadership at the centre and in UP seems to be ready for this. The second criticality is a secure network of the ecosystem. Due to the magnitude and critical nature of the data and the global dispersion of the event network, there is a need for a platform using secure cloud architecture to store information and an anti-tamper Blockchain-based distributed ledger for military and vendor input on part supply levels. It needs to be proven against all foreseen cyber challenges ahead. This will require red-teaming challenges almost on a continuous basis.

---||Delhi||Parties on hold, banquet halls to perform Covid duty||New Delhi: Delhi government ordered the conversion of several banquet halls, one school and Yamuna Sports Complex into temporary Covid hospitals on Wednesday to augment the number of beds needed for the rapidly growing coronavirus victims. Delhi reported 17,282 new Covid cases in the last 24 hours, and the number of active cases crossed 50,000, the highest since the outbreak in the capital. Together, the banquet halls and other facilities will add over 1,100 Covid beds.These new facilities will be linked with major hospitals, which will provide necessary doctors, staff, health infrastructure and consumables. Less serious patients will be shifted to these care centres to decongest hospitals and reserve the beds for critical patients.Shehnai Banquet Hall, with 120 beds, has started functioning. The patients are provided food and indoor pastimes like carrom, ludo, etc. The banquet hall centre is being managed by a private organisation, Doctors for You. With Grand Utsav Banquet in Rohini (75 beds), Masaic Sandoz Banquet in Wazirpur (250 beds), Golden Tulip Banquet Hall in West district (110 beds), these will augment beds by 875 beds. The other banquets halls, Crystal Banquet in Laxmi Nagar (50 beds), Ajija Banquet and Kundan Banquet in Kapashera (150 beds), Ashirvad Banquet in Janakpuri (25 beds) and some others, will together induct 250 additional Covid beds. Rouse Avenue School on DDU Marg will be a 120-beds care centre, while Yamuna Sports Complex in Vivek Vihar will have 200 beds.In a separate order on Wednesday, Delhi government announced the linking of hotels, including some five-star hotels, to different hospitals in a bid to boost the Covid infrastructure.During earlier waves too, banquet halls had played a crucial role in Covid care, taking significant pressure off the Covid hospitals enabling them to devote more resources to critical patients. According to the government order, the district magistrates will arrange beds with mattresses and pillows, while the banquet halls are expected to depute their housekeeping staff to the hospitals they are linked with. “The cost rates of treatment at banquet halls and other facilities will be provided by the divisional commissioner in due course,” the order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/parties-on-hold-banquet-halls-to-perform-covid-duty/articleshow/82074426.cms||AlokKNMishra

Most of the tigers that went missing were last sighted in these areas. One of the black holes identified is in the region between Sawnta and Kila Khandar with its centre at Banpur. The other is the Kanduli, Kharda Ka Nallah and Bhairupura region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-takes-note-of-missing-tigers-in-ranthambore/articleshow/82073401.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Red tape cut to get ICU bed for freedom fighter||MUMBAI: He’s done his bit for the country. As a gesture of collective gratitude, the BMC and the state did their bit in arranging an ICU bed for a 102-year-old freedom fighter at a time when there is an acute shortage of hospital beds. Matunga resident Satyabodh Singit who had tested positive for Covid-19 had a tough time finding a bed on Tuesday night despite efforts put in by officials. “Officials from the BMC and the collector’s office were helpful in arranging a bed for my grandfather at a private hospital. But when we reached there, they said that his condition was deteriorating and he needs an ICU bed,” said his grandson Vaibhav. “So, we had to keep him in the ambulance for 3-4 hours till we could find an ICU bed.” This sent the family scurrying to the BMC-run KEM Hospital in Parel.“Here again, we had to keep my grandfather in the ambulance for long... A bed in the ICUwas finally allotted after midnight,” Vaibhav said. Vaibhav said that they got little help from the municipal ward war rooms. “The BMC sent a regular ambulance with only one person. So I had to order a private Covid ambulance and carry my grandfather from our third-floor flat. The war room should have told us that there was no ICU bed available.” He alleged that war room system has “collapsed totally” and said that there is no bed allocation happening on time. Singit had been felicitated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at Shivaji Park on Republic Day this year for his contribution as a veteran freedom fighter. Assistant municipal commissioner Kiran Dighavkar said he had received a message from resident deputy collector Sadanand Jadhav that a freedom fighter needs a bed. “We didn’t wait for bed allocation from the ward war room. The patient required an ICU bed which was not available. So, the patient was stabilised and then sent to KEM Hospital,” he added. Singit’s condition is critical. “The bed allocation system must improve. There is no coordination and status update,” said Vaibhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-red-tape-cut-to-get-icu-bed-for-freedom-fighter/articleshow/82073431.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

BJP had on April 12 demanded removal of the district election officer/collector of Rajsamand from poll duty in the district as the party in a complaint against minister Pramod Bhaya and the collector alleged that they were trying to influence and intimidate voters.A BJP delegation led by state president Satish Poonia met Governor Kalraj Mishra and submitted a memorandum requesting him to ensure holding free and fair elections in three assembly constituencies – Sahada, Rajsamand and Sujangarh.

---||Hyderabad||Kota catches up, relaxed coaching draws Telugu students for JEE, NEET training||HYDERABAD: Telangana and Andhra Pradesh boast of many top corporate institutions specialising in providing coaching for competitive exams JEE and NEET. But that hasn’t stopped an increasing number of young aspirants from the two Telugu states to shift to institutions in Kota in Rajasthan. Lower fees, comparatively relaxed timings, swanky facilities and more importantly a more systematic approach to teaching are some of the reasons the students say they prefer Kota. “There is no spoon-feeding at the institute I am studying in Kota,” said Umesh Nodu, a Telugu student enrolled for JEE coaching in Kota. Umesh, who secured 96.34 percentile in JEE Main in the March session, said that as someone who had been encouraged to copy from the blackboard and learn by rote, studying at Kota came as a welcome change as he got more practical knowledge and could understand the subject better. Umesh said that even his sister took her JEE coaching from Kota and is now studying at IIT-Jodhpur. Students say they are not made to follow a prison-like regime, are not publicly shamed by putting their results in the open or forced to stay in an unhygienic environment while preparing for the competitive exams in Kota. “Classes are conducted only for half a day. For the remaining part of the day, we have self-study hours and discussion,” said Madhuri Pratap, who took long-term coaching for NEET from another top Kota institute. Madhuri, who studied Intermediate from a corporate college in Andhra Pradesh, said corporate colleges concentrate on a few meritorious candidates, who will get them ranks. Others are left to fend for themselves, she added. Kota’s coaching institutes had received severe criticism a few years ago for putting excessive pressure on students, which led to suicides. Things started changing for the better in the past five years with a focus on more all-round development. “Now, students have access to psychologists, nurses, and can take up yoga, music among other activities. We also have a fest where students let their hair down,” said Deepak Joshi, who has been teaching inorganic chemistry in Kota for the last two decades. He said that earlier there used to be hardly any Telugu students, but lately many are coming to Kota. “In fact, I even picked up several Telugu words from my students and try to communicate with them in Telugu,” said Joshi, adding that they even started serving dishes such as pulihora, idly, dosa keeping Telugu students in mind. Kota has about 1.65 lakh students from 25 states taking coaching for competitive exams. Of the total students, about 1.2 lakh are boys and over 40,000 are girls. There are about 3,000 hostels, 1,800 messes, 25,000 PG rooms. One in every fourth student getting a call from Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) for admission into IIT and one in every third student getting a call for NEET counselling are said to be from Kota. “National level competition is available in Kota as students from every state come here and perform their best. A pool of the best students is formed here. Our result in engineering and medical entrance exam every year is way better than other cities,” said Naveen Maheshwari, director, Allen Career Institute at Kota. Maheshwari said that IITs, NITs and MBBS pass outs are serving as teachers at their institute. In 2020, two students from the Telugu States secured a spot in the top 10 ranks in the country in JEE advanced exam, a year before three students made it to the top 10. When it comes to NEET, 15 students from the Telugu States managed to secure a spot in all India's top 50 list in 2020, only four made it top 50 in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kota-catches-up-relaxed-coaching-draws-telugu-students-for-jee-neet-training/articleshow/82074427.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Child panel officials also claimed that they will monitor the situation and take regular feedback from the district administration. “While the guidelines by the home department say the SDMs will be accountable if any child marriages take place, we are yet to discuss if disciplinary or any other kind of action will be taken against the official,” said an official of the Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The officials claimed that while guidelines are issued to curb child marriages, at times it becomes very difficult to actually get information because no one approaches them directly. In very rare cases do complainants come to them as most of them go to the local district administration. The department has decided to sensitise officials so that they can stay alert when such a situation arises. The guidelines issued by the home department said the district administration needs to be vigilant in order to prevent child marriages and the wedding invites should also have the birth dates of the groom and the bride so that it can be established that they are not minors. Control rooms have also been set up where information regarding child marriages can be given, but officials said till no one comes forward, it is difficult to find these cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sdms-told-to-remain-alert-prevent-illegal-weddings/articleshow/82073427.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Should create harmony in society by following Ambedkar’s path: CM||Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that while celebrating the birth anniversary of great men, we should try to assimilate their values and ideals, and create harmony in society by following the path shown by Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar in the prevailing vitiated conditions in the country today. Gehlot was addressing a seminar on ‘Role of Sarva Samaj for Peaceful State’ held on Wednesday at Ambedkar Jayanti through a video conference from the chief minister’s residence. He said that happiness and peace could not prevail in a family where there are quarrels. The same thing applies to our society, state and country as well. Today, divisive language is used to create disharmony in various sections of the society. The basic spirit of secularism has been forgotten. There is a lot of pressure on constitutional institutions. He said that we need to be restrained in our behaviour and language while assimilating the basic spirit of the Constitution. The chief minister said that Dr Ambedkar did not react to the injustice and humiliation that happened to him in his childhood, but made himself capable with higher studies and got the rights for Dalits, the exploited and the backward. The father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi, also took to his stride the discrimination and insult heaped on him in South Africa, and began to overcome the lowliness and to create harmony in the society. Our youth also need to be shown the right path. He said that in this age of information technology, untouchability and purda system are a stigma on humanity. Gandhian thinker Dr N Subbarao said that there should be no discrimination on the basis of religion, caste and region and the entire human race should be treated as one family, such education needs to be imparted to children. Gandhian thinker and former vice-president of Gandhi Peace Foundation, PV Rajagopal said that the use of language that breaks the society will have a negative impact on our future generations. The balance of language and knowledge-based information is very important for society today. He said that even Gandhiji did not believe in having a feeling of hatred for the antagonist.Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Law University vice-chancellor Dr Dev Swaroop said that for the first time, Baba Saheb created consciousness among the downtrodden and the exploited and made them realize that they too have equal rights over resources. He believed that a person should not be identified with his caste or religion, but on the basis of his ability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/should-create-harmony-in-society-by-following-ambedkars-path-cm/articleshow/82073432.cms||---

A meeting was held under the chairmanship of health minister Satyendar Jain with the representatives from these hospitals on Wednesday.“It was decided through consensus that keeping in view the interest of treatment of non-Covid patients and also the alarming rise in the Covid-19 cases in Delhi, the 14 private hospitals concerned would cumulatively provide 3,553 beds for Covid-related treatment and the remainder beds in these hospitals shall be used for treatment of non-Covid follow-up patients and patients requiring emergent medical/surgical treatment,” a corrigendum order issued after the meeting stated. In an order issued by the health department on April 12, these hospitals were directed not to admit any non-Covid medical/surgical patient till further orders.Together, these hospitals have 4,337 beds out of which only 3,553 beds are now reserved for Covid. “The 14 hospitals would be allowed to temporarily increase their bed capacity up to 35% and the additional beds may also be utilised for treatment of non-Covid patients,” stated the order.The decision to declare 14 hospitals as fully Covid hospitals was taken in the wake of exponential rise in Covid cases so that more and more beds can be created to accommodate the rising demands for beds. By Monday, the occupancy of Covid ICU beds crossed more than 85% in 57 out of 115 private hospitals and reached 100% in almost all of the large private hospitals. The occupancy of Covid ward beds crossed more than 85% in 32 out of 115 private hospitals and reached 100% in majority of the large private hospitals.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will hold a review meeting with lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Thursday in the wake of rapid surge in Covid cases in Delhi. The two are likely to discuss the situation and plan the course of action needed to check the rise in cases. Delhi reported more than 17,000 new Covid cases on Wednesday. The CM has, however, categorically stated that the Delhi government is currently not planning any lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/14-private-hospitals-not-to-go-fully-covid/articleshow/82074454.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Nagpur||One Covid positive in family infecting all members: Doctors||NAGPUR: Doctors treating Covid patients say each positive patient is infecting a couple of family members within 10 to 15 minutes of close contact. More than one member is needing hospitalization this time, and close contacts too are turning symptomatic, they say. Pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat said with lockdown the rate of infectivity is 0.6 in first five days, while it is 2.5 without a lockdown. Similarly, a positive person can spread infection to 406 persons without lockdown in 30 days, but to only 2.5 with lockdown in the same span, he said. Sengupta Hospital director Dr Shantanu Sengupta said even if there is one patient in the family he ends up infecting all. “Within six hours, the entire family is at risk of getting infected if they don’t follow norms properly. Those who are unable to isolate themselves, such families remain affected for 15 days. They face challenges like who will cook, and how they will maintain safe distance,” he said. Kingsway Covid incharge Dr Harashvardhan Bora said infectivity is such that even 15 minutes of exposure is enough to spread the disease within family or close contacts. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said they have observed that at least 25 persons, which could be neighbours, co-workers, employees or family members, are getting infected by each patients. Dr Mohammad, director of Criti Care Hospital, said it is difficult to say how many persons are getting infected from one patient in the current situation. “People don’t have proper isolation facility, separate rooms, toilet, bathroom, well ventilated rooms. Isolation implementation is not proper. Out of panic patient are visiting scan centres where they accidentally get infected. Even improper use of basic mask increases chances of catching the virus,” he said. Pulmonogist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik suggested people must use mask within their home also. “One after other, family members get infected. Last year, as part of containment, if one was positive entire colony or area used to be sealed though that time not many would get infected. Now, the scenario has changed. Society must understand asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic are two phases to control the pandemic. These phases are the time when people bring infection home,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/one-covid-positive-in-family-infecting-all-members-doctors/articleshow/82073435.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Delhi||Universities prepare for delayed start for 2nd year in a row||NEW DELHI: With the Central Board of Secondary Education announcing the postponement of the Class XII final exams due to the rampaging pandemic, universities across the country are gearing up for delayed admissions for the new academic sessions. Most universities, including Delhi University, have admission systems based on the Class XII exam scores. Only private institutions of higher learning did not appear to be affected by the announcement. Acknowledging that exam postponement would impact admissions at DU for a second year in a row, acting vice-chancellor P C Joshi said, “As a national university, we even wait for results of the state boards to accommodate their students. There is no clarity yet on the central entrance exams for universities, so the Covid situation will impact our schedule.” Joshi added, “Like last year, we will try to make admissions an entirely online process and quicken the process after the CBSE results are published.” S P Aggarwal, principal, Ramanujan College, said, “Perhaps if the Covid situation improves, CBSE can conduct the exams in June and enable us to complete the admissions by September.” Aggarwal wasn’t certain about CUCET, the proposed entrance exam for central universities, being implemented this year. So, he argued, entry would have to be based on board exam scores. “And we will have to wait for that, even if it takes till December,” he said. Former DU deputy dean of students’ welfare Gurpreet Singh Tuteja, however, felt the postponed exams would not have “a major impact on DU except for some changes in the academic calendar”. The schedule of Delhi government’s District Institutes of Education and Training will also be affected. The nine DIET colleges offer courses such as nursery teacher training and diploma in elementary education, admission for which depends on marks obtained in Class XII, with Class X scores used as tiebreakers. When asked if there was an alternative, Rajesh Kumar, principal, DIET, Gumanhera, said, “Jamia Millia Islamia and DU have admission tests. So, we can think along those lines. However, a Class XII pass is a must.” At Delhi Technological University, there is less of a hubbub because admission depends on the scores from the Joint Entrance Examination Main. “If JEE Main is held in time, admission won’t be a problem,” said a DTU official. Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jamia Millia Islamia too are not totally reliant on Class XII marks. Jamia conducts its own entrance tests, but aspirants need to have scored a certain percentage to be able to sit for these tests. JNU admits students to its undergraduate courses through the National Testing Agency exam. At private universities though, the CBSE announcement hasn’t created waves. A Shiv Nadar University spokesperson told TOI, “In the wake of the pandemic, we had altered our admission process last year. We are making provisional admission offers to candidates based on their performance in remotely proctored entrance tests and personal interviews. Selected candidates only need to secure a defined minimum percentage in Class XII exams, which can be updated whenever the results are declared. We also accept JEE, SAT and ACT scores from applicants.” An Ashoka University spokesperson similarly said, “We are in a position to make a firm offer of admission to applicants without waiting for their Class XII results based on SAT, ACT or mandatory Ashoka Aptitude Assessment scores. This reduces the uncertainty for applicants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/univs-prepare-for-delayed-start-for-2nd-year-in-a-row/articleshow/82073472.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

The 37-year-old fisherman was among the two survivors of the boat which met with an accident involving a Singapore ship ‘MV APL Le Harve’ in the deep sea off Mangaluru coast on Monday night that left three dead and nine missing. “The guy driving the boat fell on me. My neck and head hit the steering wheel. I thought it was a nightmare. Seconds later, I realised it was real when I opened my eyes under water with the boat on top of me,” recalled the fisherman from Kannirajapuram village in Ramanathapuram district while speaking to TOI over the phone on Wednesday. Among the three victims were his friend and boat captain Alexander, 38, his father-in-law Dhason, 65, of Colachel and Manickdhas of Bengal while his relatives Palani, Balamurugan and Manickam are among those missing. Besides Velmurugan, Sunil Dhas of Bengal also managed to survive the tragedy. They had set off on the deep sea expedition from Beypore on the boat ‘Rabah’ on Sunday night. “Around 10pm, Alexander anna suggested that we head towards the deep sea off Mumbai. We all had dinner and 12 of us were in the boat’s cabin. Alexander handed over the steering wheel to a 27-year-old from Bengal so that he could take a nap before being back at the wheels. It was raining and the wind was heavy. This is all I remember before falling asleep and the crash happened around 11.45pm,” he said. Minutes after being thrown into the sea, Velmurugan managed to reach the surface of in the dark. He swam in the direction of the impact to get help. “The powerful light from a high place made me realise we had hit a ship,” he said. “The ship was searching for survivors and with their light I spotted the mangled remains of our boat and swam towards it. Sunil Dhas who was on the boat already threw a rope to me and dragged me on board,” he said. The two men ran and rolled all over the top of the boat as they were tossed by the rough sea. The ship then spotted them and the crew lowered a rope for the men to climb aboard by 2 am on Tuesday. “They hit our boat but were compassionate enough to wait, search and rescue us. We were offered a new set of clothes, food. They checked our injuries, gave medicines and sprays for the swollen limbs and a place to sleep. The next morning the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) ship picked us from the Singapore ship around 7 am,” he added. The ICG ship brought the two survivors and bodies of the three others to Mangalore. After checkup and first aid, Velmurugan was returning from Mangalore to Tamil Nadu on Wednesday night. The family of Velmurugan, who lost his wife, is happy that he is alive as without him his four children aged eight to thirteen-years-old including a dumb boy would have been orphaned. “Our mother died in an accident three years ago. We are happy that our father is alive. He could not talk much as he had throat pain and is in shock over the deaths he saw. We are waiting for him to return home,” his elder son Thirumaniselvam, 13 said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/i-found-myself-under-sea-with-boat-on-top/articleshow/82073446.cms||M K Ananth

The overall bed strength has also increased by 35% to 20,022 in the same period. BMC chief I S Chahal had on March 26 said that the bed capacity would be increased to 21,000. However, the second wave has so severely impacted the city’s healthcare system that new beds get filled up within hours, said Dr Gautam Bhansali, a senior doctor from Bombay Hospital who coordinates between private hospitals and BMC. Worse, only 41 of the 2,623 ICU beds in both public and private sectors are available at the moment. However, BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said all-out efforts are being made to increase beds, especially in the private sector. “Most patients hail from relatively affluent classes who prefer private beds to public ones,” he said. The BMC is likely to soon take a decision on converting entire hospitals into Covid-only centres. Many of the private beds have been added by inducting nursing homes. The city’s 33 major private hospitals have increased their beds from 2,560 in the first wave to 3,100 in the second wave so far. Bombay Hospital has increased its Covid bed strength from 78 to 122 in the last few days, said Dr Bhansali. Hinduja Hospital’s Joy Chakraborthy said 15 beds are being added to the existing 84-bed Covid wards in his hospital. At Powai’s LH Hiranandani Hospital, Covid beds have increased from 95 to 125. CEO Dr Sujit Chatterjee said, “Earlier only the 4th floor was dedicated to Covid, but now we have added the 5th as well.” The BMC too has been adding ICU beds at its various hospitals. “The NESCO facility in Goregaon will soon have 200 ICU beds, while 34 ICU beds will be added to SevenHills Hospital in Andheri within a week,” said Kakani. BMC’s Cooper Hospital in Juhu will make all its 40 ICU beds available for Covid. If the surge continues, Dr Bhansali said the BMC may have to think out of the box. “Since the demand is mainly for private hospitals, the BMC may consider converting entire hos-pitals into Covid facilities ac-ross south Mumbai and suburbs. However, we are studying how many non-Covid patients are in hospitals and what their occupancy is like,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-of-covid-beds-in-pvt-hosps-doubled-in-15-days-says-bmc/articleshow/82073453.cms||Malathy Iyer

A high-level meeting to discuss the issue has been scheduled for Thursday and will be attended by special chief secretary of education, Chitra Ramachandran and the TSBIE secretary, among other senior officials. But even as Jaleel maintained that no inter student will be issued a pass certificate without writing an examination and that BIE is prepare to conduct the tests — it is scheduled to begin from May 1 — the Telangana Government Junior Colleges Lecturers’ Association claimed otherwise. “The state has already decided to cancel the examinations. It’s just that they do not want to make the announcement yet,” claimed Madhusudhan Reddy, president of the association. His reason: With just about two weeks left, the board has not even identified the required number of examination centres (it needs about 4,000) to conduct the exams. “Till date, only 2,500 centres have been identified. In the current situation, it is not possible to conduct exams and the state is aware of it,” said Reddy adding that even if state decided to go ahead with the exams, it will have no option but to postpone or cancel it if positive cases are reported even from one of the centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-may-postpone-inter-exams-in-line-with-cbse-says-bie/articleshow/82072613.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Rise in invasive fish species a threat to biodiversity||By: Pushpita DharHYDERABAD: A freshwater fish from northern South America was recently let into Neknampur lake and the result was havoc with the fish eating up eggs of native species and destroying the balance of the city’s already fragile aquatic ecosystem. A suckermouth catfish, an invasive species banned in Telangana by the fisheries department, was released into Neknampur lake on Sunday morning by unknown persons. “This however, is not an isolated incident,” said Madhulika Choudhary, founder of Dhruvansh, an NGO, adding the past six months have seen a number of exotic fish species released into the city’s lakes. In March, crocodile fish introduced in Neknampur lake were later found dead. Instances of invasive species being dumped in lakes by aquarists and increasing in numbers have also surfaced in Bengaluru, Kolkata and elsewhere in the country. “These fish eat the eggs of other fish and pose a threat to biodiversity if there is no other predator in the lake. They end up killing indigenous species. Nor do these species hold value for fisherfolk,” Choudhary said. The unauthorised release of exotic species into the city’s lakes also extends to red-eared terrapins that are bred in aquariums till they grow too large and are let into natural water bodies. “Similar to the catfish that is initially kept as a pet, these terrapins are aggressive and alter the biodiversity of an ecosystem,” Choudhary said. In 2016, the government issued a GO imposing restrictions on the culture of exotic fish such as tilapia to conserve aquatic biodiversity. In the same year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) passed an order prohibiting the cultivation of African catfish in Telangana. But in spite of such efforts, species diversity in water bodies in and around the city is falling. “Ameenpur lake has only tilapia despite farmers cultivating other species,” said Shilpi Sharma, regional director, Telangana State Biodiversity Board. “Exotic fish species are not only hardy, they are bottom-dwellers and there are no suitable nets to selectively harvest them.” But the biggest hurdle may still be low levels of awareness among aquarists. “We plan to ask the government to create awareness so that pet shop owners don’t stock certain species. As much as 99% of exotic fish species in India ends up in aquariums,” Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rise-in-invasive-fish-species-a-threat-to-biodiversity/articleshow/82073442.cms||---

State task force chief Sanjay Oak had in an advisory during a meeting on April 12 said patients staying in intensive care units (ICUs) for long durations were undergoing repeated RT-PCR tests. “This delays their transfer from the ICUs,” he said. The task force has said the hospitals should not insist on RT-PCR tests between the 14 and 21 days of a patient’s stay and these tests should not be mandatory before his or her transfer from ICU. “If the patient is stable and afebrile 72 hours prior to a planned transfer from ICU, no such test is required,” the task force advisory stated. “The task force, however, respects the individual discretion of the treating intensivist on a case-to-case basis in getting a test done in exceptional circumstances,” Oak said in the advisory. The task force has also suggested identification of the high risk patients when they first come to the emergency department of a hospital, nursing home, private hospital or general practitioner. “The task force is currently updating a list of red flags,” the advisory stated. It was also suggested by the task force at the meeting that each centre develop a team of paramedics, physiotherapists and other ancillary hospital workers, who would help in the emergency department to stabilize a patient and give him or her necessary oxygen and supportive treatment. Revised guidelines from the task force have stressed upon the principles of Triage-Treat-Transfer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/task-force-wants-hospitals-to-suspend-o2-consuming-work/articleshow/82072621.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Panchayat poll: Biggest ballot exercise kicks off in UP today||Lucknow: Amidst a pandemic surge, the stage is set for UP panchayat elections from Thursday — arguably one of the world’s biggest polling exercise and considered crucial to feel the grassroots pulse ahead of the high-stakes assembly elections next year. The four-phased elections spanning a fortnight will elect around 8 lakh rural representatives. Eighteen districts of the state will go to polls in the first phase of the rural local bodies elections to elect representatives for gram, kshetra and district panchayats. Some of the key districts which go to polls in the first phase include Ayodhya, Jaunpur, Kanpur, Ghaziabad, Gorakhpur, Prayagraj, Agra and Jhansi. State election commission data show in the first phase as many as 11,442 candidates will be in the fray for 779 wards of zila panchayats and 81,717 candidates in 19313 wards of kshetra panchayats. Likewise, 1,14,113 candidates will try their luck for the post of chairman in 14,789 gram panchayats. Though these polls are not fought on party symbols, the panchayat election will have political parties throwing their weight behind contesting candidates to ramp up their preparedness and consolidate their position in the run-up to assembly polls next year. BJP, in fact, has fielded its party functionaries in zila panchayat elections. Data shows Prayagraj has the maximum number of 84 zila panchayat wards, followed by 83 in Jaunpur. The home turf of UP CM Yogi Adityanath has 68 wards, while Ghaziabad and Mahoba have only 14 wards each. In terms of gram panchayat, Jaunpur tops the chart with 1,740 gram panchayats, followed by Prayagraj which has 1,540 gram panchayats. The mammoth poll exercise, not surprisingly, has left the state government extremely cautious amid a massive spike in Corona cases. Additional chief secretary, panchayati raj and rural development department, Manoj Kumar Singh told TOI that Rs 4.5 crore has been released for purchase of masks, gloves and sanitizers at the rural local bodies’ level. “Elections would be conducted as per guidelines and protocols set by the state election commission,” he said. The guidelines envisage meticulous sanitisation of 80,762 polling booths and it will be mandatory for poll officials to wear face masks and download Aarogya Setu application in their mobiles. Consumption of tobacco and spitting at public places will invite penal action. Polling officials, with help of police, home guards and gram chowkidars, will ensure voters follow social distancing norms while queuing up to exercise their franchise. Polling officials may, however, ask voters to remove masks in case of suspicion. All entry points to polling centres will have thermal scanners. In case body temperature of voters are found to be beyond the standard set by the health department, they would be given a token and asked to come in the final hour of polling. These voters will, however, be able to vote only after screening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/panchayat-poll-biggest-ballot-exercise-kicks-off-in-up-today/articleshow/82074463.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: No reason for AICC committee now to delay action, says Sachin Pilot||JAIPUR: Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Wednesday said the AICC committee formed to address issues like cabinet expansion and political appointments must act soon. The committee was formed during the political crisis in Rajasthan when Pilot and his loyal legislators rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot last year. The AICC committee and its utility has once again come into focus with the government appointing chairman and members of the state finance commission this week. The Pilot-camp, which was looking up to the committee to resolve its grievances related to political appointments and cabinet reshuffle, has begun to question its existence. The committee initially comprised AICC general secretaries KC Venugopal, Ahmed Patel and Ajay Maken. Patel, however, died last year. Maken earlier said that political appointments and cabinet reshuffle would take place after the bypolls in Rajasthan. Pilot, while talking to reporters at the PCC headquarters on Ambedkar Jayanti, pointed out that the bypolls and assembly elections in five states were about to get over and there appeared no reason for the AICC committee to delay decisions anymore on issues raised before it. In response to a question, Pilot said, “The state government has been making political appointments from time to time. I believe nearly two-and-a-half-year term of the government is now over. We have fulfilled many promises made in our party manifesto, but the promises that could not be fulfilled, needs to be met with greater speed in the remaining tenure. These include political appointments and cabinet expansion. I am sure the party and the government will reach a consensual opinion on this.” Pilot said, “The committee was formed nine months ago but unfortunately Ahmed Patel ji died and its work could not be completed. I am hopeful and confident the committee will not delay any more and there will be prompt action on issues that we raised and the consensus that was reached.” He added that the AICC committee was formed on the directions of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and that he has faith in her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-reason-for-aicc-committee-now-to-delay-action-says-pilot/articleshow/82073447.cms||---

He made a few demands for speedy vaccination and coverage of all age groups, such as allowing the state to buy vaccines independently, allowing the Serum Institute of India in Pune to sell its vaccine within the limit of regulation, and allowing private agencies to buy vaccines. He sought a nod for the Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corp and Hindustan Antibiotics to manufacture vaccines for the state.

Can’t there be a verification system online, or the use of Caller ID phone calls or a QR code system. At this time, how can a mid-sized understaffed private hospital spare staff to travel about 9km away to SVP for every critical patient for life-saving drugs,” asks Parag Rajyaguru, 43, a metallurgist, who has been making desperate attempts to get four remdesivir vials and tocilizumab for his father-in-law. “I cried, made desparate phone calls and even begged officials for help. In this age of technology, we are still asked to go along with people with papers to procure life-saving medication?”Bhavik Shah (name changed), who has been admitted to a private hospital in Chandkheda was prescribed remdesivir on Wednesday. His oxygen levels were dipping, and the injection was urgently needed but the hospital did not have any stock. “After having run from pillar to post, I finally managed two vials but paid thrice the price,” said a relative of Shah’s.When instances of remdesivir shortage are emerging every day not just in Ahmedabad but across the state, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) announced that some 4 lakh remdesivir vials have been distributed across the state from April 1-13.During the same period, according to AMC, some 24,962 dosages of Remdesivir were administered to Covid patients at Covid hospitals in the city this month.Private hospitals are told to get their supply of remdesivir injections from the distribution centre at SVP Hospital in Ellisbridge, by sending indent and details of patients. On a daily basis, 10,000 Remdesivir injections have been earmarked for use at private hospitals.Despite this assurance, the shortage prevails. Jashvant Patel, chairman, Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists’ Association (FGSCDA), said, “A few stockists are getting stock but it is rapidly flying off shelves as demand is high.

The police arrested the three suspects, including a scrap dealer, from Kudalwadi. A fourth suspect is absconding. The gang had stolen six vehicles from the different parts of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. A team, led by senior inspector Balkrishna Sawant, tracked the suspects with the help of GPS installed on one of the stolen trucks. Sawant said a resident of Bavdhan lodged an FIR on March 23 about the theft of his dumper parked along NDA-Pashan Road. “We also got information that another dumper was stolen from Warje Malwadi. We contacted the owner of that vehicle, who told us about the GPS installed in his dumper,” he said. The team tracked the dumper and found it at a scrap godown at Kudalwadi in Chikhali. “The complainant’s dumper was being dismantled when we reached the godown. We have arrested scrap dealer Akram Shaikh (43),” Sawant said. Shaikh revealed the names of Mahesh Phad (23) and Sidhhappa Dodmani (27), whom we have arrested. The duo and another accomplice used to steal the vehicles and sell it to Shaikh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-bust-gang-behind-thefts-of-heavy-vehicles/articleshow/82072628.cms||---

The numbers dropped significantly for the state too. On Tuesday, merely 2,18,827 vaccinations took place in the state, down from the average of 3.26 lakh daily. In the city, 43,234 people were vaccinated on Wednesday, taking the total count to nearly 18 lakh.

---||Kolkata||Communities ring in new year with prayers and quiet lunches||Kolkata: Since it is not the time for festivities and celebrations, many communities chose to ring in their new year on Wednesday with prayers and quiet lunches, avoiding the elaborate events that were planned earlier. Last year, some social clubs and associations had arranged for virtual celebrations but this time many of them planned not to go for it due to a fatigue factor. For the Malayalis of the city, Vishu Kani used to be a day full of promises and cheers and the evening would see community gatherings and feasts at different Samajams or associations for the occasion. “Last year this was replaced by virtual meets. Hundreds of people having moved back to Kerala this time, we did not have the online programmes,” said T K Gopalan, a prominent member of the Kolkata Kairali Samajam. Private tutor Urmila Nair decorated her traditional Kani or Krishna in yellow the previous evening and spent the new year praying to him for better times. “We offered ripe jackfruit, banana, ripe cucumber and everything yellow to the deity, signifying a successful harvest and golden times ahead. My wife cooked an elaborate Malayalee lunch containing pulissery, eriseri, payasam. We missed our daughter who married and shifted to Mumbai this year,” said T Ajay Kumar, adding that they spent a part of the day getting vaccinated for Covid. The story was more or less the same in Tamil homes too, where Puthandu was celebrated in a silent way. Families prayed to Lord Murugan fervently as they arranged their platter of ripe fruits and fresh vegetables on a tray and placed it in front of the mirror so that they reflected good times. Bharati Tamil Sangham is organising a virtual meet on Sunday, though the earlier enthusiasm is missing, said president Anant Padmanabhan.  “We had a quiet prayer and lunch that my wife Hemlata cooked with payasam, vadas, rasam and buttermilk,” he said. Most Assamese settled in the city prepared pithe and ladoos at home to ring in Rongali Bihu. New gamocha was brought out too. Assam Bhavan is keeping it brief on Thursday by hoisting the flag. No hall has been booked this time for the Bihu dance and only a modest jalpan will be arranged. “We are worried about Covid and keeping the celebration as safe and distanced as possible. But the cheer is missing everywhere. Most of us are keeping it to prayers and home-cooked delicacies,” said Bobi Bhardwaj of the Sodou Asom Lekhika Sararoh Samiti. For entrepreneur Bijay Lenka and his wife, Pana Sankranti was spent at home praying to Lord Jagannath and offering him the traditional bel sherbet, red chhena, banana, gur from sugarcane juice and milk. Lunch was a traditional affair in most Oriya homes with rice, ghee, dalma, potato and drumsticks, dahi etc. “We are definitely doing the rituals but we are not as happy as we used to be. We thought that the worst was over, but once again Covid is back to haunt us,” Lenka said. Visiting homes of friends is not possible now, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/communities-ring-in-new-year-with-prayers-and-quiet-lunches/articleshow/82072631.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Jaipur Transport Operators’ Association president Anil Arora said, “During the pandemic and subsequent lockdown, we sustained heavy losses as there was no business coming to us and a lot of transporters had to sell off their vehicles. Even when the restrictions had been lifted, we are still losing around 30% business. In this situation, if the government is thinking about allowing private buses to transport goods, then where are we supposed to go?” Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, however, said the order for the same was yet to be issued. The transporters claimed that they have to take permits for carrying goods and pay a fee for the same along with penalties for violations like overloading, while in buses there would be no such regulations, which they deemed unfair.“We will protest if this proposal is allowed to happen. The government needs to understand that already we are suffering due to high price of diesel in the state”, said a transporter. A few days ago, even the petrol pumps had shut for a day in Rajasthan as a mark of protest against the high VAT, which is being imposed on the fuel as compared to the neighbouring states. The transporters’ association had previously complained about the advance commercial tax which was being collected from them, but it had gone unheard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transporters-oppose-plan-to-ferry-goods-in-buses/articleshow/82073469.cms||---

The book release function was graced by a galaxy of legal luminaries including many Supreme Court judges from New Delhi online. Prominent among them included justices Uday Lalit, Ravindra Bhat, Rishikesh Roy and others. Justice Bhushan Gavai shared dais with Bombay high court Chief Justice Dipankar Dutta, Nagpur bench administrative judge Sunil Shukre and senior judge Zaka Haq. Many retired and sitting judges were present at the HC auditorium during the programme. Speaking on the occasion, Bobde said the country has seen many rulers over the centuries — Hindu, Mughals, British and others — but the judiciary in one or the other form always existed, although the justice delivery methods were different. “The judiciary has gone through transformation over the years and hence it is surviving, as it adapted to the modern needs of the society. The judiciary became progressive, while introducing new laws, repealing old ones and amending many,” he said. “With a view to reach the litigants, who find it difficult to communicate in English, we’ve decided to translate this book into various languages. It was a herculean task, but our team did it very efficiently and without losing out on the meaning. We would soon be launching this book in Bengali, Telugu and other languages,” said Bobde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cji-unveils-courts-of-india-books-marathi-version/articleshow/82073486.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||Relief For Class X, But Class XII Students Find Agony Prolonged||New Delhi: Parents and students heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday with the central Board of Secondary Education announcing the cancellation of the Class X exam and postponement of the Class XII exams. However, for most Class XII students, the postponement of the exams only means the extension of stress and anxiety about their future. Vivek, a Class XII science student of Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8, Rohini, wasn’t too happy. “The announcement came when I was feeling depressed,” he scowled. “But I wish now that we had prepared for them, CBSE had conducted the exams. I aspire to get into the National Defence Academy but the delay in board exams will reduce my NDA preparation time.” For Darshan Ram of Bluebells School International too, it was mixed feelings. “From a pure risk point of view, it’s a good decision because student congregations would surely create Covid hotspots. However, if we consider our future, or college admission, because there are no national internal assessment norms, it is possible that my school’s tougher internal assessment could give me a lower percentage than someone in another school.” Parent Manoj Sharma, whose daughter studies in Class XII at DPS, Mathura Road, felt it was high time the board came up with an alternative assessment system in consultation with stakeholders. “For this time, it is a very good decision because nothing is more important than our children’s lives. But cancelling and postponing exams will not work every time,” said Sharma. The board has said that it will review the situation of the exams on June 1. But that comes with its own worries. Ashok Dabbas, father of an Apeejay School, Pitampura, student, said, “My kid is worried now that the Class XII exams will be held along with other exams like CLAT and National Law University entrances.” While most Class X students and parents in the city breathed a sigh of relief, there were also parents such as Khurram Nwayab, whose ward goes to Delhi Public School, who believes that the exam should actually be conducted and finished off. “It is traumatising for the students to prolong the suspense,” he said. “The exams could be held with adequate precautions. Maybe, students can be called in smaller numbers and different question papers distributed. The board has a bank of them in any case. Postponing exams is not the solution the government should have thought of. Vaccinating the children was a better priority.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/relief-for-class-x-but-class-xii-students-find-agony-prolonged/articleshow/82073511.cms||Shradha Chettri

A police team led by senior inspector Rajendra Mokashi took the suspect Ravindra Avadhut into custody from his native village in Solapur district. “We have recovered booty worth Rs 1.3 lakh from the suspect,” Mokashi told TOI. On February 7 last year, Avadhut had taken Mohan Dhone and his wife out for a dinner in a restaurant. Avadhut told the couple that he would return with his children and returned after an hour. Post dinner, he dropped Dhone and his wife back home. “On return, Dhone found that his house was burgled. Avadhut’s involvement in the theft had come to the light after checking the CCTV footage,” inspector Sadashiv Gaikwad of Loni Kalbhor police said. Gaikwad said, “When Dhone confronted Avadhut, the latter accepted his involvement in the crime and returned a stolen silver idol,” Gaikwad said. Gaikwad further added that, when Avadhut did not return the remaining booty, Dhone lodged an FIR with the Loni Kalbhor police.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Some may relive trauma, anxiety of 2020 lockdown||MUMBAI: Stringent restrictions on movement could trigger anxiety among people who had faced trauma during the lockdown in 2020, mental health professionals fear. Individuals who were grounded with an abusive spouse or with a dysfunctional family last year are facing the very real possibility of having to relive it all over again. There is also a concern about how persons addicted to substances will cope. "I have had patients for whom staying outside their homes used to be a big relief, even if it meant sitting in cafes the entire day, as there was a lot of conflict within the family. Now with malls and restaurants shutting, these patients are petrified that a full-blown lockdown will restrict their movement completely," said psychiatrist and psychotherapist Dr Avinash De Sousa. With the surge in coronavirus infections, there is also the uncertainty of how much longer the lockdown could get extended. "A female patient was panic-stricken about how to deal with living indoors with her husband 24X7. She complained that he did no work and she couldnt deal with looking after the children as well," said psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada. Mental health professionals are concerned about how people having a previous history of emotional or psychological issues would cope. The ability to cope with difficult or stressful situations is compromised in people suffering from psychiatric disorders. "Someone whose mental health issues were resolved may even relapse if proactive measures are not taken," cautioned Mundada. The nature of curbs placed by the state government also has an impact. "Very stringent restrictions could cause people to hoard on substances to abuse," said senior psychiatrist Dr Yusuf Matcheswala. Restrictions on movement could be a major trigger for someone who associates it with losing a loved one to Covid-19 last year or being unable to bid a departed family member a proper farewell due to Covid-19 curbs on funeral arrangements. "If your coping mechanism is good, chances are you wouldn't have too many issues and would be able to handle even a tough situation," said Mundada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-some-may-relive-trauma-anxiety-of-2020-lockdown/articleshow/82072635.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Kolkata||Cop lens on Poila Baisakh crowds for Cov safety||Kolkata: Cops have decided to hit the streets in large numbers to implement safety norms during Poila Baisakh on Thursday. Apart from extensive naka checks, special teams will move around the Maidan-Nandan area and urge people to wear masks. Each police station has been asked to campaign on the safety measures to be undertaken by citizens during the second wave. Police stations like Burrabazar and Gariahat carried out awareness campaigns at local markets on Wednesday and distributed masks to those who were not wearing it. “We have begun campaigning through microphones at markets and outside complexes. We are asking the gated communities not to celebrate the Bengali New Year in a group as the second wave is more infectious. We are also asking people to wear masks, disinfect the common passage and elevators and restrict the entry of outsiders. At markets, it is important that everyone wears masks and maintains distancing,” said an officer. Wearing masks has been on a decline recently while some people don’t wear it properly. In the past week, cops have challaned 150 to 200 people daily. On Thursday, cops are unlikely to issue challans because it is the day of Bengali new year. Instead, cops will patrol the areas that draw crowds on Poila Baisakh and urge people to put on masks. Latest data shows that the virus is spreading in Ballygunge, Gariahat, Dover Lane, Garcha and the Dhakuria neighbourhoods. Similarly, the virus is spreading in the Phoolbagan-Kankurgachi-Beliaghata areas that are connected to Maniktala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-lens-on-poila-baisakh-crowds-for-cov-safety/articleshow/82072715.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

After Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath directed his health department officials to procure remdesivir, a state aircraft flew from Lucknow to Ahmedabad on Wednesday and returned with a consignment. Sources in Ahmedabad confirmed that a stock of remdesivir was sent to UP by the state government. On being asked, state government officials said, “I am not aware of any such development of remdesivir injections being sent.” According to officials in the Gujarat government, some 4 lakh vials of remdesivir have been distributed across the state from April 1-13. As the number of Covid-19 cases have shown increase, demand for the injection has risen. “Health department officials have been told to ensure there is no shortage of the drug in any district. The CM asked the health department to coordinate with district officials on current stock and replenishment. The department has spoken to pharma companies to ensure supply of the medicine to distributors for ready availability in the market,” a UP government spokesperson said.

However, it took another six hours for the 48-year-old to be eventually admitted to Civil Hospital as he had to spend more than five hours in a long queue of ambulances waiting to gain entry into the 1,200-bed Covid hospital. On Tuesday evening, the Juhapura resident, who was being treated at home for Covid-19, began having trouble breathing. His family and friends decided to get him hospitalised. They called EMRI 108 ambulance helpline at 9pm on Tuesday, and were assured that an ambulance would be sent over. When no vehicle arrived, they called up twice more through the night but got nothing except assurances. As public hospitals do not admit Covid-19 patients if they are not brought to hospitals in 108 ambulances, the family had no choice but to wait. “Around 5am on Wednesday, we got a call from the helpline desk. However, it only created more confusion,” said Shaikh’s wife, Gulruba. Then, at 9am, the family made three more calls to the helpline. Their wait ended just before noon when a 108 van arrived to take him to Civil Hospital. Gulruba accompanied him in the vehicle. She said, “An hour before he was admitted, they noted down details about my husband while he was kept waiting in the ambulance for hours.” Ravindra Parmar’s case was no different. Sources said that his family began calling the ambulance at 1.30pm on Tuesday. After repeatedly calling them for four hours, the ambulance reached his home in Naroda. The 30-year-old too had to wait in a long queue outside the Civil Hospital before he was taken in at 2am on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/15-hr-ambulance-wait-6-hrs-in-civil-queue/articleshow/82072763.cms||---

The state reported a 100% increase in active cases in just 18 days. On March 27, the state had just over three lakh active cases, which doubled to 6.12 lakh on Wednesday. The state had over 50% of the active cases in the country. The state showed a slight dip in daily detections, adding 58,952 cases. Fatalities numbered 278. The total caseload reached 35.7 lakh and the death toll touched 58,804. After a dip in the daily case count for two days, the city saw cases rise to 9,931 on Wednesday. Fatalities rose to 54, including 37 deaths of patients above 60 years of age and 15 between 40 and 60 years. “We increased the number of tests to 56,266, resulting in higher detections,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said. He said the daily positivity rate had been decreasing and was now at 17%. “It is a good sign and we hope to reach 10% positivity soon,” he said. The total number of cases in the city since March last year touched 4.4 lakh and the toll reached 12,140. With 9,000-plus cases being detected on average every day this month, and almost 10%-15% of them needing hospitalisation, the bed crunch in the city has worsened.

Two vials of remdesivir and Rs 13,000 were recovered from Sawant. Shewale said, "Sawant was working as a medical assistant with a nursing home in Bhavani Peth, which also treats Covid patients. Doctors there had prescribed six remdesivir injections to a woman patient, but Sawant secured the prescription and raised the number to eight injections. He then started contacting relatives of patients who needed the drug." Sawant has been booked on charges of cheating and provisions under the Food and Drug Administration Act. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta has formed 10 teams to check the black-marketing of Remdesivir vials in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nursing-home-staffer-held-for-trying-to-sell-remdesivir/articleshow/82072724.cms||Gitesh Shelke

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: I-T official acquitted after FIR delay in Pocso case||MUMBAI: An “unnatural” year-and-a-half delay in lodging an FIR has led to the acquittal of a 42-year-old deputy income-tax commissioner accused of sexually assaulting his 13-year-old domestic help in 2017. The special POCSO Act court questioned why the child’s family, a member of which was employed in the maternal house of the estranged wife of the accused for decades, did not lodge an FIR immediately after the incident. The accused and his wife are in the midst of divorce proceedings and the woman had lodged a domestic violence complaint against him. The accused had alleged that he was falsely implicated by the wife and her politically-connected family. The court observed that while it was probable the minor’s character would not have been put at stake merely because of a dispute between the accused and his wife, the conduct of the prosecution witnesses and inordinate delay in lodging the FIR created sufficient doubt in the prosecution’s case. The child, her sister and mother had alleged that they were threatened in their village after the incident. The accused was arrested in 2018 but granted bail. In 2016, the minor and her sister had come to the city to live with the accused and his wife so that they could help take care of their daughter. They were to join a school in the city and pursue studies. They went back to their village in 2017. The minor deposed that the accused threatened to release her nude pictures if she complained to anybody. The court pointed out that the minor had admitted that she would always latch the bathroom door before bathing. “So, it is unbelievable that accused had snapped nude photographs of the minor with his mobile phone. Even, if it is considered that the accused only threatened to make viral her nude photographs for molesting her, the question remains as to why the investigating officer had not made any inquiry or seized the phone of accused to verify if he has nude photographs of the minor,” the court said.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: SVP staffer held for illegal sale of drug||AHMEDABAD: City crime branch on Tuesday registered two cases for the illegal sale of remedesivir, an antiviral injection used to treat Covid-19 patients, and booked five persons including a male nurse at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (SVP) Hospital, his twin sister and a former employee of the hospital. In the first case, city crime branch sleuths got an input that a nurse at SVP, Akshar Vaza, 39, a resident of Gomtipur, was selling remedesivir which has been sourced by his former colleague at SVP, Hariom Lohar, 35, a native of Dungarpur, Rajasthan. Lohar got the injections from a pharmaceutical company based in Solan in Himachal Pradesh and began selling them for Rs 12,000 apiece, while the maximum retail price is around Rs 5,000, said a crime branch officer. According to the FIR, a crime branch cop posed as customer and spoke to Akshar seeking nine injections for an ailing relative. “Akshar told the cop to come to the gate of SVP Hospital on Tuesday night and when the cop went there, Akshar spoke to his sister Vidhi, 39, and then went on the cop’s motorcycle towards Akshar’s home in Gomtipur,” said the FIR. The FIR said that they went to the Shriramji no Khancho neighbourhood in Gomtipur where Vidhi arrived with nine vials and when they were handing them over, other sleuths who were undercover nabbed them. Later, police nabbed a third accused from Shahpur, and booked the three of them for cheating and criminal conspiracy along with charges under the Essential Commodities Act, Disaster Management Act and the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. In another case, Justin Pereira, a resident of Indraprasth Tower in Vastrapur, was caught by city crime branch from the city airport in a trap laid by cops on Tuesday afternoon with 35 remedesivir injections, worth Rs 1.89 lakh, manufactured by a pharmaceuticals company in Telangana. According to the FIR, cops received an input that Pereira was selling remedesivir injections illegally. The cops set up a decoy customer, from whom Pereria took Rs 25,500 in advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/svp-staffer-held-for-illegal-sale-of-drug/articleshow/82072757.cms||---
---||Pune||Concern, anger mount as Remdesivir shortage continues||Pune: There was widespread concern among city hospitals and families on Wednesday after officials reported that the district had not received fresh supplies of Remdesivir. The Food and Drug Administration said the district's allocation of the drug could improve by Thursday, considering the export ban the Union government put in place this week. Healthcare activists responded to the shortage in the district by demanding that allocation to each hospital should be made public. Currently, the state government has allotted the district only 14-15% of the share of remdesivir vials it gets primarily from four pharma companies. The state government is getting approximately 45,000 to 50,000 vials from the companies nearly every alternate day, officials said. "There was no allocation of vials on Wednesday. This is due to multiple factors, including the rising caseload in other parts of Maharashtra, and adjoining states. The Centre's curbs on export are likely to resolve the shortage within a day or two," said Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drugs), FDA, Pune. Healthcare activist Abhijit More questioned the transparency of hospital-wise vial allocation. "Big hospitals are hoarding vials and small hospitals are being left out. The FDA should make public the hospital-wise remdesivir allocation in Pune district." As per allotment norms, Pune district gets 6,300 vials - 15% percent of the 45,000 vials the state receives. "All other districts in Maharashtra have started reporting cases. So some of the stock has to be diverted to them," Pratapwar said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's (IMA) Hospital Board of India, said, "The non-availability of remdesivir led to confusion and chaos, especially among small hospitals and relatives of patients who are being treated at small facilities in the city."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/concern-anger-mount-as-remdesivir-shortage-continues/articleshow/82072743.cms||Umesh Isalkar

With the threat of the pandemic’s second wave looming large, many people took a break in the afternoon but came out in the evening to make the best of the Chaitra sale offers and discounts on the last day. New Market too saw decent sales, store owners said. Many of them have taken to e-sales where buyers can enter the shop’s portals virtually, choose and order products that will be delivered at home. The shop owners of New Market said they offered special discounts this year to encourage people to go on shopping physically and virtually. On the last few days there has been a spurt in sales, they said, praying that another lockdown should be clamped in the city again. The hawkers did brisk business outside New Market where shopping went on till late in the evening. “Last year comes back to haunt us. We are happy with what we managed to do this time. Most of our loyal customers bought like old times, though the process of buying has changed to the virtual mode,” said Vinay Mangalani, the owner of Bombay Silk Stores. The Gariahat hawkers offered masks to the customers, who did not wear it, along with blobs of hand sanitisers to those who just browsed and moved on. “We just pray to God that the markets remain open. Chaitra sale has seen a 30% growth compared to last month’s sale,” said Amar Koley who sells sari on the pavement next to Basanti Devi College. Some popular stores like Aparna, Bhojraj, Traders’ Assembly saw a surge in customers from the evening. However, efforts were made to maintain distancing and ensure the use of hand sanitisers and masks. “It is difficult to keep the mask on in this heat,” said Alo Paul, a senior citizen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/curtains-on-chaitra-sale-with-brisk-biz/articleshow/82072750.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The hospital will also have a 150-bed ICU with ventilators. Work on setting up this 900-bed Covid hospital has begun on a war footing, with assistance from the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO). The hospital will be reserved for patients who have tested positive in an RT-PCR test and need oxygen to maintain their oxygen saturation levels. A five-bed model has been set up in the main hall of the convention centre. The convention centre, which has so far hosted numerous exhibitions and events, sits on a 60-acre plot. It will now serve as a 900-bed full-service dedicated Covid hospital. Officials say the facility is being set up by a private player. The hospital will have 150 ICU beds and will likely start admitting patients by the end of the month. The carpeting has been removed and the centre is presently being cleaned and disinfected. According to the design prepared and displayed for approval, curtain walls will divide the facility into sections. Each section will have five or six beds and storage space for personal belongings and medicines. The main hall will serve as a Covid ward and the smaller exhibition hall will have a 150-bed ICU, which will have ventilators and oxygen supply. A dome will likely be erected at the main entrance for waiting relatives. Entry to the convention centre from the main gate at the Manav Mandir side will be closed and patients will be entered from the reception area which is near Gate 3. The main hall covers 47,000 square feet and there are smaller halls of 26,000 and 12,500 square feet.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt blames doctors, firms for remdesivir shortage||AHMEDABAD: The state government on Wednesday filed a report in the Gujarat high court saying that it has taken all measures for best medical care of Covid-19 patients and to curb spread of the diseases. On the issue of shortage of remdesivir, it said that black marketing is the outcome of pricing fixed by private companies. In response to HC query during hearing of a suo motu PIL on the recent upsurge in Covid cases, the principal secretary of health and family welfare department, Jayanti Ravi has explained the shortage of remdesivir and said that the over-prescription by doctors has led to this crisis. She has cited WHO saying, “There is no evidence that remdesivir improves survival in corona patients.” The government has claimed that black-marketing of remdesivir is taking place because of different MRPs by different companies. “Owing to a very wide diversity in MRPs fixed by all seven manufacturers, various evils like the hoarding, black-marketing, short-supply of the said injection have taken place”, the government said and added that it wrote to the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority, New Delhi, on Wednesday to examine the issue of different MRPs by different companies and do the needful. The government has stated that the price variation is from Rs 899 to Rs 5,400 per vial, and this has resulted in hoarding. The government has informed the HC of the distribution channel for remdesivir and said that it has purchased 1.71 lakh vials whereas private sector has bought 2.28 lakh vials in last few days. It also said that the police have started crackdown on black marketeers. The government has claimed that it is ramping up its RT-PCR testing capacity. It also claimed that Gujarat is much ahead in the country in this field. The testing is double per million in comparison with national average. Gujarat tests 2177.7 per million everyday as against 1014.42 per million in the country. It has positivity rate of 2.3 as against 5.28 in India.It also claimed that there is a facility of testing on demand and cited AMC’s initiative of drive-through which began on Wednesday only. As a measure to curb Covid spread, the principal secretary has stated on oath that Gujarat does very well in contact tracing and claimed that an average of 52 contacts per positive case are being traced as against the norm of 30 contacts per positive case. The HC has posted hearing on the issue on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-blames-docs-firms-for-remdesivir-shortage/articleshow/82072767.cms||---

There is a severe shortage of oxygen supply in all Covid hospitals,” the letter said. “Doctors are unable to treat the patients who need oxygen.” The letter, signed by AMA president Dr Kirit Gadhvi, secretary Dr Dhiren Mehta, and immediate past president Dr Mona Desai said that if the shortage persists, it could lead to a rise in the death toll. “Violence against doctors will increase, and doctors will be forced to shut down their hospitals due to the lack of oxygen supply,” the letter said. The members urged the CM to direct 100% of the oxygen supply to the healthcare sector “as human life should be a priority”. AMA officials told TOI that the majority of the smaller hospitals are facing an acute shortage of oxygen. A member said that right from manufacturing to distribution, several issues have been flagged to the authorities. “There should be a central committee that can address these lacunae,” said the member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/direct-100-oxygen-to-hospitals-ama-to-cm/articleshow/82072764.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Forest fire claims 8th life in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: A retired Uttarakhand government employee trying to help put out a forest fire was charred to death on Tuesday — the eighth such death this season. Raghuveer Lal, 65, a former public works department man, was just done with the first round of work on his farm at Gadoli village in Chamoli when he noticed a blaze in the Soniyaala forest area. He rushed there, hoping to help. But after he got there, within minutes the fire surrounded him and he could not get out. “A villager from Gadoli, Vinod, came running to tell us a man had been burnt in the forest fire. Before he was charred to death, he had actually helped in dousing the fires,” SHO of Gairsain police station Subhash Jakhmola said. But by the time they got there, it was too late. He succumbed to the burns. Area ranger Pradeep Gaur said, “Around 9am some unidentified persons are believed to have caused the fire.” It was not clear why. Chief conservator of forests (nodal officer of forest fires) Man Singh said, “The state forest department is yet to take stock of the incident.” Since January this year, Uttarakhand has lost eight lives to wildfires — five in Kumaon and three in Garhwal. So far, about 2,800 hectares of forest cover has been gutted across the state in over 2,000 wildfire incidents. The treacherous landscape makes it difficult to continue with fire control operations. But this season has been especially bad because of how dry it has been and how the wind has been behaving. “This time, the main challenge we are facing is wind. Its direction keeps changing,” Rudraprayag divisional forest officer Vaibhav Singh said. On Tuesday, he added, some 25 people had to be deployed to control a fire in the Rudraprayag forest division. And just as they thought the fire was nearly under control, the winds changed direction and started feeding the inferno afresh. “We don’t know why it is so this time, but it is acting as an obstacle in controlling the fires.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/forest-fire-claims-8th-life-retd-govt-employee-dies-trying-to-douse-blaze/articleshow/82071623.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Pune||Intense rain spell causes drop in temperature||Pune: Certain areas in the city received a short but intense spell of convective rainfall on Wednesday, mainly due to a cyclonic circulation over northwest Madhya Pradesh and neighbourhood as well as local heating caused by high day temperatures. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Shivajinagar received 0.4 mm rainfall between 8.30am and 8.30pm on Wednesday. During the same period, Lohegaon received 1 mm rainfall. Before it rained on Wednesday, the day temperature in Shivajinagar was 36.2 degrees Celsius and in Lohegaon was 36.5 degrees C. The rain spell, however, caused the mercury to plunge in the city by Wednesday evening. The real feel temperature in the city on Wednesday evening was 26 degrees C, as per a private weather forecaster. The sky had started to get cloudy late on Wednesday afternoon in Pune and the spell of rain followed soon after. The meteorological department on Wednesday also forecast isolated rainfall with thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds (30-40 kmph) over Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada and Konkan as well as Goa during the next 48 hours and over Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh between April 14 and 18 due to wind discontinuity at lower tropospheric levels. Isolated hailstorm also occurred over Madhya Maharashtra on Wednesday, including at Wathar near Koregaon, Satara. An IMD official told TOI, “Trough/wind discontinuity at lower tropospheric level has been causing moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal over parts of Maharashtra. This, coupled with local heating, is causing convective showers.” Kolhapur, Hingoli, Nanded and Latur are also likely to witness thunderstorm activity with lightning and rain at isolated places on Thursday. Akola, Amravati, Bhandara, Buldhana, Chandrapur, among other places in Vidarbha can expect light to moderate rainfall at isolated places during the next few days. The IMD’s forecast for Pune on April 15 predicted partly cloudy sky becoming generally cloudy towards the afternoon/evening. The day temperature on Thursday is likely to be 37 degrees C in Pune, while night temperature may hover around 19 degrees C.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/intense-rain-spell-causes-drop-in-temperature/articleshow/82072769.cms||---

---||Delhi||Safety comes first: CM, educators laud CBSE’s move||New Delhi: Principals, educators and Delhi’s political leadership all hailed the decision of Central Board of Secondary Education to cancel the Class X examinations and postpone the Class XII boards. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal expressed relief at the decision, tweeting, “I am glad that the exams have been cancelled/postponed. This is a great relief for lakhs of parents and students.” On Wednesday, Kejriwal had requested CBSE to find an alternative assessment process. The education board has said it will develop an objective criterion to determine the Class X performance. If any student remains unsatisfied with such an assessment, he or she could sit for re-examination, whenever held. Tania Joshi, principal, of The Indian School suggested the pre-board marks could be form the basis for assessment. “Class X students moving to Class XI are mostly within the school, so it isn’t a big problem. Their board exam marks used to help students choose their stream,” said Joshi. “But that can be done on the basis of pre-boards, which is conducted in every school in a strict manner and with great transparency.” Padma Srinivasan, principal, Delhi Public School, RK Puram, said the cancellation of the Class X exams was the most viable in these unprecedented times. “It minimises the risk of infection among students, teachers, school employees and their immediate families.” As for the Class XII exams, CBSE has said it will review the situation on June 1. The new date sheet would be published 15 days in advance of exams to aid students in their preparation. However, some principals doubted whether the pandemic would allow holding of the exams. A K Jha, principal, Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8, Rohini, suggested an alternative. “For Class XII candidates, CBSE should instruct schools to give marks to students based on the best of the previous three years of their performance. For example, if a particular school had the highest mark of 95 in the past three years, that should be the highest score awarded this year. The logic is that the institutional percentage and percentile should remain the same more or less.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/safety-comes-first-cm-educators-laud-cbses-move/articleshow/82073544.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Ahmedabad||HC lawyers demand cap on medical charges||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat High Court Advocates Association (GHAA) on Wednesday filed an intervention application in the suo motu PIL on Covid-19 and urged the court to pass a slew of directions to the authorities, to control the situation. GHAA demanded that there be a cap on fees charged by doctors and hospitals for oxygen, injections and other medicines. It says that for 15-30 days, such reasonable restrictions may be placed on the doctors’ fundamental right to practise their profession in the public interest. This will reduce the financial pressure on relatives of Covid patients. Treatment charges at private hospitals have “gone through the roof”. The petitioner demanded video call facilities at all public hospitals, from where government doctors can cater to more Covid patients and thereby save their money. GHAA urged the HC to form a Standing Advisory Committee (SAC) of experts and people from NGOs working with the poor, who can review and suggest measures to control the Covid-19 pandemic. It said that government officials are not experienced enough to deal with the pandemic and the government should be asked to take help from experts on communicable diseases. The government must not be dependent on the views of officials. The lawyers stated that some of the government’s strategies show that it lacks vision and needs guidance from experts. Requesting the court to allow it to join the litigation, GHAA has objected to the present system where a patient cannot be admitted to government hospitals if they are not brought there by an EMRI 108 ambulance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-lawyers-demand-cap-on-medical-charges/articleshow/82072779.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bhowanipore, New Alipore new hotspots in 2nd wave||Kolkata: The health department at Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has identified fresh hotspots that have emerged in the second wave of Covid-19 so that it can line up intensive measures to combat further spread of the virus. According to civic officials, the worst-affected zones include Burrabazar-Jorasanko, Sealdah-Entally-Beliaghata, Bhowanipore-Elgin Road, New Alipore-Tollygunge, Behala and Garia-Patuli. “We have recorded 170 positive cases from New Alipore in the past two weeks and 150 positive cases in the 10 days. Many are suffering from fever and displaying Covid-like symptoms in these localities,” said a civic health official. Among the Bhowanipore localities, reeling under Covid cases, are Paddapukur Road, Justice Dwarkanath Road, Chakraberia (north) Road, Allenby Road, Elgin Road, Bakulbagan Road and sections of Sarat Bose Road. New Alipore residents who have tested positive include children too, a civic official said. Sources said a resident of Deshapran Sashmal Road in Tollygunge, who had tested positive a few days ago, died on Tuesday. Former civic coordinators Asim Bose and Jui Majumdar Biswas representing Bhowanipore (ward 70) and New Alipore (ward 81) have started doing rounds of affected areas and coordinating with KMC health workers to urge residents to adhere to Covid protocols. The sharp rise in number of people suffering from Covid symptoms in the Garia-Patuli belt has resulted in lengthy queues before Covid-testing centres. According to a KMC borough XI health official, besides attending to residents from Garia-Patuli belt, a civic clinic at Atabagan (Garia) has also been arranged for rapid antigen tests for Rajpur-Sonarpur residents as the belt is witnessing a jump in Covid cases. KMC health workers are also keeping a vigil on large areas located off the Bypass that had recorded a large number of Covid-19 cases last year. Fearing the situation may go out of control for the civic body if strict anti-Covid measures are not adopted, the KMC top brass has formed borough-wise teams to do the rounds of affected areas to take stock of the situation and suggest remedial measures. “Besides taking up the sanitization drive afresh in the affected zones, we have also decided to ramp up tests in boroughs,” said a KMC official. Last year, KMC had started swab collection in four-five boroughs. This year, it has decided to start swab collection in all 16 boroughs. “We have kept a fleet of vans that will collect the samples in cold chain and deliver them to SSKM and medical college for RT-PCR tests. The civic brass has also ordered the re-activation of ward-wise urban primary health centres to identify patients with Covid-like symptoms so that they can be tested and virus cases detected early.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bhowanipore-new-alipore-new-hotspots-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/82072771.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||With vax in short supply, priority given to 2nd dose||Kolkata: Vaccination will remain suspended a day before and after the election date in hospitals and inoculation sites, located in areas where the polls are due to be held. Announcing this at a meeting with hospitals on Wednesday, health department deputy secretary Joly Chaudhuri asked all vaccination sites to focus on administering the second dose to recipients who have received their first jab seven weeks ago. Due to a short supply of both Covaxin and Covishield, hospitals have been asked to ‘rationalize’ use for the next few days. While south and north Kolkata constituencies go to polls on April 26 and 29 respectively, Salt Lake and New Town will vote on April 17. This would lead to a suspension of vaccination in the satellite townships from April 16 to 18 while south Kolkata will see no inoculation between April 25 and 27. North Kolkata will not have vaccinations from April 28-30. Private hospitals that have been reeling under a vaccine shortage for the last 4-5 days, said this would give them a much needed breather and help to build up stocks that have been slow to arrive. Peerless Hospital, for instance, received just 4 vials of Covaxin for first doses on Wednesday. It used its old stocks to administer first doses and would remain shut on Thursday since there would be no fresh supply. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) received 15 Covishield vials on Wednesday, all of which were used for second doses. “Due to a shortage of vaccine supplies, we have been advised to rationalize its use. With limited availability of vials, the primary focus should now be on second dose with limited quantity to be administered for the first dose. We have been told that the preferred timeline for the second dose would be seven weeks from the first dose and, accordingly, suitable priority needs to be given to beneficiaries coming as per this timeline for their second dose,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. At AMRI Hospitals, 235 were vaccinated, with 207 vaccinations taking place at its Dhakuria unit and 28 at its Mukundapur unit. At AMRI Dhakuria, 103 people received Covaxin as first dose, including 42 senior citizens, 61 from the age group of 45-59. Twenty-one people received Covaxin as second dose, including 18 senior citizens and three from the 45-59 age group. Meanwhile, three lakh doses of Covishield vaccine arrived in Kolkata on an AirAsia flight from Pune on Wednesday afternoon. This is the second consignment of vaccines to land in Kolkata this week. Earlier on Monday, 4 lakh doses of Covishield had reached the city after more than two months' hiatus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-vax-in-short-supply-priority-given-to-2nd-dose/articleshow/82072797.cms||---

Hospitals said that with shrinking supplies many vendors have started charging a premium under labels of transportation and labour. The owner of a Goregaon hospital said the cost of refilling a single jumbo oxygen cylinder has tripled to Rs900. “Before Covid, it used to be Rs250, which rose to Rs600 during the first peak, before settling at Rs350. Now, the rate is Rs900,” he said. “But I don’t mind paying the extra price as long as supply is seamless,” he added. The head of a Malad hospital that needs up to 120 jumbo cylinders refilled in a day said he had to pay a deposit of Rs60,000 for the 20 additional cylinders he added to his stock recently. “The vendor has told us that he is paying more to source it and hence he is charging us,” he said. The doctor added that there has been no change in prices of liquid oxygen supply so far. Dr Amit Thadani of Niramaya Hospital in Kharghar said that hospitals that don’t have liquid oxygen installations have to rely heavily on jumbo cylinders. “Some hospitals have paid up to Rs2,500 to refill a single jumbo cylinder that used to cost Rs350 before the surge. Many smaller hospitals are struggling to get refills on time,” he said. Thadani spent a few anxious hours on Tuesday morning when he had oxygen stocks left for only two hours and more than 40 patients on oxygen support. “I got in touch with the local corporation, which could luckily arrange the supply,” he said. The ministry of chemicals and fertilizers had in September last year capped the ex-factory price of liquid medical oxygen at the manufacturers’ end at Rs 15.22/CUM exclusive of GST and ex-factory cost of medical oxygen cylinderat filler end at Rs 25.71/CUM exclusive of GST, subject to transportation cost fixation at state level, for six months. Thadani said vendors have retained the capped prices but hiked other heads such as transportation cost and labour charges. Dr Shilpa Ambekar, head of LifeLine Medicare Hospital in Kandivli said they rely on jumbo cylinders for beds that were newly created and don’t have a central line connection. “The other day we sent our tempo to Khopoli and few other places to get refilled,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-prices-for-purchase-refilling-of-jumbo-oxygen-cylinders-triple/articleshow/82073592.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Domestic passenger traffic to dip 17% in April||MUMBAI: Domestic passenger traffic is likely to witness a month-on-month drop of 15%-17% in April, said credit rating agency ICRA in a report released on Wednesday. Shubham Jain of ICRA said, “The average daily number of passengers departing in March 2021 stood at 2.49 lakh. From April 6 to April 11, domestic passenger traffic dipped by 11%-12% compared to the March average. With rising Covid cases and fresh restrictions in many states till April 30, domestic passenger traffic is expected to be lower by 15%-17% month-on-month in April 2021.” Domestic passenger traffic was on the rise since May 25 last year when flights resumed after lockdown. Consequently, domestic traffic was expected to grow at 125% in FY2022 after an estimated drop of 61% in FY2021, said ICRA. But the second wave and the restrictions it brought about has altered those projections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-domestic-passenger-traffic-to-dip-17-in-apr/articleshow/82073630.cms||V Manju

A note issued by the examination controller of the university, said, “The competent authority of JMI — seeing the situation of covid-19 and taking into account the safety and well-being of the students — has postponed the annual board examination 2020- 21 of Class X and XII with immediate effect.” It added, “This postponement is on the lines of postponement of CBSE exams based on the directives of the Prime Minister and minister of education.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-the-lines-of-cbse-jamia-also-postpones-examinations/articleshow/82073586.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||3 tests/minute at GMDC drive-through facility||Ahmedabad: Three tests were conducted every minute at the drive-through facility at GMDC ground set up by the civic body in partnership with Neuberg Supratech laboratory. On day one of the drive-through facility, a total of 2,200 samples were collected at GMDC ground. The laboratories and AMC had set up 10 counters for cars and two walk-in counters where those on two-wheelers could get themselves tested. To save time, the laboratory has decided that once the person registers on the website, he can drive through directly to the counter allotted, and give his/her samples. On day 1, people had to scan a QR code for registration. They have done away with this in the updated software. Businessman Rajesh Shah, who had come with his father and his wife, said that it was a good facility and one would feel safe too. “Standing in a queue, I would not be sure if the person standing next to me is infected or not. The drive-through is safer as you are not exposed to other people,” said the Satellite resident. Chintan Patel, a bank employee living in Satellite, said, “Though the facility was set up late, it is a good one. One had to wait for 25-odd minutes before he could drive out. This time needs to be reduced. AMC and the laboratory should set up more such counters.” A resident of Ghatlodia was upset that the AMC was charging Rs 800 for the test. “The AMC and the laboratory should give some financial relief as one has to drive down to give samples. The organisers should also ensure that they accept debit or credit card. They can allow people to pay through digital wallets or other online methods at the time of registration. This will help them save more time too,” he said. Officials said they say a huge rush in the morning which meant that people had to wait for 40-50 minutes to complete the process. This came down to 20 minutes in the afternoon when the crowd thinned. “Samples will be collected for 12 hours – from 8am with a break for an hour at 1pm. The report will be generated within 24-36 hours and shared through WhatsApp, SMS, or email.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3-tests/minute-at-gmdc-drive-through-facility/articleshow/82072985.cms||---

They are trained on the theme of orientation, motivation, and presentation.” Dr Joshi added: “Care is taken to ensure that they are not infected during their shifts.” Civil Hospital authorities said that over 1,100 patients have been discharged in April so far. The authorities, however, did not reveal the discharge rate. Experts said that for the past three days, the MediCity campus has been admitting over 250 patients every day. Under criticism for long queues of ambulances outside the hospital, the authorities on Wednesday said that the queues don’t have anything to do with efficiency. “The hospital is working at its full capacity,” said Dr Rajnish Patel, additional medical superintendent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/60-intern-docs-join-covid-duty-at-civil/articleshow/82072808.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Good for average pupils, bad for hardworking ones: Parents||By: Piyush Sarna CHANDIGARH: The city gave a mixed response to the decision of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to cancel the board exams of Class X, with some welcoming it and others calling it unjustified. Kamalpreet Singh, a resident of Kharar, said “My niece was working hard day and night to achieve a good score this year. This decision might be favourable for average students but for those who work really hard, it is unjustified. If election rallies and Kumbh Mela can take place, what's the issue with holding the exams?” Nitin Goyal, president, Chandigarh Parents Association, said, “Children have already gone through the syllabus and put in their hard work while appearing for pre-board exams. While the hospitals have also closed OPDs, it cannot be fair to force students to appear in board exams.” Durgesh Jha, a resident of Chandigarh, said “I have two nephews; and one of them is in class Xth and the other in Class XII. This decision is completely unjustified for children who work hard the whole year for good marks. I believe that postponing the exams would have been better.” Another parent, however, said the CBSE has taken the right decision as the health of the children is important as they are the future of this country. Meanwhile, the CBSE officials have made it clear that any student who is not satisfied with the marks allocated, he or she will be given an opportunity to sit in an exam when the conditions are conducive to hold them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/good-for-avg-pupils-bad-for-hardworking-ones-parents/articleshow/82072778.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Congress ex-minister, who lost to Sukhbir twice, joins Akali Dal||JALALABAD: Congress suffered a setback in Malwa on Wednesday as senior party leader and former minister Hans Raj Josan, along with hundreds of his supporters, joined the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in the presence of SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal. Welcoming Josan into the party fold during an event organised by the former Congress minister at his village Bandi Wala in Jalalabad constituency, Sukhbir said the party had been further strengthened in the Malwa region. He also appointed Josan as the party general secretary on the occasion. Josan had remained two-time minister in the Congress government, first in 1992-1997, then in 2002-2007 and also served as chairman of Punjab Leather Board in the past. He had also unsuccessfully contested against Sukhbir Badal in 2009 and 2012. Josan resigned from the post of chairman, district planning board, on Tuesday to join the Akali Dal. Josan’s son Harpreet Josan, who also joined the SAD with dozens of youth activists, also quit the Punjab Youth Congress, which he was serving as a general secretary. Acknowledging the political experience of Josan, the SAD president assured to field him in the forthcoming assembly polls. Josan said he was impressed with the vision and approach of Sukhbir Badal towards the development of the state. “I have seen him working day and night for the development of the state, particularly Jalalabad constituency. Impressed, I opted to join the SAD and work under him,” he added. He said Punjab is having a headless government, with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh displaying zero interest in governance. “People of Punjab now repent the day they voted for Captain Amarinder Singh in 2017. The Congress government’s days in office are numbered,” Josan said. He also appreciated Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal for quitting the Union cabinet in protest against the three farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-ex-minister-who-lost-to-sukhbir-twice-joins-akali-dal/articleshow/82073574.cms||Dinesh K Sharma
---||Nagpur||Maha Vikas Aghadi govt lockdown package is ‘mere eyewash’: Devendra Fadnavis||NAGPUR: Terming the Rs5,300 crore lockdown package announced by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for helping the poor as “mere eyewash”, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday said the government had miserably failed to increase beds, ventilators and other facilities required for the Covid-19 patients on urgent basis. He blamed Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for miserably failing to provide relief to citizens of Maharashtra. Speaking on his arrival in the city, the former CM said that the Thackeray government didn’t know that Maharashtra existed beyond Mumbai and Pune. “Absolutely no efforts are taken to increase facilities or upgrade the medical infrastructure in cities like Nagpur and Nashik. Even last time when the pandemic was at peak, the government did nothing for other districts. I came to Nagpur to help out the people and would be staying here for the purpose.” Pointing out loopholes in the CM’s package, the Southwest Nagpur MLA said Rs3,300 declared to fight Covid-19 pandemic was a part of the state budget which will be spent in one year. “A maximum of this amount would be contributed by the central government towards various schemes, while the state hasn’t provided anything from its kitty. This Rs3,300 crore should be used immediately to boost the health infrastructure, including beds, ventilators and other medical equipment.” Accusing the Thackeray government of ignoring the farmers, farm labourers, hairdressers, florists and small traders from the package benefits, Fadnavis said the MVA administration was misleading the people in the name of financial allocation. “In various schemes like for senior citizens and Shravan Bal, the state is only advancing payments, which are disbursed by the centre. It isn’t adding any additional money into it. The CM announced Rs4,000 for the tribals, but the government had failed to release their last year’s package of Rs2,000 till date. Even this Rs4,000 was already allotted under the Khawti scheme to them.” Explaining on food grains being provided under the Food Security Act, the opposition leader said the MVA government had left out over one crore people from its jurisdiction who would suffer during the restrictions. “All these poor people couldn’t be included in the food security due to blunders committed during the survey in 2011. We had expected that with lockdown, the government would take care of all constituents, who required help. But, there’s nothing for most of them.” According to him, the government’s priority should have been improvement in the healthcare system, even if lockdown is necessary. “Priority should be given to the availability of ventilators, Remdesvir, oxygen, oxygenated beds as well as simple beds. The government declared Rs1,000 for licensed street vendors, but only Mumbai and Thane have most of them. Restrictions are okay, but the government needs to take care of all sections of the society, else it will adversely affect the population,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mva-govt-lockdown-package-is-mere-eyewash-fadnavis/articleshow/82072814.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Sceptical of govt help, migrants head home||NAGPUR: “We are outsiders...who knows if Maharashtra government’s welfare scheme covers workers from other states also,” says Naseem Malik, a migrant worker from West Bengal. He was among a group of nearly 20, who worked at a factory in Latur, at Nagpur railway station waiting to board Ahmedabad-Howrah Express to reach home in Bengal. Once bitten, twice shy, those like Naseem did not want to take any chances after last year’s experience. “During the first lockdown, I was stranded in Mumbai and had to spend Rs12,000 along with others to hire a bus and reach home,” he said. For many TOI met, including Naseem, Rs12,000 was a month’s wage. On the eve of new lockdown, which restricts movement of public in general once again, migrant workers were seen rushing to their home states. The Rs5,500 crore package announced by Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray made a little impact on the fleeing. The migrants preferred to reach home instead. The general notion was no relief would be reaching them. Mohamed Ehsaan was resting at the bridge connecting platforms with his friends. Street vendors selling T-shirts, they were heading for Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. “What we earned has been sent home and some amount was spent on buying new stock. There is lockdown here, so we are leaving for Tirupati. There are no curbs in that state,” said Ehsaan from Bulandshahr in UP. Next to him sat Riyazuddin from Bhopal with his family, which included women and children. And they had the same story to tell. Both shared their experiences of the previous lockdown. Traditional makers of bass instruments like drums and dafli, they were here since Holi, but had little luck this time, he says. They were going back to Bhopal. Two days ago, railway station had only a handful passengers. On Wednesday, the rush was evident. With belongings packed in small shoulder bags, the migrants sat in small group. Most of these workers reached Nagpur in buses or trains from Pune, Latur, Solapur to even nearby towns like Wadasa Desaiganj, Jamb in Wardha district and were heading to Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha or neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. One again, Nagpur served as a transit hub and there were same stories about paltry wages and a bleak future. Almost every worker TOI contacted said his wages were not more than Rs12,000 to Rs13,000 a month. Bipin Majhi, who worked at a brick kiln in Latur, said he got Rs13,000 and it was Rs6,000 for his wife. After a few months, they could manage to save Rs20,000. They wanted to reach home before the situation worsened. Some distance away, despite sweltering heat, workers sat patiently in buses parked along Kamptee Road. Others waited in a queue outside to enter as the conductor called out each name. Those taking the buses were heading towards Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. On being asked, many said they were leaving for a personal reason. Marriage was the stock answer as others standing by admitted they were all leaving due to lockdown. There were workers from other states also. Noorul Hasan, a textile unit worker in Tamil Nadu, was going to Allahabad. “Who knows... they will clamp a lockdown even there... like last year,” he said. For Hassan, who has been in Tamil Nadu for two decades, he continues to live on meagre wages. There were others from Telangana scrambling towards their hometowns for the same reason.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sceptical-of-govt-help-migrants-head-home/articleshow/82072818.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Ahmedabad||Class X Gujarat board optional papers deferred||AHMEDABAD: The state education department is firm on its decision to conduct board exams for Class 10 students and does not have any plans to cancel them like Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The government may, however, defer the examination, but won’t cancel it, said sources in the education department. On Wednesday, the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) said in a notification that exam dates of optional subjects have been deferred and will now be held after the main board exams. Faced with mounting pressure from the Centre to defer the CBSE board exams scheduled for next month, the central education ministry on Wednesday announced cancellation of Class 10 exams. For Class 12, the ministry said it will review the situation on June to decide fresh dates. Maharashtra and Rajasthan have also decided to postpone Class 10 and Class 12 board exams given the worsening Covid-19 situation. Rajasthan Board of School Education (RBSE) has also announced to promote students of Class 8, 9 and 11 without holding any annual examinations. In Gujarat, Class 10 and Class 12 board exams are scheduled from May 10 to May 25. As many as 17.5 lakh students participated in the board exams last year and this time the numbers are expected to be higher. The All Gujarat Vali Mandal, an association of parents of schoolchildren, has made representations to Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani to postpone the board exams to June. The results of Class 10 for CBSE will be prepared on the basis of an objective criterion to be developed by the Board. Any candidate who is not satisfied with the marks allocated to him/her on this basis will be given an opportunity to sit in an exam as and when the conditions are conducive to hold the exams, the ministry said on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/class-x-gujarat-board-optional-papers-deferred/articleshow/82072825.cms||---

The fine is Rs 5,000. A second-time violation will also cost the same amount, but the water connection will be disconnected if a violator is caught for the third time. The teams will be on the lookout for violators from 5.30am to 8.30am. The special drive will continue till June 30. The MC said since the two-and-a-half months are of peak summer and leads to increase in requirement of potable water, the effort is to stop the use of maximum water for non-potable purposes. A copy of the order, which is with TOI, reads, “The teams shall function under the overall supervision of the executive engineers of the MC’s public health department. For arriving at some decision and for resolving some dispute, the SDE in-charge of the team may consult him. Daily report will be sent to the senior officer before 10am. Material confiscated or recovered from defaulters shall be kept by the SDE concerned.” Municipal commissioner K K Yadav said, “Water is an essential commodity and needs to be judiciously used by everybody. I request people of Chandigarh for better management of water by avoiding its unnecessary wastage.” Since 2018, the engineering department has issued 596 challans for water wastage and received Rs 12.82 lakh. Most challans were issued in 2018, yielding the highest fine amount of Rs 7.84 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pay-rs-50k-fine-if-caught-wasting-water-from-today/articleshow/82071664.cms||Deepak Yadav

The woman, a Thane resident, is a consultant with an insurance company.  It was last week that the woman, while going through her account statement, found a transaction of Rs 7,900 for which she had received a message from her bank. So, she took to the netbanking account but it got locked due to which she looked up the Internet for the bank’s customer care number. She got a toll-free number which she dialled, but did not get connected. She found another number which she dialled, but it got disconnected soon after. She then received a call from another number, states the woman’s police complaint. The caller, who the police said was a fraudster, identified himself as the bank’s executive. “This caller accused told her that her account would be closed and to avoid that he asked her to download a certain app, and share the one-time password so that he could solve the issue,” said a police officer. Soon after, Rs 6.7 lakh had been debited to her account. A police officer said online fraudsters use phone apps that help them trick customers or use remote access software to cheat clients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-bank-exec-dupes-woman-of-rs-7-lakh/articleshow/82074522.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

During the first wave of the pandemic last year, Surat had set an example by setting up community isolation centres (CICs) for asymptomatic patients but later closed these as cases started to decline in the city. “As a unique model, Surat has shown exceptional resilience through CICs. Altogether 25 such centres with total 1,200 beds and 208 Beds with oxygen have been provided with medicines and other support by the SMC,” municipal commissioner, Surat, Banchhanidhi Pani tweeted on Wednesday. “We are in the process to restart our CIC in the next three days. First, we are creating a 25-bed facility and more beds would be added later. A team of doctors from our Ahir community will provide free 24X7 service at the centre and SMC would supply essential medicines and other required services,” RH Hadia, coordinator, Ahir community's Isolation Centre, told TOI. “Unlike previous years, the scenario is different this year. The Covid-19 patients need oxygen support at isolation centres which was not the case last year. We are trying to get through the civic body and private suppliers,” said a community leader, who manages the centres. These centres provide basic medical facilities and some of the centres are also providing oxygen facilities. But if the patients’ condition worsens, they are immediately shifted to a hospital for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/community-reopens-isolation-centre-with-1200-beds-in-surat/articleshow/82071685.cms||---

North Delhi Municipal Corporation, too, plans to make necessary arrangements by Thursday and introduce a helpline number. The move comes after residents and residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) have made consistent appeals to the civic bodies and the administration for communication on the list of infected people. “Due to the sudden increase in Covid-19 cases, the SDMC concessionaire has started a centralised toll-free number, 011-40988800, for Covid garbage collection,” said a resident. Sanjay Rana, president of Greater Kailash-II RWA, said they had already started circulating the number. “It seems there is a communication gap between the administration and the municipality, leading to the delay in garbage collection. As a result, either we had to call the concessionaire multiple times or contact civic officials. This has forced us to demand a concrete solution,” he said. A north corporation official said the number of their deputy health officers and zonal offices were available on its website “We have planned to reappoint nodal officers in six zones, in addition to reactivating a helpline number to deal with such issues,” he said. For the time being, the corporation is sharing the number of infected people with the biomedical concessionaire as soon as it receives any update from Delhi government, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmcs-helpline-for-picking-waste-from-houses-of-covid-ve/articleshow/82073668.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||India||Bilateral sanctions illegal, will deliver S-400 as planned: Russia||NEW DELHI: Russia and India remain committed to the agreement for procurement of S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the latter and will adhere to the timeline for its delivery, Russia said on Wednesday even as the US threat of sanctions still looms over India for the proposed purchase. The US has so far refused to rule out a waiver for India from the CAATSA (Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) sanctions leading to speculation that India could delay the procurement. Russian ambassador to India Nikolay Kudashev said though that both countries were committed to the timely delivery of the weapon system. While talking about the outcome of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s visit to India, Kudashev and the deputy chief of mission, Roman Babushkin, also said Russia’s ties with Pakistan stand on “their own merit’’ and that Moscow had only ``limited’’ cooperation with Islamabad on counter-terrorism and under SCO. Babushkin said Russia was following the situation at LAC and that it would continue to encourage disengagement efforts by India and China and to promote ``constructive and forward-looking dialogue’’ which was a precondition for regional stability. He said Russia would also encourage India and China to take advantage of multilateral platforms like BRICS, SCO and RIC to resolve their differences. “On S-400 and other broader agreements, both sides are committed to the agreed timelines. This commitment is being successfully fulfilled to the best of my knowledge,’’ said Kudashev. “Together with India, we do not recognise bilateral sanctions as they are illegal tools of unlawful and unfair, should I say, competition, pressure and even blackmail. It was clearly stated by the two foreign ministers in the course of their exchange,” added the ambassador. However, while India continues to emphasise before the Russians that Indo-Pacific is an inclusive initiative with Asean at its centre, Kudashev described it as dangerous and said it reflected “cold war mentality’’. Asked about Lavrov’s visit to Pakistan after his meeting with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar here, Babushkin said there was no misunderstanding or divergence with India on Russia’s ties with Pakistan. Lavrov had announced in Islamabad that Russia will supply special military equipment to Pakistan to aid its counter-terrorism efforts. ‘’Russia has limited cooperation with Pakistan as compared to India.

School principals and teachers said they were awaiting the guidelines from the board on the basis of assessment and declaring of the results of these students. A standard X student from a city school said, “I tested positive two days ago. I was rigorously preparing for this exam but now I can relax and concentrate on my health. However, I prefer to give the board exam and then pass as it is my first public test.”At Vidya Pratishthan’s Magarpatta City Public School, Pune, the school has been holding online classes since March 2020. Initially, it has been physically as well as psychologically tough for the students, but they have been attending classes online. “Students have an overwhelming sense of uncertainty about how this situation will impact their transition into higher education. Some might be relieved for not having to sit for their board exams this year, but others feel as though the opportunity to shine has been taken out of their hands,” principal Chandrika Banerjee said.Director of IITians Prashikshan Kendra Durgesh Mangeshkar said, “Cancellation is an extreme measure and its tenability hinges now on whether the ‘objective criteria’ to be defined by CBSE is prospective or retrospective in nature. If the criteria is about online viva or online tests to be conducted by school in future, then it is fair. But if it is about a retrospective parameter like standard IX & X school marks, then it may not be acceptable tomost students who may opt for a board exam later.”Principal of The Kalyani School Nirmal Waddan said, “Thinking activities and several interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary projects have been conducted throughout the year. Every activity has been diligently recorded too. The evidence has been preserved. So, the students of our school are more than ready to move to the next level, even without the board exams.”According to career counselor Kedar Takalkar the decision was unjust to all sincere and studious students who had already prepared well for the exam. “Most students will be happy with the result based on an internal assessment which will be better than the percentage that they would have scored in the exam. Scoring a good percentage in the exam itself is self-motivation for students as well as for parents. It confirms that everything was done in the right way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/basis-of-marks-in-focus-after-cbse-cancels-std-x-final/articleshow/82072820.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Chief minister Amarinder Singh made the announcement on Wednesday, along with other measures for the upliftment of the Dalit communityat a virtual meeting to pay homage to B R Ambedkar on the 130th birth anniversary of the architect of the Constitution. Capt Amarinder also announced filling up of SC vacancy backlog in all departments on priority, while promising to explore a post-matric overseas scholarship scheme for SC students, on the lines of the Baroda State Scholarship Scheme awarded to Baba Sahib under a scheme established by Sayajirao Gaekwad III. He also announced a special Rs 500-crore rural link roads project for FY2022. The project will encompass construction of new link roads to the localities of scheduled castes and other poorer sections of the society, which do not currently have road connectivity. Cremation grounds and places of worship will also be connected through the project. A special allocation of Rs 100 crore is proposed in 2021-22 for modernisation of villages having more than 50% SC population, said the chief minister. This was aimed at providing further impetus to existing grants in the villages having SC population greater than or equal to 50% of the total population, he said. Smartphones will be given to all Class XII SC students in government schools, while 150 village-level awareness camps and training at nine training and extension centres will be conducted to motivate people to take up dairy farming, with special emphasis on SC beneficiary, he added.

Proposed under GGRK mission, it will have 50% seat reservation for SC candidates. Other projects planned include Dr B R Ambedkar museum and institute of management in PTU campus, Kapurthala, he added. Amarinder recalled that when Rajiv Gandhi contested for the first time from Amethi, after the death of his brother Sanjay, the campaigning task was handed over to him for one of the four areas in the constituency. He went on to recall: “A SC youth who was deputed to help me wanted to get off the jeep before entering an upper caste dominated village, but I did not allow him to. He was standing next to me when the villagers offered me water, asking him to go out. But I made it clear that he will not go out alone. So I also left the place, telling them – Give us votes or not, we are going.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/30-scheme-funds-for-sc-welfare-capt/articleshow/82073635.cms||---

---||Jaipur||6pm-5am curfew from tomorrow to put brakes on Covid spread in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The state government on Wednesday announced a 6pm to 5am daily curfew across the state from Friday as part of a series of measures to combat rising Covid cases. The curfew will be in effect till the end of the month. To ensure that the curfew comes into force from 6pm sharp, shops and business establishments have been asked to down shutters at 5pm. All government offices, except Covid control and war rooms, have to shut at 4pm. Private offices have also been advised to close at the same time. In rural areas, shops and businesses have to close at 8pm. Quoting health experts, the government said the second wave was more dangerous and aggressive. If the spread was mainly confined to urban areas in the first wave, this time around 30% of the cases were reported from rural areas and 60% infections were among people below the age of 45. The government said the positivity and mortality were much higher in the first 10 days of April than during the peak of the first wave (September-October 2020). Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, while chairing a meeting of political and religious leaders and NGOs on Wednesday, said with around 6,000 positive cases per day and more than 161 deaths in April alone, it is clear that this phase of infection is more fatal and contagious. Gehlot instructed doctors to conduct a comparative study of infectivity, disease severity and deaths in the first and second wave with an aim of formulating a strategy to contain the spread. The government said only those involved in essential services should venture out of their homes. However, the government continued with the previous exemptions given to factories, IT companies, bus stands, railways stations, marriage functions and medical shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/6pm-5am-curfew-from-tomorrow-to-put-brakes-on-covid-spread-in-state/articleshow/82073671.cms||---

Yet, they took everyone by surprise with a fighting goalless draw against Qatar giants Al Rayyan at the Nehru Stadium at Fatorda on Wednesday. “If we had won, it would not be a scandal. But credit to FC Goa. They defended very well,” said Al Rayyan coach Laurent Blanc, winner of the 1998 World Cup with France. Nobody had any doubt that the Qatar club was the better side. This is their 12th year in the Champions League, they have players who played for top European clubs and Blanc himself has had a great career with playing stints at Manchester United and Barcelona, besides guiding French giants PSG. But Juan Ferrando’s boys from FC Goa, four of whom were making their debut in the top league only this season, ensured they are now unbeaten for a record 16 games, 15 of them in the ISL.  “One hour before the start of the match, everyone was excited in the dressing room.

Over 10 lakh students usually take the exam, but this year only about five lakh registered. The exam was scheduled for April 25 but due to the current Covid situation in the state and a rise in cases, the Maharashtra State Council of Examination, postponed the exam to May 23 last week.Commissioner of the council Tukaram Supe said, “The students have been engaged in online classes this year and the preparation for scholarship exams may have been disturbed. This extension of the exam date will give them more time to prepare. We were also expecting enrolments to increase after the extension in the date, but overall the mood looks down. But, we will have to conduct the exams even if there is poor registration.”Supe said every year the enrolments cross 12 lakh for both the categories together but this year it has been exceptionally low.In total, as many as 6.2 lakh students have registered for the exam for middle and high school categories from the state. The exam is conducted in February every year. Nearly 10,000 students enrolled for the exam but failed to pay the registration fees so their applications had to be rejected.Schools are also in favour of the scholarship exams. They actively encourage students to apply and even coach them .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/enrolments-for-scholarship-tests-drop-to-nearly-50/articleshow/82072856.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP) on Wednesday said that the decision will adversely impact their income. The association plans to seek legal opinion if the issue can be brought before the high court. Traders said they decided to keep the shops closed until April 14 in response to the chief minister’s appeal, but the government has not responded to their demands. “The government’s decision is discouraging. Our demands have not been considered. The new rules have allowed functioning of almost everything except non-essentials shops,” said Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary of FTAP. President of the association Fatehchand Ranka added, “We discussed the issue with traders across the state. Everyone is unhappy as traders will have to keep their shops shut. We are seeking legal opinion on how the matter can be taken up before the high court. Why are the traders being stopped from doing business when all other activities are being allowed?” He added that the state government has allowed certain people to step out. “Even small eateries have been allowed to function. The vendors at vegetable markets and Marketyard can run their businesses. Why have traders been compelled to keep shops shut? This appears illogical. It is as if only traders and their shops are responsible for the spread of the infection. We are planning to seek legal opinion on all these points,” Ranka said. The traders said that they would decide about opening their shops after seeking legal advice. Ramesh Shinde, who runs a cloth shop, said that traders have already faced huge losses over the last one year due to the lockdown, restricted timings as well as drop in footfall. “Shopkeepers are not in a position to face another closure. There is no proof that non-essential shops are responsible for the spread of Covid-19. We are following all necessary measures at the shops and avoiding overcrowding. There is a need to concentrate more on places that are attracting a larger crowd,” Shinde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/non-essential-shopowners-unhappy-over-closure-plan-to-seek-legal-advice/articleshow/82072874.cms||Sarang Dastane

According to the CBSE, exams for Class XII that were to be held from May 4 to June 14 have been postponed owing to the rise in the Covid-19 cases across the country. Further, the statement from the board states that the situation will be reviewed by it on June 1 and details will be shared subsequently. A notice of at least 15 days will be given to students before the start of the examinations. As for the Class X board exams, which were to be held from May 4 to June 14, it stands cancelled. Results of Class X will be prepared on the basis of an objective criterion to be developed by the board. A statement from the education minister further states, “Any candidate, who is not satisfied with the marks allocated to him/her on this basis, will be given an opportunity to sit in an exam as and when the conditions are conducive to hold the same.”CBSE’s city coordinator Dr Paramjit Kaur said, “I am glad that the exams have been cancelled and postponed. It’s good that they have left it on the schools to assess students as we all know about them. Guidelines will be shared soon by the CBSE and we will follow the same. For Class XII students, we will plan out and keep the children learning as there is already a learning gap and these are crucial years and they have to continue higher education. Therefore , the students who were geared up for Class XII exams may lose the momentum, but the schools will boost these students.”Jasdeep Kaur principal of GNPS School said , “ We are going through a pandemic that is increasing exponentially on a daily basis. For us the safety of our students is of paramount importance. Thus, under the prevailing circumstances, this action of CBSE of cancelling Class X exams and postponing Class XII seems very appropriate and the safest way out for now. My advice for the students would be to continue their studies with the same gusto and build up on some good skills. Stay home. Stay safe.”Another city-based educationist said, “ This is very unfortunate as promoting like this would not be justified and will effect students.”Shrey Jain, a Class X student of DAV School, said, “ The CBSE has done the right thing as it will be impossible to ensure safety of students at crowded exam centres.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/a-sigh-of-relief-as-cbse-cancels-class-x-board-papers-postpones-class-xii-exams/articleshow/82071729.cms||---

They petitioned the government for higher aid and waiver of interest on loan EMIs of several drivers. Nearly 4,000 autos have been confiscated for defaulting on repayments. “We will agitate on streets post-lockdown if our demands are not met.

---||Hyderabad||Many Covid-19 test negative, but lungs taking big hit||HYDERABAD: Despite testing negative in an RT-PCR test, a significant number of people are now recording a high score on the Co-Rads scale indicating an underlying lung infection, said doctors treating Covid-19 patients. The increase in such cases has left doctors looking more minutely at every Covid-suspect case and not rely entirely on RT-PCR reports. Reason: The deterioration rate among such patients is high and they need immediate medical attention. Apart from Co-Rads, doctors are also performing tests like D-dimer —indicative procedures done to assess extent of lung infection. In Co-Rads, for instance, 6 is the highest score showing a severe lung infection. “Many patients with negative RT-PCR test reports are recording Co-Rads scores of 5 and 6. Also, there are several cases where symptoms are very vague. For instance, in a recent case patient walked in with no other symptom other than dry nose. The patient tested positive,” said Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, national secretary, Indian Medical Association’s Academy of Medical Specialities. In yet another instance a patient who walked in only with conjunctivitis, tested positive for Covid-19. Considering the RT-PCR test, though 80% efficient, leaves some room for patients going undetected, doctors say that it is becoming important to perform a Co-Rads. “Though the RT-PCR is considered as a confirmatory test for Covid-19 and is far more reliable than the Rapid Antigen Test (RAT), it still has around 80% efficiency.In such cases HRCT (high resolution scan of the chest) helps,” said Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan, superintendent, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences. The hospital has seen over 400 Covid-19 patients so far. “Apart from a variety of symptoms, or even their complete absence, in many patients there is quick deterioration, while some are improving in a day or two,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/many-with-ive-rt-pcr-reports-showing-severe-lung-infection-docs/articleshow/82072891.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Goa||Spike in Covid-19 cases could be due to unrestricted cross-border movement: Goa Health minister Vishwajit Rane||Panaji: Health minister Vishwajit Rane said the recent spurt in Covid-19 cases could be due to cross-border movement of people without restrictions. During the first phase, Goa could flatten the curve with the restrictions which were then relaxed, he said. “This time, the infectivity is also high. I think the surge is taking place due to the free movement of people. We have also traced some UK strains in the state,” Rane told a news channel. He said though people were reluctant in getting themselves vaccinated, in the last few days the numbers have increased with the mass vaccination call was given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Goa is not facing a shortage of vaccines, but with now more people coming forward for taking the jab, we have placed a request for 1 lakh doses with the ministry of health and family welfare. We have stock for only ten days,” Rane said. The health minister said that inorder to bring down the fatality rate, D-Dimer and interleukin tests for Covid-19 patients have been introduced at Goa Medical College (GMC), and they are repeated every 72 hours. The tests are useful in monitoring the patient’s progression to Covid-19-related cytokine storm and timely medical intervention, he said. “Besides vaccinations, some amount of restrictions and strictly following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is a must if the cases need to be kept under control.” While stating that a lockdown is not the only solution, Rane said that instead strict restrictions need to be in place. “We are using all the available machinery to ensure that people are wearing masks. Lockdown is the solution only up to a certain point,” he said adding further that the need of the hour is proper implementation of existing SOPs. “At the moment, as you see in Goa, the situation is under control, and I don’t see a lockdown happening in the state,” Rane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/spike-in-covid-19-cases-could-be-due-to-unrestricted-cross-border-movement-rane/articleshow/82074566.cms||---

The 5-year old feline had entered the zero point of the Haripura reservoir near Tilpuri number 2 where a team of the forest department spotted the injured tiger and informed the senior officials. Sub-divisional officer (SDO) Dhruva Singh Martoliya reached the spot with a rescue team, including veterinarians. Though combing operations were launched immediately, the tiger managed to hide in the bushes. With additional guards and police and with JCB machines, the team launched the second round of combing operations. It took the team around six hours to spot the tiger and then tranquilize it in the evening. SDO Martoliya said that the tiger had sustained severe injuries on its body and was limping badly. It appeared emaciated and had probably not consumed anything in a few days. “The tiger has been shifted to the Ranibagh Rescue Centre in Nainital district. It has been kept under observation,” SDO Martoliya added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tiger-found-injured-in-us-nagar-rescued/articleshow/82071754.cms||Aakash Ahuja
---||Goa||Cannot afford lockdown, up to locals and tourists to take precautions: Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: The state has just emerged from the impact of one lockdown and cannot afford one more as it would mean another impact on tourism and industrial activity, CM Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday. In the backdrop of the nearly 550 new cases being recorded in Goa each day, and to avoid going through a lockdown like the neighbouring states, Sawant said that they “expect citizens cooperation if the state has to keep tourism, industrial and other activities on”. For this, he urged Goans to “seek treatment as soon as they have any symptoms”, while also appealing to them to turn up in large numbers to get vaccinated and follow safety protocols. “The kind of conditions that are prevailing in our neighbouring states they have to undergo a lockdown, we should not have to go through the same. We have just about come out of that situation,” he said. Sawant said he had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for permission to vaccinate all hospitality industry staff, across age groups. The PM, in response, called up to stress that promoting vaccination and not lockdown should be the state’s focus, Sawant said. The CM requested both Goans and tourists to observe all Covid-19 protocol to ensure that the spread Covid-19 in Goa is contained. “While managing the new cases, we have to keep economic activities going and for that we have kept all our services on at primary health centres and district hospitals. If you have come in contact with any person with the infection or symptoms, you should get yourself tested, home isolate yourself, quarantine yourself. This is my request,” Sawant said. The government will help with hospitalisation and in making the home-isolation kits available, he added. “We want to keep this Tika Utsav on for another 10 to 12 days. Anyone who is above the age of 45 should come forward to take vaccination because lockdown is not the solution to Covid-19. We should follow norms like taking the vaccination, wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing. We should go out only where it is absolutely necessary. Unnecessary gatherings should be avoided, it has been the appeal of the government,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cannot-afford-lockdown-up-to-locals-and-tourists-to-take-precautions-cm/articleshow/82074587.cms||---

According to Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Service (AFES) officers, some of the deceased or injured may have tried to light the stove when the explosion took place, possibly due to a leak. “The gas could have been filled the house through the night and when one of the residents tried to light the stove in the morning, the blast took place. The force of the explosion caused the two-storey house to collapse like a house of cards,” said an AFES officer. The loud sound and shockwave caused other residents to run out of their houses in panic. Some of the residents then called the fire brigade and police after seeing the damaged house. A fire brigade team rushed to the spot and took around three hours to remove the debris and rescued four persons — Mayur Pranchal, Ashish Patel, Vishnu Patel and Ichha Patel — all between 40 and 50 years old, said an AFES officer. AFES personnel could not save two women — Nootan Panchal, 55, and Bhavna Patel, 55 — and they may have died from burns or asphyxiation, said an officer.

---||Coimbatore||Thadagam valley breathes easy||Coimbatore: Thanks to the authorities who sealed the illegal brick kiln units at Chinna Thadagam, Sheila Chandran and her husband Swaminathan, residing on Thadagam Road, are painting their two houses after 11 years.“There was no point painting them earlier, because the walls would be covered in red dust and black soot minutes after painting,” says Sheila. The couple hopes that the kilns stay shut at least till the painting job is complete.The couple is among the thousands of residents, living in the five villages — Pannimadai, Chinna Thadagam, Somaiyampalayam, Veerapandi and Thadagam — who are relieved that the kilns have closed.M Satheeshwari, who runs a tea stall and snack house on Thadagam Road, serving three of the largest kilns in Somaiyampalayam, says she has not worn a mask for the past two weeks despite the Covid-19 threat. “I wore masks every day for 20 years, not because of any virus, but to protect myself from the dust and smoke from the kilns. I have had wheezing episodes at least twice requiring hospitalization and coughs, forcing me to use masks. For the past 10 days, I have been able to breathe clean air.”“After the kilns were closed, I have no customers or contact with people, to fear Covid,” Satheeshwari adds.M Muthukumar, a foundry employee and resident of Thiruvalluvar Nagar, says the locality has been dust-free for the first time since his birth. “During summers, it’s hard to live here. Red dust forms on our vehicles, on clothes in our kitchens and on dining tables.”Clothes hung out to dry turned black or dark red, says Sheila. “It was becoming impossible to live here due to wheezing issues, headaches and dry coughs. It got worse when the kilns burnt cashew shells and coconut tree.”However, the dust and smoke-free air has come at a price. M Satheeshwari who had been running a tea stall with her older son Balaganesh for the last 10 years, plans to close it. “Many labourers who had accounts with me have run off to their villages without settling my account, making me lose Rs 50,000.”Balaganesh now plans to start a bike repair shop or join a workshop. He is not the only youngster in the area who has to hunt for a job. D Narendhiran had quit an IT job in Bengaluru to manage his uncle’s bakery at Thaneerpandhal, that made Rs 4 lakh a month. He now plans to return to the IT sector, because the bakery, without business from kilns, makes only Rs50,000 a month. “We had daily orders from kilns for tea and snacks. Several contractors, plumbers, maintenance staff and lorry drivers who visited the kilns, used to eat at our bakery,” he adds.Vaasu Swaminathan, who used to earn Rs 15,000 a month working as a loadman for a company supplying firewood to the kilns, has been jobless for the last three weeks. “We have some savings but will have to borrow from relatives soon,” he rues. At least one lakh people living in the locality, including labourers, drivers, masons, plumbers, wood cutters and loadmen like him have lost jobs or livelihoods due to the sealing, because there is no other local industry in the area, he adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/thadagam-valley-breathes-easy/articleshow/82072898.cms||---

The episode took place when they were asked to take the designated route during the ‘shahi snan’ in Haridwar on Wednesday. The three Gupta brothers, who hail from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh, were part of the procession of the Niranjani akhada which was the first akhada to come for the shahi snan. After the snan, the Gupta brothers wanted to take a shorter route to reach their hotel but were stopped by the police personnel which caused the argument. In a viral video of the incident doing rounds on social media, the Gupta brothers can be seen arguing with the cops who stopped them from crossing the barricading. One of the brothers can be heard saying, “Your inspector general (IG) knows us”. Meanwhile, deputy inspector general (DIG), Garhwal, Neeru Garg, has ordered a probe into the matter and directed senior superintendent of police (SSP), Haridwar, to submit the report within the next seven days. The Gupta brothers were earlier involved in controversy over the holding of wedding ceremonies of their sons in Auli near Badrinath in 2019. It was found that a lot of waste was left behind in the ecologically-sensitive area after the wedding ceremonies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-2021-south-africa-based-businessmen-gupta-brothers-enter-into-an-argument-with-cops-probe-ordered/articleshow/82071783.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The issue came up after Vijay Pratap reiterated in a post on Facebook on Tuesday night that he was firm on his plan to quit the Indian Police Service (IPS), even after Amarinder had rejected the resignation letter earlier in the day, “I will continue to serve society in the best possible manner, however, NOT (sic) in the IPS,” he wrote in the post. The IPS officer has found himself in the middle of a political storm after the Punjab and Haryana high court ordered that he be removed from the Punjab Police SIT (special investigation team) probing sacrilege and police firing cases of 2015. The Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura police firing cases of October 2015 had become a poll issue in the 2017 elections in the state and were a major factor in the Congress coming to power in Punjab. Sources said Pratap was feeling hurt after a single bench of Punjab and Haryana high court ordered to quash the investigation into Kotkapura case on April 9 and set up a new SIT without him. On Tuesday night, Kunwar Vijay Pratap took to Facebook, writing that his report was the truth. He had also appealed to people not to politicise the issue. However, on Wednesdy, Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Kotkapura, Kultar Singh Sandhwan, who is vocal in taking on the Congress government in cases of sacrilege, said the high court order was a “complete failure” of the state government, and if Vijay Pratap was making up his mind in entering politics, he could think of AAP. While Amarinder had rejected Vijay Pratapt’s resignation by describing as an honest and talented officer, former Punjab minister and Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu demanded that the IPS officer’s report on the three cases be made public. Pratap was not available for comment, but while speaking to media on March 15, he had said that he had to face a lot of pressure during investigation of the cases and it was the will of God that he was alive. He had refused to divulge the type of pressure or threats and the names of those involved in the conspiracy behind the case of sacrilege and killing of two protesters. He had also said that everything would become crystal clear after the final and 10th challan was presented in the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/ig-firm-on-quitting-ips-all-eyes-on-his-next-step/articleshow/82073696.cms||Neel Kamal

Both the security and administrative teams have done a commendable job. The state has recorded a good turnout on all three shahi snans,” CM Rawat said. Meanwhile, CS Om Prakash told TOI, “There has been no such official decision nor have I received any such directive from the Centre or the CM's office. Some people were circulating rumours on social media but they lack any substance. Our teams have worked very hard for Kumbh and the results are visible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/talks-of-kumbh-duration-being-curtailed-are-mere-rumours-cm/articleshow/82071795.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Dehradun||Forest fires reported at three places around Mussoorie||Mussoorie: Forest fires broke out at three different places around the hill town on Wednesday. The blazes occurred in the Jaunpur range (below Jabarkhet Nature Reserve), near Bata Ghat and near Lal Tibba. While the fire in the Jaunpur range was contained, forest officials were battling to contain the other blazes till the time of filing this report. According to locals, fire in the Jaunpur range had been raging since Tuesday and had spread rapidly during the night. It was contained with much difficulty by the forest department officials with the help of locals. “This fire damaged a large area but it was prevented from spreading and causing further damage,” told Bikram Rawat, a village local. Another fire was reported near Bata Ghat on Wednesday afternoon. Till late evening, the fire could not be doused completely but it was ‘sufficiently contained’, said forest officials. “We are trying to douse this fire and efforts are being made to prevent its spread. Although the fire is still smouldering on steep rocks, it will be put out by Thursday morning,” said Jagjeevan Lal, a forester. Meanwhile, the forest fire near Lal Tibba broke out on Wednesday evening and officials were rushing to the spot to douse the flames at the time of filing this report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/forest-fires-reported-at-three-places-around-mussoorie/articleshow/82071788.cms||Anmol Jain

While many residents and environmental activists hope the kiln owners don’t get a stay on the closure order and reopen again spoiling the environment, the owners are praying a stay order comes through to at least clear existing stock of bricks and piles of red soil. Construction contractors hope the hearing goes the kiln owners’ way to buy enough bricks to complete existing projects. The Coimbatore Brick Manufacturers’ Association plans to get a stay order against the closure. “We hope the stay order comes through, allowing us to operate for a few months until we decide our next move,” says Pradeep, owner of a kiln at Chinna Thadagam, who has stocks of 2.4 lakh bricks worth Rs 16.8 lakh in his unit. He has sent back 50 of his 80 labourers to their villages as he was unable to pay their salary. Owners of smaller kilns, who have loans ranging from Rs 10 lakh upwards at high interest rates, are hoping to sell bricks and raw materials to pay off loans and exit the business. “I have bricks worth Rs 30 lakh and raw material and machinery worth Rs 30 lakh. I just want to sell and settle my loan dues and shut shop with no losses,” says another kiln owner in Thadagam. The construction industry, especially of individual villas and small complexes, is still reeling from the sealing drive. “Many of our projects have come to a standstill. The next alternative, fly ash bricks, are not available anywhere now or cost double the usual price. Kilns must be allowed to at least exhaust existing tocks,” says M Mohan of Mayflower Enterprises. While brick measures 230mm, blocks measure 200mm, says D Singaravelu of Prolific Housing. “How can a building be built with both?” Builders’ associations accept the writing on the wall and say it is time the industry does too. Rajiv Ramasamy, secretary of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India (Credai) Coimbatore, says most of the larger builders had started using light-weight blocks or fly ash bricks 12 years ago. “Acceptance among builders and customers initially took time, but now we prefer the blocks and find no difference in quality at all. The government has also been pushing us to use fly ash bricks for several years. We do admit there is a crisis, but there is a longterm alternative and solution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kiln-owners-builders-wait-for-d-day/articleshow/82072908.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||‘Puthandu’: People throng temples||Coimbatore: Devotees flocked to many temples in the city in large numbers on Wednesday to usher in the Tamil New Year and Vishu with prayers and by seeking God’s blessings. While the turnout of devotees was just 50% of what the temples used to record on festive days in the pre-Covid days, temple authorities said the crowd was several times larger than that on the non-festive days in the past one year.Most of the temples allowed the devotees in only after checking their temperature and making them sanitize their hands. They also asked the crowd to follow the government guidelines to contain the Covid-19 spread through repeated announcements. There were also temples that made the devotees stand in queue to avoid crowding inside.In addition to all these, police personnel were deployed in front of temples to ensure strict adherence to the Covid guidelines.Sree Ayyapan temple at Siddhapudur in the city had seen 10% to 15% increase in the number of devotees on the day, compared to the previous year. A member of the temple committee said, “Unlike the previous years, both the Tamil New Year and Vishu is celebrated on the same day this time. A large number of Tamils and Malayalees visited the temple since morning. Usually, Keralites staying in the city would travel back to their native places to celebrate the festival with their relatives. But this time, many of them stayed back and visited the temple because of the travel restrictions and fear of Covid-19.” The temple also saw more than 100 families feeding solid food to their toddlers for the first time. “It’s an auspicious day for the ceremony. Earlier, we used to see only 30 to 40 such families. While we had more than 100 of them today, we had limited the number of people accompanying the child to five to reduce crowding inside the temple. Instead of offering annadhanam in plates inside the temple, we packed the food and distributed it outside the temple.”A Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department (HR&CE) official, who is incharge of Arulmigu Koniamman Temple at Town Hall, also confirmed that they had registered a significant increase in the turnout of devotees on the day. “It was a floating crowd and hence the temple was not packed with people at any time. A lot of people from neighbouring districts used to visit the temple on auspicious days. This time, many such outsiders and elderly people didn’t visit the temple because of the pandemic situation.”He said they had put in lots of efforts to strictly follow the government guidelines inside the temple. “We had to send a couple of devotees out of the temple as they didn’t wear face masks. Usually, we would offer annadhanam (full meals) to more than 100 people inside the temple. This time, we just offered variety rice in disposable plates that too outside the temple.”An official with the Mundhi Vinayagar Temple at Puliyakulam said there weren’t big celebrations as they wanted to keep the crowd in check.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/puthandu-people-throng-temples/articleshow/82072911.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh questioned on equations with Param Bir Singh, Sachin Waze||NEW DELHI: The CBI questioned former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh for eight hours on Wednesday in connection with its probe into allegations of extortion levelled against him by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Sources told TOI that the CBI team asked Deshmukh whether Waze would visit him at his residence and whether it was normal for the former home minister to meet API-rank police officers at his home. Sources said Deshmukh was grilled by two superintendent of police rank officers — Abhishek Dular and Kiran S — at the DRDO guesthouse in Mumbai. The two SPs are part of a 12-member team probing the high-profile case, a source said. Investigators are learnt to have confronted Deshmukh with statements given by people they had quizzed in the last one week in connection with the “letter bomb” dropped by the former Mumbai police chief before he was shunted out. Deshmukh was asked specific questions about each allegation made by Singh and Waze. However, the crucial portion of questioning revolved around Singh’s purported exchange of messages with ACP Patil, an officer said. Many in political and police circles are intrigued by Patil’s messages to Singh, based on which the former Mumbai top cop alleged that Deshmukh had set a target of Rs 100 crore a month for Mumbai police to be raised from bars and hotels. Singh had shot off his explosive letter to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray when Mumbai police and the state government were reeling under the disclosure of Waze planting explosives outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence. The CBI team, sources said, will seek to investigate the suspicion rife in many quarters that the letter and its timing could have been crafted to distance Singh from Waze, who had flourished on his charge. Deshmukh came to the guesthouse around 10.15 am. His questioning began at 11 am and ended around 6.30 pm, but he didn’t leave immediately. After being asked about his relationship with Singh and Waze, Deshmukh was asked how often the latter visited his residence and office and which other officers from Mumbai police did the same, another source familiar with the questioning said. He was asked if he ever asked Waze to extort Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants in Mumbai every month. Deshmukh denied all the allegations and said these were attempts to malign him and the state government. The CBI is conducting a preliminary enquiry (PE) against Deshmukh on the orders of Bombay high court. Following the HC order, Deshmukh resigned as home minister of Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-questions-deshmukh-on-relationship-with-singh-waze/articleshow/82074693.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Traders feel buyers cool about ‘break the chain’ curbs||NAGPUR: It was business as usual at the markets on eve of another round of restrictions under which movement of public in general will be curbed. TOI moved around areas like Sadar, Indora, Gokulpeth, Dharampeth and even Kamptee only to see a normal day on Wednesday. There was hardly any rush seen at the essential shops. At 6 pm, just a couple of hours before the lockdown, there was no increase in the crowds. Traders say the public has now taken the lockdown as normal. As no new restrictions on shops have been imposed, there was no panic among the consumers. Prabhakar Deshmukh, the president of Nagpur Kirana Association — a body of grocery traders — said buying was as usual and no sudden increase in demand was seen. “It hardly seemed that there would be fresh curbs from Thursday. There is no dearth of supplies also,” he said. Deshmukh, however, doubted whether even the fresh curbs would actually help in breaking the chain. “There will still be a leeway as it would not stop people from mingling with each other totally,” he said. President of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC) Ashwin Mehadia, who too confirmed no panic buying, said they have been supporting complete lockdown. “Only milk should be allowed as essential item, not even groceries,” he said. Ashok Kumar Gandhi, of M/s AK Gandhi Group which deals in consumer durables and vehicles, said the sector has been hit hard. As the curbs have liquidity, businessmen are not in a position to pay full wages. “Air conditioners and coolers may be luxury items but as good as essentials during the summer months. For that matter, even mobile phones that have become integral part of day-to-day life should be treated as essential items. Distancing can be maintained at the shops or home delivery service can happen,” said Gandhi. Industrialists said a number of units will have to remain closed. “The employers will have to make arrangement for workers’ stay near the factory or have a dedicated transport for them. A number of small and medium units may not be in a position for that,” said Nitin Lonkar from Butibori Manufacturers’ Association (BMA). Mayank Shukla, from Chamber of Small Industry Associations (COSIA), said there is a general impression that only “those units that had got a permission to run last year will remain open. Rest may have to remain shut”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/traders-feel-buyers-cool-about-break-the-chain-curbs/articleshow/82072912.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Tika Utsav takes off on last day of special drive after slow start||VISAKHAPATNAM: Tika Utsav finally took off in Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday, the last day of the special immunisation drive against Covid-19.  The state administered Covid-19 vaccines to over six lakh people by 9 pm on Wednesday thus reaching the proposed target of six lakh vaccinations a day for the first time during the four-day Tika Utsav which started on April 11. Due to a shortage of vaccine stocks, the state could only give vaccine doses to around one lakh people during the first three days of the Utsav. The increasing number of daily cases has driven scores of people towards the vaccination centres in the last few days. However, most centres had remained non-functional in the first three days of the Utsav, much to the disappointment of the public. With sufficient stocks in hand, district officials managed to ramp up the mass inoculation drive on Wednesday. The Utsav covered at least one ward or village secretariat for every rural and urban primary health care centre. Village and ward volunteers alerted locals about the special vaccination drive beforehand which also helped in pulling many to the vaccination centres on Wednesday. At least 35,000 people were vaccinated in each district while some districts crossed the 50,000-mark. Due to the increased number of vaccination centres, coverage has been now extended to several rural parts of the state. The Tika Utsav was conducted at as many as 3,400 vaccination sites on Wednesday. Speaking to TOI, Lagudu Prasad, who received the vaccine at a government facility in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday, said that he had been inquiring about the vaccine for the last three days. “Finally, they gave me the Covid-19 shot on Wednesday. I did not develop any adverse reaction from the vaccine,” he said. Vizianagaram district medical and health officer Dr SV Ramani Kumari said the district had achieved 100% of its vaccination target on Wednesday. “The special drive was conducted at 78 village and seven urban ward secretariats to vaccinate eligible beneficiaries, aged 45 and above,” Dr Ramani Kumari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/tika-utsav-takes-off-on-last-day-of-special-drive-after-slow-start/articleshow/82071196.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 1.25 lakh CBSE students will be promoted to Class XI||AJMER: About 1.25 lakh students of Class X from Ajmer region of CBSE on Wednesday got relief as it cancelled the upcoming board examination. About 1,300 schools of Ajmer region in Rajasthan, Gujarat and UT of Dadar and Nagar Haveili already submitted internal assessment report of Class X. This internal assessment is of 20 marks in all subjects including English, Hindi, social science, Science and mathematics and also in some schools in sixth subject of IT. Official of Ajmer region said that they have not received the process of assessment of students appearing in Class X board examination, but every school have already submitted internal assessment report of their students. The internal assessment is of 20 marks of each subject. The students have to appear in the main board examination in a paper of 80 marks. But sources said that now school will play the main role to provide assessment of students as it was in CCE (Comprehensive and continue evaluation) which was stopped about five years ago. Last year, there were 1 lakh 13 thousand and 897 students registered for Class X but this year their number increased to 1 lakh 24 thousand and 239, “We had prepared to conduct the examination, but now the Class X board examination is cancelled by the CBSE therefore we are waiting for their directions so to instruct schools for further evaluation,” said official. Principal of a CBSE school said whole year they conducted assessment of students of Class X and also conducted pre-board examinations both online and offline and they have the data of their students. If board ask these reports, then schools are ready to provide. Previously the board had class X board exam as well as internal examination till 2016 but it was eliminated and made the board examinations compulsory. Meanwhile the board postponed Class XII examination and therefore about 87,000 students in Ajmer region are perplexed as because they have to look forward to get admission in further higher studies or to sit in different entrance examination. Most of the students feel that with postponement of board examination they will not get appropriate time to prepare for entrance examination like JEE and NEET. For Class XII, the practical examinations are already completed. Dilemma on subject allocation norm Ajmer: First time in the history of CBSE, the Class X board examinations are cancelled and therefore the students are eager to know the criteria of allotting subjects in Class XI. The subject allocation in Class XI is made in accordance with the marks obtained in Class X board in CBSE schools. Students who performed bad in pre-board or internal assessment of school usually work hard in main board examination to improve their performance but now with cancellation of Class X board examination, the students will not get this opportunity and therefore their performance in school level will decide their future of choosing subject in Class XI. Board official said that certainly the result will be based on objective criterion but if a student is not satisfied with the marks allocation, he can get the opportunity to appear in the examination if situation turns normal. Class X result for students remains important because they choose their stream of subjects as well as decide their future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1-25l-cbse-students-will-be-promoted-to-class-xi/articleshow/82072916.cms||---

The decision is likely to impact around 21,60,000 students. The government had earlier promoted students till class VII and on Wednesday, an order was issued to promote students of IX and XI, too. State education minister Govind Singh Dotasra said the move to postpone the board exams was taken considering the grim Covid situation. “It is necessary to conduct class XII board examination as students have to appear for college admissions. We can conduct the class XII board examination once the situation becomes normal and will also decide about class X board finals at that time. But students of other classes should be promoted,” said Dotasra. The Rajasthan government took a similar approach in 2020 when unlike CBSE, they refused to cancel board examinations. Class X and XII board exams were conducted and rest were promoted. On Monday, the government had promoted class VI and VII students without any examination. The students will be promoted on April 15 on the basis of homework given and projects done under SMILE 1, SMILE 2 and under the programme Aao Ghar Se Seekho evaluated by teachers without written examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/board-exams-postponed-others-promoted/articleshow/82072921.cms||---

Meanwhile, parents and teachers associations demanded that all students should be promoted to the next higher class, following in the footsteps of CBSE. “Andhra Pradesh is the only state in the country which is continuing its academic year as per the calendar. But it is getting tough to implement the standard operation procedure and other guidelines as Covid-19 cases are increasing every day. The CBSE took the decision to promote students and our government should also think of it considering the health and safety of students,” APTF state president Hrudaya Raju said.

---||Mumbai||Aging parents further out of reach for expats amid India’s 2nd wave||MUMBAI: Every time Malaysia resident Amrita Gupta speaks to her elderly parents in Mumbai, she breaks down. She has not seen them for almost two years and lives with a lingering dread of the worst case scenario. Gupta, 53, was all set to visit them this month but the second wave engulfing India has made her think twice.  When international news anchor Fareed Zakaria recently lamented on his show that the Covid pandemic prevented him from being by his mother’s side during her last days, his words struck a chord with thousands of expats across the world. The psychological ease of ‘I’m just a flight away’ has suddenly evaporated. Physical distance has been replaced by an unnerving sense of psychological distance, catastrophized by not just the illness, but the shifting sands of border control restrictions.  “Even if I do fly down, I will not be permitted re-entry into Kuala Lumpur. I would have to get special permission on compassionate grounds. I would also have to quarantine on both sides,” says Gupta, whose worry chart shot up this week when her parents’ only helper tested positive. “One of the reasons I moved to Asia from the US was to be closer to my parents. This is so cruel.”  While countries like Malaysia and Singapore are restricting re-entry to non-citizens, New Zealand recently said they will not permit even citizens returning from India. Many are fearful other countries might apply this rule at any point, which would jeopardize their return. Lina Desai, a UK citizen who has not seen her Mumbai-based parents for two years, says, “There are two reasons I have not made it back, even though every face time chat makes me realise how frail my folks are becoming. First, I have had only one jab. And second, I am always fearful UK will suddenly put India on the ‘red list’ and then I will have to quarantine when I return. I have two young children and it becomes difficult.”  Most Indian immigrants have already been living with the subterranean foreboding of taking that emergency flight home for a parent’s last rites. Amit Kara, who lives in London, flew to Mumbai when his mother was hospitalised with the virus a few months ago. He arrived just before she passed away but could not see her because she was isolated in hospital and he was quarantined in a hotel. “At a time like this, you clutch at straws and the straw that I was clutching is that she knew I had come back for her…that may have given her some satisfaction,” says Kara.  Those coming from the US may not be required to quarantine officially, but in some cases, it may be required by the community. Shailaja Shekhar, who lives in Washington DC, had saved up enough vacation time to come back for her mother’s 80th birthday in Coimbatore last month, but then learned that the assisted living community where they lived required a 14-day quarantine, and her leave would not be enough.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Hospitals running out of beds in Barmer||JAISALMER: Amid surge in cases across the country, hospitals in Barmer, too, are running out of bed as more and more Covid-19 patients are being admitted. On April 1, three patients were admitted to the hospital and no one was on oxygen, but at present, there are 72 patients in the hospital out of whom 45 are on oxygen. The situation of the medical college is also getting worse. The number of patients admitted here in the last 10 days has equalled the total number of patients admitted in the last 10 months. The situation is such that a new ward is being created every day. The consumption of oxygen too, has, increased manifold, leaving the oxygen generating plant insufficient. Medical officer Dr B L Mansuria said if the situation continues for the next 4-5 days, then the situation will become very concerning. At present, the situation is under control, but the sudden spike in the number of patients has increased the administration’s worries. Each new ward that is created in the morning gets full by night. The oxygen plant is unable to meet the demand. The medical department is worried that there might be shortage of medical equipment and oxygen soon. Dr Mansuria said the second wave is proving to be very dangerous and little carelessness can put the life of people at risk. General public is not following corona guidelines and are taking it lightly due to which the cases are increasing daily. If the cases increase with the same pace, then lot of problems will have to be faced in future. Especially, a large number of relatives are coming to hospital to meet corona patients and this could further spread the virus. Temples deserted during Navratra The temples of goddesses are lying deserted during the ongoing Navratra due to corona. Tanot Mata temple in Jaisalmer usually witnessed a crowd of over 10,000 during Navratra, but hardly a few devotees have visited in the last two days. Use of mask and sanitisers had been made compulsory in the temple. Devotees bringing prasad with them is offered to goddess and immediately given back to devotees. Similar situation prevails at Bhatiyani Mateshwari temple in Jasol, Ramdeora, Ashapura, Bhadaria Rai and Degrai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hospitals-running-out-of-beds-in-barmer/articleshow/82072937.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Despite booking vaccine slots, many turned away from hospitals||VISAKHAPATNAM: Despite registering beforehand and taking their slots for vaccination, many have been left in a fix after being repeatedly refused vaccination at certain government and private hospitals. These hospitals have been citing server problems, holidays and other issues over the past few days. As per health authorities, besides shortage of vaccines being a factor, fresh stock that had arrived was diverted from the hospitals as per government order for use in ward secretariats. As a result, general public above 45 and senior citizens could not be vaccinated on Wednesday. Some complained they had travelled all the way to the hospitals only to find that no vaccine would be administered. They said that there was no prior intimation, either by SMS or call, about auto-cancellation after successful online registration on the government app for the time slots and designated vaccination centres. “On Wednesday and Saturday, many of us had to return without being vaccinated from government hospitals in Chinna Waltair, including Chest and ENT Hospital, and even a private hospital in MVP Colony. All of them refused vaccination stating either a holiday or server problem. We received no communication even though we had made an appointment and booked our slot online,” said GPS Murhty, chief scientist at the National Institute of Oceanography. Addressing the issue, medical superintendent at Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD), Dr KVV Vijaya Kumar said, “On the first two days of Tika Utsav, there was no vaccine supply. As per government order, general vaccination on last day of Tika Utsav was stopped at all teaching hospitals and vaccines received had to be returned to the central store, to be sent to hundreds of gramma sachivalayams or ward secretariats for a special drive.” According to Covid-19 nodal officer for north-coastal AP, Dr PV Sudhakar, due to an exclusive vaccine drive for frontline workers on Saturday, there was some disruption in administering vaccines to public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/despite-booking-vaccine-slots-many-turned-away-from-hosps/articleshow/82071301.cms||Sulogna Mehta
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Private buses charging twice as much as RTC rates, operators say move necessary||VIJAYAWADA: Passengers looking to travel in private buses to destinations such as Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, or Tirupati are having to shell out almost twice compared to APSRTC or TSRTC buses. A similar situation can be seen on the Telangana side too where people travelling from Hyderabad to Andhra Pradesh on private buses are having to pay hefty charges. During weekends, a APSRTC bus ticket to Hyderabad from Vijayawada aboard the AC semi-sleeper Garuda costs Rs 530 while travelling the same class on a private bus can cost between Rs 900 and Rs 1,200 depending on the operator. Even on a normal day, a ticket for a sleeper bus from Vijayawada to Hyderabad can cost anywhere between Rs 1,000 and even Rs 2,000. Private bus operators said these high prices were necessary as they did not have the resources to sustain paying salaries, vehicle maintenance costs and other expenses given they did not generate any revenue during the lockdown. The other factor which helped such operators was the stand-off between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana over resumption of interstate bus services. A chunk of revenue for private operators comes from trips to Hyderabad. “Rising prices of petrol and diesel have caused a price hike by another 20% at least,” said K Rajesh, a private bus operator. Transport officials explained that there are no provisions to control prices of private tour operators under the MV Act and the discretion remains with the management. Commuters said that last-minute prices of bus tickets are so exorbitant and are almost in the same region as that of a flight ticket or first AC train ticket. “I had to reach Hyderabad by Monday and decided to take a bus without booking a ticket from a private bus pick-up point. To my shock, I was charged Rs 1,000 for a non-AC semi-sleeper seat which actually costs Rs 450 or less,” said Maddapalle Siddharth, an IT professional working for a Hyderabad-based company. Private tour operators also raise a point that there was no respite for them when it came to road taxes even when vehicles weren’t allowed to ply. They had submitted their representation for exemption three months ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/private-buses-charging-twice-as-much-as-rtc-rates-operators-say-move-necessary/articleshow/82071316.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Despite Covid wave, 50% of those surveyed plan to travel in April-June||NAGPUR: Even as India is currently experiencing an unprecedented surge in Covid, with caseload now touching nearly 1.70 lakh, 50% of the citizens surveyed still plan to travel during April–June 2021. Since many of them have already booked their travel and are unable to cancel unless service providers like airlines, hotels travel portals and agents cooperate, the risk of Covid-19 further worsening in the country is significant. LocalCircles, India’s leading social media platform, has been tracking travel plans of citizens since September 2020. During the latest survey conducted last week to understand what kind of travel citizens plan to undertake in the next three months, 17% said ‘holiday destination’, 24% said ‘visit family and friends’, and 9% said ‘plan to do both of the above’. Only 45% of citizens said that they will not be travelling, and would be staying at home. Earlier, a survey in February 2021 had indicated that a whopping 60% of citizens planned to travel this summer. With Covid second wave, the percentage of citizens saying they “will not be travelling and staying home” has increased from 29% in February 2021 to 45% now. While summer travel may mean taking a flight and train or rental cars, many will be frequently travelling by sleeper class in trains or taking a bus to see their parents or grandparents. There were also 25% of citizens who plan to do last-minute bookings and have put their plans on hold. “However, those who have booked, still plan to travel. This is again a major area of concern given the rapid rise in Covid cases in India in the last 30 days, and if 25% of Indians proceed with their travel plans during summer, it could be extremely difficult to contain Covid,” says Sachin Taparia, CEO, LocalCircles. The survey also indicates that flights and roads will be the most preferred mode of travel during this summer. The findings of the poll have indicated that more citizens planning to travel this summer have changed their mode from railways and the road to flights in the last one month. While state or district level lockdowns will lead to some restrictions and cancellations and some more people may cancel their travel given the rise in cases, a sizeable percentage may still proceed with their travel plans. LocalCircles has appealed to the central and state governments to carefully study these inputs and bookings data for flights, hotels, trains, and buses and take necessary action so either such travel is restricted and whatever is permitted is only after following Covid protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-covid-wave-50-of-those-surveyed-plan-to-travel-in-april-june/articleshow/82072940.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

With 918 fresh cases reported on Wednesday, the district and police administration suggested that strictness may further increase if people don't adhere to the protocols. So far 106 micro containment zones have been created where commutation has been strictly prohibited. Udaipur collector Chetan Ram Deora said 3.31 lakh rupees have been collected from 663 persons found without masks in public places while challans have been made against 10,418 people and a fine of 10.41Lakh rupees collected from them for not maintaining social distancing. Around 156 commercial establishments have been seized by the authorities. “We have set up six check-posts to scan the people arriving in Udaipur by road. As per the government orders, only those travellers having the RT-PCR negative report are given entry while those without the report, are being quarantined after their samples sent for test,” OP Bunkar, ADM (admn) said. All the religious places have been closed for 10days while Gulab Bag, the public garden has been declared a De-congestion zone with no entry granted to the people. With the upsurging cases and anticipating shortage and black marketing of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab injections, the medical department has issued guidelines to the private hospitals. CMHO Dr Dinesh Kharadi said only those private hospitals which are Covid dedicated centres would be supplied the injections and the hospitals would be allowed to keep stock enough for two days. There has been an increased demand for these injections and so the hospitals would require to send their demand to the CMHO and Drug Controller who will verify the stock of the injections at the respective hospitals and then supply stock enough for two days. The over the counter sale of these injections have been strictly prohibited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/106-micro-containment-zones-under-watch-156-outlets-seized-in-udaipur/articleshow/82072942.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Allegations against AG motivated: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday trashed as “baseless and politically motivated” the allegations against Advocate General Atul Nanda, as well as the legal team that defended the Kotkapura firing incident probe. Countering the “totally unjustified criticism” of the AG, as well as other lawyers hired by the state government to fight the case, the chief minister slammed opposition parties and their leaders for deliberately trying to provoke public sentiment on the sensitive issue to create trouble ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. “Contrary to what these vested interests, including leaders of SAD and AAP, were projecting, the fact is that cases relating to the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib were being handled separately in the courts from the Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan police firing cases,” he said. “The AG and his team had been tasked with defending the state only in sacrilege matters. The case has been decisively won by the state in a detailed judgment rendered by a single judge of the high court on 25 January 2019, thus upholding the findings of the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission of Inquiry, appointed by the government to examine the case,” he said. Pointing out that a separate SIT, headed not by Kunwar Vijay Pratap but by IG Parmar, is now probing the sacrilege cases, the chief minister said this, in itself, falsifies allegations of any collusion between the government and the accused of this heinous crime. ‘Appoint new AG, call meeting of MLAs, MPs’ Criticising the office of the advocate ceneral (AG) over the recent “setbacks” in court over the Kotkapura firing case, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa on Wednesday demanded that he should be replaced. In a statement, Bajwa also asked chief minister Amarinder Singh to call for an emergency meeting of all Congress MLA’s, ministers and members of Parliament from both houses to have a threadbare discussion on this issue “I am of the opinion that the advocate general should take responsibility for these professional failures and resign from his position. If he is unwilling to do so, I urge the Punjab government to relieve him from his position and appoint a new AG. The consistent failure of the AG to defend the state has damaged not just the reputation of the state, but also the sentiments of Punjabis. By refusing to take responsibility, the AG would seem to be more interested in remaining in his post, rather than focusing on his duties,” he added. “As per the information received from some sources and the government, the advocate general has paid about Rs 5.5 crore to the Delhi lawyers for defending these cases in the Punjab and Haryana high court. It is the public exchequer’s money that has been wasted by the advocate general because he refuses to appear and defend the interests of the state in various cases,” claimed Bajwa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/allegations-against-ag-motivated-cm/articleshow/82073771.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Don’t harass or beat up people, Mumbai police chief tells cops||MUMBAI: Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale on Wednesday asked the police force not to harass people or get into arguments or to beat up people or give ‘instant punishment’ such as sit-ups to those violating the 15-day restrictions that came into effect last evening. In an 18-minute video, Nagrale told cops that in a city like Mumbai, many people are from “Class Four” and many of them may go out to bring bread or essentials for their families, so police personnel on the streets should not catch and beat them. Police should not beat up anyone in front of their family as it is very humiliating, he said. “First, they should inquire and know the reasons, just don’t beat him or give him instant punishment like ‘surya namaskar’ or sit-ups as he may be out to get bread or medicine for his family. This is an opportunity to build a good image of the police (force), or one small mistake and the video will be viral and the image of the police will be badly affected. Help people and build a friendly environment in such a time of crisis,” he said. Director general of police Sanjay Pandey, interacting with the media, clarified the police will not issue any travel passes unlike last year, and stern action will be taken against those found violating Covid-19 norms. But he asked police personnel to take all precautions to avoid contracting Covid-19 and asked them to avoid asking vehicle-owners for their papers as it could lead to spread of the virus. Nagrale told policemen in his video, “Unlike the earlier lockdown, people are not mentally prepared. There is a difference between the earlier lockdown and this lockdown, hence one should be more careful and responsible. A small help would make a lot of difference, but a small mistake will ruin our image. Cops should see that black marketing of important medicines like Remdevisir is not done and strict action should be taken against those culprits.” Nagrale said cops should help members of the public. He urged local police to make a WhatsApp group with their area representatives, collect information on Covid patients, containment zones and hospitals beds available and see what help people need. DGP Pandey appealed to people not to move in public places without valid reasons and urged all those in the exempted categories to carry identity cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dont-harass-or-beat-up-people-mumbai-police-chief-tells-cops/articleshow/82073762.cms||Ahmed Ali

Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency, which will go to bypoll three days from now, falls in Nalgonda district which is witnessing a surge in cases. While 109 positive cases were reported on a single day on April 12, there were 68 cases on April 13 though it was a holiday on account of Ugadi. On April 11, 31 cases were recorded. According to a health department bulletin, more than 80 cases a day were reported on four days of the week. Officials said the Covid-19 spike was seen more in Nalgonda town and Nagarjuna Sagar limits where various political parties have been campaigning by organising meetings and roadshows. “Parties have been sending leaders to the district from other districts for campaigning. This is one of the reasons for rapid increase in the positive cases in the district,” a senior health official said.  Officials also attributed the rise in cases to large gatherings and people not wearing masks during election meetings and roadshows. The byelection is scheduled to be held on April 17. Apart from Nalgonda, Khammam is also witnessing a sharp surge in positive cases. Over 450 Covid-19 cases have been registered in the district, especially in Khammam Municipal Corporation limits. On an average, 60 cases are being reported every day. In Warangal Urban district, 545 cases were reported between April 7 and 13. Elections to Greater Warangal and Khammam municipal corporations along with some municipalities are expected to be held by this month-end or first week of May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/522-covid-cases-in-nalgonda-ring-alarm-bells/articleshow/82073759.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Delhi||Raw deal: Spike in ammonia levels hits Delhi water supply||NEW DELHI: Around 10% of Delhi’s overall water production was impacted during the morning supply hours on Wednesday even as the levels of pollutants and ammonia continued to rise in the raw water coming through the Yamuna. The quality control department of Delhi Jal Board (DJB) said the ammonia levels as high as 8.4ppm were being recorded while Delhi’s water treatment plants had the capacity to treat levels up to 1ppm. During the morning hours, Okhla Water Treatment Plant was operating at 78% capacity, the Wazirabad plant at 72% and the Chandrawal plant units at 58%. A senior DJB official said a shortfall of 78MGD was recorded. DJB daily supplies 920-930MGD water. The raw water is being diluted from other sources to reduce the pollutant load and diversion can lead to low-pressure water supply in tail-end areas, said an official. DJB vice-chairman Raghav Chadha wrote to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who also holds the portfolio of irrigation and water resources, on Wednesday. “The crisis being faced adversely impacts the drinking water supply of major areas of Delhi, including diplomatic missions, embassies, President’s House, Supreme Court, along with hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. I implore you to extend your cooperation on humanitarian grounds keeping in mind the unprecedented emergency of Covid-19,” the letter stated. The quantity of water coming from Haryana has also gone down significantly, alleged DJB. The water for the Wazirabad and Chadrawal plants is drawn directly from the Wazirabad barrage. Instead of the normal levels of 674.5ft at the Wazirabad pondage area, the levels dropped to 671.3ft on Wednesday, an official said. “The combination of these two factors have led to alarming levels of drop in water production capacity,” the letter stated. The impacted areas fall in west, north, central and south Delhi, including Delhi Cantonment and New Delhi Municipal Council areas. Some of the key localities include Civil Lines, Lahori Gate, Old Sabzi Mandi, Jhandewalan, Patparganj, Rajendra Nagar, Karol Bagh, Central Secretariat, RK Puram, Vasant Vihar, Sarojini Nagar, Kalkaji, Tughlaqabad, Lodhi Colony, Defence Colony, Moolchand and Sundar Nagar. As a upper riparian state, Haryana is serviced not only by the Yamuna but also the Markanda, Somb and the Ghaggar, Chadha wrote. “Haryana has the fortune of abundance of availability of drinking water, with the per capita availability of drinking water being far higher than Delhi. As a lower riparian state, Delhi is dependent on Haryana to ensure supply of clean and adequate water.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/raw-deal-spike-in-ammonia-levels-hits-city-water-supply/articleshow/82073928.cms||Paras Singh

People from 85 different areas of the city tested positive, and among those Malviya Nagar reported 70 cases, which are highest from an area in the city. Doctors suspect that the virus is spreading fast and infecting people at an increased pace. Long queues are seen at the government’s centres across the city of those who had come for get their tests done. The number of samples collected in the city reached to 57,718 in one week (from April 8-14). This is high time that people continue using face masks, follow social distancing and follow guidelines issued by the Centre and state to curb the spread of the virus, the health department appealed. “If we continued to be careless, the facilities for treatment for Covid will fall short,” said health minister Raghu Sharma. The hospitals are witnessing more admissions for Covid treatment in comparison to March. “Daily, over 100 patients are getting admitted to our hospital. Patients are coming with pattern of pneumonia and out of those almost half of them require oxygen support,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, dedicated Covid-19 RUHS hospital, where over 550 beds are already occupied. Almost a month ago (from March 11-17), the city had reported 303 new infections and no death was reported. But, since then the situation continued to change and the cases continued to increase every week. From April 8-14, in just seven days, the city reported 6,005 new infections and 19 people lost their lives. From March 11 to April 7, only six people died of Covid in the state, but in past seven days, the figure of deaths increased significantly. Areas such as Malviya Nagar, Vaishali Nagar, Jhotwara, Sodala, Vidhyadhar Nagar, Pratapnagar, Jagatpura, Shastri Nagar and Mansarovar, which were worst affected due to Covid-19 in the first wave, are worst-affected in the second wave too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-reports-over-1k-covid-19-cases-for-the-first-time/articleshow/82072963.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

Two critically ill women were among the four who had died at the CCC in the absence adequate treatment and oxygen supply, it has been alleged. It’s also learnt that another woman had died while being shifted to a hospital in Nagpur. The patients had been accommodated at the CCC after making them sign consent forms as they were unable to find beds elsewhere in any city or rural Covid hospitals. After their death, one of the angry relatives had ransacked the hospital premises. Apart from Bijwal, the other two members of the committee are civil surgeon (CS) Dr Ravindra Paturkar and district health officer (DHO) Dr Deepak Shelokar. The committee will submit probe report to the collector. Thakare said serious patients with low oxygen saturation levels were not supposed to be accommodated at the CCC, which is meant only for preliminary Covid management treatment. “The DHO and the CS had briefed doctors at the CCC not to admit patients with severity, but we need to see who had taken the decision to allow the admission of the patients who had several health complications,” he said. “The committee will scrutinize documents and record at the CCC and report me within a day or so for further course of action,” said the collector. “There was oxygen arrangement at the CCC, but it cannot be used to treat serious patients,” he said. Thakare said he would soon inspect CCCs and other Covid facilities in the district. “We have to learn a lesson from the incident (at Kandri) and prevent recurrence,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-member-panel-to-probe-covid-deaths-at-kandri-ccc/articleshow/82072964.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Kanpur||Kerala HC bench overrules 1972 judgment||The court had then held that under no circumstances can a Muslim marriage be dissolved at the instance of the wife, except in accordance with the provisions of the Act. In its judgment, the division bench of Justices A Muhamed Mustaque and C S Dias analysed four major forms of dissolution of marriages as recognised under Islamic law and protected under the Shariat Act at the instance of the wife — talaq-e-tafwiz, khula, mubara'at and faskh. "On an overall analysis of the scheme of the Shariat Act as well as the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act as above, we are of the considered view that the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act restricts Muslim women to annul their marriage invoking faskh except through the intervention of the court." "All other forms of extra-judicial divorce as referred in Section 2 of the Shariat Act are thus available to a Muslim women. We, therefore, hold that the law declared in K C Moyin's case (supra) is not good law," the court said in its judgment on April 9. While talaq-e-tafwiz allows the wife to dissolve the marriage if her husband fails to keep his end of the marriage contract, khula allows her to unilaterally divorce her husband by returning his dower. Mubara'at deals with dissolution by mutual consent while faskh allows dissolution with the intervention of a third person such as a qazi. On the jurisdiction of the family court in matters related to extra-judicial divorce, the division bench noted that Explanation (b) of Section 7(1) of the Family Courts Act confers the family court with the jurisdiction to declare the matrimonial status of any person. It said there is no difficulty for the family court to endorse an extra-judicial divorce to declare the matrimonial status of a person. The division bench said in the matter of talaq, khula, mubara'at, talaq-e-tafwiz, the family courts shall entertain such applications moved by either of the parties or both parties to declare the marital status of such parties. It said in the matter of unilateral dissolution of marriage, invoking khula and talaq, the scope of inquiry before the family courts is limited. "In such proceedings, the court shall record the khula or talaq to declare the marital status of the parties after due notice to other parties. If any person wants to contest the effectiveness of khula or talaq, it is open for such aggrieved persons to contest the same in appropriate manner known under law," it said. The court said in the matter of mubara'at and talaq-e-tafwiz, on being satisfied that the dissolution is being effected on mutual consent, the family court without further inquiry shall declare the marital status. "We notice family courts are overburdened with a large number of cases. The family court therefore, shall restrain from adjudicating upon such extra-judicial divorce unless it is called upon to decide its validity in appropriate manner." "The family court in such matters shall endeavour to dispose of the cases treating it as uncontested matter, without any delay by passing a formal order declaring the marital status," the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kerala-hc-bench-overrules-1972-judgment/articleshow/82073766.cms||---

The figures exclude RT-PCR reports of tests done on Kumbh attendees on April 13 and 14 as those are pending. According to the state health department data, in Haridwar district, some parts of which come under the Kumbh Mela site, 2,167 have tested positive in the same time period. According to the CMO, since April 10, the health department has conducted a total of 2,28,650 tests at the mela site, including antigen, RT-PCR and TrueNat. The CMO added that tests are being done at Haridwar, Pauri, Dehradun and Tehri. As per directives of the Centre and Uttarakhand high court, a minimum of 50,000 Covid-19 tests need to be done at the Kumbh site every day and pilgrims need to show a negative RT-PCR report to enter mela premises. It's a different matter that on the ground this is almost impossible to be implemented. But at 14 lakh, Wednesday’s shahi snan saw the lowest footfall among all three shahi snans (the figure was upwards of 30 lakh on each day). Inspector-general of police Sanjay Gunjayal, in charge of the Kumbh, said the low footfall had been a blessing of sorts as crowd management was easier. “Compared to the scuffles and stampedes of shahi snans at the earlier Haridwar Kumbhs in 1986, 1998 and 2010, this one was more organized. In the 2010 Kumbh, a total of 1.60 crore pilgrims had descended on Haridwar,” Gunjayal said. He added that security forces were now preparing for the next shahi snan and other events of the Kumbh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-1200-at-kumbh-test-covid-in-5-days-14l-turn-up-on-3rd-shahi-snan/articleshow/82071831.cms||Ishita Mishra

The FIR was registered under Section 380 of IPC. Amid the shortage of Covid vaccines, it is the first major lapse in security that has come into light. The two boxes of Covaxin were stored in an ice-lined refrigerator. The matter came to light after the hospital staff, who were taking care of vaccination, suspected that some doses went missing. They informed higher authorities about it. “When we came to know, we constituted a committee to look into it. For the last two days, the committee took stock of the vaccines and checked the available doses. As many as 320 doses were found missing. We have filed an FIR at Shastri Nagar police station after the committee’s findings,” said Dr L Harshwardhan, superintendent, Kanwatia Hospital. The committee interacted with the hospital staff and took their statements. Only after that, it came to conclusion that an FIR should be registered to find out who was responsible for the theft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/320-doses-of-covid-vaccine-stolen-from-kanwatia-hospital-fir-registered/articleshow/82072968.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Man killed in fight over mobile phone||RAJKOT: A verbal spat, over a mobile phone, between two youths of an extended family ended in a murder in the Rupavati village of Gariyadhar taluka of Bhavnagar district on Tuesday night. The 40-year-old, who paid the price for the petty fight with his life, was the father of one of the two youths involved in the heated exchange. Police on Wednesday booked four persons for the murder of Ramesh Unava. According to police, the deceased Ramesh was a resident of Rupavati village. Ramesh’s brother Gordhan Unava lodged a complaint against Devraj Unava, Jitu Unava, Raju Unava and Vipul Unava for the crime. “Ramesh’s son Kaushik had a verbal spat with accused Devraj’s son Jitu over a mobile phone on Tuesday evening. Later, Kaushik told about the incident to his family. So, Ramesh, along with Kaushik and two other members of his family went to Devraj’s home hoping to sort out the differences. But Devraj’s family allegedly attacked Ramesh and the three others,” Gordhan Unava said in his complaint. Ramesh was seriously injured in the attack and rushed to the Government Hospital in Gariyadhar town where he succumbed to the wounds. The others who were injured — Kanu, Dinesh and Kaushik — were referred to the civil hospital in Bhavnagar for further treatment. “All the accused are on the run.

The motorist was later arrested on charges of negligence. Around 9.30am on Tuesday, Santosh Naik was riding to work near Dahisar check naka from his Kandivli residence. Motorist Shivkumar Pillai (39) was on the north-bound arm of WEH at Mahakali bus-stop. He wanted to take a U-turn. Police said he was speeding and instead of taking a U-turn at a designated location, he tried to take a short-cut. “Pillai did not contemplate the consequences. As his car moved sideways, he rammed into Naik’s motorcycle from the rear end,” said a police officer. Naik was grievously injured in the accident. After the police control room was alerted a team rushed to the spot. Locals and police took Naik to a civic hospital, where he was declared dead before arrival. Dahisar police immediately arrested Pillai under Indian Penal Code for causing death due to negligence (section 304-A) and rash driving in a public way (section 279). Pillai was produced before a local magistrate court on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-motorist-takes-illegal-u-turn-kills-biker-on-weh-arrested/articleshow/82073845.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: With test-optional, UG applications for US rise 30%||MUMBAI: Even though admissions are still on, early estimates show that undergraduate applications from India for the US have risen by about 30%. This surge is largely driven by the fact that more universities have shifted to the ‘test-optional’ mode of admission — where test scores are not required to complete admission application. This, in turn, has allowed students to apply to universities that they wouldn’t have otherwise. According to the data shared by Common App with TOI, till March-end, the number of unique applicants (those that apply to multiple universities) residing in America increased by 1.54% compared to 2019–20, while unique applicants living outside the United States increased by 10%. Harvard University has received over 57,000 applications for the class of 2025 — a 42% increase from last year, when it received 40,248 applications. New York University, on the other hand, received more than 1,00,000 applications — a 20% increase over last year, and The University of California system nearly 2,50,000 applications — a 16% increase from last year. Incidentally, Boston University has seen a 10% increase in international applications while Tufts University has seen a 14% increase, and University of California system has seen a 10% increase in international numbers. New York University too has seen a 22% increase in international interest. Apart from China (-18%), applicant counts from most countries that typically generate largest volume of applications increased from 2019–20, said Jenny Rickard, president and CEO of Commonapp. “The shift to test-optional requirements in university admissions has driven a large increase in applications. For students applying for Fall 2021 undergraduate entry, the number of applications submitted through the Common App has increased but not the number of applicants. This suggests that applicants are applying to more schools,” said George Joseph, managing director of US-based Gyan Global Advisors. “There is a strong interest in elite and well-funded private and public universities because students feel they may have a chance without SAT or ACT,” Joseph added. Platforms like Leverage Edu has seen an increase in demand for international education from students even from tier 2 and 3 town, said its founder Akshay Chaturvedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-test-optional-ug-applications-for-us-rise-30/articleshow/82074801.cms||---

The in-principle approval of the master plan is the only regulatory hurdle now left to commence development work at the site, officials said. However, the regulatory body has asked Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL) to amend some parts of its master plan. And once the revised plan is vetted, BCAS will grant the final clearance, a procedural step that is expected to take 10 to 14 days, officials said. “Once BCAS gives in-principle approval to the master plan, the board of Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL) will issue a letter authorising the concessionaire to commence construction and development work,” said NIAL’s nodal officer Shailendra Bhatia. NIAL is the project proponent which will also facilitate the transfer of the 1,334 hectares of land to the subsidiary of Zurich AG to start work on the ground. Meanwhile, YIAPL has initiated the process of shortlisting and empanelling the construction agencies after floating its requirement on its website. Several international companies are likely to participate in the bidding process. It is estimated that the development of the first phase will require up to Rs 5,730 crore. However, in an emerging situation, the pandemic is disrupting the working of the government offices, including that of NIAL and aviation regulatory bodies in Delhi. “We are not opening talks with officials in Lucknow over the date of the foundation stone laying ceremony as the Covid situation is going out of control,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/airport-gets-security-nod-wait-now-for-plan-approval/articleshow/82073780.cms||Shalabh

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Covid surge leads to excessive demand of drugs leading to short-supply||NAGPUR: At a time when demand for Remdesivir injection is drawing all attention, supply of other commonly used drugs too is learnt to be under stress as the district is witnessing Covid surge in the last fortnight with more than 63,000 active cases in the district on Wednesday. Sources in Sandesh Dawa Bazar, which houses several pharmaceutical shops and mostly wholesalers, said Favipiravir used to treat Covid patients at the primary stage is not easy to get nowadays as the demand has shot up manifold. Going by the trends and expert opinion, the drug’s demand is further set to rise as the district administration has clamped down on the use of Remdesivir, which is still in short-supply list. “Hospitals would need to fall back on Favipiravir for many of their indoor patients whom they earlier treated with Remdesivir in the earlier stages. Even now, stock of Favipiravir is hardly remaining stable,” said a distributor and stockist. Murlidhar Kewalramani of Suresh Medical store at Gandhibagh said the stocks of the Dexamethasone and Enoxaparin drugs too are getting over in no time as there is an excessive demand. It’s also learnt that another common drug, Doxycycline, is too selling fast. “Doxycycline is one of the primary doses which is in high demand and most of the time hospitals and pharmacies have to wait, unlike last year when these drugs used to be easily available,” he said. Similarly, source said, Ivermectin too remains in short supply often along with Enoxaparin (used to used to prevent and treat harmful blood clots) and Neodrol (used to treat different inflammatory conditions). On the brighter side, the costlier Tocilizunab, which costs around Rs40,000, is likely to see a healthy competition from other brands which have released their products Alzumab and Itolozumab, which cost around Rs31,000 in the market. Sources stated many doctors have now switched to Alzumab and Itolozumab as they are readily available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-surge-leads-to-excessive-demand-of-drugs-leading-to-short-supply/articleshow/82072978.cms||Soumitra Bose

District election officer and Nalgonda district collector Prashant Patil and the SP advised people to undergo Covid-19 tests if they have any symptoms of the virus. The collector said out of the 3,500 tests that were being done everyday, at least 250 to 300 people were testing positive. Earlier, only 2% of people used to test positive, and it has reached 10% in the last couple of days. Election officials conducted training for web casting which will take place during the bypoll on April 17. Web casting wll be done in 173 polling stations.

We have serious objections to allowing two-wheelers on this trail route. It is a bridle path which locals and tourists cover on foot and it should remain so,” said Reenu Paul, founding president, Rajpur Community Initiative. Meanwhile, Anuj Gupta, chairman of MMC, told TOI that the eco-tax barrier is proposed just till the road branches off to the Makreti village. “Villagers have said that the setting up of the eco-tax barrier would put a check on the entry of anti-social elements. Efforts will also be made to restrict the entry and exit timings of visitors,” said Gupta. When asked about the demand to prohibit the entry of two-wheelers on the Rajpur-Jharipani trek route, Gupta said that two-wheelers would not be allowed to ply on this route. “Beyond the entry to Makreti village, we would develop suitable structures to prevent two-wheelers from going up to Jharipani,” Gupta assured. It must be mentioned that before a motorable route was constructed from Dehradun to Mussoorie, this trek route was the primary route for reaching the hill town from Dehradun. The path is also known as the Kipling Trail as author Rudyard Kipling used this stretch when he came to Mussoorie in the 1880s. Earlier this year, the tourism department had expressed plans to refurbish the trek route and develop it as a heritage walk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mmc-plans-eco-barrier-at-jharipani-rajpur-trek-locals-urge-for-ban-on-two-wheelers-on-the-trek-route/articleshow/82071850.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Chandigarh||A look at cases linked to Sirsa dera and their progress||Jalandhar: A close look at the major cases involving Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief or his followers — from blasphemy case of 2007 to Maur blast of 2017 in which seven innocent persons were killed — reveals that either he was allowed to go scot free or investigations have been tardy. The major trouble between Sikhs and Sirsa dera chief started, within three months after Parkash Singh Badal led SAD-BJP came to power, when he allegedly imitated 10th Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh. He was booked under sections 153 A and 295A of IPC in May 2007 at police station Kotwali Bathinda. The case had led to widespread protests by Sikhs across Punjab. The bad blood this caused also led to loss of lives from both sides. However, chargesheet was never presented in the court in this case even as earlier a senior Punjab Police officer had submitted an affidavit in Punjab and Haryana high court that the case was registered against dera chief only after investigations and they had evidence to prosecute him. Then just a a few days before Punjab assembly polls in 2012 police filed cancellation report in a Bathinda court. Finally, in August 2014, Sirsa dera chief was discharged by district and sessions Judge Batinda on the ground that chargesheet was not presented against him in stipulated time. Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar and Jalandhar Cantt MLA Pargat Singh have been on record stating that roots of the sacrileges were in letting off Sirsa dera chief in blasphemy case even without prosecution in 2014 and this had emboldened him and his followers. Pargat and a few Sikh groups had even written to Punjab CM Amarinder Singh to reopen the case. Pargat in his letter last year urged the CM that a petition filed by advocate Jaspal Singh Manjhpur challenging dera chief’s discharge was pending in high court and the CM should get all the details of the case through advocate general and issue instructions to take all measures to get the case reopened so that not only dera chief could be punished but also the entire conspiracy was brought out. However, nothing happened. When contacted Manjhpur confirmed that case was still pending in the HC. Ten months after he was let off in the blasphemy case even without prosecution, Bir of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala gurdwara in beginning of June 2015, later sacrilege happened in October 12, 2015 and then two days later police firing at Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura took place. Around the same time sacrilege also took place in villages Gurusar and Malke. Punjab Police arrested two Amritdhari brothers in the Bargari sacrilege case and claimed that there was foreign hand behind the case. Later, it came out that it was a false implication and police claims fell flat and later case was shifted to CBI which also failed to nail any accused. Three years later, in June 2018, after Bargari mocrha was started by parallel Akal Takht Jathedar Dhian Singh Mand, all the three major cases of sacrilege were traced to Dera followers by then deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra-led SIT. Khatra-led SIT had cracked the Maur blast case in February 2018 and traced it to Sirsa dera and even identified three suspects, who have already been declared proclaimed offenders. The SIT had found that the car used in the blast was car used in the terror act was painted and prepared in the workshop of Sirsa Dera head where only latter’s cars were modified or repaired. Though for full one year Congress, SAD, BJP made noise around Maur blast and Sukhbir Badal had blamed hobnobbing between Sikh radicals and AAP for this, but after the case was traced to Sirsa dera political parties, barring AAP and its rebel camp led by Sukhpal Singh Khaira, turned completely silent on the case. In September last Punjab and Haryana high court expressing its displeasure over main accused remaining out of police net had directed the SIT of the Punjab Police to make all efforts to arrest the accused in two weeks. The HC had held that challan had been put up before the trial court on January 29, 2020. Currently, additional director general of police, law and order, Ishwar Singh heads the SIT in Maur blast case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/a-look-at-cases-linked-to-sirsa-dera-and-their-progress/articleshow/82073778.cms||IP Singh

And with the number of vehicles increasing with each passing day and barely 500 cops to manage the roads, the Noida Authority has decided to set up more traffic lights in the city.Officials said that the traffic cell of the Noida Authority will begin a survey of the newly developed sectors and localities from mid-May to find out where signals are needed. The Authority will also rope in an agency to maintain the signals that are not working at present. Of the 86 signals installed across the city, nearly 30 are not working at present.SC Mishra, the in-charge of the Authority’s traffic cell, said, “The maintenance work of the signals is handled by the electric and maintenance department. Survey work will focus on identifying spots and localities where signals are needed. We have got requests to add more signals in 7X sectors. Some intersections between Parthala Chowk and Sector 115 have to be covered as well.”The Noida Authority has, in fact, outsourced the work of repairing and maintaining the signals to two private agencies — Onnyx Electronisys Private Limited and Ascent Traffic and Media Solutions. But the two agencies cover only 40 locations while the other 46 ones are managed in a random manner. Officials said that the problems are reported from these 46 locations, which are yet to be covered. In fact, this week only, commuters have reported snags in the signals that have been put up in D Block of Sector 30 and A Block of Sector 62. The wide 4-km long carriageway between Parthala Chowk and Sector 115 that is also part of the Faridabad-Noida-Ghaziabad expressway, also needs traffic lights. “At least 10 to 12 new locations will be covered within the next few months. The Authority has to provide Rs 8 lakh to Rs 10 lakh to the contractors for putting up signals at an intersection,” an official told TOI.Residents have welcomed the move, but say that proper planning is required before that. “Traffic volume on a stretch needs to be studied before signals are put up,” said Brajesh Sharma, a resident of Sector 78. “A signal has been established close to Civitech Sampriti building recently. The waiting time is too long and that many commuters do not use the stretch at the moment. A lot of fuel is wasted. Timings need to be revised as per the traffic volume on a regular basis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/1/3rd-of-traffic-signals-defunct/articleshow/82073775.cms||Shalabh

The court was hearing the bail plea of K Thambiraj, who was arrested by the Thirumangalam Town police on February 11. The petitioner had helped a man to withdraw Rs 5,000 each for four times from an ATM centre in November 2020. After withdrawing a total of Rs 20,000, the petitioner handed over the ATM card to the man. After nearly one month when the man checked his bank account, he noticed that Rs 78,000 was withdrawn from his bank account. The man also realised that Thambiraj had switched his ATM card and gave him another card. The counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that he was not involved in any such offence as alleged by the prosecution. Hence, he sought to grant bail to the petitioner. The public prosecutor submitted that there were 15 such cases against the petitioner in various other police stations. He objected to the grant of bail to the petitioner since the investigation is pending in this case. Taking into account that there were 16 cases against the petitioner including the present case, Madurai principal sessions judge P Vadamalai dismissed the bail plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/court-denies-bail-for-atm-card-theft-accused/articleshow/82073784.cms||---

Local manufacturing will kick in from July-September quarter, top officials of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories said on Wednesday. “The first batches are going to be produced by RDIF (Russian Direct Investment Fund) and will be imported to India by us,” Dr Reddy’s Laboratories co-chairman and managing director GV Prasad said. Sources added that RDIF could begin shipping the doses from Russia as early as mid-May once the vaccine batches are tested and approved by Indian regulators. Dr Reddy’s has a contract with RDIF for distributing 125 million people equivalent doses (250m units comprising 125m doses each of vectors Ad26 and Ad5 to be injected 21 days apart). This would be a combination of imports and locally manufactured doses and can be increased subject to mutual discussions, Deepak Sapra, CEO APIs & pharmaceutical services, Dr Reddy’s Labs said. Most vaccine doses made in India will be used in India till vaccine availability eases. Only after that will Sputnik V exports start from India, Sapra said. Sapra also indicated that about 60-70% of the global production of Sputnik V will come out of India, where six manufacturers have been tied up. Dr Reddy’s Labs has entered into a contract manufacturing tie-up with Bengaluru-based Shilpa Medicare for manufacturing an undisclosed quantum of doses. Sapra said the vaccine has a shelf life of six months and while ideal storage temperature is -18 to -22 degrees C, the firm is in the process of generating additional stability data on +2 to +8 degrees C range. “This data will be available in a few months after which we will make the necessary amendment request to the regulator for storage condition to be modified to 2-8 degree C, which will make the process of storage and transportation easier,” Sapra said. The firm has been testing cold chain through simulation scenarios from Hyderabad as far as Manipur in North East, Ladakh in north and Tamil Nadu in the south. It has lined up cold chain infrastructure to ensure temperature of -18 to -22 degree C is maintained from factory to the transportation from Russia to India and from global distribution centre in Hyderabad to various parts of country through air and road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sputnik-rollout-to-start-with-imports-this-quarter/articleshow/82073001.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

According to Khattar, Ambedkar had opposed inclusion of Article 370 in the Constitution so as to uphold the political integrity, unity and diversity of the country. The CM was speaking as the chief guest at a programme organised on the occasion of 130th birth anniversary of Dr B.R Ambedkar held in Haryana Vidhan Sabha.. Vidhan Sabha speaker Gian Chand Gupta said, “This is the first time that the birth anniversary of Babasaheb is being celebrated in the assembly premises after the installation of his statue.” Khattar said Babasaheb always believed that only through education the person standing last in the queue can be brought into the mainstream. He said Ambedkar served as the chancellor of a law university and also served as the chairman of governing body of Delhi’s well-known Ramjas College. He was a known educationist who always spoke about the importance of education, added chief minister Khattar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khattar-pays-homage-to-ambedkar/articleshow/82073857.cms||---

Earlier this week, the state postponed the HSC and SSC examinations to May and June. But most parents and students have demanded that the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education consider promoting students on the basis of internal assessments. “Now that the CBSE has said it will promote its class X students based on internal assessment or objective criterion, we will study the option and speak to experts to understand its viability,” said Gaikwad. State board teachers in the city said their students would get a raw deal if exams are conducted. “In Maharashtra, all students compete for junior college seats unlike in other parts of the country where they usually continue in school after class X. If the CISCE also goes the CBSE way, state board students would be at a disadvantage while competing for college seats,” said a teacher. Parents too have called for a uniform policy. “Since all students will compete on a common platform next year, they must be evaluated on similar lines. The central government must intervene,” said Anubha Sahai, member of the India Wide Parents Association. Last year, the state board cancelled the last SSC paper (Geography) and awarded average marks based on performance in other subjects. CBSE and CISCE too cancelled a few pending exams and awarded marks based on internal assessment and papers students had appeared for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-amid-calls-to-scrap-board-exams-state-says-it-will-consult-experts/articleshow/82073790.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar

For almost a week we have begun sending 100% of our supply for medical use. We’ve been supplying centres in Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar and other parts of the state based on the requirements listed by the state authorities.” Earlier, about 70% of oxygen supplied from Patel’s plant went for medical use while the rest was used for industrial purposes. The scenario is similar for a distributor in Anand. “For a fortnight, we have been supplying 550 cylinders to hospitals and nursing homes only. Our supply goes to all of Anand district and major and small hospitals nearby,” said Kiran Patel, founder, Santram Gas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/o-factor-units-push-to-produce-medical-gas/articleshow/82072981.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The district has so far managed to meet the oxygen demand by sourcing it from Bhilai and by reducing industrial use. Now, the administration wants to create sustainable stock for the coming days as Covid surge seems to spiralling out of control with more than 63,000 active cases on Wednesday. Sources from the district administration stated that Gadkari, while chairing a meeting with district officials earlier this week, had suggested that the oxygen generation and utilization capacities of steel and iron ore plants in Vidarbha and surrounding places must be explored if it could be used for clinical purposes too. It is learnt that Gadkari himself called up a few industrialists and sought their opinion. The Union minister had also arranged for three tankers of liquid oxygen from a company in one of the southern states. This, after the Nagpur district officials told him on the difficulties of procuring oxygen from Bhilai. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra task force for Covid has issued guidelines on the rational use of oxygen during the pandemic. It has urged the medical fraternity to postpone routine surgeries and procedures where oxygen is needed. It has also issued instructions to reduce wastage through leakages and also ensure optimum use. The hospitals have been asked for form an oxygen audit committee and also not use high flow nasal oxygen machines (HFNOs).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkari-push-sends-district-team-on-oxygen-hunt-in-steel-plants/articleshow/82072994.cms||Soumitra Bose

Acting on a tip-off from People for Animal (PFA) activist Kaustubh Gawande, Wardha, that some people are involved in selling wildlife species, forest officials formed a team pretending to be buyers. They struck a deal and called the sellers at a place on Tuesday evening. The forest team waiting near the spot pounded on the sellers. Those arrested have been identified as Aditya Gangadhar Patil and Prashant Vasudeo Dhole, both residents of Kapil Nagar (Nari Road), and Tushar Dilip Shimpi, Mhada Colony. The team led by honorary wildlife warden Ajinkya Bhatkar, RFO Vijay Gangawane, forester Mangesh Patil, PFA activists Swapnil Bodhane and Ashish Kohale, raided the houses of the accused and seized seven Plum-headed parakeets, two roofed turtles and one Singapore turtle. These species are listed under Schedule IV & I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Bhatkar said the birds and turtles were handed over to the Transit Treatment Centre (TTC) at Seminary Hills. Bhatkar said, “Selling wildlife species seems to be flourishing trade in the city. Many youth and pet shop-owners are involved in the illegal trade and the nexus needs to be broken.” Kohale said, “There is a spurt in trade of wildlife species even on online and social media platforms. There is a need to curb this trade by strict enforcement. As there is no regular action against such traders, the illegal trade is going on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-held-for-trafficking-parakeets-turtles/articleshow/82073898.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Agra||As UP prepares for rural polls, top farmer leaders turn star campaigners||AGRA: Away from the protest sites, it’s been a busy time for farmer leaders. For four months, they have been at the forefront of the farmers’ agitation in western UP and Delhi. That political capital, panchayat poll candidates have realised, could make a difference in the first electoral test in the region since farm protests began. “Candidates from different parties are approaching us for support,” Kuldeep Pandey, national president of Bharatiya Kisan Union - Swaraj, said. “Our agenda is to oppose BJP because of the farm laws. We are supporting candidates with clean images and good prospects of winning who have backed our cause during the farmers’ movement against the three farm laws.” Agra-based farmer leader Chaudhary Ramveer Singh added: “We are going village to village to help candidates who have been associated with us. It is farmers vs BJP this time.” Rajveer Lawaniya, Agra district president of BKU (Tikait), said, “We are backing candidates who have been supportive and have been working for the welfare of farmers. We support whoever is the strongest candidate against BJP.” Farmer leaders are not supporting any one party specifically but different candidates across the political spectrum. That is reflected in their speeches at campaign rallies, which skip party endorsements and stick to approval of individual candidates. “Ours is a fight against corruption and to resolve problems farmers face,” Pandey said at a rally. ‘Kisan Ekta Zindabad’ has been ringing out loud across parties. Candidates who have earned the farmer leaders’ support are counting on it to win. “I am optimistic. With help from Rajveer Lawaniya, things look good for me,” said Teekam Singh, a candidate for the post of Agra district council member from Ward 9. “When I get elected, my top priority will be to resolve the stray cattle menace that troubles farmers.” In fact, many farmer leaders have themselves joined the poll fray. Somveer Yadav, Pradeep Sharma and Mukesh Pathak are contesting for the post of block development council members. Former Armyman Ramnath Singh Sikarwar, who was the Republic Day parade commander at Chilla border, is contesting for the post of district council member. So is Savitri Chahar, Agra district head of BKU women's wing, who had joined the protest at Ghazipur border with 18 other women supporters. She said, “I had not thought of contesting initially. I had no money. But women in my area persuaded me to file my nomination. Now, I am getting overwhelming support, especially from farmers.” With this, farmers’ issues have, for perhaps the first time, upstaged caste dynamics in UP. “The farmer has become the central figure in this panchayat election. So, farmer leaders have become star campaigners. Candidates are trying to get farmer leaders on board, sharing selfies with them, and using farm union flags and slogans. For the first time, the caste factor has been sidelined,” Akola-based lawyer Dineshchand Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/as-up-prepares-for-rural-polls-top-farmer-leaders-turn-star-campaigners/articleshow/82070956.cms||Deepak Lavania

Between April 1 and April 13, the civic body claims to have disbursed 24,962 remdesivir vials to private hospitals alone, ideally meant for 4,160 individuals (if six vials are required for each patient), and most of these patients are on oxygen in the city. “Once the logistics are sorted out, hospitals will begin taking in more patients. This will cut the patients’ waiting time to a large extent,” said a supplier, who provides oxygen cylinders to 35 hospitals in the city. He added, “In our letter we have urged the government to ramp up production of oxygen cyclinders at two private plants in Gandhidham,” said one of the 10 members who had represented before the civic body. The suppliers claimed the average requirement of a below 30-bed hospital was around 9-10 cylinders for 6-8 ICU beds. Now, many mid-size hospitals have become Covid care centres and their demand has risen. On Tuesday, the demand was 11 times higher than on usual days. Fire chief on oxygen support Chief fire officer, Rajesh Bhatt has been shifted to a hospital after testing positive for Covid four days ago. Sources said Bhatt was put on an oxygen concentrator. “He is stable and receiving medication. He is currently admitted to a private hospital in Bodakdev ward,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/help-us-with-labour-transport-refillers/articleshow/82072991.cms||---

As against 1,450 beds in this Covid-19 hospital, there are 1,600 patients under treatment, resulting in a massive pressure on the staff as well as infrastructure. On Wednesday alone, 156 new patients were admitted. “We are trying to create 600 more beds in the next few days but there is a shortage of oxygen storage facilities. There is no meaning of admitting people if we are not able to provide them treatment,” Jamnagar district collector Ravi Shankar told TOI. There are 200 patients being treated in temporary beds acquired from the Indian Navy. These beds are also provided with oxygen facilities and per day consumption of oxygen is nearly 36,000 kilo litres. Owing to the massive influx of Covid-19 infected people, the entire hospital infrastructure, the biggest in Jamanagar, is exhausted and it will not be able to admit new patients for the next five days at least, said Shakar, requesting patients to opt for other hospitals for few a days. While the district administration could manage beds from other departments including dental college and Ayurveda hospitals, installing oxygen facility is the biggest challenge. The hospital’s out-patient department (OPD) is handling 600 patients per day. GG Hospital handles patients from Porbandar, Devbhumi Dwarka, Morbi, Rajkot, Junagadh and Amreli districts. According to sources, the state government is also trying to create more infrastructure in Rajkot and Morbi to stop the influx of Covid patients into Jamnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/1450-bed-gg-hospital-cant-admit-more-patients/articleshow/82071931.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Akali Dal factions may form new group||AMRITSAR: SAD (Democratic) and SAD (Taksali), the breakaway factions of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), will be putting up a united show ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Punjab, but leaders of the two parties are yet to take a call on whethere they merge the two political outfits or make an arrangement where they fight the polls together while keeping their individual identities intact. For long, rumours have been abound of a possible unification of SAD dissidents, who formed individual groups after differences over the importance given to them and their family members in SAD, led by former friend and long time colleague Parkash Singh Badal. To further their plans to take on SAD in the elections, the Taksali faction led by Ranjit Singh Brahampura and the Democratic faction led by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa had constituted their respective three-member core committees to iron out the details. The Taksali committee members include Karnail Singh Peermohammad, general secretary, SAD (T); Ujjar Singh Wadali, former MLA from Kharar; and Mohinder Singh Hussainpura, SGPC member. The Democratic faction’s core panel includes Jagdish Singh Garcha, former minister; Ranjit Singh Talwandi, former MLA from Khanna; and Chinder Pal Singh Brar, former additional advocate general. According to sources, committee members met in the recent past and contemplated on the possibility of a merger or forming a joint coordination committee while not compromising with the existence of their individual political parties. “The best option which has so far emerged is to dissolve both the parties and make a new political party and give important roles to Akali stalwarts to jointly take on SAD in the elections,” said sources, adding that if a new party came into existence Brahampura and Dhindsa could get the roles of patron and president, respectively. “The idea is to put up a united face before the beginning of campaigning to 2022 assembly elections. For this, the leaders as well as the cadre of both the parties are under immense pressure,” said Peermohammad, while talking to TOI on Wednesday. He said leaders of both parties had held a meeting about two weeks ago to contemplate on possibilities and the next meeting had been scheduled for April 17 in the house of Talwandi. He said they had yet to reach a decision on either forming a new party or making a strong coordination committee of both the parties ahead of assembly elections. Sources didn’t rule out the possibility of other splinter Akali factions coming under a single umbrella and making of political ‘adjustments’ with AAP and BSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/akali-factions-look-to-join-hands-exploring-merger-possibility-too/articleshow/82073846.cms||Yudhvir Rana

At present, 2,700 to 3,000 doses are being administered through the urban primary health centres. Inaugurating a three-day vaccination programme jointly organized by the Pazhamudhir Solai Thiruvarul Murugan Bakthasabai Trust and the corporation at Sethupathi School in North Veli Street, Visakan said that the number of infections in the second wave is increasing steeply unlike the first wave. A large number of people, who crossed 45 years of age got administered with a vaccine in the camp. Visakan urged those who got vaccinated to convince their relatives and people in their vicinity by dispelling rumours. He asked them not to be complacent after getting the shots. Everyone should wear masks and maintain social distancing irrespective of the vaccination status. A corporation health official said that camps will be organized at TNSTC depots, apartments, Sidco industrial estates, chamber of commerce and a separate camp for medical shopkeepers and workers, to cover more people. “There are 826 active Covid-19 cases in Madurai city as on Tuesday. The number of containment zones has increased to 22. The civic body is keenly following the influenza-like illness (ILI) cases reported in private hospitals. Contact tracing is being done efficiently. At least 60% of the cases reported daily are detected through contact tracing,” the official said. People are being monitored in containment streets to curb unnecessary movement. Only those who are going to work are being allowed to leave, upon showing their identity card, he said. He urged people to take advice from a medical practitioner if they have symptoms of Covid-19 before going into home isolation and quarantine. People should also come forward to inform the local health authorities. They can also approach medical camps conducted regularly. As many as 149 camps are being conducted everyday. Testing is being done anywhere between 2,300 to 2,500 a day by the civic body alone depending on the positivity rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corporation-to-scale-up-vaccination-drive/articleshow/82073842.cms||---

Although the channels are cleaned occasionally, there has not been any mechanism to prevent people from polluting the channels. Some of the channels in the city carry water from the Vaigai to various places, while some carry excess water from waterbodies to the river. Garbage dumping is taking place in almost all the channels such as Panaiyur, Avaniyapuram, Sottathatti, Managiri, Pudur, Thandalai, Villapuram and the Kiruthumal river. “People have developed a habit of dumping garbage into waterbodies. A mass-scale awareness campaign is required to curb the menace. But sadly, Madurai Corporation is turning a blind eye towards the issue,” M P Sankarapandi, an activist from Sellur, said. “They should monitor the menace and impose fine on repeated offenders. Otherwise, the waterbodies will be polluted further. We tried to reach out to people, but they are not cooperative,” he said. R Mugilan, a resident of Ismailpuram, said that some people are dumping debris into the channel making it difficult for the civic body to clean it. The civic body should form groups involving social activists to safeguard the waterbodies, he said. A resident of Anna Nagar said that collection of door-to-door garbage is not taking place regularly. They have no other choice, but to dump garbage outside.  “We erected fencing at a few places at Bethaniyapuram to prevent people from dumping waste into Avaniyapuram channel. But, people continue to dump waste,” a corporation official said. “We are working to bring down the number of dumper bins by improving door-to-door collection, which will be closely monitored in coming days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/garbage-dumping-rampant-in-channels/articleshow/82073831.cms||V Devanathan
---||Hyderabad||Nagarjunasagar bypoll outcome may alter political scenario in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Nagarjunasagar assembly constituency by-election has the potential to change the equations of political parties in the assembly. If Congress wins the seat, it would be a jolt to the ruling TRS on the political front and in the assembly too. Congress might stake claim to the main opposition party status in the assembly, which has been bestowed on All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) by TRS. Presently, AIMIM has seven MLAs, one more than Congress in the House. Veteran K Jana Reddy’s entry into the assembly would also make him a potential candidate for the TPCC president’s post. It would also check BJP’s claim of having emerged as an alternative to the ruling TRS. However, a senior official in the state legislature said that it would be the prerogative of the speaker to take a call on which party should be given the main opposition status in case two or more parties have an equal number of MLAs on their side respectively. If the electorate do not send Jana Reddy to the assembly, MIM, the friendly party of TRS, would continue to occupy the main opposition benches in the House and enjoy the status. But if Congress wins the seat, then both Congress and MIM would have seven legislators each. Congress floor leader in the assembly, Bhatti Vikramarka Mallu, who had earlier served as the deputy speaker of Andhra Pradesh assembly between 2011 and 2014, told TOI that there was no rule in the book which states that the second largest party should have 10% of the total strength of MLAs in the state. “We will definitely stake claim for the main opposition party status. It actually belongs to Congress as the merger of CLP into TRSLP is illegal and unconstitutional. The case is also pending in court. We had lodged a complaint with the speaker to disqualify four Congress MLAs, who had defected to TRS. Later, eight more Congress MLAs joined TRS on different dates. How can the speaker merge the CLP into TRS when our application seeking disqualification was pending with him before 12 MLAs got together and sought merger,” Bhatti said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nagarjunasagar-bypoll-outcome-may-alter-political-scenario-in-t/articleshow/82073865.cms||Roushan Ali

Thoothukudi MCH has 700 oxygenated beds and increased its oxygen tank capacity to 16 kilo litres from 10 earlier this week. The district is also focusing on CCCs so that oxygenated beds can be reserved for those in need of tertiary care. “CCCs will also be made available to asymptomatic persons without facility for home isolation,” Dr Senthil Raj added. Kanyakumari has 550 beds including 220 oxygenated at the government MCH, 500 in the other government hospitals and 500 more in private hospitals apart from 400 beds at two CCCs that are yet to be put to use.“Five hundred more beds will be ready at CCCs by this weekend. We have increased sample testing from 1,200 a day last week to 2,200 now,” collector M Arvind said. In Tenkasi district, the number of samples collected was 500 to 600 a day till last week, which has been increased to more than 1,000. “The number of persons testing positive is around 60 to 70 a day. Tuesday’s figure was high due to backlog,” says district collector G S Sameeran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tirunelveli-tuticorin-ramp-up-bed-strength-testing/articleshow/82073874.cms||M K Ananth

---||Mumbai||Allow fast & taking away of pious food in Mumbai : Jain trusts to HC||MUMBAI: Two religious trusts from the Jain community have approached the Bombay high court with an urgent petition to permit an Ayambil fast for nine days from April 19 to April 27, both days inclusive, and permission to “take away pious boiled cooked food from the premises of the religious trusts.” Shree Trustee Atma Kamal Lab Labdhisurishwarji Jain Gyanmandir Trust and Sheth Motisha Religious and Charitable Trust filed the petition with a main plea to quash the state diktat and allow them and “other 48 Jain trusts” to open their Jain temples with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in place.” The HC bench of Justices S C Gupte and Abhay Ahuja is expected to hear the plea on Thursday. The petitioners, invoking fundamental right to religion, say they are “aggrieved and dissatisfied” by the orders and advisories issued by the state to direct closure of places of worship across the state as a ‘break the chain’ measure. The petition says, “It is not only necessary but also in the interest of justice to take immediate steps for unlocking all temples and Upasharya with all necessary conditions, timings etc… The petitioners further submit that once religious worshipping places will open, each devotee will pray to their God for Corona Mukt Maharashtra and thus each devotee will become the warrior in battle against Corona.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/allow-fast-taking-away-of-pious-food-in-mumbai-jain-trusts-to-hc/articleshow/82074856.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Elgar case: Retired prof moves HC over UAPA charges in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Retired professor Shoma Sen, an accused in the Elgar Parishad case, has filed a petition before Bombay high court to challenge her prosecution under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Accused of alleged Maoist links, Sen claims the case against her is based largely on electronic evidence and has cited a February 8, 2021, digital forensic report by US-based Arsenal Consulting to contend that it affirms her suspicion that evidence relied on by the prosecution is planted. The prosecution had given co-accused Rona Wilson cloned copies of data it had seized from his computer during investigation. Wilson had, in turn, sent them to Arsenal Consulting last July. Police had cited “letters” found embedded in computers of some of the accused, including Wilson’s as evidence to prosecute them for offences under the UAPA. A report by Arsenal said Wilson’s laptop was “compromised’’ and that “the attacker responsible” had “extensive resources (including time) and it is obvious that their primary goals were surveillance and incriminating document delivery”. Sen’s petition is filed under Article 226 to invoke its extraordinary jurisdiction to do justice and also under CrPC Section 482 which empowers the HC to pass orders “to prevent abuse of process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/elgar-case-retired-prof-moves-hc-over-uapa-charges-in-mumbai/articleshow/82073905.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Class 12 delay likely to derail entrance tests||MUMBAI: The decision to postpone CBSE Class 12 exams is likely to have a cascading effect on admissions to engineering and medical colleges this year. While the Centre plans to review the Covid-19 situation on June 1 to decide on the exam dates, students are worried JEE (Advanced) for admissions to IITs and the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for medical exams may be pushed further too, in a repeat of the 2020 scenario. Last year, JEE (Main), JEE (A) and NEET were all held in September due to the pandemic and the resultant lockdown. With the academic session starting late last year, this year’s entrance tests have already been affected.JEE (Advanced) 2021, usually held in May, is scheduled on July 3, while NEET is on August 1. With the Centre’s decision to postpone Class XII board exams by over a month, parents are worried all these entrance exams will be pushed further, leading to a delayed start to the academic session this year too. A parent representative, Sudha Shenoy, said when the national lockdown was announced on March 23 last year, the state board exams were nearly over and only a few papers were pending for the national boards. “This year, the boards are yet to be conducted. We do not know when they will be held or when the results will be announced. There is a lot of uncertainty in the Covid-19 situation. The CBSE board will have to give a two-week notice before holding the exam in June. If it starts even in the third or fourth week of June, they may have to postpone JEE (Advanced) and NEET,” she said. “Even if the entrance exams are conducted on time, there will be delays in announcing the board results. Students require Class XII board scores to be eligible for medical admissions,” said Shenoy. Some of the parents are in favour of the board exams being held twice so that students who are unable to take the exam now can do so later. An IIT official said the Covid-19 situation is unpredictable. “The surge in cases has happened over a period of only three weeks. We do not know how things will pan out in June. We will have to monitor the situation before taking a decision,” said the official. Class XII CBSE board exam, if scheduled in June, is likely to clash with the current schedule of JEE (Advanced) on July 3. There is no announcement yet on the third phase of JEE (Main) scheduled in the last week of April. A parent said the National Testing Agency (NTA) may hold the exam as per schedule as students are anyway getting multiple attempts. Officials from the NTA were unavailable for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/class-12-delay-likely-to-derail-entrance-tests/articleshow/82074860.cms||Yogita Rao

Later it was suspected that he was killed by a crocodile. Soon after this incident, locals had demanded that the government undertake adequate measures to prevent tourists from venturing into the water.

Even though April is considered to be 'off-season' at Taj, the footfall still used to range between 12,000 and 15,000 daily during the pre-Covid times. Superintending archaeologist (Agra circle) Vasant Swarnkar said that the low turnout is probably due to the spike in Covid-19 cases across the country and the rising day temperatures. “Such a low footfall was last recorded in September 2020 soon after the lockdown-induced curbs were lifted,” he added. Data accessed by TOI suggest that the numbers were varying between 6000 and 7000 in the recent days due to the Covid surge and rumours of more restrictions. On April 5, 7890 tourists visited the monument and the number went down to 6477 the next day. On April 7, the footfall fell to 6227 but went up to 7122 the next day. During the weekend (April 10 and 11), the footfall was 7789 and 6839 respectively. Citing the falling number of visitors, Rajiv Saxena, vice-president of the Tourism Guild of Agra, said that the second wave of Covid-19 has practically ruled out the possibility of any revival of the tourism industry in the near future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/taj-sees-record-low-footfall-for-april-season/articleshow/82070981.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Congress goes on offensive in Sagar||HYDERABAD: On a day when chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao addressed a huge public meeting in Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency on Wednesday, Congress appealed to tribals and Dalits to drive away the ruling TRS by voting for K Jana Reddy in the April 17 bypoll. While AICC state in-charge, Manickam Tagore tried to invoke the self-respect of Telangana people, state Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said tribals that they were insulted by KCR when they had gone to submit a representation to him about Podu lands during his last visit to Nagarjuna Sagar. Manickam Tagore said preliminary reports from party cadres in the field suggests Jana Reddy has bright prospects of winning the by-poll. Uttam called upon the Dalits to teach a befitting lesson to the TRS “for beating up Dalit leader Manavtha Roy” and that one of the ministers had abused Dalits when they questioned him about unemployment allowance. However, energy minister G Jagadish Reddy said he did not abuse any Dalit and that the candidate was one of the Congress workers or could be a relative of Jana Reddy who obstructed their rally on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/congress-goes-on-offensive-in-sagar/articleshow/82073902.cms||Roushan Ali

My neck and head hit the steering wheel. I thought this was a dream. Seconds later, I realised it was real when I opened my eyes under water with the boat on top of me," he recalled while speaking to TOI over the phone on Wednesday. The 37-year-old fisherman who hails from Kannirajapuram village in Ramanathapuram district was among the two survivors of the boat which met with an accident involving the Singapore ship ‘MV APL Le Harve’ in the deep sea off Mangalore coast that left three dead and nine missing on Monday night.Among the three victims were his friend and boat captain Alexander, 38, his father-in-law Dhason, 65, of Colachel and Manickdhas of West Bengal while his relatives Palani, Balamurugan and Manickam are among those missing. Besides Velmurugan, Sunil Dhas of West Bengal also managed to survive the tragedy.They had set off for a deep sea expedition from Beypore on the boat ‘Rabah’ on Sunday night. "Around 10 pm, Alexander anna suggested that we head towards the deep sea off Mumbai. We all had dinner and 12 of us were in the boat’s cabin. Alexander handed over the steering wheel to a 27-year-old from West Bengal so that he could take a nap before being back at the wheels. It was raining and the wind was heavy. This is all I remember before falling asleep and the crash happened around 11.45 pm," he said.Minutes after being thrown into the sea, Velmurugan managed to reach the surface of in the dark. He swam in the direction of the impact to get help. "The powerful light from a high place made me realise we had hit a ship," he said. "The ship was searching for survivors and with their light I spotted the mangled remains of our boat and swam towards it. Sunil Dhas who was on the boat already threw a rope to me and dragged me on board," he said.The two men ran and rolled all over the top of the boat as they were tossed by the rough sea. The ship then spotted them and the crew lowered a rope for the men to climb aboard by 2 am on Tuesday. "They hit our boat but were compassionate enough to wait, search and rescue us. We were offered a new set of clothes, food. They checked our injuries, gave medicines and sprays for the swollen limbs and a place to sleep. The next morning the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) ship picked us from the Singapore ship around 7 am," he added.The ICG ship brought the two survivors and bodies of the three others to Mangalore. After checkup and first aid, Velmurugan was returning from Mangalore to Tamil Nadu on Wednesday night.The family of Velmurugan, who lost his wife, is happy that he is alive as without him his four children aged eight to thirteen-years-old including a dumb boy would have been orphaned. "Our mother died in an accident three years ago. We are happy that our father is alive. He could not talk much as he had throat pain and is in shock over the deaths he saw. We are waiting for him to return home," his elder son Thirumaniselvam, 13 said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/i-thought-it-was-a-nightmare-till-i-woke-up-under-the-sea/articleshow/82073920.cms||M K Ananth

Tallakulam police inspector Vanasundar said they have lodged a first information report against both BJP and VCKA police officer said VCK members opposed BJP members garlanding the statue and got into a verbal duel with them. Things turned violent when they started attacking them with stones and wooden logs. Paying heed to police requests, BJP members left the place, but VCK members chased them. BJP district president Maha Suseendran said that Thirupalai area functionary Velmurugan suffered injury in the incident and was sent to hospital in a 108 ambulance. He said VCK functionaries used foul language and chased them. However, they garlanded the statue two hours later after the functionaries left the place. Another police officer said BJP scheduled caste wing state president S Venkatesan has lodged a complaint against VCK district secretary Kathiravan, functionaries R Pandiammal, Mohana, Thamaraivalavan and 50 unnamed party cadres with the Tallakulam police station.

On the occasion, CM Rawat also announced a series of welfare measures for the Dalit-dominated area and said that he would personally look into the repairs of the community hall in the village. “The respect our prime minister has given to Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar in the last 6 years has not been done by any other leader or party in the last 70 years of Independence. We believe that all sections of the society must be given equal respect and status apart from putting an end to casteism,” he added. Similarly, Madan Kaushik said that all political parties consider Dalits merely as a vote bank except BJP. BJP worker Ram Prasad, at whose house the BJP functionaries dined in, told TOI that he was pleasantly surprised and overjoyed to meet the CM face-to-face. “He didn’t say anything and only smiled to me.

---||Hyderabad||Local leader, shopkeeper file plaints against each other alleging attack||Hyderabad: A video showing a local TRS leader and her supporters attacking a shopkeeper, for allegedly keeping his shop open beyond a self-imposed deadline by traders in Begum Bazar, went viral on Wednesday. Begum Bazar police said that they received a complaint and counter-complaint from both the parties on Tuesday and Wednesday. Police are waiting for the court’s nod to register a case. The video showed the woman TRS leader Shanti Devi, who is also Darussalam Dal Mandi president, along with few persons approaching a store and allegedly assaulting a man seated in front of the shop. Later, two others in that shop were also assaulted. The three persons, who sustained injuries, were shifted to hospital for treatment. “There was unanimous decision among local shopkeepers in that area to close the shops early to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Since one shop was found to be open beyond 8pm, a few persons went and attacked the shopkeeper,’’ assistant commissioner of police (Abids Division) K Venkat Reddy said. The incident took place on Monday night. In a counter complaint, given on Wednesday, Shanti said that on Monday she went to the store and requested the shopkeeper to close it since it was already 9pm. “But the shopkeeper picked an argument and hurled abuses and later physically attacked me. After hearing about the assault on me, my brothers and few other association members came and a fight took place. It is not correct to take my party’s name since I went there as association president,’’ Shanti said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/local-leader-shopkeeper-file-plaints-against-each-other-alleging-attack/articleshow/82073009.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Admissions to degree colleges may be affected||MUMBAI: Degree college admissions in the state are likely to take a hit this year with Class XII board exams pushed to June. The surge in Covid-19 cases has forced the state and central boards to reschedule the board exams. While city colleges were able to start the admission process by July end last year, this year it is likely to be worse. “Postponing the state board exams for Class XII students was a wise decision, but the delay will pose new problems and challenges this year,” said principal of St Xavier’s College, Rajendra Shinde. Last year, Class XII board exams were almost over before the outbreak of the pandemic. Despite the delays, colleges managed to conduct admissions and start classes in September. “There were a few challenges in the assessment of papers, but it was somehow managed last year,” said a principal. Mumbai University had to curtail the summer vacation this year to ensure the delays in 2020 did not impact the academic session in 2021, but the delay in board exams has thrown a spanner in the works. Former chairman of National Institute of Open Schooling, Chandra Bhushan Sharma, said the government needs to think of innovative solutions. “With the surge in Covid-19 cases it may be difficult to hold exams, but it is also important to assess students. Many students take admissions to colleges abroad as well, and therefore, it is important to hold exams,” said Sharma, suggesting on-demand exams. “The NIOS has been conducting on-demand exams for several years and it is possible to allow students to take exams at a time convenient for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-admissions-to-degree-colleges-may-be-affected/articleshow/82073963.cms||Yogita Rao

But this year the situation is reversed. Despite the decrease in milk production, the procurement of Rajkot-based Gopal Dairy has increased over the past fortnight.This is mainly because of reduced offtake due to low demand and Covid-19 related restrictions that have cut down of the operations of local restaurants and hotels.“Many of the local milk producers used to sell milk directly to big hotels and restaurants. But with a night curfew in place and fewer people preferring to dine out, these local milk producers are selling the milk to us,” said Gordhan Dhameliya, chairman of Gopal Dairy.“Over the past 15 days, we are getting on an average 50,000 litres more milk. About 30,000 litres is from cattle breeders who used to sell directly to hotels and restaurants. Also, due to the closure of religious places, bulk milk demand has gone down that has impacted our sales. Our milk sale has decreased by 20,000 litres per day,” Dhameliya told TOI.Gopal Dairy, a member of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that markets the brand Amul, had been procuring average 5.15 litres of milk daily. On April 1 it procured 5.45 lakh litres and on Wednesday (April 14) the procurement was 5.84 lakh litres. Out of the total procured milk, Gopal Dairy processes 3.50 lakh litres of milk daily to make buttermilk, curd and ghee. The surplus milk is sent to GCMMF. Valamji Humbal, vice chairman of GCMMF said, “The overall milk procurement has not increased. But if the Covid-19 restrictions like night curfew continue, it may impact procurement next month.”The Amul Fed Dairy at Gandhinagar collects the surplus milk of all the federation to make milk products.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/eateries-shut-summer-milk-procurement-up-in-rajkot/articleshow/82071978.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

He was brought dead to Goa Medical College (GMC), as also a 62-year-old from Vasco. On Thursday, Goa’s mortality count rose to 858. Other deaths were that of a 38-year-old woman from Bardez and a 70-year-old man from Bicholim – who died in GMC. The woman did not suffer from any comorbid condition and died eleven hours after she was rushed to GMC, indicating a delayed diagnosis. She was diagnosed with an acute respiratory distressed syndrome (ARDS) as well also the 70-year-old man, but succumbed to the virus after four days of treatment. This is the first time in the past six months and since the second wave hit the state, that it has seen two cases in a single day, that patients were brought to the hospital dead. The third case is almost similar though the woman died few hours after she was brought to the hospital. Goa had faced a similar scenario post June 2020, as it witnessed cases climbing in the first phase of the pandemic. On Wednesday, Goa reported 473 new cases and 245 recoveries that pushed the count of active cases the 5,000-mark. The case positivity rate was 21%, the recovery rate dropped to 90.60%. The day saw 401 patients home isolated and 78 admitted to hospital. Meanwhile, urban health centres at Margao and Porvorim did not see relief and their cases continued to rise. Margao’s tally rose to 591 with the addition of close to 70 new cases, and Porvorim’s count rose to 484. Candolim primary health centre also reported a steep rise with over 30 cases. Its caseload was 344 while that of Mapusa was 341. Panaji witnessed a slight drop owing to recoveries being more than new infections. It has over 300 active cases, nonetheless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/active-covid-tally-breaches-5k-mark-4-deaths-reported/articleshow/82073914.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Covid-19 hits brain, survivors face nightmares, depression||HYDERABAD: Covid-19 has affected the general mood and mental health of about 35% of people who have recovered from the severe pandemic infection, say health experts. They say post-Covid-19 neurological symptoms range from nightmares, unknown fears, depression to mood swings. Though the mechanism of novel coronavirus attack on the brain and nervous system is yet to be decoded, viral manifestations are clear. In many cases neurological symptoms fade away in six months, but in a few cases, they may last beyond six months post recovery. According to Dr P Ranganadham, senior consultant neuro surgeon, Sunshine Hospitals, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, Covid-19 has affected both central nervous system and peripheral nervous system in varying degree. “Evidence in the last one year points that the pandemic virus has hit different parts of the nervous system. While loss of smell and taste are most common in infection stage, post recovery symptoms include sleep disturbances, depression, day-time sleepiness, headache, memory loss, mental fuzziness,” he said. He told TOI other issues are foot drop, muscle pain, cramps, fatigue, disinterest in work, numbness, disturbances of eye mobility and temporary vision loss. Dr Ranganadham suggested opening of neurological speciality clinics for post-Covid-19 complications. Tests like MRI of brain or spinal cord should be conducted. He, however, said recovery has been good though in rare instances complications like stroke and GB syndrome may arise. Dr Visweswaran Balasubramanian, consultant interventional pulmonology and sleep medicine, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad, said some neurological manifestations are seen in almost 50% of hospitalised Covid-19 patients. “Most common are severe weakness or myalgia, headaches, encephalopathy. Patients may manifest symptoms like dizziness, loss of taste, smell, and in few cases, even suffer from brain stroke, other movement disorders, and seizures,” he said. He said 1% to 3% of hospitalised patients develop strokes. Higher incidence is in severe Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-hits-brain-survivors-face-nightmares-depression/articleshow/82073016.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Goa||Goa: ‘With no other evaluation method, exams only option’||PANAJI: Covid-19 cases are on the rise in Goa, but on Wednesday chief minister and education minister Pramod Sawant said that the state has no plans to go the CBSE way and has decided to hold its Class X and XII state board public exams as scheduled. The Class XII exams are scheduled to begin from April 24. Educationists and parents, however, said that Goa has been left with little option other than to conduct the board exams as scheduled. The state government and Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, they said, have failed to strategise last year itself by taking into consideration the possibility that the pandemic will last beyond 2020. Former Goa Board chairman Jose Remedios Rebello said teaching-learning and evaluation methods were not altered post the pandemic, instead, the traditional teaching methods were continued in the online mode. “When children have hardly had any contact teaching, we want to have full-fledged exams. It does not make sense. Somehow the advisers do not seem to be advising (the state government) correctly,” Rebello said. He said teachers should have been empowered in teaching techniques which are a combination of online and offline methods. “In areas where no stable internet access is available, students of higher classes should have been given worksheets just as worksheets are given to primary school students. Similarly, evaluation methods should also have been altered by introducing quizzes etc. Students should have been evaluated periodically, every two months. The Board had to be prepared. We had to strategise properly, which was not done,” Rebello said. PR Nadkarni, another former chairperson of the Goa Board, said that though the state government is content in thinking it held the boards exams successfully in 2020, the number of Covid-19 cases at present is much higher. “CBSE is a trendsetter for any innovation and experimentation in academics and a decision by CBSE should force the state to at least give a good thought to its decision to go ahead with the board exams as scheduled,” Nadkarni said. Students who are set to answer the board exams and their parents said they would prefer the exams to be held as scheduled rather than go through the uncertainty of the exam being cancelled, in the absence of any other alternative strategy with the state government. “There is no alternative means at present to conduct the assessment if exams are not held. It is up to the chief minister now to provide sufficient medical facilities on standby. And, if a student is infected with Covid-19, then there should be arrangements for them to answer the paper again in time, so that their exam results are declared along with other students,” said teacher and parent Anant Pissurlekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-no-other-evaluation-method-exams-only-option/articleshow/82073925.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Kolkata||BT Road blocked after clash during bike rally||Kolkata: Actor and BJP candidate from Baranagar constituency Parno Mittra alleged that her rally was attacked during campaigning on Wednesday. In protest, BJP supporters staged a sit-in in front of the Baranagar police station, blocking the busy BT Road for half-an-hour, causing much distress to commuters. When police tried to evict the agitators, a scuffle broke out between them and cops. Later, Trinamool also demonstrated in front of the police station, to protest against BJP’s alleged atrocities. Hundreds of people returning home from work were held up on BT Road on Wednesday evening as the two parties blocked the Shyambazar-bound flank to register their protest at the Baranagar PS. Though the campaigns drew to a close at 5pm ahead of the fifth phase of poll, the protests continued till much later. Mittra, who planned a bike rally to mark the final day of her campaign, alleged the attackers belonged to Trinamool. She claimed the rally took off from the BSF camp near Alam Bazar and was on its way through Baranagar, when the attack took place in Satin Sen Nagar area around 1.30pm. Videos shared by BJP showed the two sides coming to blows, one BJP worker being assaulted and his clothes torn. Mittra lodged a complaint. “First, they blocked the way. Opposed, they attacked our workers with bamboo. Some of them rushed towards me, climbed on my car and harassed me. We demand their arrests,” Mittra told TOI. Denying the charge, Trinamool alleged Mittra had instigating the violence. “BJP flouted the ban on bike rally. I had complained to police but there was no action. BJP men attacked our supporters during the bike rally,” said Trinamool MLA Tapas Roy. He was campaigning at Bonhooghly-Tobin Road area when he learnt about the incident and took a rally to the police station. Dum Dum MP Saugata Roy and Tapas lodged an FIR at the Baranagar PS. “They are lodging FIRs against our key polling agents and supporters after attacking them on the instigation of their candidate,” said Tapas. “We have received complaints from both sides,” a senior officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bt-road-blocked-after-clash-during-bike-rally/articleshow/82073027.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

---||Nagpur||Mood swings, irritation, aggression, hopelessness...||NAGPUR: While getting a bed is a big challenge, staying mentally strong in ICUs and Covid-19 hospitals is a bigger challenge for patients. TOI spoke to some patients who were recently discharged after being in the ICU for more than two weeks. They said fighting Covid-19 is also a mind game. “On the third or fourth day of my ICU stay, I had gone almost mad. I screamed at nurses and called out to the doctor as I was coughing relentlessly. Finally, the doctor came and consoled me. The next day I felt embarrassed because of my behaviour,” said 68-year-old Sudha Khisti, who was in hospital for 16 days. She said no communication with family members is the biggest problem in Covid hospitals. IMA functionary and community medicine expert Dr Sanjay Deshpande said that hospitals should think of introducing some innovative steps like one meeting a day with a family member. “With full protection and PPE kits, one family member should be allowed to visit patient in the ICU once a day. This will definitely bring some good results,” he said. At present, hospitals discourage relatives from meeting patients in Covid wards. In some cases, they allow visits by relatives only if the patient is critical. “What is the point in sending my relative to meet me when I’m already on the death bed,” said Sanjay Jagtap, who was in the ICU for 12 days. “I was feeling lonely after 3 days in hospital. Covid shows different symptoms daily. Cough one day, headache the following day, fever, stomach ache and much more. You start feeling hopeless,” he said. Doctors said these are known facts. “Studies state that 75% of Covid patients experienced increase stress. Multiple factors play a role in patient attitude, including uncertainty of disease progression, strict restriction of visitation from family members and inability to develop open connection with healthcare workers due to use of PPEs,” said Dr Nitin Shinde, an infectious disease specialist. “We are trained to handle such patients who experience irritation,” said intensivist Dr Kunal Javade. “Female patients with co-morbid conditions become angry and sometimes aggressive or abusive. It’s all right for us. The psychological impact of Covid-19 is the same worldwide,” he said. Doctors said that first-time hospitalization patients face more such issues. “Majority of the patients of Covid-19 are hospitalized for the first time in their life. Some of them land in ICU for the first time. Doctors fully covered with PPEs and constant monitoring of health through machines increase their anxiousness,” said a doctor from GMCH’s Covid ward. WHAT PATIENTS SUFFER FROM... · Distinct mood disturbance, women are more in this category · Increased mental stress during Covid admission compared to non-Covid admissions · Increased anxiety due to uncertainty disease progression · Absence of family, loneliness in isolation rooms · Absence of human touch, human face due to PPE kits etc. EXPERTS SAY... · Relatives should be allowed to meet at least once in 48 hours by wearing PPE kits · Stop wasting money on surface cleaning, PPE kits · Focus on air movement, masking, social distancing and vaccination||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mood-swings-irritation-aggression-hopelessness-/articleshow/82073022.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

When my son and his wife complained to our neighbours, they started misbehaving with them.” The next day, Lamba lodged a police complaint against it. “To settle the grudge, Maninder, Raju and Jot, who were armed with sharp-edged weapons, and their accomplices, who had bricks, barged into our house at night. They thrashed my family and vandalised our house,” he added.Sadar police station ASI Satinderpal Singh said a case has been registered under sections 456 (house trespassing), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapons), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/armed-neighbours-assault-family-after-tiff-over-pet-dogs/articleshow/82072006.cms||---
---||Delhi||Bad flour sends over 500 rushing to hosps in 2 cases; FIRs registered||New Delhi: At least 540 people in Kalyanpuri and adjoining areas of east Delhi went to Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital late Tuesday night with complaints of vomiting, loose motion, nausea and weakness after eating buckwheat flour (kuttu ka atta) to break their Navratri fast. Six members of a family in Mehrauli also complained of similar problems after consuming kuttu ka atta. DCP (east) Deepak Yadav said, “In the Kalyanpuri incident, Bunty (31), the proprietor of Bunty General Store, has been arrested. He procured the flour from a man identified as Krishi Gopal, who has also been called for questioning.” The Mehrauli family had also bought the flour from a local general store. Two FIRs have been registered under IPC sections 273 (selling, offering, as food or drink, any article that has been rendered or has become noxious), 284 (any act, with a poisonous substance, in a manner so rash or negligent as to endanger human life) and 337 (causing hurt to any person as to endanger human life). Anil Kumar, a resident of Trilokpuri on whose complaint one of the cases was registered, said he, his wife Hemlata and their daughter had kept the Navratri fast and bought half-a-kg kuttu ka atta on Tuesday evening. “We all ate puris and slept. Next morning, I woke up with a severe headache and my body was trembling. My wife was also feeling the same and the daughter had a severe headache. We immediately went to the hospital and informed police,” said Kumar. Another resident, Deepak, who also bought the flour from the same shop, said, “My family members have been vomiting since morning.” A district administration official said most people had reported to the emergency at night and were discharged later. Around five persons who had more severe impact of food poisoning were admitted. “We received reports of people falling ill from Kalyanpuri, Trilokpuri and other areas and they said they had eaten kuttu ka atta. It prima facie appears to be a matter of food adulteration or sale of spoiled flour,” said an official. No reaction was available from Delhi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bad-flour-sends-over-500-rushing-to-hosps-in-2-cases-firs-registered/articleshow/82073996.cms||---

Modi said the NEP, unveiled last year, is “futuristic and as per global parameters”. He launched four books related to Babasaheb Ambedkar, authored by Kishor Makwana on the occasion. On NEP, he said students’ capabilities pose questions like what they can do? What is their potential if they are properly taught? And what they want to do? He said the answer to the first one is the inner strength of students. If institutional strength is added to inner strength, they’ll be able to do what they want to do.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nep-is-futuristic-as-per-global-standards-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/82075916.cms||---

The pre-monsoon showers resulted in three degree drop in maximum and minimum temperature to 35 and 20 degree Celsius respectively. Following cloud overcast for the past two days, light to moderate showers started lashing parts of the city at 4 am and turned the weather conditions cold and chilly. Two hours of thunderstorm activity led to waterlogging at many places that were eventually cleared by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) by 8 am. “I woke up to a rather chilly weather to have my Sehri. I am happy that Ramzan began on a cold and pleasant note,” said Arif Mohammed, a BTech student. As per the Telangana State Development Planning Society up to 8 am, 78 automatic weather stations in the city recorded rainfall Wednesday early morning. Of them, Rein Bazar recorded the highest rainfall of 36.3 mm followed by Sardarmahal 30.8, Asifnagar 28 mm, Lingojiguda 27.8 mm and Saidabad 24.8.

---||Kolkata||Madan hopes to win back ‘lost’ seat, BJP points at civic apathy||KOLKATA: Madan Mitra’s campaign in Kamarhati has been raising a new slogan: “Na mein Hindu, na mein Mussalman, sabse pehle mein ek insaan”. This time, the Trinamool veteran is up against two mammoth challenges—first, the growing religious and caste divide among voters and second, the increasing dissatisfaction even among staunch Didi-supporters over Kamarhati Municipality’s poor performance. Madan, a seasoned politician who has a separate fan base, is making every possible effort to clinch the turf a second time after 2011. In the last assembly election, he could not be part of the campaign as he was implicated in a Ponzi muddle though his family and party workers canvassed for him. Madan lost to Manas Mukherjee of CPM. “In 2016, I contested from this seat. The team and jersey were present. But, the captain was absent,” he said.  In the 2019 LS elections, the party made up for the loss and handed a lead of 17,725 votes to MP Sougata Ray in Dum Dum from Kamarhati assembly segment. This time, Mitra has been holding rallies, some with celebrities, including Dev, Mahima Chaudhry and Soham. But residents seemed upset with the poor infrastructure of the area. “Civic amenities of Kamaharti municipality are pathetic and roads are encroached upon. There is a drinking water problem in multiple areas and the drainage system is in a shambles. Every monsoon, several wards go under water for several days,” said Anirban Brahma, a resident of Feeder Road. CPM candidate Sayandeep Mitra pointed out he had got complaints about poor municipal facilities. “I have visited homes, where even in April, the water has not receded. Voters are terrified and alleged real-estate promoters are grabbing closed industrial plots. We have promised refugee colony residents will get government documents to prove their ownership. These people are living in fear as Trinamool leaders are threatening them with eviction and BJP pointing to detention camps,” he added. Sayandeep rued that the outgoing MLA, Manas Mukherjee, was not given a free hand to improve the area. “Though Kamarhati has been a strong Left bastion except in 2011, Manas-Da was restricted from discharging his duties as most of civic work was done by the municipality, in control of Trinamool,” claimed Sayandeep, a young face of the alliance. Aware of the poor performance of the civic body—it has 31 wards—Madan said he aimed to improve the infrastructure. “I have promised to set up a garment hub, which will employ 20,000 people. The local youth will benefit from the project. CM Mamata Banerjee has given the go-ahead to the proposal and we have identified a few plots. Teacher recruitment and building affordable English-medium schools are on the to-do list,” said the former Trinamool minister. Madan has been trying to bridge the divide among communities and religions in Kamarhati. Claiming he had registered mosques in his tenure, he said, “I have also set up several temples, that of Jagannatha, Laxmi and Durga. Now, the crossing is known as Mandir Marg,” said Madan, who was instrumental in setting up Sagore Dutta Medical College. Both Madan and Sayandeep were vocal about “outsiders” being brought in from Titagarh and Barrackpore before the election on Saturday. “It is a ploy to create trouble on the polling day,” said Sayandeep. But BJP candidate, Anindya Banerjee, popularly known as Raju, denied the allegation. “I will withdraw my candidature if they can prove my party’s involvement. I plan to restore peace in the constituency,” he said. Stating his priority was to remove political interference from local clubs he said, “Reopening closed industrial units, facilitating employment for the youth, and improving civic amenities are on my agenda.” He insisted a “double-engine government” would benefit people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/madan-hopes-to-win-back-lost-seat-bjp-points-at-civic-apathy/articleshow/82073082.cms||Somdatta Basu

From 21,558 samples, 5,993 tested positive and there were 57 fatalities. The fall was more significant in the city limits where nearly 1,000 fewer cases recorded mainly because NMC is conducting only rapid antigen test (RAT) to clear backlog of RTPCR samples. The city reported 3,712 positive cases - a decline of 963– and 35 deaths, which was one less previous day’s figure. The district’s overall testing also came down by nearly 9,000. Highest ever 29,122 tests were done on Tuesday. These included around 3,700 backlog RTPCR samples from GMCH and IGGMC labs. NEERI’s was the only lab without a backlog, yet it too was given a break as NMC decided to stop fresh RTPCR collections at its centres. Since March-end, citizens were unable to get the report within 24 hours and the delays prolonged to more than three days before the NMC stopped RTPCR testing till April 15. Of the day’s positive cases, 4,427 were reported from 10,913 samples processed at private labs. Compared to the heavy rush at NMC centres three days back, just 7,083 swab were collected for RAT there on Wednesday. in all 70,998 cases have been reported in the 14 days of April so far in the district. This month 742 deaths have been reported already, compared to 1746 in March and 1327 in September last year. Cases in April are also now higher than in all other months except March. The consecutive tally of over 5,000 cases took this month’s numbers closer to the entire March’s tally (76,250). Until the second wave hit the district, September with 48,457 cases had the highest cases reported in the pandemic. At the current rate of new infections, the district is set to cross three lakh cases, 50% of which have come in the March and April, and 6,000 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/daily-ve-cases-dip-by-over-800-again-as-labs-clear-backlog/articleshow/82073032.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Hyderabad||Face probe, come clean: HC to suspended judge||Hyderabad: The Telangana high court has advised a suspended additional district judge, who was arrested in a disproportionate assets case, to face the investigation and prove his innocence instead of asking the court to quash the ACB FIR against him. “Face the probe. Come clean. That is good for the judiciary as an institution,” said a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy. The judges said this while dealing with a writ petition filed by V Vara Prasad, additional district judge from Rangareddy district court. The ACB took permission from then acting CJ of the high court to proceed against him and arrested him in November 2018. Later, Prasad was placed under suspension by the high court. Describing the action of the ACB as without any basis, Prasad sought quashing of the case. The judges, however, felt that the petitioner raised hundreds of grounds in support of his claims which cannot be examined in writ jurisdiction. Knowing which way the court is proceeding, the petitioner’s counsel sought permission from the court to withdraw his petition. The judges permitted him while advising him to face the probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/face-probe-come-clean-hc-to-suspended-judge/articleshow/82074063.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Over 3,400 jump Covid bail, parole||NEW DELHI: At least 3,468 inmates of the three Delhi Prisons—Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli—who were released to decongest the jails during the pandemic are yet to return. Jail authorities have shared the details with police to ensure they are tracked and brought back. During the pandemic last year, 1,184 convicts were released on emergency parole out of which 112 are yet to return. Similarly, 5,500 undertrials were released on interim bail by courts out of which only around 2,000 have returned. Sandeep Goel, DG (Prisons), said: “A total of 1,184 convicts were released on emergency parole from the three jails last year. It was initially for eight weeks, which was extended from time to time. Finally, they were supposed to surrender from February 7 to March 6. Out of these, all have surrendered except 112. The prison department has shared a list of these 112 convicts with Delhi Police as well.” Goel further stated that a total of 5,556 undertrial prisoners (UTPs) were similarly released on interim bail last year by the orders of various courts. “Their process of surrender started from March 6 and most were required to surrender by the end of March. However, so far around 2,200 UTPs have only come back. A list of UTPs who have not surrendered has been shared with Delhi Police,” added Goel. Jail authorities said that they were also checking records as it was possible that some of the undertrial prisoners might have been given regular bail. On the other hand, the local police are also carrying out searches at their addresses to ensure they surrender and return to the jail. Each inmate, who returns to the prison, undergoes a mandatory rapid antigen Covid test. Soon after the test, they are sent for a 10-day quarantine at the temporary prisons that have been made near the Mandoli jail, irrespective of the test result. The jail administration had said that ever since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year, the prisons department remained vigilant and instructed its staff to not only maintain hygiene and social distancing, but also spread awareness about the infection among inmates in the three jail complexes. Earlier, the prison officials had said the situation could be more difficult to manage when the inmates, who were granted parole during the pandemic outbreak last year, would return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-3400-jump-covid-bail-parole/articleshow/82074075.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Covid bed mantra: Join the queue, wait for your turn||NAGPUR: Though many critical patients breathed their last even before finding a bed in hospital, not all hope is lost for moderate patients amid the gloom and ongoing crisis brought in by the second wave of Covid in the city. Relatives, doctors and social workers say there is still hope for patients who can hold it on for a day or so. ‘Have patience, join the queue and wait for your turn’ is the latest mantra amid the Covid crisis. A 40-year-old lawyer from Civil Lines had been frantically looking for a bed for his 28-year-old brother whose condition was gradually worsening at home since Tuesday. “I contacted around 12 hospitals starting with the closest from my home and later other parts of the city a day ago,” he said. The lawyer landed a bed for his brother in a Ramdaspeth hospital the next day. “The situation is not completely hopeless. It is not easy, but still we were happy to get a call as the wait list cleared,” he said. Respira Chest and Critical Care Hospital director Dr Vinit Niranjane said hospitals have been forced to maintain a wait list. “Unfortunately, when we call up wait listed patients, some have already expired by that time, some have found bed at other hospitals. Yet, after morning round, patients are discharged and new ones are added from the wait list or from the OPD,” he said. Activist Joseph George said there is hope for immediately starting 90-more beds in three day care centres which can come handy for many patients waiting for hospitalization. “The three day care centres at Shankar Nagar, Reshimbagh and Lakadganj have been proposed by us. Two are locations belonging to Trusts and we are getting a marriage hall free of cost. But the NMC has rejected the proposal,” he said. “The high court’s April 8 order had clearly mentioned that NMC commissioner must start day care centres at schools, marriage halls and at large public spaces. Medicines, oxygen and staff salary has to be given by the NMC,” said George. “We will arrange infrastructure and manpower,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-bed-mantra-join-the-queue-wait-for-your-turn/articleshow/82073052.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Cannot invoke Delhi order on mosques, state tells Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday dismissed a petition filed by Juma Masjid of Bombay Trust on its request to open the mosque at Janjikar Street so that prayers can be offered five times a day during the holy month of Ramzan“The state’s circular “is issued in public interest and for safety of all the residents of Maharashtra. In our view, offering of prayers only in the mosque as sought by the petitioner cannot be considered, in view of the ongoing critical Covid situation, which is serious in nature,” the order by Justices R D Dhanuka and V G Bisht said. The HC said that the state has, after considering the prevailing circumstances, found it “imperative” and “expedient” to enforce various measures throughout the state” from April 14, 8 pm to May 1, 7 am. The petitioners, a public trust, represented by advocate M A Vaid, cited an April 12 Delhi high court order that allowed mosques to be opened for Ramzan with proper social distancing and other safety measures in place. The mosque is spread across an acre and able to accommodate 7,000 people, “quite spacious,” and all SOPs meant to break the chain can easily be followed under supervision of local police, said the trust.  Additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan, opposing the petition, said the Delhi HC order cannot be invoked as the situation in Maharashtra and Mumbai is grave and on Tuesday alone, over 11,000 new cases were added in Mumbai and more than 65,000 across the state. She said, “Considering this critical situation prevailing in the state and more particularly in Mumbai… the state has rightly considered that all religious places of worship stay closed till 7 am on May 1.” The HC said Chavan “is right in her submission that the Delhi HC order cannot be considered a precedent in this case.” Chavan said no case is made out to invoke Article 25 of the Constitution for religious freedom. The HC had in the past rejected permissions for such religious ceremonies. This restriction is for all religious places and to members of “all communities and following whichever religion they follow,” she said. Clause 7, however, allows personnel to continue to perform their duties at such places of worship, though no outside visitor shall be allowed. The HC said the circular shows the state issued the order after being “satisfied that the State is threatened with the spread of Covid-19 virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cannot-invoke-delhi-order-on-mosques-state-tells-bombay-hc/articleshow/82074070.cms||Swati Deshpande

The Punjab mining department has taken the help of drones to carry out an investigation into illegal mining. Rahon is the same area that was spotted by chief minister Amarinder Singh in 2018, besides Phillaur, where some earthmover machines were engaged in illegal mining during the day on the Sutlej bank. It was only after he directed the Jalandhar and Nawanshahr DCs and SSPs that the district authorities swung into action and not only seized the machinery but also arrested 23 accused. Surprisingly, three years down the line, illegal mining activities have still not been stopped fully in this area. Another photo that was shared by Capt Amarinder Singh to highlight illegal sand mining in PunjabDhoke also directed the Khanna police to arrest the remaining accused involved in illegal sand mining case registered at Machhiwara police station last week. A wanted criminal, Gurinder Singh alias Ginda was arrested by the Khanna police on April 9 as he was found to be involved in illegal sand mining in Rahon. His accomplice, Karanvir Singh was arrested by Khanna police on Wednesday. During the course of the investigation, it was revealed by the accused that Raju Gujjar of Ratnana village, Dharamjit Singh of Shamshpur village, Dalvir Singh alias Bittu of Barsea village, and Pawan Singh of Bharta village were carrying out illegal sand mining in the Sutlej bed in Rahon near Shamshpur and Hadiwal villages.  The joint team of mining as well as police departments visited the affected area on Tuesday and carried out drone photography to know the extent of illegal mining in the two villages. The report submitted by XEN mining will become part of the investigation file. Dhoke has also directed Khanna SSP to expedite the investigation of the case and put up challan in the court on priority. Accused who attacked mining officer arrested Ferozepur police arrested the main accused Sukhchain Singh alias Chaina in a case of the attack on the mining officer Vipin Kumar Kamboj on the instructions issued by Dhoke.

It was on the night of March 4 that Kamboj raided on secret information at an illegal mining site at Gill Mudki village. When the mining officer along with his staff reached the spot, they saw that the road was blocked with a tractor bearing no PB 05 H 4158 and a trolley loaded with sand from an illegal mine. When a mining officer questioned them about the illegal sand trolley, Chaina along with some unknown persons attacked him and his vehicle was damaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/4-years-after-cm-flagged-illegal-mining-punjab-to-probe-extent-of-menace-in-rahon/articleshow/82073124.cms||---
---||Kolkata||BJP’s Mukul in fray after 2 decades, TMC’s Koushani eyes youth vote||KRISHNAGAR: One of the most experienced politicians in the state assembly election this year always wanted to remain a strategist. Mukul Roy had refused offers for ministry to stay more involved with organizational work. In 2019, he travelled across the state to campaign for candidates. Two years down the line, Roy is contesting the state election, apparently at insistence of Union home minister Amit Shah. Roy, Krishnagar North BJP candidate and national vice-president of the party, might be a reluctant contender but he keeps a tab on every political development here.  The last time he had contested an election was in 2001, when he lost to Forward Bloc’s Haripada Biswas from Jagaddal assembly constituency in North 24-Parganas. “It was a different situation in Jagaddal. Those people could not even vote. But this year, EC ensured people could cast their votes without any fear,” said a leader close to Roy. Roy remained a general secretary of Trinamool till 2017, before joining BJP. Asked if he liked being called the strategist of Bengal politics, Roy merely smiled. Instead, he said, “Mamata (Banerjee) is on a wrong path this time. She is going to lose it. BJP will get 200 seats.” Since morning, he had been busy with meetings at his election office as workers from shakti-kendras discussed poll preparedness. A makeshift office outside his room has been working with clockwork precision. In an adjacent hall, karyakartas were being trained for a Shah roadshow scheduled in a few days. The day BJP leaders in Delhi announced his candidature, Roy had left for Krishnagar and started on his strategy. He told reporters if the party wanted him to contest, he was ready to do that. In 2019 LS polls, BJP candidate Kalyan Choubey was ahead of Trinamool’s Mahua Maitra by 53,000 votes from Krishnagar North assembly segment. Yet, Roy is not complacent. Trinamool has fielded actress Koushani Mukherjee, a first-time contender, against the veteran politician. Leaving nothing unturned, Mukherjee has been campaigning since morning. The youngster is equally active on social media. “The campaign Koushani has planned, targeting especially the youth, is gaining momentum each day. Anyone can become a volunteer by filling a Google Form,” said a Trinamool leader. “He (Roy) is around my father’s age and I respect him. But it is also true we are contesting each other,” said Mukherjee a gathering in Krishnagar. “It is for the people to decide between Mukul Roy and Koushani Mukherjee. People know they are the safest under Mamata Banerjee,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjps-mukul-in-fray-after-2-decades-tmcs-koushani-eyes-youth-vote/articleshow/82073118.cms||Rohit Khanna

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Mixed reactions to cancellation, delay of CBSE board exams||NAGPUR: Students, parents, and teachers had mixed reactions when the long-awaited decision by CBSE regarding board examinations finally came in. While some appreciated cancellation of Std X exams and postponing the Std XII boards, some were against the decision. Talking to TOI, Devaang Kothary, parent of a Std XII student, said, “CBSE should take board examination as per old schedule because if it’s delayed then students preparing for entrances and other competitive exams will face difficulties. All exams will come at the same time, confusing students.” Criticising the decision, city lecturer Prerna Kotecha said, “I feel this decision is quite unfair for students who have studied and worked hard for their board exams. Std X is considered one of the turning points of career for students. The decisions kept changing which disturbed students too, and at this point students feel frustrated for having studied so much.” Vaishali Patil, principal of Sayona Public School, said, “Exams are the only way students push themselves to study. By cancelling exams, students will not be able to evaluate their weak points and interests in any way. I do not support the decision of completely cancelling the Std X boards. They should have been postponed exams like Std XII. Students and teachers have worked hard in online mode, and this is unfair to both.” However, students expressed relief at the government decision in view of the second Covid wave. Jenai Buhariwala, a student of Std XII, said, “Postponing board exams is a pragmatic solution considering the current situation, as the lives of students are more important than exams.” Agreeing with Buhariwala, Std XII student Raavi Laddhad said, “I definitely support this move. This will more time to study without being tense about the exams during the serious second wave. Every board should postpone or cancel exams.” Std XII student Nishita Rughwani said, “It was the need of the hour to postpone or cancel boards due to the rising cases. Just like Std X students, even Std XII students should have been promoted because the risk of the virus is on us as well.” Cajal Gupta, a teacher from the city, said, “I think this is a great move. If exams are conducted in person, even teachers are at risk as centers could become hotspots for Covid-19. This decision will affect academics of students, but I support this move.” (With inputs from Dev Sethia and Eshika Bhargava) THOSE AGAINST · Delayed exams can hamper students’ future · Decision unfair for those who worked hard · Students frustrated by changing decisions · Cancellation not solution; postponement better · Unfair to students as well as teachers who have worked hard THOSE IN AGREEMENT · Postponing exams gives more time to study · Students will be less tense about virus · Postponing exam need of the hour · Std XII exams should be cancelled too||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mixed-reactions-to-cancellation-delay-of-cbse-board-exams/articleshow/82073109.cms||Anchal Bhatia
---||Chandigarh||Centre slams Mohali: Containment zones only on papers, testing poor||MOHALI: A three-member central government team has pulled up the local administration for poor contact tracing and testing. The team comprising Dr Naveen Kumar and V K Singh said containment zones are only on papers despite the district witnessing a steep rise in the Covid-19 cases from 45 days. The team also observed that there is no government L3 facility and no unified command centre at the district level and the facility of beds for the patients who cannot be isolated at home is poor. Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan, while explaining about the bed capacity, said the L1 facility at Gharuan provides isolation for patients with mild symptoms who do not have the means to quarantine themselves safely at home. PM told that UT not cooperating: Mohali DCThe DC said, “We have 45 L2 beds at BR Ambedkar Medical College and a strong system of referral to GMCH at Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, for those needing critical care. Referral is immediate and ALS/BLS ambulances transport patients to Patiala free of cost. Twenty more beds will be operational at Dhakoli hospital from Thursday. At present120 out of 600 beds are occupied in Rajindra hospital,” the DC said. He further elaborated that Unified Command Centre at the District level for tie up with private hospitals is in line. Mohali has dedicated officers for L2 and L3 facility along with a Covid Patient Tracking Officer to ensure best possible care to patients. Chandigarh hospitals (PGI, GMSH, Sector 16, and GMCH, Sector 32) should admit Punjab patients who need critical care, especially in emergency situations, said Girish Dayalan, adding the matter has been taken up with Prime Minister. Mohali traces the highest contacts in the state of 20 per patient, the deputy commissioner said. All the contacts of Covid patients are regularly traced and and tested. At present, nearly50% of the contacts have been tested. Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said the team came with a negative mindset. “When we apprised them with our preparations, the team was satisfied. Mohali has high and targeted testing. It is not random. We are following the mantra of trace, test, isolate and treat. Contact tracing for every positive patient is highest in the state with an average of 20. These contacts are tested and if found positive, isolated and treated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-slams-mohali-containment-zones-only-on-papers-testing-poor/articleshow/82072181.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Ruben Mascarenhas of the Aam Aadmi Party, who is also associated with the NGO Khana Chahiye, said for the last couple of days they have been providing prepared food to groups of daily wagers along the Western Express Highway, Powai, Aarey Colony, MIDC Andheri, Andheri Link Road, D N Nagar, S V Road Bandra among others places. “We have been distributing around 2,000 meals since the last three days. Since April 5, Zomato and Feed India have also been providing around 500 meals daily,” said a member. “In addition since Monday, we have distributed around 30,000 litres of water at CSMT and Kurla terminus.” Priti Patkar, founder of NGO Prerna which works for the upliftment of commercial sex workers, said they are raising funds to provide food and other essentials to sex workers at Falkland Road, Kamathipura and Vashi-Turbhe checknaka red light areas. “There are around 800 women who will need this help. Each kit of food rations and other essentials for a month costs around Rs 4,000,” Patkar said. During last year’s lockdown, Kailash Pagare, controller of rationing and director of civil supplies for Mumbai and Thane, worked with the NGO to help a large number of sex workers in Kamathipura get a ration card.  “There are still quite a few women who are yet to get their ration card as they do not have the requisite documents,” Patkar said. She added there are another 600 families of the Pardhi community spread over Chembur, Mankhurd and Ghansoli who will need similar help. “They are the margins of society, have no ration cards and are amongst the poorest in the city. We want the department of food and civil supplies to ensure they get a ration card and we want the residents of this city to help them tide over the lockdown,” she said. Patkar can be reached at 9821274865. In Dharavi, labourers have gone back to their villages, said activist Balraj Dharmagiddha. “We have started receiving enquiries about food arrangement from families here, but we have told them to wait a few days for the lockdown to set in and see what the situation is,” he added. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G-North which includes Dharavi, said they had to only arrange food for vagrants on the weekend lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ngos-reprise-hunger-heroes-role-to-feed-daily-wagers-poor/articleshow/82074094.cms||Clara Lewis

The statements recorded by the ED officer as part of money laundering act cases are admissible in the court as evidence and the ACB investigators want to verify if these can strengthen their cases.

---||Pune||Uncertainty & anxiety drive up panic buying among citizens||Pune: Grocery store owner Bhairav Ram was a busy man on Wednesday, fielding hurried phone calls from Salunke Vihar Road residents on the household items they needed urgently. “Their lists consisted of items that can easily sustain an average family for a month and a half. The problem is that I don’t have that kind of stock in my shop. I tried to reason with them that the grocery shops will remain open even after the new restrictions come into force, but all in vain,” Ram told TOI. Not just grocery stores, vegetable vendors also witnessed panic buying among consumers on Wednesday. “Besides attending customers at my shop, I am also getting text messages and phone calls from my regular customers. They are all scared of the restrictions and the surge in cases,” said Kanhaiya Lal, who sells vegetables and fruits in the Lullanagar area. Homemaker Neelam Joshi (58) from Koregaon Park said she had enough groceries and vegetables to last for the next 10 days. “It is not possible for people like me to go out every second day to the market. Milk is something of a concern but our milkman has assured that he will come every day. People will stock up, irrespective of the supply assurances from the authorities,” Joshi said. Echoing similar sentiments, Nadeem Khan of Hadapsar said he was stocking up for the next few days as his office work gets over only by 7pm by which time the shops are shut. “Moreover, online delivery services do not have delivery slots available for my area. So, it is a safer option to stock up on fruits, vegetables and other essentials, especially as the month of Ramzan has begun,” Khan said. Panic buying wasn’t the only problem faced by shopkeepers. Many of the non-essential shopkeepers were distressed too as they did not have any clarity on the new regulations. A launderer from Undri said, “I don’t know if I can keep my shop open, but I need the work. I am collecting the laundry from my clients’ homes and delivering the serviced items to their gates.” A beauty parlour owner from Dhole Patil Road said, “I was also taking appointments and doing home visits till last week. But with new restrictions, people want to be extra cautious.” Domestic help, caregivers and other such professionals are expecting transportation issues and feel that it will be difficult for them to commute. “Though public buses are plying, they are few and far between. My employers are also not happy that I have to cut down on my hours as I have to leave early to get home before the night time restrictions. Thankfully, they have not cut my pay yet,” said a caregiver from Balajinagar who works in Katraj. Petrol pumps also witnessed long queues at certain locations on Wednesday. Ali Daruwala, spokesperson of the All India Petrol Dealers Association, said, “From morning, people have been queueing up to get petrol. Though we told them that there are no restrictions on getting fuel, they are still in panic mode.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/uncertainty-anxiety-drive-up-panic-buying-among-citizens/articleshow/82073136.cms||Joy Sengupta

The youngsters were making up for the aversion of the rusty village seniors to social media. They have become the social media campaign managers of their family members. Ajay Balyan, 22, a student and a resident of Dulhera village in Shahpur region of Muzaffarnagar, was on Wednesday busy editing slogans for his uncle Sanjeev Balyan, a village pradhan candidate. His target is over 500 village youths who he knows are avid social media users. “Times are changing fast. We have to develop a multi-pronged strategy to fight elections. At least 90% of our village youth is active on social media and it is a major chunk comprising 25% of total 2,000 votes in our village. An aggressive campaign will certainly bear fruit,” Ajay believes. While 26-year-old Avesh Gurjar, a bank official, has taken a month-long leave. He is posting every activity of his uncle Base Ram on social media. “Campaigning in villages is very traditional. My aim is to convince and bring home voters who are staying outside the village. Social media is the best tool to reach out to them. I have connected with locals living in Roorkee, Baghpat, Bulandshahr and have urged them to come and vote for my uncle. This was not possible earlier,” says Avesh, a resident of Kheditappa village of Meerut. Just like Avesh, Sumit Chaprana, 26, is also campaigning for his uncle Satvir Singh who is contesting for pradhan’s post in Mantodi village in Khatauli town of Muzaffarnagar. “I am learning the trade. Managing activities on social media is an important part. Five years later, I will also stand for panchayat polls,” said Sumit, 24, who runs a coaching centre. Sharing his strategy, he says, “I have united all friends and youngsters of our joint family. We connect with others on social media and ask the problems they face. And we also try to help them.” Another youth, Amit Kumar, 24, a lawyer practicing in Haryana, is back in his Madhubanpur village in Bijnor. His father, Rajendra Singh, is contesting panchayat poll. Amit is canvassing for his father on social media platforms. “Soon after coming here, I created a WhatsApp group adding most youths of my village. And I am trying to convince all why it is important to cast their votes in favour of my father. It is all about a healthy argument which is done in an interactive manner. And, a lot of young people are joining us,” Amit said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/as-elderlies-hit-the-campaign-trail-youngsters-back-home-take-charge-of-social-media-canvassing/articleshow/82071164.cms||Sandeep Rai

The CEO will also hold a video conference with the DMs of districts where polling will be held in the next four phases so that the safety norms are followed stringently during campaigns. On Tuesday, the HC had asked the Bengal CEO and all district magistrates to rigidly enforce the election commission’s Covid norms, if required with police help. The HC also said the administration can, if necessary, enforce prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC to ensure physical distancing. The HC laid down a four-point guideline for immediate implementation. This makes masks mandatory at all gatherings, asks for sanitizers to be made available and says safe distancing norms must be followed at all gatherings. A PIL was filed mentioning laxity on part of the EC to maintain pandemic norms though it was notified that Covid rules would be maintained. Alarmed over the rising figures, the HC ordered to take enough precautionary measures, said Srijib Chakraborty, counsel for the petitioner. “The HC order stated that the DMs and the CEO shall be personally responsible for ensuring that the Covid guidelines are followed by all,” said Chakraborty. Advocate Arindam Das said: “The HC wanted stringent measures to be taken against people who fail, neglect or refuse to obey the Covid protocols. Callous, irresponsible, and nonchalant attitude or behaviour of some of the members of society cannot be permitted to endanger the lives of the other members of society.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-calls-for-all-party-meeting-over-cov/articleshow/82072207.cms||---

---||Pune||High demand, low supply spur veggie price rise||Pune: Vegetable prices shot up by 20-30% in the Market Yard on Wednesday due to less supplies and panic buying amid statewide restrictions making a comeback against the backdrop of rising Covid-19 caseload. “Supplies to the market were lower on Wednesday due to Gudi Padwa the previous day. Farmers usually do not go to fields for harvests on festive days. Also, due to the stringent curbs being imposed in Maharashtra, customers bought twice the amount of vegetables they usually buy from Gultekdi. Retailers have bought vegetables for several days in advance. Even though essential supplies like vegetables are not included under the new curbs, people are buying vegetables for 4-5 days in advance from retailers so that they do not experience last year’s situation,” an official of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) said. Sunil Kumbharkar, who owns a vegetable wholesale firm in Market Yard, told TOI that supplies in the market were around 40% less on Wednesday. “The new curbs for 15 days announced on Tuesday have caused panic buying. Consumers and retailers purchased 20-30% more than their usual purchases from the market on Wednesday.” Retailers said the last two days had recorded a significant rise in vegetable prices, mostly because of the announcement of an impending lockdown/restrictions, which led to panic buying. Vegetables that were earlier selling at Rs 40-50 per kg shot up to Rs 60-70 per kg in the retail market on Wednesday. Vitthal Hanamgar, a retailer in NIBM road area said, “Vegetable prices started increasing on Monday, following the market closure on Saturday and Sunday due to weekend lockdown. Prices shot up further on Wednesday due to announcement of fresh curbs. Customers are wary and leaving nothing to chance. They were also crowding vegetable vendors on Wednesday.” Hanamgar said tomatoes were selling at Rs 25-30 per kg on Wednesday as against Rs 15 last week in the retail market. “Cauliflower per kg price went up to Rs 60-70 from last week’s Rs 40-50. A kilogram of okra was priced Rs 70 on Wednesday as against the earlier price of Rs 45, while cluster beans’ price went up to Rs 80 per kg. Last week, cluster beans were being sold at Rs 50-60 per kg in the retail market,” he said. Shankar Surve, a retailer in Shivaji market, Camp, said, “Even though vegetable vendors will be working during the restrictions, people were crowding the market on Wednesday to stock up in advance. Supplies were around 40% less in Gultekdi on Wednesday.” “Besides attending customers at my shop, I am also getting text messages and phone calls from my regular customers. They are all scared of the restrictions and the surge in cases,” said Kanhaiya Lal, who sells vegetables and fruits in the Lullanagar area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/high-demand-low-supply-spur-veggie-price-rise/articleshow/82073137.cms||Neha Madaan

We have already prepared 100 rooms. We have requested the administration that the hotels also should be allowed to start care centres individually for Covid patients who have no symptoms,” Poddar said. Incidentally, HRAEI had organized 2,000 rooms during the first wave. Association of Hospitals in Eastern India president and AMRI Group CEO Rupak Barua said they were ready to join hands with hotels for satellite centres. “AMRI has already tied up with three hotels. Around 30 beds have been started on Wednesday and another 30 will take off from Monday. We are also increasing the capacity of our beds,” he added. AMRI has tied up with Sojourn, Southern Plaza and Casa Broadway. “We are looking at availability of hotel rooms,” said Belle Vue CEO Pradip Tandon. Medica chairman Aloke Roy added that they had also started a satellite facility at a guest house and looking for more tie-ups. Incidentally, HRAEI has already written a letter to health secretary N S Nigam, offering rooms for satellite Covid treatment. The association has over 800 members and 60,000 beds in Bengal. It has also requested the state government to provide a list of the towns and cities where it would require rooms for quarantine centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hospital-hotel-tie-ups-get-going/articleshow/82072192.cms||---
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: National-level shooter who turned poaching kingpin killed in crash||MEERUT: Prashant Bishnoi, a national-level shooter who had been running an international arms and wildlife parts smuggling operation, was found dead in a road accident on Tuesday night. Bishnoi, 45, had been arrested in 2017 by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and Meerut forest department after a massive haul of unlicensed weapons and wildlife parts were found at his house. That included 44 firearms, 50,000 cartridges, 117kg animal meat, and skins of deer and black buck. Cash amounting to nearly a crore and nine high-end cameras had also been seized at the time. He was arrested in June that year and had been in and out of jail since. Later, he had confessed to using the fact that he was a professional shooter to smuggle arms into the country. On Tuesday night, around 10.30pm, Prashant is believed to have been speeding along the Rohta Road in an SUV, which lost control. He was alone. “It turned turtle and fell into a gorge. He was speeding and probably under the influence of alcohol,” SHO of Rohta police station Upender Singh said. It was a 20-foot drop. The car was mangled and he was seriously injured. Police were on a regular patrol when they saw the car. They got him out and took him to two private hospitals, but he had died by then. With documents found in the car, he was identified as Prashant Bishnoi. Prashant’s father, Devendra Kumar, a former Army colonel, had fought the 1971 War and been a part of Operation Blue Star in 1984. He had later resigned from the Army and worked for 12 years in UP state services, from which he retired. The raids that led to Prashant’s arrest had been at his house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/natl-level-shooter-poaching-kingpin-global-arms-dealer-found-dead-in-up-crash/articleshow/82071166.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Dread and dreadlocks at Haridwar Maha Kumbh in Covid-19 shadow||HARIDWAR: Kumbh Mela, it is said, is the greatest show on earth – a microcosm of all that humanity has to offer. This year, the show has had a big spoiler. The Maha Kumbh at Haridwar is cut to one-fourth of its original duration; curbs are in place and the numbers that count for the success of any event like this is much less; foreign pilgrims (and babas), a source of much attraction, are missing and the buzz is muted. Operating under the shadow of an epidemic, the mela in Haridwar is however offering a unique perspective of devotion co-existing with the dread of the disease, with devotion often overpowering all other emotions. A walk along the Ganga banks in Haridwar during the Kumbh presents many such sights. The presence of Covid hovers in the form of masked strangers, policemen trying to enforce social distancing, booths dispensing sanitisers and loudspeakers blaring caution to pilgrims. Alongside are scenes, some of which could easily have been from a century ago -- sadhus with matted-hair sitting under ancient peepal trees, bodies smeared in ash, trishul by their side, offering blessings to devotees; groups of villagers in traditional finery decked up to take a dip in the Ganga, firmly believing that the river will wash away their sins. Occasionally, there are flashes which add colour to the spectacle -- a sadhu in a faux leopard skin dressed as Lord Shiva with a matching spotted skin, like a protective mask. His motorcycle has the words 'Naga Baba' boldly stenciled at the rear. Simplicity and glitz, devotion and drama walk hand-in-hand at the festival. The devout who has faith that Ganga, the mother goddess, will not let harm befall him, takes a dip in the river with thousands of others, foregoing caution. Once he arrives at the river, the tacit understanding is that the onus is on the river to protect. Scenes of naked Naga sadhus jostling to jump into the Ganga without a care and the sight of thousands of people in massively mounted peshwais – processions of the akhadas as they proceed for the shahi snan – may be unnerving for many worried about the pandemic. But for those at the Kumbh, faith is overpowering these fears. At least for now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dread-and-dreadlocks-at-kumbh-in-covid-shadow/articleshow/82072206.cms||Atul Sethi

Instead, candidates will concentrate on door-to-door campaigns, small gatherings and street corners in view of the second Covid wave in the state. CPM is the first party to have asked its activists and supporters to observe the Covid protocol (wearing of masks and using sanitizers) while conducting poll campaign. “We will try to avoid mega election gatherings. Even while holding gatherings at places, we will try to maintain all Covid protocol,” CPM leader Mohammad Salim said on Wednesday while criticizing both the state government and the Centre over the “lack of co-ordination” in Covid management.

Large e-commerce players said that the definition of what constitutes an essential commodity is ‘static’ and full service must be allowed to meet consumer needs. “Currently, we are enabling deliveries of essential products in Maharashtra in line with the new guidelines. However, urgent customer needs vary across households and it is challenging to define a static essentials list. Therefore, we request the government to allow delivery of all products soon,” said a spokesperson from Amazon India. Small and medium-scale enterprises have also made similar requests as they have bet a lot of their growth and productivity on the servicing of e-commerce platforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/e-commerce-players-seek-intervention/articleshow/82073157.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Hyderabad||Distribute Inter boards’ staff in 3 months: HC to Telangana, Andhra Pradesh||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court has asked Intermediate boards of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to apportion the staff in three months. The judges also asked the Board of Intermediate Education, AP (BIEAP) to prepare a composite seniority list of employees in all categories working in both states by June 2, 2014. Finding fault with both boards for not taking steps to divide the staff between themselves in the last seven years, a bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar said officials of both states should sit together and discuss to arrive at within two months guidelines and modalities for the distribution of the employees. The judges gave this direction after hearing three employees — S Savitri, K Venkateswara Rao and G Venkat Rao — of BIEAP who contended that the dodging ways of both the boards were harming the interests of the employees. Since the composite AP Intermediate Board has become BIEAP and Telangana had formed its own Intermediate board on December 4, 2014, the BIEAP was asked to prepare the combined seniority list. “The actual distribution of employees should happen within one month from the date of finalisation of modalities and guidelines,” the judges said. As per section 82 of the AP Reorganisation Act, both the boards should decide the modalities within one year of the bifurcation of the state. The judges made it clear that this limitation of one year was not mandatory. “Just because they failed to do it till now, that does not prohibit them from doing it now,” they said. The petitioners also argued that both boards have been discriminating against the employees who were temporarily allotted to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/distribute-inter-boards-staff-in-3-months-hc-to-t-andhra/articleshow/82073155.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Pune||Pune: New rules force people to leave, large crowd gathers at bus stands||PUNE: Kuldip More (32) was at the Swargate bus stand on Wednesday morning trying to get back to his family in Kolhapur. “My parents heard CM Uddhav Thackeray’s address last evening and told me to come back immediately. I called my office in the morning and they told me to take a weeklong break after which they will contact me. I am shocked as my manager did not tell me this earlier,” said More. It was a busy Wednesday morning at the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation-run (MSRTC) bus stand with many passengers turning up desperate to leave the city anyhow they could. A group of middle-aged men, who hail from Dhule, were sitting under the shade of a tree. “We have been in Pune since three years. When the first lockdown hit last year, we left and returned in November. Though the CM did not say it is a lockdown, the restrictions are nothing less than one. Work has dried up since over a month and some of us were doing odd jobs to survive. Being at home is safer than getting stuck here,” said one of the men. Pune MSRTC officials confirmed most of their buses ran at full capacity on Wednesday and the services will continue once the restrictions set in as well. “A large number of passengers are traveling on Wednesday as they panicked. We will run buses to all destinations from Pune,” MSRTC’s divisional traffic manager Dnyaneshwar Ranavare said. A student Suraj Raje said with hotels and messes closed, he had no options but to leave Pune. At Koregaon Park, working professional Kailash Sharma booked a one-way ticket to Delhi for Wednesday morning. Sharma, who works with an IT company, said he originally planned to leave on April 20. “I live in Kolkata but I didn’t book a direct flight to the city as I don’t have an RT-PCR report. The Delhi airport has a swab collection facility and so does Pune airport. I will go through the test at either of the places. I plan to stay in Delhi for a day, then take a flight to Kolkata with the report. It will cost me more money but I don’t have a choice,” he said. Travel agents said booking of one-way tickets has increased by over 60% since late last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-rules-force-people-to-leave-large-crowd-gathers-at-bus-stands/articleshow/82073143.cms||Joy Sengupta

During a press conference at Civic Centre, the mayors claimed to have written to Delhi government for permission as all arrangements are in place, including ICU facilities. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said they were receiving 40-50 cases with Covid symptoms every day. “But since these hospitals have not been demarcated as Covid facilities, it is becoming difficult to deal with the pressure,” he said, adding that they were waiting for Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s nod. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said 20 beds at Swami Dayanand Hospital of east corporation, 200-300 beds at Hindu Rao and Balak Ram hospitals of north corporation and 200 beds at Tilak Nagar and Kalka hospitals of south corporation could be arranged. The north corporation has also requested Delhi government to make Hindu Rao Hospital a dedicated Covid facility, he said. The corporations also assured cooperation in turning their schools and community halls into isolation centres. East corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said more community halls could be offered this year. South corporation mayor Anamika Mithlesh said a portion of Tilak Nagar Hospital and another facility could be turned into Covid hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-offer-400-beds-for-covid-at-5-hospitals/articleshow/82091397.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Lost money online? Dial a new helpline||NEW DELHI: If you become a victim of cybercrime, you can now dial 155260 and report it. Like 112 — earlier 100, this new helpline number will serve as an emergency number for those who are targeted by cyber crooks in Delhi. During the pandemic, several people had lodged complaints of SIM card cloning and fraudulent transactions in which money was deducted from their accounts to other payment wallets. Following this, Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) and the Union home ministry launched an initiative under which Citizen Financial Fraud Reporting and Management System was developed and made available to the state police forces. At present, Delhi and Rajasthan police have made it operational. The details are available on the police dashboard of National Cybercrime Reporting Portal too. Anvyesh Roy, DCP, cybercrime, said, “Till now, in 23 cases, fraud amount totalling Rs 8.1 lakh has been put on hold. Around 138 fraud tickets have been raised since its formal launch on April 1. The testing began last November.” The efficacy of the initiative depends on prompt reporting of online financial frauds by the victims on the helpline, he added. “The earlier they report, the more it is likely that the defrauded money can be traced and put on hold while it is still in the digital ecosystem.” The helpline aims to put on hold fraudulent transactions so that the victims don’t lose out on the money. The system, which is linked to several banks and payment getaways, sends a real-time alert to the respective financial intermediaries (FI). If the funds have moved out, it feeds the transaction details in the portal and escalates it to the next FI. If funds are found available, it’s temporarily put on hold. The initiative seeks to create a platform where all FIs, merchants, utilities and any other entity involved in the money or digital trail are connected with each other for online fraud ticket generation, escalation and resolution. Reserve Bank of India has already asked all FIs regulated by it to become part of this initiative. For this to be successful, all parties concerned need to work round the clock because crooks strike when banks are shut, said an investigating officer of the cyber unit. “Not all banks and merchants work round the clock. Some have holidays or work only till evening or some at night. We are in talks to improvise the system. This will take time, but will happen gradually,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lost-money-online-dial-a-new-helpline/articleshow/82074123.cms||---
---||Pune||Cops urge Puneites to walk down to neighbouring shops for daily needs||Pune: Joint commissioner of Pune police Ravindra Shisve on Wednesday made it clear that people should prefer to walk down, instead of using vehicles, to neighbourhood shops for buying essentials. “People can use their vehicles only in case of emergency and will have to explain the nature of emergency travel to the policemen at the check points. People should avoid unnecessary travel and are requested to cooperate with the police,” he said.“Only vehicles and persons involved in essential services are allowed to move on the roads. The weekend lockdown will remain in force and people should follow the existing rules during the weekends. The police will implement all the directives issued by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner,” he said.Sudhir Hiremath, deputy commissioner of Pimpri Chinchwad police, told TOI, “No one is expected to come out on the roads just for a walk or bicycle ride during the next 15 days. People should have a valid reason if they want to step out of their houses.”He said, “People can go to their nearest grocery store or dairy for buying essentials, that too between 7am and 6pm. They are not expected to go to some other part of the city to buy essentials. After 6pm, only medical stores and food delivery people will be permitted.” Hiremath said the police would not restrict people going for vaccination, provided they must carry necessary documents with them. “We will verify the documents at our check points,” he said, adding that there were 50 checkpoints in the Pimpri Chinchwad police commissionerate. “We will be taking strict action against the people going out after 6pm,” the officer said.The Pune rural police will deploy about 2,000 policemen at 150 check points to enforce the state restrictions. “We will ensure that this process is hassle free. Hotels, restaurants, eateries and dhabas will continue with the parcel service,” Pune rural superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh said. “Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao held video conference meeting with industrial representatives on Wednesday. We have categorically told them that their employees and vehicles should carry necessary documents and identity cards to avoid any issue at the check points,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-urge-puneites-to-walk-down-to-neighbouring-shops-for-daily-needs/articleshow/82073197.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC paid more for Remdesivir to save lives, says Iqbal Chahal||MUMBAI: BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal on Wednesday said the BMC purchased Remdesivir at a higher rate to save lives since there was an acute shortage of the drug in the city. Chahal said more than the rate, the BMC’s priority was to secure enough vials for Covid-19 patients who would need the life-saving drug in civic hospitals. “Remdesivir vials have not been supplied to Haffkine yet, since companies have expressed their inability to do so at once. They can only do it in a staggered manner. Dynamics are changing every day. On Tuesday, India recorded 872 deaths, including 225 in Maharashtra. Remdesivir rates change every day since it is a war-like situation,” he said. The BJP has sought an ACB probe into the BMC’s purchase at 2.5 times the price at which state-run Haffkine had bought the vials. Chahal said 17,000 patients needed Remdesivir at the BMC hospitals. “We bought these since no other company was willing to supply two lakh vials. Several state governments and civic corporations have bought Remdesivir at the same rates as us. So our rates are not very high,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-paid-more-for-remdesivir-to-save-lives-says-chahal/articleshow/82072266.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The CM also assured the voters of getting Godavari water from Paleru to Sagar ayacut and filling Peddadevulapally Cheruvu. In his nearly 40-minute speech at a public meeting in Halia, KCR mainly targeted Congress candidate and former minister K Jana Reddy, but avoided mentioning the BJP. He asked the people not to carried away by the smear campaign of some parties against the TRS. “Some Congress leaders are claiming that chief ministership is Jana Reddy’s ‘biksham’ (alms) to KCR. Jana Reddy did not give me CM’s post. People gave the alms to KCR by giving majority seats to the TRS,” he said. Alleging that Telangana Congress leaders had surrendered to Andhra rulers when the state was united, he said: “Congress leaders gave up Telangana’s interests to protect their posts and power. But, we gave up our posts in the interests of Telangana. That is the difference between the TRS and Congress.” When he launched Telangana statehood movement, he quit his assembly deputy speaker and MLA posts and told people to stone him to death if he gave up the movement in the middle, KCR recalled. Urging the people to think wisely who had done what in the past six years, KCR said it was the TRS which had developed the Sagar constituency. The TRS president said some parties had even tried to stop Wednesday’s public meeting by approaching the high court and even the Election Commission of India. ”Generally, political parties hold meetings during the elections and tell people what they have done and what they would do for them. It is a democratic right. In the ongoing elections in four states and Puducherry, Prime Minister Modi and other parties conducted several meetings,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-vows-to-complete-li-schemes-in-nalgonda-targets-congress/articleshow/82073244.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Pune||6pm-7am curfew, weekend lockdown to continue in Pune||PUNE: The district will once again have different night curfew timings compared to the rest of Maharashtra till May 1. On Wednesday, the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations and the district collector’s office released identical orders, retaining the 6pm-7am night curfew timing on weekdays from Monday to Friday, besides the weekend lockdown from 6pm on Friday to 7am on Monday, till May 1. On Wednesday, the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) recorded 7,888 Covid-19 cases, its least in two weeks. As many as 10,578 patients in the region recovered in the past 24 hours, the highest since the pandemic began early last year. The curfew timing set off a debate among citizens as to why Pune was being singled out for an extra two hours of restrictions, when the rest of Maharashtra will follow the 8pm-7am night curfew timing as per the “Break the Chain” order released on April 13 by state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao told TOI, “The orders issued by the local authorities are in consultation with the state government considering Pune’s huge number of active cases which is close to 1lakh.” Rao said, “The state government has given local authorities the powers to take a call regarding additional restrictions according to the situation. It has been communicated to the relief and rehabilitation secretary. After discussions, we decided to make the necessary changes for Pune district from the state government orders issued on Tuesday.” He added, “We decided to continue with the 6pm-to-7am night curfew and weekend lockdown given the present high number of cases in the district.” When contacted, Kunte told TOI, “I will speak to the Pune local authorities before making any comment on the issue.” Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar added, “Pune has been following a certain set of orders. We decided to keep the orders same after considering the situation in the district.” Rao said the stricter restrictions have shown a difference in Pune’s positivity rate, which was 41.27% in the first week (April 1-7) and had reduced to 31.34% (April 8-14). “This means the restrictions are helping to control crowding and reduce the infection rate. It may be a bit early to conclude, but if these restrictions continue, they may help bring down the positivity rate further as has been suggested by public health experts,” he told TOI. Citizens also raised concerns about facing hassles as the civic orders restrain them from stepping out without any valid reason, but allow essential shops to remain open from 7am to 6pm. Many expressed fears about how to convince the law enforcers about their purpose for stepping out for essential work like buying groceries, vegetables or visiting a dentist. Both Kumar and joint police commissioner Ravindra Shisve sought to allay such fears and maintained that people going to neighbourhood shops to buy essentials won’t face any hassles. “No proof is required if you are going to neighbourhood shops,” said Kumar. Rao said, “Inputs from the police department also had to do with the 6pm-7am night curfew timing in Pune. Police officers were of the opinion that allowing shops to remain open till 8pm would mean more people on the roads even after the closure time. However, we have strictly instructed the police authorities to ensure that there is no unnecessary harsh action against people.” He said, ‘If people are going to get their essential goods or for vaccination, they should not be harassed. People can travel by their own private vehicle or walk to their local groceries to collect their essentials; similarly if they are going to a vaccination centre.” The divisional commissioner said there was no complaint from Puneites regarding the weekend lockdown and the order was executed well last week. “To break the chain of transmission, Puneites have to cooperate for just the next two weekends,” he said. The PMC has allowed house help, cooks, caregivers and drivers and others to visit home. They are allowed to travel between 7am and 10pm. The state in its order on Tuesday had asked the local self governing bodies to take call on it. The civic body has allowed online and on-call home delivery of food. All online food delivery apps are permitted. Home deliveries are allowed till 11 pm. Restaurants, hotels and bars can give home deliveries. Takeaways are not allowed. Changes have also been made for the delivery of e-commerce websites, compared to previous order in PMR. Now only essential items and services are allowed to be ordered. If the home delivery has to be provided to more than one family residing in a society, it should be kept at the entrance of the society. Internal delivery of the item should be done by the dedicated building staffers. All other provisions mentioned in the April 9 order relating to weekend lockdown and night curfew would continue as it is, the order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/6pm-7am-curfew-weekend-lockdown-to-continue-in-pune/articleshow/82073240.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Pune: Over 40 vaccination centres set up to give second dose of Covaxin||PUNE: More than 40 vaccination centres have been set up across Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune rural to ensure beneficiaries due for a second dose of Covaxin get the shot. Thirty of these sites are in Pune city — 16 of them are PMC-run. In Pimpri Chinchwad, officials said nine sites have been set up to administer the vaccine. Pune rural has been allowed four centres. As per health services data, nearly 1.14 lakh people in the district have been administered Covaxin till April 13. The number includes senior citizens, people over 45, health workers and frontliners. For days, during a district-wide shortage of Covishield in March, Covaxin had become the lead vaccine for first-time beneficiaries. The number of recipients surged during this period. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “We are administering Covaxin as and when the doses are being provided by the Union government. We had received a large chunk of doses in the second week of March. At the time, several private hospitals had conducted their vaccination drives solely using Covaxin. Those beneficiaries are now due for their second dose and preparations have been made accordingly in the region.” Deshmukh said as of April 13, the district has nearly 55,999 doses of Covaxin in its reserves. From this total, 34,334 doses are available for the PMC, 13,530 are available for the PCMC and 8,135 have been set aside for Pune rural. An official with District Hospital, Aundh — the only dedicated Covaxin centre in the district — said since January 16, they have given the shot to more than 13,000 individuals, including senior citizens and those over 45 with underlying medical conditions. “There was some apprehension early on, especially among healthcare workers. But our vaccination sessions have received a very good response. For the past few days, we have been vaccinating about 300 people every day,” the official said.

---||Pune||Overall coverage improves as 57,000 more individuals take shots in district||Pune: The Covid-19 vaccination drive in the district picked up pace on Wednesday after a few days of weak turnouts. More than 57,000 beneficiaries were covered on Wednesday, with Pune rural recording a whopping four-fold increase in coverage (it had just about 8,000 beneficiaries on Tuesday). The region was the highest with 34,416 doses administered. It was followed by Pune city (17,157 beneficiaries) and Pimpri Chinchwad (6,261 beneficiaries). Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “The district now has ample vaccine doses available. We have around 1.11 lakh Covishield doses and 55,999 doses of Covaxin in our reserves. This stock will last three more days, at least. Our focus, anyway, is on Covaxin as there are scores who are due for a second dose across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.” He also said there’s currently no need for an increase in the number of vaccination sites. Nearly 530 sites are currently operational in the district and Deshmukh said the number is enough to handle one lakh daily vaccinations. On fresh curbs and their potential impact on the vaccination drive, Deshmukh said officials will increase public messaging through advertisements and announcements if turnouts dip. “The travel curbs don’t affect vaccine beneficiaries. So they cannot impact the vaccination drive,” he said. Ayush Prasad, the chief executive officer of the zilla parishad said officials in Pune rural will continue transporting beneficiaries to vaccination centres. For days now, officials in Pune rural have been ferrying vaccine beneficiaries to sites for free. The move, they said, has improved coverage across the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/overall-coverage-improves-as-57000-more-individuals-take-shots-in-district/articleshow/82073116.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||India||Maharashtra ex-home minister faces 75 CBI posers over 8 hours||NEW DELHI: The CBI grilled former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh for eight hours on Wednesday in connection with its probe into allegations of extortion levelled against him by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, with the day-long session focusing on the NCP leader's equations with Singh, suspended API Sachin Waze and the authenticity of the WhatsApp messages sent to him by ACP Sanjay Patil. Sources told TOI that the CBI team asked Deshmukh whether Waze would visit him at his residence and whether it was normal for the former home minister to meet API-rank police officers at his home. Sources said Deshmukh was grilled by two superintendent of police rank officers — Abhishek Dular and Kiran S — at the DRDO guest house in Mumbai. The two SPs are part of a 12-member team to probe the high profile case, a source said. Investigators are learnt to have confronted Deshmukh with statements given by people they had quizzed in the last one week in connection with the "letter bomb" dropped by the former Mumbai police chief before he was shunted out. Deshmukh was asked specific questions about each allegation made by Singh and Waze. However, the crucial portion of questioning revolved around Singh's purported exchange of messages with ACP Patil, an officer said. Many in political and police circles are intrigued by Patil's messages to Singh, based on which the former Mumbai top cop alleged that Deshmukh had set a target of Rs 100 crore a month for Mumbai police to be raised from bars and hotels. Singh had shot off his explosive letter to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray when Mumbai police and the state government were reeling under the disclosure of Waze planting explosives outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence. The CBI team, sources said, will seek to investigate the suspicion rife in many quarters that the letter and its timing could have been crafted to distance Singh from Waze, who had flourished on his charge. Deshmukh came to the guest house around 10.15 am. His questioning began at 11 am and ended around 6.30 pm but he didn't leave immediately. Sources said the team asked Deshmukh over 75 questions through the day and may question him again after studying his statement. After being asked about his relationship with Singh and Waze, Deshmukh was asked how often the latter visited his residence and office and which other officers from Mumbai police did the same, another source familiar with the questioning said. He was asked if he ever asked Waze to extort Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants in Mumbai every month. Deshmukh denied all the allegations and said these were attempts to malign him and the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-ex-home-minister-faces-75-cbi-posers-over-8-hours/articleshow/82075932.cms||Raj Sekhar

---||Goa||In times of Covid-19, Goa Pro League should not have relegation: Armando||Panaji: Former India coach Armando Colaco has asked the Goa Football Association (GFA) to scrap relegation in this season of Goa Professional League. Last season’s league was cut short due to the coronavirus pandemic with Sporting Clube de Goa and Churchill Brothers FC declared joint winners. GFA kickstarted this season’s league after almost a year, but with a new format. The 12 participating teams now play each other only once with the bottom-placed team relegated to the First Division League. “It will be unfair to relegate any team this season,” said Colaco, now coach of Churchill Brothers. “There is a new format, all matches are being played behind closed doors and at a single venue. All teams are good, they can beat anyone on their day. I appreciate the efforts of GFA in organising the league, but since we are not having a full season, no team should be relegated.” Colaco’s suggestion comes at a time when five teams are battling to save the drop. Youth Club of Manora, Guardian Angel SC, Panjim Footballers and Sesa FA all have 10 points while Velsao Sports and Cultural Club are at the bottom with eight points. While Panjim have completed their engagements and Sesa have two games in hand, the others have one match each left to be played. “The clubs make a great contribution to Goan football, even in difficult times. Sesa has been running an academy and providing a very good platform. Guardian Angel, Velsao and Manora are all village clubs, who keep the team going. Panjim have done well too. “Relegation will not help Goan football’s cause. There will be more harm done. I know this is a league and a professional league must have relegation, but we are now dealing with exceptional circumstances. So many players have tested positive for Covid-19 during the league and have been unable to take part,” said Colaco. Colaco made a special mention of Youth Club of Manora, who are late entrants to the league after replacing Corps of Signals at the last minute. GFA initially wanted SSC Cavelossim from the first division but they were not ready to take part at short notice. “It was brave of Manora to take part in the league. They did not get enough time to prepare,” said Colaco.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-times-of-covid-19-goa-pro-league-should-not-have-relegation-armando/articleshow/82091422.cms||---
---||Pune||Remdesivir not only option against Covid, can save lives without it: Doctors||PUNE: Remdesivir is not the lone life-saving drug against Covid-19. Instead, it has been a careful mix of oxygen therapy, vitamin supplements, steroids and blood thinners that has been helping patients recover faster, medical experts have said. In fact, the state task force, in a meeting on April 12, made it clear that it is absolutely possible to save patients without even using remdesivir. Coronavirus: Live updates“The drug is being rampantly prescribed. And people have developed this impression that the anti-viral will save lives,” Sanjay Oak, chief of the state task force, wrote in the advisory released on April 13. Critical care expert Prasad Rajhans, the chief intensivist of the Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, said patients and families should not put pressure on doctors to use remdesivir. Read AlsoUP gets 25,000 vials of Remdesivir injections airlifted from AhmedabadLUCKNOW: With Uttar Pradesh facing a shortage of Remdesivir injection, used in the treatment of Covid-19, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed the health department to procure 25,000 vials from Ahmedabad on Wednesday. As per the CM’s orders, a state aircraft was sent to Ahmedabad to pick up the“Oxygen therapy, vitamins, steroids and low molecular weight heparin (blood thinners), when used at appropriate stages under medical supervision, make for an excellent recovery rate. People should not panic over the shortage of remdesivir in Pune," Rajhans said. Infectious disease expert, Parikshit Prayag, said, "Remdesivir only shortens duration of illness in carefully selected patients - like those with early hypoxia (low blood oxygen saturation) or high-grade fever with lower respiratory involvement. This impression, that it is life-saving, makes a patient desperate and anxious when she or he does not get it. Unfortunately, many people are being unnecessarily put on the drug." Antiviral drugs like remdesivir (given intravenously) and favipiravir (given orally) prevent viral replication. "So it is not remdesivir alone that helps. It's when the drug is given along with oxygen therapy, steroids and blood thinners that it benefits recovery. While remdesivir reduces viral load, other drugs bring ease inflammation triggered by the virus," said physician Aniket Joshi, from theAssociation of Physicians of India (API), Pune branch. Intensivists using the drugs only vouch for its efficacy when used in carefully selected patients. "Remdesivir is certainly efficacious in the early phase of infection, to control virus replication. Similarly, tocilizumab in select critical patients also helps tame the abnormal immune response called 'cytokine storm'. But these drugs' indiscriminate use should absolutely be discouraged," said Ruby Hall Clinic's chief intensivist Kapil Zirpe. Zirpe said good ICU care forms the backbone of Covid recovery. "Covid can boost blood sugar levels in some patients as the virus causes pancreatic beta-cell changes. In addition, steroids used in treatment can also spike blood glucose levels. Administering insulin along with adequate hydration (saline) are key to manage patients' sugar-related complications," Zirpe said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/remdesivir-not-only-option-against-covid-can-save-lives-without-it-docs/articleshow/82073258.cms||Umesh Isalkar

New dates will be announced soon, an airport official said. “We received a communication from the IAF on Wednesday evening, which stated that the closure has been deferred. We don’t exactly know the reasons behind the decision. The IAF, in its communication, said fresh dates of the closure will be announced later. We have sent out the information to all the airlines operating from Pune,” a senior airport official told TOI. The airport is a part of the IAF’s base at Lohegaon and controls the 2,530 metre runway. “We had been requesting the IAF to defer the total runway closure due to the rise in Covid-19 cases. Now, with the closure having been deferred, airlines can plan their flights. We are hoping for flight movements to increase after the decision. It will also come as a relief for many flyers who had booked tickets during the period and were in a fix,” another official said. As of now, passenger flights are operating for 12 hours (8am to 8pm) ever since the runway recarpeting work started at the airport last year. “I had booked four tickets last month for travel on April 28 without knowing about the closure. This is a big relief for me as I spent almost Rs. 40,000 (both ways) on fare,” Shirish S, a flyer, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/iaf-defers-pune-airports-closure-for-two-weeks/articleshow/82073117.cms||Joy Sengupta

He said his maternal aunt has 1,600 US dollars, which he wants to exchange for India currency. He took me outside a house in Harcharan Nagar and said it belonged to his aunt. There, he showed me dollars, which were original.” Thereafter, Surjit asked Ankit to reach Kashmir Nagar crossing at GT Road with Indian currency notes. “When I reached there, five men and one woman were already present there. Surjit took Rs 4.54 lakh from me and gave me a bundle of ‘1,600 US dollars’. When they left, I found only 100 dollars in the bundle and the rest were newspaper pieces,” he added. Division 3 police station SHO inspector Jarnail Singh said, “Surjit had reached there on a two-wheeler. After taking the money, he along with his accomplices walked away. We have recovered his two-wheeler from the spot. During probe, it was found that it was sold multiple times from one owner to another. We also visited the house in Harcharan Nagar, which Surjit claimed was his aunt’s. The family living there has no connection with him.”“Three men have been captured on a CCTV camera and we are trying to trace them,” the SHO added.A case was registered under sections 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/newspaper-pieces-in-us-dollar-bundle-moneychanger-duped-of-rs-4-5l/articleshow/82072300.cms||---

The KCB is also in the process of starting a six-bed ICU. “We have purchased necessary equipment and also have a pipeline in the ward. We couldn’t execute the civil work due to paucity of funds. The work order has been passed and the actual civil work will begin from Thursday.

---||Pune||People picking pvt hosps over Covid care centres||Pune: Nearly 50% beds at Covid care centres across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits have remained vacant despite a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases as a majority of the patients are opting for private hospitals. Rising hospitalisation demand is also leading to mushrooming of unauthorised private Covid care facilities, which charge heavily for providing beds and healthcare. PMC officials said of the 1,200 beds, 600 are available in four Covid care centres at Yerawada, Hadapsar, Kharadi and Satara Road. These centres are being operated by the civic body. These Covid care centres are treated as institutional isolation centres. Patients who are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms are kept in these centres. Apart from the civic-run Covid centres, facilities operated by private parties, too, have come up. The civic body has provided guidelines for operation of these facilities. “The Covid care centres are becoming an income source for some organisations. In some cases, mandatory norms are not being followed which may lead to accidents and loss of lives. Such cases have happened in cities like Mumbai,” said a PMC official. The PMC has made it mandatory for carrying out fire audit of properties. A tie-up with a nearby hospital is a must for handling any emergency situation. Structural audit and structural stability certificate are also mandatory. The operator of the Covid care centre must also seek permission from the police department. “Taking permission for running a Covid care centre is a must. We have given guidelines for setting up private Covid care centres. Strict action will be taken for failure to adhere to the rules. Operating Covid care center is a matter of life and death. Any negligence will attract stringent punishment,” said Rajendra Muthe, a senior PMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/people-picking-pvt-hosps-over-covid-care-centres/articleshow/82073119.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Health infra gasps as Covid cases and distress spiral||NEW DELHI: Covid cases are rising exponentially with a highly infectious strain stalking the city. Lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour, with people not wearing masks and showing indifference to maintaining social distancing, has aggravated the situation. In 24 hours, 17,282 more people have tested positive and 104 deaths have been reported. These positive cases were detected in 1.08 lakh tests — 73,915 RT-PCR and 34,619 rapid antigen — with the positivity rate at 15.92%, the highest ever in the state. Earlier, on November 15, the city had recorded a positivity rate of 15.33%. “There are no ICU beds available in most big hospitals, both public and private. There is no sign of the outbreak ebbing either,” said a senior doctor at AIIMS, warning that if cases continue to grow at this speed, the capital’s health infrastructure may collapse. Currently, Delhi has 50,736 active cases, of which 24,155 (50%) are under home isolation. The rest are admitted to hospitals or Covid Care Centres. According to real-time data on Covid beds, there are only 163 ventilator beds available across Delhi. The number of available ICU beds without a ventilator is 452. This includes the new beds added by the government over the past three days by turning some of its hospitals, like Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, into a dedicated Covid facility. “AIIMS Trauma Centre is running full. We have started a new ward in the burns ward and that too is almost full. We plan to add a few more beds,” Dr Rajesh Malhotra, chief of the centre said. He added that many young patients aged 45 years or less were getting admitted with severe symptoms. Safdarjung Hospital has run out of ventilator beds. Among private hospitals, Sir Ganga Ram, VIMHANS, Holy Family, Batra and Manipal have no ventilator beds available anymore. “My sister is experiencing respiratory distress due to Covid-19 but there aren’t any beds available. We are trying to use an oxygen cylinder at home,” Rajeev Dutta, a resident of Dwarka, said. Many families also complained about unavailability of anti-viral drug Remdesivir. The Centre has clarified that it was not advised for patients under home isolation. “People aren’t getting beds in hospitals. That’s why even those with moderate to severe symptoms are being managed at home through tele and video consultation. There should be some mechanism to avail the necessary medications for such patients,” said a doctor. At 7.67 lakh, Delhi has the sixth highest number of Covid cases in the country. With 11,540 deaths, Delhi’s toll is the fourth highest in the country. Maharashtra has reported the maximum of 58,804 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/health-infra-gasps-as-cases-and-distress-spiral/articleshow/82074139.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Ankita Singh, a resident of Krishnanagar, had a tough time in taking her 59-year-old father for the Covid test. The law student has been calling up the Integrated Covid Command Control Centre, and even went to KGMU and RMLIMS but in vain. “It’s the third day that I have been asking people to tell me a way of getting my father tested. He has been getting high fever and has lost sense of smell or taste. He has been even complaining of body ache. We have kept him in home isolation and giving medicines, but we want an immediate test to be done,” said the 27-year-old student. Aishbagh resident Ram Lotan Dwivedi (70) said, “I called up ICCC to help me in getting tested after my son came positive on April 6, but the person who attended the call told me that I won’t get infected since I had been vaccinated.” NB Singh (60), a resident of Alambagh, who tested positive on April 8, said, “When I started showing symptoms, I got myself tested at a private hospital through Rapid Antigen Test. I wanted a RT-PCR done, so called up ICCC but nobody took the call. I also came to know that authorities were providing medicines to those testing positive and are in home isolation, but nobody has come to my home so far.” Rajendra Nagar resident Savita Singh (32) said, “I tested positive on April 8. I wanted someone from the health department to collect the swab sample of my mother for testing, give medicines, guide us about the protocols to be followed in home isolation, but nobody came.” Raj Kumar (30), resident of Manaknagar, said, “My whole family tested positive on April 8. A health department team came two days later to give medicines, but since I am a healthcare professional I found that two medicines were missing from the kit. In their pace, a medicine was given which is not required at all.” Resident of Indiranagar, Lalit Kumar (56) said, “After three members of my family tested positive on April 12, I called ICCC where the attendant said that a team will be sent soon for contact tracing, but nobody came.

Soon after the event, 13 participants –10 serving and two retired LU teachers, and the principal of a degree college in Lakhimpur Kheri – tested positive. Of these, a serving and a retired professor (Prof BK Shukla and Prof Ashok Kalia) have died, while the condition of three is critical. There are reports that several other participants from Delhi and Meerut have tested positive. Prof Shukla was the head of LU’s Sanskrit department and the institute, besides dean of Arts faculty, while Prof Kalia was the former head of LU’s Sanskrit department and former vice-chancellor of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, Varanasi. Both were renowned Sanskrit scholars. Prof Kalia was also a Padma Shri awardee. Among those critical and in ICU include a retired Sanskrit professor and his wife (under treatment at a hospital in Delhi), and a professor in philosophy department, who is on a ventilator. A professor said the permission for such an event was granted by the proctor office, superintendent of works and vice-chancellor. “You cannot hold teachers or Sanskrit department staff responsible. They had already invited limited number of participants in view of Covid-19 pandemic. The primary task of teachers was to coordinate guest lists and academic activities. Implementation and supervision of safety protocol is the responsibility of LU administration. Such events are being held in many universities and it’s their officers who ensure precautions,” said a senior professor in Arts faculty. Denying negligence, LU VC Prof AK Rai said, “It’s wrong to single out an event for Covid spread on the campus. Several other teachers and non-teaching staff who had not attended the event have also been infected during the recent surge. Usually, organizers ensure Covid protocol during such events but more people came for the event due to the presence of eminent guests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/13-cases-2-deaths-was-lu-event-a-super-spreader/articleshow/82074167.cms||Mohita Tewari

Justice Yogesh Khanna said the IO in the case should allow the family to view the footage of the spot where the incident took place whenever they want to, after the kin said there were several cameras from which footage had survived. While the family sought copies of the footage, police opposed the demand, arguing that it was still investigating and trying to identify the suspects. Meanwhile, the court also allowed the grandfather of the deceased to seek opinion of experts on the victim’s postmortem and X-Ray reports and listed the matter for hearing on July 26. The grandfather, Hardeep Singh, has alleged that police shot his grandson and he did not die of injuries from the tractor. However, both Delhi and Uttar Pradesh police had told the court that Navreet did not suffer any gunshot wounds. During the hearing, advocates Vrinda Grover and Soutik Banerjee, representing Hardeep Singh, said the family needed time to seek experts’ evaluation of the material provided to them by police, which included postmortem report and video and X-ray report of the deceased. The high court had earlier directed Delhi health secretary to constitute a board of medical and forensic experts and a radiologist to examine the X-Ray report. It had also asked the doctors of Maulana Azad Medical College to prepare the X-Ray report from the original X-Ray plate, which was received by Delhi Police from its Uttar Pradesh counterpart.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farmer-death-family-to-get-access-to-cctv-clip/articleshow/82091447.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The civic body plans to complete the long-pending project by October-end. Once completed, a commuter would reach Ajmer Road via Hawa Sadak within 10 minutes. A senior engineer said four ramps would be constructed for traffic to ascend and descend from elevated road. Also, an existing ramp of Ajmer Road elevated structure will be utilised. Commuters plying from Ambedkar Circle will have an option to ascend at Nandpuri near Hilton Hotel using the ramp. Similarly, JDA has planned to connect the existing elevated road at Ajmer Road, which was constructed by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) with the new structure.  Commuters traveling the entire 2.8km stretch will ascend at Shyam Nagar, Sabzi Mandi, before the junction using existing ramp of the Ajmer Road elevated road. “Having two ascending ramps for commuters plying between Ambedkar Circle and Ajmer road will benefit many residents. If the ramp was not constructed at Nandpuri, people living in the area would have avoided using the elevated road as they had to take a U-turn from Sodala to reach their destination.” Similarly, the JDA has constructed the 1.8km-long elevated structure for commuters plying from Ajmer Road end. The elevated road ascends in front of Hirapura power house and descends near Kathputli Nagar. An official claimed 90 % of the elevated work had been completed and it is expected to be thrown open for public in October-end. A senior official informed the JDA will launch three spans having a height of 36 feet over the railway crossing. Similarly, eight spans will be launched between Ram Mandir and railway crossing end. A senior engineer said, “The JDA will be allowed to work for 4 hours over the railway crossing stretch. It would take at least two months to complete the entire construction. Apart from this, 90% of the work of the structure has been completed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-begins-sodala-elevated-road-work-over-railway-crossing-stretch/articleshow/82073284.cms||---

---||Goa||Laurent Blanc disappointed as Al Rayyan draw a blank||Margao: Time was fast running out when Al Rayyan right-back Mohammed Alaaeldin made a run, and from just outside the box sent in a cross that evaded all players in orange jerseys. Shoja Khalilzadeh found himself in the right place at the right time but his low header hit the side-netting. Coach Laurent Blanc – a World Cup winner with France in 1998 and former manager at PSG -- turned his face away from the field. He could not see this anymore. For a majority of the game against FC Goa, Al Rayyan were the better side. There were several other chances like the one in the final minute of regulation time, but the Qatar heavyweights only drew a blank. “I think in the first 15-20 minutes, Goa played well. We lost control,” Blanc told TOI during the post-match press conference on Wednesday. “For the next 60-70 minutes, there were lot of occasions (for us) to score. Believe me, if you score one, maybe (there will be) a lot more goals. But congratulations to Goa They defended a lot and got one point.” Al Rayyan had 12 shots, three of them on target and Blanc understandably was not pleased with his team’s lack of sharpness upfront. The weather also didn’t make it any easier for the visitors in their AFC Champions League group opener at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda. “The conditions were very, very difficult. I just hope we can score against Persepolis (in the next game),” said Blanc. It won’t be easy for Blanc’s side as they are up against last year’s finalists. Unless, they take their chances. “In football, whether it’s in India or in France, if you don’t score you don’t win. I think my team deserved to win the game because there were a lot of possibilities. Lot of respect for FC Goa as they gave their best. “I am a little disappointed. When you play a football game, you wait for some goals. I would have preferred 1-1 than nil-nil. Because goals are the most important,” said Blanc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/laurent-blanc-disappointed-as-al-rayyan-draw-a-blank/articleshow/82091470.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra National Law University-N to produce trained judges who can directly be recruited: CJI Bobde||NAGPUR: Maharashtra National Law University (MNLU) here would produce judicial officers on the lines of the National Defence Academy through new courses introduced by it, said Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Bobde. Speaking at the inauguration MNLU-N’s new academic block at Waranga on Wardha Road on Wednesday, the CJI said the premier law institution had also introduced a course in ‘Nyaya Shastra’ based on the ancient Indian judicial system. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Supreme Court judge Bhushan Gavai, Bombay High Court Chief Justice Dipankar Datta, Nagpur bench administrative judge Sunil Shukre, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari, higher and technical education minister Uday Samant, guardian minister Nitin Raut and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis also graced event conducted in a blended mode. While the CJI along with justices Gavai, Datta and Shukre were at the new campus, others joined virtually. Many sitting and retired HC judges, lawyers and academics related to the legal fraternity from the entire country witnessed the event on YouTube and other online platforms. MNLU-N vice-chancellor Vijender Kumar shared the dais and officer on special duty (OSD) Ramesh Kumar, also the in-charge of the building committee, addressed the students. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar couldn’t attend the event due to emergency but he sent a written congratulatory message to the administration and students. Explaining the innovative courses introduced by the MNLU-N, CJI Bobde, who is also the university’s chancellor, said when the students pursuing specialized courses for judicial officers would graduate, they wouldn’t need to undergo training for judges and can be directly recruited. “The other course in Nyay Shastra was a bit difficult to impart as it was in Sanskrit. MNLU-N tied up with Ramtek-based Kavi Kulguru Kalidas Sanskrit University in this regard. We have inherited the judicial system from the British. However, our ancient system isn’t inferior to anyone. The benefits of introducing these innovative courses would be realized in the long run,” he said. Explaining the MNLU-N’s specialities, Bobde said it intended to impart a national outlook to all those who study here. “The students and faculty hail from across India. There’s no regionalism or narrow mindedness that distinguishes this institution from ordinary law colleges. Its classrooms are world-class having all hi-tech devices under one roof. The facilities provided can be compared to globally renowned institutions like Harvard, Oxford and Cambridge.” Explaining the MNLU-N’s concept, the CJI said it was first mooted by former SC judge Vikas Sirpurkar to then President Pratibha Patil, who instantly agreed to it. “Gadkari then advised us to hold a meeting with Fadnavis, who was CM then. During our meeting, the latter also supported the concept that led to a dream turning into a reality. Today, I am extremely proud to see this magnificent edifice. Its classrooms and facilities left me dumbfounded and the entire credit goes to architect Paramjit Singh Ahuja and his team.” Stressing that change in the government didn’t adversely affect MNLU-N’s development, the CJI said it was a tribute to the entire political leadership. “The former and current administration continued their support with the same enthusiasm and vigour. I must express gratitude to the CM and Raut for their unflinching support,” he said. Justice Gavai said CJI had clearly told his vision about MNLU-N in 2016 that it should be different from other law schools and impart innovative courses. “In the last five years we have been fulfilling his dream. When the entire construction is completed, MNLU-N would be one of the best institutions producing judges and lawyers,” he added. CJI nominates Gavai as new MNLU-N chancellor Justice Bobde declared that justice Gavai would succeed him as MNLU-N chancellor. “Gavai has made untiring efforts for this institution, being a chairman of its building construction committee. His enthusiasm is infectious and even pro-chancellor Justice Dutta has inherited it. The original idea was to have the concept of Gurukul, the ancient concept, where the students could be taught under the tree. I am sure with facilities like the research centre, yoga, meditation, there would be fruitful interaction among the students and teachers,” the CJI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mnlu-n-to-produce-trained-judges-who-can-directly-be-recruited-cji-bobde/articleshow/82073324.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nashik||Migrant workers rush to catch trains back home||Nashik: The severe restrictions imposed by the state government for the next 15 days to stop the spread of Covid-19 saw increased rush of migrant workers at the Nashik Road railway station. With the railway station authorities not allowing anyone inside the station without a confirmed ticket, the workers were worried about reaching their hometowns in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar on time. Some migrant workers, who had heard about possible restrictions in the offing, had already started making rounds at the Nashik Road Railway station to board a train to their home state. However, the rush increased on Wednesday after stringent restrictions were announced by the state government. Gopal Chauhan, who works at a construction site in the Cidco area, said he was unable to get a confirmed train ticket and could not afford to travel by a private bus. “I reached here with my two children and wife but the station authorities are not allowing me inside as we do not have a confirmed ticket. Even the people at the ticket booking office are not explaining for which train I can get a confirmed ticket to Bhopal,” he told TOI. Meanwhile, a manager of a private passenger bus agency said that no private buses from Maharashtra are allowed into Madhya Pradesh from the last week of March. Sohail Ansari, who had come to the railway station with his wife and children, said he had been making rounds to the railway station for the past eight days and had managed to get a confirmed ticket. “The owner of the bakery where I was working closed it down about a fortnight back. he left for his hometown but I managed to get a confirmed ticket only today,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/migrant-workers-rush-to-catch-trains-back-home/articleshow/82070573.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The farmers, who come from the rural areas, will have to sell their produce at these designated vegetable markets. They will not be allowed to sell vegetables along the roads in the city. Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav has instructed all the six divisional officers to zero in on the open spaces in their respective jurisdiction immediately so that the markets can start operating within 48 hours. NMC squads will be deployed in market places to ensure buyers and sellers follow the protocol. “We have already started the process of decentralising vegetable and fruit markets in the city as per the new government order to ensure social distancing and other appropriate Covid behaviours are followed,” said additional municipal commissioner Pravin Ashtikar. NMC deputy commissioner Pradeep Chaudhari said the divisional officers are already in the process to finalise the locations to allow farmers and fruit vendors to sell their produce at the market. “During lockdown last year, we had allowed farmers to sell their vegetables at around 102 open spaces and various locations in the city. Apart from these locations, we will add more locations so that buyers are scattered and there will not be rush in any particular markets,” said Chaudhari. “Apart from this, we will also allow farmers to sell their vegetables at the open areas near housing societies in the city,” said Chaudhari. They will have to follow all the norms like wearing masks and maintaining social distance, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/temporary-markets-to-be-set-up-in-nashik-city/articleshow/82070580.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Lucknow||H Vasant, music maestro behind popular DD serials, passes away||Lucknow: Popularly known as the ‘Musical Man of Lucknow’, H Vasant, who is credited to have started choral group singing at Akashvaani (All India Radio) here in 1976, passed away on Tuesday afternoon. He was 86. The music composer, who made a mark in the history of All India Radio and Lucknow Doordarshan with his numerous compositions and experiments, breathed his last in Lucknow following heart issues. Vasant is survived by his wife, Kalpana, and son, Gunjan. This is the second loss that Lucknow has suffered in three days. Writer and historian Yogesh Praveen had passed away on April 12. Originally belonging to Mangalore, Vasant’s tryst with Lucknow began when he moved to the city in 1974 from Mumbai (then Bombay). Before entering the world of music, Vasant had worked on several projects with singers like Asha Bhosle and Aparna Maykar. Later, he swooned the audience with his background music in Lucknow Doordarshan’s first serial ‘Bibi Natiyon Wali’, written by Indian satirist and writer KP Saxena. The award winning serial was an instant hit where Vasant not only composed its music but also sung the title song. The singer-composer also received the Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 2006 for his contributions. “He was an A-grade composer of All India Radio who added a new dimension to the field of music with his experiments, background symphonies, efforts to make people understand the chorus music and singing, and the discipline that goes into it. Not only traditional music, he had a strong hold over western music too. There was so much to learn from him everyday. Even till his last days, he was associated with both AIR and Doordarshan,” said Shobhna Jagdish, one of the former news anchors at Lucknow Doordarshan, who is also the sister-in-law of Vasant. His love for music, artistic works and gentle behavior made him very popular among people of Lucknow. “It was as if he lived and breathed music. It is a tragic loss for the people of Lucknow since we lost him and historian Yogesh Praveen in a matter of two days. He taught music to several of his students for free. The way he could play any musical instrument and his words, mesmerised one and all. We could feel the emotions behind his melodies and music. I was always in awe of his unbridled creativity. His experiences and legacy was clearly visible in his works,” said Anil Rastogi, theatre artist and actor who was closely associated with Vasant. Sunil Chaudhary, a friend and student of Vasant, said, “He was a guiding light, such a master, such a music arranger, a pianist and conductor of choir. He once said a man must know three things in life –typing, horse riding and piano. He was a true inspiration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/h-vasant-music-maestro-behind-popular-dd-serials-passes-away/articleshow/82074227.cms||Aditi Singh

Police identified the deceased as Kaliyammal, 95, of Bharathi Street at Avalpoondurai. According to the Arachalur police, the victim’s grandson M Poovizhi Selvan, 33, was an alcoholic.

Under the law in India, there is no provision in which a transgender person can marry — a male or a female — due to which their relationship is still not accepted by the society or by law. Neither Personal Marriage Acts nor Special Marriage Act mentions transgenders, which has made it difficult for them to validate their relationship in public. Malini says, “I recognise myself as transgender and my partner is completely accepting to this fact but we are not socially or legally accepted as people do not consider it to be a right form of relationship. There are thousands of transgenders in the state but unless we have legal marital rights as a spouse, there will be no security for us.” Unlike Malini and Ankit, most transgenders have to hide their relationship from the society. Sunita (name changed), another transgender from Jaipur, was in a relationship with a man for six years secretly, as it was difficult for the guy to accept her socially. “He got married two years back which was painful for me. I understand his difficulty but if there was some kind of a law in favour of our community, I guess it would have been easier for us. Transgenders have always been socially boycotted. Getting marital rights will be another step in getting our freedom to live as a dignified citizen,” said Sunita. Majority of the transgenders are in a live-in relationship with their partners, although they can get married in a religious ceremony. Pushpa Mai, head of Nayi Bhor Organization said, “I agree that a transgender can marry his/her partner in a religious ceremony, but if the partner leaves her after ten years, what legal rights do they have? We want legal backing to our rights that will help us secure our future. There is an urgent need to amend the law.” However, there is a way through which a transgender can legally marry. According to a Supreme Court judgment, a person can choose to declare being a male, female or transgender. Hence, if a man later changes his sex and becomes a woman, declares himself as a woman and not as a transgender, he can marry legally under the law. Same goes in case of a woman. Mitul Jain, a Rajasthan High Court lawyer, who has been working with the community for a long time, said, “This has been a long-standing demand of the community — to get married with transgender status. In 2019, Transgender Persons Protection of Rights Act was implemented, in which there was no mention of property or marital rights of the community. There is a need to implement the law as soon as possible to uplift these people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/marital-rights-still-elude-transgender-community/articleshow/82073287.cms||---

Even those mild showers were received only in few parts of the city and were not widespread. Last year by this time, the city had received at least a couple of strong summer showers drenching the cityscape. This year, however, the city barely managed to get good rain. Two days back, parts of the city received mild showers and once again on Wednesday there were drizzles. “`It started drizzling around 12.45pm in Podanur and Ramanathapuram which lasted for about 10 minutes. But in Singanallur there was no rain,’’ a resident of Singanallur said. Weathermen have forecast that several parts of Tamil Nadu including the western belt would receive moderate rainfall this week. But the summer spells have given the city a miss while some regions like Chennai and Madurai have received showers over the past few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mild-showers-in-some-parts-of-city/articleshow/82073290.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Agra||UP: In this temple, goddess Durga wears mask||AGRA: On the second day of Chaitra Navratri Wednesday, devotees visiting a temple in Etah were taken by surprise when they found the idol of goddess Durga wearing a face mask and priests offering masks as ‘prasad’. The temple administration’s initiative soon became the talk of the town even as the Etah district recorded 81 Covid-19 positive cases on Wednesday. Manoj Sharma, a priest at the Durga temple located on GT Road in Etah, said, “As Navratri is coinciding with the second Covid-19 wave in Uttar Pradesh and people are thronging temples in a large numbers, we have put a face mask on the idol of the goddess and have been distributing face masks as ‘prasad’ to promote Covid-appropriate behaviour among devotees. Besides, we have made proper arrangement for hand sanitiser and also placed Covid-19 advisory at several places on the temple premises to ensure devotees do not pose a danger to public health and behave as responsible citizens.” “Abiding by the government's guidelines, we are not allowing more than five devotees on the temple premises at a time. Also, social distancing norms are religiously being followed during the morning and evening aarti,” added Sharma. Meanwhile, 20,510 people were declared Covid-19 positive in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday, while 68 succumbed to the deadly virus in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/in-this-up-temple-even-goddess-durga-wears-mask/articleshow/82071312.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Lucknow||Ramzan begins on pious, subdued note||Lucknow: The first day of Ramzan saw the devout fasting while remaining confined to their homes due to the pandemic second wave surge. The usual fervour of Ramzan was missing, as people stayed indoors and observed the first day of the holy month with their families. Many people said they miss the hustle and bustle at Akbari Gate in Chowk and at iftars. Recalling the days when she and her sisters used to visit the Old City to relish their favourite delicacies during Ramzan, Saheba Ramzi Khan said, “Ramzan amid Covid crisis is very different. Last year, there was lockdown and so we couldn’t observe it like earlier. This year too we miss the iftars, jugs of Roohafza, sehri with nahari kulcha, kebabs and the most necessary khajoor (dates). All celebrations this year have to be low key due to rising cases,” she said. Masood Abdullah and his daughter Asreen kept roza and did iftar with their family while Gomtinagar resident Rubina Sheikh observed the first day by distributing packed sweets among the needy. “During Ramzan, we distribute dates, milk and fruits. We hope the pandemic ends within the holy month with our prayers,” she said. Atul Keshav Rawat, a Kashmiri Pandit who has been observing roza for the past eight years marked the day with prayers. “I come from a family that believes God has no religion, except for the one that ensures common good. Though I have been observing fast, but I helped my students who are in need of essentials,” said the Hussainganj resident. Few citizens who couldn’t observe roza due to ill health said they are praying for the safety of all. “We rue that we are not able to observe roza this year since some family members are sick. But, we have full faith in Allah and pray the pandemic ends soon and people don’t suffer any further and all are hale and healthy,” said Sophia Haider. At mosques, people were seen adhering to Covid protocols and only five devotees were present at a time for taraweeh prayers. Both Shia and Sunni clerics have been issuing advisories and appeals to people to observe Ramzan from home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ramzan-begins-on-pious-subdued-note/articleshow/82074257.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Aurangabad||Restrictions put on CT-scan use for Covid diagnosis||Aurangabad: A positive RT-PCR test or referral made by a treating doctor will be mandatory for CT-scan as a part of Covid treatment or diagnosis in Aurangabad district. Observing that CT-scan centres were witnessing unwanted crowding, the district administration has put restrictions on the rampant use of such diagnostic techniques during the pandemic. Aurangabad collector Sunil Chavan said CT-scan itself is discouraged as a tool for Covid diagnosis. “The health authorities are conducting Covid testing on a large scale every day and suspects should undergo the same first to detect Covid-19. Besides RT-PCR and antigen testing, X-ray and prescribed blood tests can prove handy in detecting Covid infection,” he said. Chavan said the central team that had recently visited Aurangabad had objected to large-scale CT-scans being conducted for Covid diagnosis. “The CT-scan centres have become major sources of Covid infection. It is essential to put a check on crowding at these places,” he said, justifying the scan in question for individuals with very low oxygen level among other serious patients. The district administration has also asked all CT-scan centres to provide daily diagnostic details to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in a stipulated format. Dr Sharad Kondekar, the head of the Association of Radiologists in Aurangabad district, said, “False negative RT-PCR results can be detected with the help of CT-scan effectively. Also, there are patients with other major illnesses who need CT-scans done to negate the possibility of Covid-19 in order to avail treatment. As the outcome of RT-PCR testing is available within 24-hours, CT-scan helps such patients,” he said. Kondekar added that all radiologists in Aurangabad have been asked to comply with the directives issued by the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/restrictions-put-on-ct-scan-use-for-covid-diagnosis/articleshow/82071313.cms||---
---||Delhi||Virus not slowing down, but we’ve enough beds: Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: With Covid-19 cases increasing rapidly in the capital and showing no trend of slowing down, health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday appealed to everyone to step out only when needed and follow all safety measures. “The trend has not slowed down yet as the last time wherein the number went down with each passing day. Since the past few weeks, cases are doubling in Delhi as well as the country,” he said, adding that Delhi government had been augmenting the bed capacity for Covid-19 patients. “On the Delhi Govt app, the total bed count was 6,000 one week ago. Now, the count is more than 13,000 and orders have been given to escalate the beds,” he said during a press briefing. TimesViewThe frightening rise of Covid-19 cases has put hospital infrastructure under severe strain in the city. At such a critical juncture, access to a ventilator may be the difference between life and death for a patient. The government must ensure that the pace at which it augments the availability of life-saving medical equipment doesn’t fall behind the speed with which the disease is spreading.“This is a time of crisis and everyone has to come together to defeat the virus. Any unnecessary movement like going for celebrations or gatherings must be avoided,” the health minister said. “Even if a healthy person contracts the virus, or is asymptomatic, they must not forget that they can be carriers of the virus to their families and friends, who may be highly vulnerable to the virus,” Jain said. Jain paid a surprise visit to Delhi government’s Lok Nayak hospital later in the day to meet patients and their family members, take feedback and review the facilities. He directed the hospital management to ensure that the admission process was fastened further and there should be zero rejection of patients. “Delhi is seeing an unprecedented surge. In view of the same, I visited the patients at LNJP Hospital. LNJP has treated the maximum number of patients in India. The doctors and staff have been working really hard and I am very grateful for their dedication,” Jain said after the visit. “I also met the patients and their family members to ask about their well-being and take their feedback,” he added. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said journalists were working from the frontline in the battle against Covid-19 and should be inoculated against the virus. “Journalists are reporting from most adverse situations. They shud be treated as frontline workers and shud be allowed vaccination on priority. Delhi govt is writing to centre in this regard (sic),” the chief minister tweeted. Reiterating that people who have a mild infection should refrain from getting admitted to a hospital, Jain said, “In case one catches a fever, I urge them not to panic. If one is tested positive, and has mild symptoms, they shouldn’t rush towards getting hospitalised. Till the time they are not advised by a doctor, or have severe symptoms, they should refrain from admission to hospitals,” he said, adding that if those with mild symptoms occupied beds, there would be no space left for the severely sick. Jain also said that though initially ventilators were considered as a primary health tool, the truth was that it was the last resort. “There are many levels before that, namely medication, home isolation, administering oxygen, HFNO, Bi-pap, etc,” he said, adding that there was no shortage of ventilators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/virus-not-slowing-down-but-weve-enough-beds-jain/articleshow/82074282.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kolkata||Evaluation worry for Class X kids; Plus-II students fret over uncertainty||Kolkata: The CBSE’s decision to cancel the Class X board examinations and postpone the Class XII exams have come as a temporary relief for students who have been feeling the stress over the uncertainty surrounding the examinations. But the decisions have given rise to all sorts of speculations. While Class X kids are worried over the evaluation process, the deferment of exams has led to another round of wait for Class XII students. Class XII students are uncertain when the new dates will be announced. Class X students, on the other hand, expect the board to allot a major weightage to the pre-board examinations that may not have been satisfactory for many. “It is understandable that the exams had to be postponed. But it still is frustrating given that we have to continue revising the subjects endlessly. The deferment of the exam will also delay college admissions. Our future is uncertain. There is no assurance of a timeline within which we will get the results,” said Urmi Maitra, a class XII student of the DPS Ruby Park, living in Santoshpur. Class X Board examinee, Shankhasubhra Mandal, from South Point High School said that though he has found a seat in the science stream in the school itself, he feels cancellation of the exam will hamper his future. “As we progress, the marks from Class X examinations may be considered during job appointments. No class X examinations may later lead to losing out in the future competitions,” Mandal said. Rima Ghosh is suffering from Covid for the past few days and is hospitalized. “I was suffering from severe diarrhoea. Doctors initially ignored that I may have Covid. It was only during a test, I was found to be positive. I was getting worried due to my sickness as I have lost considerable study time. I was stressed and was planning ways to cope up. With the news of the examinations being cancelled, I am a bit relaxed,” said the CBSE class X board examinee. Teachers feel that this was the best decision that could have been taken. “Taking into account the current situation it is the right move. It is a relief for the time being as we were concerned that children are at the risk of contracting the virus during an offline mode. The class X examinees have two more years to prove themselves. Since it is not affecting the entire world, we hope that while framing the policies, the future of the students won’t be adversely affected,” added Paramita Sarkar, coordinator of classes IX and X in South Point High School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/evaluation-worry-for-class-x-kids-plus-ii-students-fret-over-uncertainty/articleshow/82072409.cms||Somdatta Basu

The alleged cheating took place between January 1 and January 29. The suspects duped him on the pretext of installing a mobile tower at his house and pay him considerable rent for the same. The victim, Yuvraj Chitte, told TOI, “After being duped, I came forward to lodge a complaint so that not only the suspects are arrested but also to raise awareness among the masses.” Based on Chitte’s complaint, Jinsi police have registered a case of cheating against six suspects, including two women, who coordinated with him by falsely claiming to be representatives of a private telecom company. Inspector Rajesh Mayekar said, “The teacher received a text message claiming that the private telecom company is looking for private space for installing its mobile phone towers. The suspects offered Rs 75,000 rent per month against the installation.” Falling prey to the trap, teacher dialed a call on the given number. The suspects, on the pretext of completing the procedure, collected his identity proof and documents of the property where the tower was being proposed to be installed. They also took verification and installation charges from Chitte in multiple instalments. After ending up paying Rs 4.71 lakh to the suspects, the teacher smelled the overall scheme fishy, following which he verified the same only to find that he has been taken for a ride by the suspects. Chitte also said that one of his neighbours, a pensioner, too, was duped in a similar fashion to the tune of Rs 3 lakh. Fearing social stigma, his neighbour abstained from filing a police complaint against the suspects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/teacher-duped-of-rs-4-71l-on-pretext-of-installing-mobile-tower/articleshow/82071321.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Chandigarh||HP hoteliers near bankruptcy as second Covid wave spells doom||Manali: With the number of tourists visiting Himachal gradually decreasing and hotels reporting cancellations of bookings, the hoteliers and others associated with the tourism industry say they are very close to bankruptcy. A day after Himachal government had announced that tourists from seven highly-affected states and union territories will need to bring negative RT-PCR report to visit Himachal from April 16, the tourism stakeholders held a meeting in Manali on Monday. They reached a conclusion that if government does not work on attracting tourists in May and June, most of them, who are already defaulters in banks due to lockdown last year, will go bankrupt. Himachal Pradesh Travel Agents’ Association president Budhi Parkash said, “Tourists are in panic. A lockdown-like situation in many states is already weighing heavy on our industry. RT-PCR tests are not available easily at many places. And sometimes it is taking too long to get the report. Tourists are also hesitating in travelling in buses. These reasons are enough for most tourists to cancel or postpone their trips.” The number of tourists in Himachal used to increase from April. Most hotels and other service providers used to charge full seasonal amount for the services from mid-April to June 30. As there is very thin tourist flow, most hoteliers and others are offering discounted rates even for May and June. Volvo buses used to be the main mode of transportation for tourists between Delhi and Manali. These days most tourist buses are parked without passengers and some others are plying half-empty. “We shall support government in its fight against Covid-19 pandemic. But at the same time, we are concerned about the loan repayment. Last year, we availed moratorium and then rescheduled the loan. Many hoteliers are getting phone calls from banks to settle the dues. We are totally dependent on summer tourist season for our earnings. As dark clouds are hovering over the season, we again look at the government for help,” Thakur added.Meanwhile, tourism deputy director held a meeting with tourism stakeholders in Manali to seek their inputs on Covid situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hp-hoteliers-near-bankruptcy-as-second-covid-wave-spells-doom/articleshow/82064585.cms||---

NMC administration has decided to appoint the eligible candidates immediately after the interviews. “There has been a rise in the number of cases per day. Accordingly, we are continuously enhancing our health infrastructure like opening new Covid care centres and increasing bed capacity in the existing Covid hospitals of the civic body,” said additional municipal commissioner Praveen Ashtikar.Since February, NMC has appointed 1,300 health workers, but 600 of them are yet to join. “We have already given notices to the employees, who have been appointed but not joined. We have also decided to take legal action against such employees under the disaster management and epidemic diseases act,” he said.NMC has two Covid hospitals- Bytco and Zakir Hussain with a total capacity of 910 beds, including 760 beds in Bytco and 150 beds in Zakir Hussain hospital. NMC needs at least 300 employees in Bytco hospital alone, but there are at present only 150 health staffers. The situation is similar in Zakir Hussain hospital, where only 50% of the health staff is working.Hence, NMC needs more health staff and the civic administration has also increased the salaries for various posts between Rs 2,000 and 1 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-plans-walk-in-interviews-to-recruit-health-staff/articleshow/82070613.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Paramedic, med student & MR held for ‘black market’ sale of Remdesivir||MUMBAI: A paramedic, a medical student and a medical representative (MR) were arrested for allegedly selling Remdesivir injections in the black market. Police said the MR procured the injections from the pharmacy of a suburban hospital in a legal manner while his co-accused sold it at a higher price in black.  An informant told Malwani police earlier this week that a paramedic known to him was offering Remdesivir injections at Rs 20,000 each against the actual price of Rs 5,400. The paramedic had allegedly suggested to the informant he could re-sell it at a higher rate and make his own commission. Malwani police immediately informed Food and Drugs Authority (FDA). A trap was laid at Charkop Naka in Kandivli on April 13. Around 7.30pm, the paramedic, Rizwan Mansuri (32), arrived at the location with a student, Siddharth Yadav (21). The police had already sent their informant with Rs 60,000 in cash to make the purchase so they could nab the accused red-handed. “Mansuri handed over three Remdesivir injections to the informant while Yadav accepted the cash. Our team and the FDA team swung into action and the two men were taken into custody,” said investigating officer Rakesh Pawar. It turned out that Yadav is a medical student based in Kandivli and comes from a family of doctors. Yadav told the police that he had procured the injections through an MR, Chiranjeevi Vishwakarma (28), employed with a pharma company. The cops got Yadav to dial Vishwakarma and summon him for a meeting. When Vishwakarma arrived, he was taken into custody. ‘Through his academic background, Yadav had come into contact with Mansuri and Vishwakarma, both of whom are Kandivli residents,” said senior inspector Shekhar Bhalerao, Malwani police. Vishwakarma told officials he had presented a Covid-19 patient’s health report, his Aadhar card and a doctor’s prescription for purchasing the three Remdesivir injections from the pharmacy of Hayyat Hospital, Malwani. Inquiries are on with Vishwakarma to find out how he procured the health report and doctor’s prescription. The three were booked under IPC, Essential Commodities Act, Drugs (Prices Control) Order and Drugs and Cosmetics Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-paramedic-med-student-mr-held-for-black-market-sale-of-remdesivir/articleshow/82072415.cms||Nitasha Natu

Police said that the man has been accused of assaulting his wife by suspecting her character. One such heated argument over a petty issue resulted into an incident of domestic violence, following which she took the extreme step. At the time of incident, the man was sitting outside their house along with his children. The suspect has been identified as Milind Tupe of Ashoknagar in the MIDC Chikalthana area of the city. He has been remanded to three-day police custody. Citing the account given by victim’s children aged six and five years, police said that the woman took the extreme step after being assaulted by their father. Investigation officer and police sub-inspector Amol Nagre said, “He has been booked on the charges abetting suicide, domestic violence and for intentional insult for provoking peace of breach.” The officer, citing the family members’ account, said that since their marriage about eight years back, there have been serious differences between the two. The man often suspected her character and it would result in serious arguments and even domestic violence. A few months back, angered over frequent domestic violence, the woman left for parents home. Later, the suspect apologized to her and brought her back by assuring that he will not harass her, but but within days of returning, he allegedly started abusing and harassing her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/woman-hangs-herself-husband-held-for-abetting-suicide/articleshow/82071325.cms||Mohammed Akhef

There have been no meetings about the change of date or postponement of JEE Advanced. “CBSE exams are near and so the board had to react quickly. However, we are also keeping a close watch. We will wait for the CBSE to first declare the postponed dates of the XII exam and then perhaps we will take it up from there. Perhaps we will take a call by end of May, but as of now there is no change of date,” Chakraborty said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-change-in-iit-jee-exam-dates-yet/articleshow/82080031.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Seth spoke to Joshi over phone and suggested that the Coal India Limited subsidiary, Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), should take the lead in setting up the hospital equipped with doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and unhindered oxygen supply to attend to the critically Covid patients. “The Union minister agreed to the suggestion and spoke to CCL CMD P M Prasad. Prasad then rang me up and we had a detailed discussion on the matter. CCL said they will need the state government’s consent,” Seth told TOI. Seth later rang up the health secretary, K K Soan, and urged him to take initiative on the matter urgently. “The way cases are rising in Ranchi, there will soon be acute shortage of beds. Some drastic measures need to be taken at once. CCL manages the Mega Sports Complex, where it has been running the Jharkhand State Sports Promotion Society for nearly four years. There is ample space and CCL can use its CSR fund for building the hospital,” Seth said. Last month, the Ranchi administration had set up an 800-bed isolation centre in Khelgaon. The administration on Wednesday set up a dashboard in its website to provide real time status of bed occupancy in the city’s 19 designated Covid hospitals. “It will provide information on the type of beds available, such as non-oxygen, BPIP, ventilator and ICU. The information will be uploaded by the hospitals on real time basis and it’ll help critical patients immensely,” the district’s public relations officer, Prabhat Shankar, said. As of Wednesday night, the dashboard stated 50% of the 144 ventilator supported beds were occupied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/seth-speaks-to-joshi-urges-ccl-to-set-up-covid-hosp-in-ranchi/articleshow/82071674.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences approves purchase of CT scan, RT-PCR machines after court rap||RANCHI/CHATRA: The governing body of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences on Wednesday met virtually and approved the purchase of a CT scan machine with 256 slides and three RT-PCR machines which are essential for treatment of Covid. The meeting was presided over by state health minister Banna Gupta and attended by members, including state health secretary K K Soan, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth, Kanke MLA Samri lal and others. The decision comes after the state health department received flak from the high court last week which had said that it is a shame for the state largest hospital that it doesn’t have a CT scan machine which is essential for treating patients with lungs infection, especially those who have contracted Covid. Talking to TOI, state health minister Banna Gupta said, “The meeting was scheduled to be held in Marc,h but due to a rise in cases, it got delayed and had to be organised online. We have decided to increase the existing capacity of our RT-PCR labs and have approved appointment of four scientists and eight lab technicians for operating the machines.” The body also approved setting up of new bi-plane cath lab and an echocardiogram machine and facilities for dual chamber pacemakers at the cardiology department. “The cardiology department is experiencing additional patient load and an additional cath lab and ECG machine were required for long,” Gupta added. Meanwhile, Chatra sadar hospital dispatched five ventilators to Rims on Monday. Notably, ventilators are essential in treating critical Covid patients. In 2020, the sadar hospital was provided with 11 ventilators and with Monday’s dispatch, the hospital is left with only six. The civil surgeon was asked to send the ventilators to Rims by senior officials of the state health department. “The ventilators were installed in the burn ward of Chatra sadar hospital the and the technicians were imparted training to operate them. But the ventilators were not used even once and most of the technicians forgot how to operate the machines,” said a hospital source requesting anonymity. Civil surgeon Dr Ranjan Sinha said, “Since the ventilators were not being used here, the department asked us to send them to Rims.” Meanwhile, state health minister Banna Gupta on Tuesday had said there is no shortage of Remdesivir injections in the state. Gupta, while on his visit to the Covid-19 ward at sadar hospital in Ranchi, told media, “We have received 1,500 injections on Tuesday and have written to the Centre for more ventilators. Some patients who have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic and were admitted to the hospital are being sent to home isolation.” According to the health department, the state has 17,155 active Covid-19 cases. On Tuesday, the state recorded 2,844 fresh cases and 29 deaths.

---||Ranchi||Controlling Covid mgmt while campaigning: Jharkhand CM||DUMKA: A day after BJP accused the ruling mahagathbandhan of focusing on the Madhupur bypoll instead of the surge in the Covid pandemic across the state, chief minister Hemant Soren on Wednesday refuted the charges, saying that even though he has been camping in the constituency in Santhal Pargana for six days, he is in constant touch with senior officials and cabinet colleagues about Covid management. On Tuesday, BJP had urged the state government to declare a “medical emergency” in Jharkhand and “take over all private healthcare facilities” to stem the increase in the number of Covid cases and casualties and stop them from charging ehorbitant rates for testing, ambulances and other medical facilities. Speaking to reporters after addressing his last rally at Kamron village, Hemant said, "It's not that I have turned a blind eye towards the prevailing state of the pandemic during my six-day stay in Madhupur. I have been controlling Covid management by communicating with my cabinet ministers and department secretaries constantly to strengthen the pandemic management machinery in Jharkhand.” He diod not comment on the sharp rise in Covid cases and deaths across the state in the last two weeks. He added, "It is not as if elections are taking place only in Madhupur. Polls are happening in Bengal and other states as per the guidelines prescribed by the Election Commission. As a responsible political party, we are working to secure a win in Madhupur without hampering governance in any way. The attendance at my rallies over the last six days is a clear indication that the JMM candidate will register a landslide victory here.” Speaing to the media in Madhupur on Tuesday, BJP legislative party leader Babulal had said, “The state government has failed completely in controlling the spread of Covid. People are crying for medical attention while the chief minister is busy in campaigning for the bypoll. The government should immediately declare a health emergency in Jharkhand. The government is making false claims on vacant beds for Covid patients in the state while in reality people are standing in queues waiting for treatment at hospitals in Ranchi. The central government is willing to help but the state government is only interested in doing politics over issues.” On Tuesday, BJP MP from Godda, Nishikant Dubey, had said that hospitals in the constituency and other parts of Santhal Pargana were reeling under a crisis of basic medical facilities. “It's an irony that the CM is camping in Madhupur for several days to seek votes even as common people are running from pillar to post for oxygen for their infected relatives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/controlling-covid-mgmt-while-campaigning-jkhand-cm/articleshow/82071764.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Tirkey had first tested positive last year. His associates said he took his first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine on April 5, following which, he complained of breathlessness and fever. When his condition continued to deteriorate, his family members admitted him to Rims’ medicine ward on Monday. Later, on Tuesday, when he tested positive for the virus, he was shifted to the hospital’s Trauma Centre, which has been converted into a Covid ward. On Wednesday, Tirkey succumbed to the virus around 10.30am, his associates said. Condolences poured in with chief minister Hemant Soren tweeting, “I am saddened to learn about the death of Niel Tirkey. May God bless his soul and give strength to his family.” State Congress chief Rameshwar Oraon also expressed grief while Lohadarga MP Sukhdeo Bhagat said, “I have lost an elder brother and a sociable person. He was a leader who struggled for the issues of the people.” Tirkey, who is survived by his wife, a daughter and a son, began his political career as a student leader of Ajsu Party in 1987. In 1992, he joined JMM and successfully contested from Simdega in 1995. After winning the election again in 2000 on a JMM ticket, Tirkey was appointed as a social welfare minister in the Rabri Devi cabinet. Later, after the bifurcation of Jharkhand in the same year, Tirkey switched over to Congress. In 2009, he unsuccessfully contested in the Lok Sabha election on a Congress ticket and later, he failed to make a cut even in the assembly election. In the 2019 vidhan sabha election, Tirkey fought as an Ajsu Party candidate from Simdega, but lost to Congress’s Bhushan Bara. Meanwhile, Hemant paid tributes to former JMM MLA Simon Marandi at his native Dumariya village in Pakur’s Littipara constituency before he was laid to rest. Marandi died at a hospital in Kolkata late on Monday night after prolonged illness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ex-min-in-undivided-bihar-dies-with-covid-days-after-1st-vax-dose/articleshow/82072284.cms||---

---||India||Kerala HC restores Muslim women’s divorce rights||KOCHI: Overruling a 1972 judgment, the Kerala high court has restored the rights of Muslim women for divorce without resorting to judicial proceedings. A division bench of the high court pronounced the judgment in a bunch of cases that arose out of different proceedings before the family courts seeking varied relief. Noting that the Holy Quran recognises the right to divorce equally for both men and women, the court observed that the dilemma of Muslim women, particularly in the state of Kerala, came to the fore when a single-judge bench in the “K C Moyin versus Nafeesa and Others” case negated the right of Muslim women to invoke extrajudicial divorce in the light of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939. PTI Act restricts Muslim women on divorce: HC The court had then held that under no circumstances can a Muslim marriage be dissolved at the instance of the wife, except in accordance with the provisions of the Act. In its judgment, the division bench of Justices A Muhamed Mustaque and C S Dias analysed four major forms of dissolution of marriages as recognised under Islamic law and protected under the Shariat Act at the instance of the wife — talaq-e-tafwiz, khula, mubara’at and faskh. “On an overall analysis of the scheme of the Shariat Act as well as the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, we are of the considered view that the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act restricts Muslim women to annul their marriage invoking faskh except through the intervention of the court,” the HC said. “All other forms of extra-judicial divorce as referred in Section 2 of the Shariat Act are thus available to Muslim women. We hold that the law declared in K C Moyin’s case (supra) is not good law,” the court said in its judgment on April 9. The bench said there is no difficulty for the family court to endorse an extra-judicial divorce to declare the matrimonial status of a person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-hc-restores-muslim-womens-divorce-rights/articleshow/82075943.cms||---

Dr Pandey was a year short of retirementAccording to the American Journal of Medical Association, if anyone gets re-infected after effective immunisation, they may not get seriously ill and their oxygen level will be well maintained, Dr Neral said. “In most cases, they won’t need ventilator support. However, uncommon and rare cases are possible everywhere. If it is happening to 1% people it cannot be said that immunisation is not effective,” he explained.

He said the existing rail line and right of way (RoW) was conceptualised and implemented in the 1800s, way before the enactment of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, or even the issuance of Section 4 Notification under the Indian Forest act 1972 for the intention of notifying a reserve Forest. “Keeping this fact in mind, and on reading the Forest Conservation Act guidelines it is abundantly clear that the forest cover in possession of the railways along the RoW of the existing rail line did not require a clearance under the act,” Kshatriya submitted to the committee, adding that the act cannot be made applicable to a situation that exists over a century later. The company also submitted that the RoW for the existing single-line track comprising the villages of Caranzol, Sonaulim. Kulem in the Caranzol-Kulem section and villages of Collem and Calem and in the Kulem-Kale section has been excluded from the ambit of the sanctuary which was declared as a game sanctuary in 1967 under the Wild Birds and Animals Act 1965 vide a notification in 1985 under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. “Implicitly, the RoW would also therefore be outside its purview. However, the project proponent, RVNL is going through the rigour of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 for diversion of 86.954 ha which are absolutely essential for the doubling of the railway line in the new project,” the company stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/railways-justifies-cutting-trees-for-track-doubling/articleshow/82074510.cms||---

We will upgrade fire stations and its equipment within next one year, as the need is increasing due to tourism and industrial activities,” Sawant said, while speaking during the National Fire Services Day function. He said the DFES had attended to over 6,000 calls during the last financial year, which also included “false fire calls”. “People need to be aware that their false fire calls lead to waste of money and manpower in the effort to reach the spot,” said Sawant. DFES director Ashok Menon said the three-decades-old Daman and Diu Fire Forces Act 1986 and the Goa State Fire Forces Rules 1997 have been proposed for replacement with new legislation to streamline the functioning of the department. He said that there are also many gaps to be filled in terms of manpower, fire stations’ coverage and equipment in the DFES. “The government has been supportive to the department’s need for replacement of unserviceable fire fighting vehicles and equipment, and meeting additional needs to bridge the gap. From April 2020 to March 2021, these investments have helped the department save 104 human lives, 597 animal lives and citizens’ property worth Rs 27 crore,” Menon said. With rapid urbanisation in the state and vertical growth in infrastructure, aerial ladders and turntable platforms of greater height are required to attend to emergencies in super highrise buildings of 50m height, he said. Menon also said work of reconstruction of fire station at Bicholim and Valpoi and the fire services headquarters building are being executed by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (GSIDC), while the work on the dilapidated fire station building at Vasco is being undertaken by the public works department (PWD). “The department has revamped its website, which is more responsive and dynamic. The response to fire fighting incidents can now be monitored online by citizens through the website. Fire safety and disaster management apps have also been developed,” the DFES chief said. So far, the DFES has helped train in fire safety and disaster management over 5,000 primary and secondary school teachers, 33,027 students and 17,600 citizens. “Under Swayampurna Goa, the government has approved the department’s proposal to draw up the village level disaster management plan,” said Menon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-upgradation-of-emergency-services-infrastructure-within-one-yr/articleshow/82073530.cms||---

Godinho also hinted that the government may partially give in to the demands of the taxi unions and remove the GoaMiles counter at Goa International Airport. At the same time, Godinho said that the taxi operators cannot dictate terms to the government. The taxi operators have been on strike for six days at Azad Maidan, with their family members joining them on Wednesday. “The agitating taxi operators, I appeal to them to meet the government on Wednesday at 4.30pm and let us try to find a solution together,” Godinho said. “But you cannot put any conditions on the government. It has to be unconditional. They cannot say scrap the GoaMiles first and then they will come for talks.” Godinho blamed his cabinet colleagues for creating a situation where the taxi operators are upset with the app-based taxi aggregator GoaMiles. He said that inter-departmental conflicts were the reason why the government has found it difficult to resolve the issue. “Transportation is the transport department’s business. A few years earlier, a corporation run by another department started GoaMiles. It was my view at that time too, that the transport department should run the service. This has created confusion,” he said. Goa Tourism Development Corporation helped set up GoaMiles. The app-based taxi aggregator also operates a counter at the Goa International Airport, which was allotted by the Airports Authority of India to GTDC. Goa Airport director Gagan Malik has informed the government that it is not possible to transfer the counter being used by GoaMiles to the transport department. GTDC will have to surrender the counters after which AAI will begin the allotment process for the counter and hand it over to the transport department. The transport minister said that being an app-based taxi aggregator, GoaMiles should not be permitted to have a physical presence at the airport. “They cannot get a counter at the airport to solicit customers. This means that GoaMiles has totally flouted the rules and regulations under which they were granted permission to operate. Because they flouted the rules, they will not remain at Goa airport, I am specifically saying this.” Godinho said that scrapping GoaMiles would be detrimental and would be counter productive if GoaMiles approached the courts. “If tomorrow we issue an administrative order to scrap GoaMiles, they will go to court and get a stay and it will be much worse for taxi operators,” he said. He also said that the transport department is ready to provide financial assistance to taxi operators if they plan to start their own app-based taxi service. He subtly blamed former tourism minister Nilesh Cabral for allowing GoaMiles to operate. He took potshots at Calangute MLA Michael Lobo for making statements on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/godinho-calls-protesting-taxi-operators-for-talks-next-week/articleshow/82073605.cms||---

Responding to the submissions of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), Goa Foundation stated that the right of way (RoW) submitted is not signed by the assistant director of land records, South Goa and added that RoW does not convert into ownership of land. “In the peculiar economic and political circumstances in which the Railways was established in 1888, people on both sides of the traditional path permitted the then railway developer to lay the track without conveying the land to it,” Goa Foundation stated. “In exchange, they were provided a RoW of 10m between their residences and the actual railway track, which is still in use by adjoining landowners today all along the existing single track. This is RoW of landowners alongside the track guaranteed in exchange for permitting installation of the track. It cannot be claimed by the railways.” Goa Foundation also stated that it is absurd for the inclusion of eight wildlife crossings to be a reason for doubling of the tracks where the existing railway line doesn’t have any wildlife crossing. It also stated that there is no response to removal of 22,488 trees and objected to RVNL’s “safeguards of two mobile stone crushers within the wildlife sanctuary. “We fail to understand how stone crushers can be permitted to operate within a national park and wildlife sanctuary,” Goa Foundation stated adding that the area is within the core zone of the proposed Tiger Reserve,"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/right-of-way-doesnt-mean-land-ownership/articleshow/82074523.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A naval Dornier maritime surveillance aircraft and two advanced light helicopters from the naval airbase are assisting naval and Indian Coast Guard vessels in the search and rescue mission. The fishing boat, IFB Rabah, with 14 fishermen was struck by Singapore cargo vessel MV APL Le Havre early on April 13. Immediately after the collision, two fishermen were rescued and shifted to safety ashore. The authorities have also recovered three bodies, leaving nine fishermen missing. “Naval warships INS Tillanchang and INS Kalpeni along with naval aircraft from Goa were deployed in the area to augment SAR efforts of coast guard vessels,” said a source. The Navy also deployed INS Subhadra, a patrol vessel from Karwar, to assist in the rescue efforts. INS Subhadra has a diving team onboard. The ship arrived at the site of the incident on Wednesday morning. Two specialist diving teams are undertaking a snag line search in the area in an effort to locate the sunken fishing craft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navy-joins-search-for-fishermen-deploys-aircraft-from-ins-hansa/articleshow/82073689.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: All-Out Mission For More Oxygen||BHOPAL: A sub divisional magistrate (SDM) of Wara Seoni in Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh had a novel idea to resolve the oxygen crisis being faced by the district Covid care centre. On Tuesday, SDM Sandeep Singh went around the city of Wara Seoni and took away 30 oxygen cylinders from welding shops and supplied them to the district Covid centre. Like many other places, coronavirus-infected patients have been increasing in Balaghat too and seven patients have allegedly died because of oxygen shortage. “Though the SDM’s out-of-the-box idea has been praised in the district, it underlines the acute shortage of oxygen supply in Madhya Pradesh,” said a senior IAS officer. Despite frantic efforts by the government, Madhya Pradesh is facing more than 50% oxygen shortage for Covid-19 patients. This shortage is likely to deepen in the coming days as the number of active Coronavirus patients is increasing far too rapidly. On April 13, the number of active patients was 43,539 which is expected to be around 1 lakh by month end, health department sources point out. The state government has sought the help of the Centre for oxygen supply. “The number of those who would require oxygen after severe lung infection would go up in future if the conditions prevail,” they said. Against the demand of over 400 metric tonnes of oxygen, Madhya Pradesh had availability of only 280 MT supply, up by about 8 MT from Monday which was 272 metric tonnes. The government focus for the oxygen supply was on the medical college hospitals of the state and the government-run Covid care centres in various districts. But, large number of patients admitted to the private hospitals continue to face unprecedented oxygen crisis. Many hospitals were forced to make the family persons of infected patients sign a form explaining the risk of oxygen and Remdesivir injection shortage. Health experts in Madhya Pradesh wonder what the government was doing between the first corona break last year and the second deadly wave being faced by the people, now. “What did the government do to improve its health infrastructure,” they ask. “Even Bhopal’s Hamidia hospital, where the building construction is complete, is not fully equipped,” they claimed. This shows the government priorities and lack of vision, a senior doctor of Jabalpur said. “In a city like Jabalpur,” he said, “we have only one oxygen storage facility only in the medical college.” Madhya Pradesh is getting oxygen from Bhilai in Chattisgarh and a private player. Plus, there is supply from Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-all-out-mission-for-more-oxygen/articleshow/82075979.cms||---

The village is situated in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary “When I was collecting cashew apples I saw a tiger walking at a distance of about 200m. It was a sub adult tiger. Our village is forested and we often see wild animals,” a villager told TOI. Deputy conservator of forests of wildlife division Jabestin Arulraj told TOI that he will “inform the officials to patrol the area and monitor for tiger movement”. A Sattari-based wildlife expert, Gajanan Shetye, said, “Caranzol falls in the Mhadei sanctuary area, which is a known natural habitat of the tigers.” Caranzol is also contiguous with Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary of Karnataka. The wildlife division has also been monitoring Chorla and Ponsuli villages in Sattari for tiger movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tiger-spotted-at-caranzol-plantation/articleshow/82073714.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Parab was forced off the stage by some of the taxi union leaders after he criticised all the political parties and also accused some of the leaders of the taxi operators of compromising with the government. With physical clashes and verbal duels erupting, police were forced to intervene. Parab blamed the taxi owners for creating a crisis by pandering to BJP, Congress, GFP and AAP. He also blamed the taxi operators for bringing a bad name to their business. “There needs to be reform. The name of taxi operators needs to be cleaned and it must draw respect,” said Parab as he criticised a section of the taxi operators for beating up drivers of GoaMiles. “We have to clean up our image because today people say you are mafia. Stop thrashing others, breaking vehicles and circulating videos. Whoever sends videos and audio asking you to bash up others, remove them from the group,” said Parab. Parab was forced off the stage twice, once by tourist taxi union leader Bappa Korgaonkar and later by Goa police personnel. Parab also told the taxi owners to publicise their rates, create a website and explore the possibility of launching an app-based service in Goa to compete with GoaMiles. After Parab left, some of the taxi union leaders lashed out at him and said that politicians were trying to gain political mileage from the ongoing agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/taxi-protest-erupts-in-clash-in-panaji/articleshow/82073733.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Manhar Katariya, a farmer’s son, is the only one from Gujarat to have cleared IES in mechanical engineering stream apart for emerging amongst top 20. The exam for gazette class 1 post is conducted by UPSC in three phases – prelims, mains and interview round. “I feel fortunate that I have been selected in the very first attempt. Also, I feel lucky that I am the only candidate from Gujarat and amongst 41 students from across the country to be selected in my stream,” said Manhar, whose father Chhagan Katariya, is a farmer in Vaghnagar near Mahuva taluka in Bhavnagar district. “Initially, my focus was on Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) but after I did not achieve remarkable rank in it, I started putting all my efforts for IES,” said Manhar, who passed-out from MSU in 2019. Manhar, who did his schooling from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Bhavnagar says he could finish his graduation thanks to the scholarship that he received through foundation for excellence scheme. “If not for the scholarship and schooling at Navodaya, there would have been lot of financial struggle that we would have to undergo,” he said. Earlier, Manhar was amongst 48 mechanical engineers from across the country to be selected by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre under the orientation course for engineering graduates and science post-graduates scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/farmers-son-bags-air-18-in-ies/articleshow/82071245.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Goa||With no pending probes, HC allows accused to go abroad||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has deleted a condition imposed by a local court against Samir Sardana to travel abroad after it found that none of the authorities have any inquiries or investigations pending against him. Sardana had approached the HC challenging the condition imposed by a Vasco court, and stated that his fundamental right to travel abroad cannot be restricted on the vague assertion of pending inquiries by the authorities. Sardana, son of a decorated retired major general of the Indian army, was arrested by the Goa anti-terrorist squad from Vasco railway station in February 2016 and granted bail later that month. In the bail order of 2016, the court directed that he should not leave the country without the court’s permission. In August 2018, the petitioner had applied for leave to travel abroad before a Vasco court, which was granted to him. However, it imposed a condition to submit his address outside India to the court. During the hearing of the petition, the court directed the authorities to file affidavits to indicate whether any inquiry, prosecution or investigation is pending against the petitioner. The state authorities never stated that any such proceedings were pending against the petitioner. Referring to the affidavits, the high court said it appears that none of the aforesaid authorities have any inquiries or investigations pending against the petitioner “If this is a position, we see no ground to impose any restraint upon the petitioner’s travel abroad on the ground of pendency of such inquiries, investigations, or cases,” the court stated. The court has dropped the condition - of seeking court’s permission to travel abroad - from his bail order dated February 11, 2016. “Ultimately, the right to travel abroad is a fundamental right, and if any restrictions have to be imposed on his right, then, such restrictions should be backed by law,” the court held. The joint secretary, internal security-II division, ministry of home affairs (MHA) submitted to the court in July last year that MHA received a secret letter dated February 19, 2016, from the inspector general of police informing him about the arrest of a suspect Samir Sardana from Goa on February 1, 2016. Goa police requested MHA to seek assistance of the ministry of external affairs to inquire about his activities when he was abroad. MHA forwarded the IGP’s letter to the central agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-no-pending-probes-hc-allows-accused-to-go-abroad/articleshow/82073768.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||GFP dropped long ago, why did they stay till now: CM||Panaji: Reacting to GFP’s Tuesday decision of quitting BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday ridiculed the regional party for staying back long after their ministers were dropped from his cabinet. “When they were anyway not there what is the point of their withdrawal. We had already removed them. I do not know why they were staying back until now in the first place,” Sawant said when asked for his comment on GFP’s decision to breakaway from NDA. On Tuesday GFP quit NDA blaming BJP for introducing anti-Goan policies that led to “divisiveness and despair” in Goa. Citing several reasons for the party’s decision, GFP president and former deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai in a letter to NDA national chairperson and Union home minister Amit Shah, said BJP had overseen the destruction of Goa’s natural forest cover and had been negligent in the protection of Goa’s interests in the Mhadei water dispute with Karnataka. GFP, with its three MLAs, had extended support to the NDA in 2017 to facilitate the formation of the then BJP-led state government under Manohar Parrikar and all three were in the BJP-led cabinet. Ministers from GFP and MGP were dropped by Sawant from his cabinet after ten MLAs from the Congress had switched over to BJP in early July 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-dropped-long-ago-why-did-they-stay-till-now-cm/articleshow/82073798.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Power minister Nilesh Cabral said the move aims at averting last year’s Borim-type accident in which three workers had lost their lives. Three workers standing in the carriage were crushed to death after the pole-laden truck turned turtle at Borim.  The modification in the 11-metre long trucks with a larger cabin will help avert such casualties, Cabral said. The power minister was in Ponda on Tuesday for inaugurating the two section-offices of Ponda electricity department and also electrifying a 10MVA transformer at the Ponda power substation within the office precincts.  Executive engineer Vallabh Samant said the new offices will ease the space crunch and benefit around 20,000 consumers. Samant said the newly electrified transformer would help them provide uninterrupted supply to the Ponda taluka and no-load shedding. Cabral also sought people’s support for promotion of electric vehicles in the state. In a bid to promote pollution-free transport, the state electricity department is working on a policy that would enable people to procure e-bikes and e-cars with around 55% subsidy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/redesign-cabins-of-power-depts-trucks-to-fit-5-workers/articleshow/82073875.cms||---

Speaking a day after Ugadi, when he held a meeting with officials on Covid preparedness, the CM reiterated that lockdown would not be imposed anywhere in the state. The state’s daily tally crossed the 11,000-mark for the first time as it saw 11,265 fresh infections on Wednesday, of which 8,155 were from Bengaluru. The sudden rise, attributed by officials to clearing of backlog after the holiday, took the daily Covid positivity rate to 9.9%.  Thirty-eight Covid-related deaths were also reported, of which Bengaluru accounted for 23. With this, Karnataka breached the 13,000 mark in deaths since March 2020. The active caseload in Bengaluru alone stands at 63,167 (85,480 in the state); of these patients, 184 are in ICUs (506 in state). “We will take into consideration all possible steps to curb the spread of the virus. While I reiterate that there will be no lockdown, we will consider further strict curbs after the byelections. If required, we will consider extending the night curfew by two more days,” said Yediyurappa.  “A final decision on extending the night curfew will be taken by the technical advisory committee.” The CM has called an all-party meeting on April 18 to discuss steps to tackle the Covid-19 resurgence. Bypolls to the Belagavi Lok Sabha seat and Maski and Basavakalayan assembly segments will be held on Saturday. The CM, who was in Belagavi for campaigning on Wednesday, put off his return to Bengaluru after reporting fever and uneasiness. Govt may look at stepping up curbs over weekends: BommaiCurrently, the night curfew is in force in eight cities till April 20: Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mangaluru, Udupi, Manipal, Tumakuru, Kalaburagi and Bidar. Restrictions have also been announced on gatherings and on occupancy in gyms, cinema halls and restaurants. Home minister Basavaraj Bommai echoed the CM’s views against a lockdown and urged people to strictly adhere to Covid-19 safety norms, including wearing masks, practising hygiene and maintaining social distancing. “There is no lockdown proposal in front of the government and we are giving more attention to prevent Covid-19 without such measures. But for that, people need to co-operate,” said Bommai. The government may look at stepping up some curbs over weekends, he added. On Tuesday, the CM directed senior government officials to ensure there is no shortfall of beds for patients and to collect real-time availability data in private hospitals as well. He asked officials to take stringent action against those who violate Covid-19 norms and do not wear masks. While he said the opposition would be consulted on measures to be implemented in the days to come, state Congress chief DK Shivakumar called it a desperate move. “The government so far has not taken suggestions and it ignored our cries about corruption in Covid management. Now, the CM has decided to call the all-party meeting since the situation is going out of control. They have not even formally invited us to the meeting. We will decide on whether to take part in it or not after taking inputs of our leaders,” said Shivakumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bs-yediyurappa-signals-more-covid-19-curbs-after-april-17-bypolls/articleshow/82076021.cms||---

Tetrapods are concrete structures intended to prevent coastal erosion on a long-term basis. Work on the installation of tetrapods to create a protection wall was initiated in 2012 and completed just about four years ago. However, it has already started coming apart, posing a further threat to the shoreline and to beachgoers. The base of the wall is also sinking at many areas, destabilising the tetrapods. Work on the tetrapod wall was executed under Goa’s Golden Jubilee package for which the central government had sanctioned Rs 85 crore for protection and restoration of beaches at Keri, Anjuna, Candolim, Utorda, Majorda, Betalbatim, Talpona and Polem. At Keri, many portions of the 650m-stretch, some of the 1,200 tetrapods and 2,000 blocks of one tonne each are collapsing. The affected part of the beach lies on the river-sea confluence and is also dominated by strong monsoon currents. The shoreline had an abundance of casuarina trees, but they have been uprooted over the years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/keri-tetrapod-wall-falling-apart-increases-erosion-risk/articleshow/82073917.cms||---

On April 2 the bundh broke in Chorao, leading to saline water entering fields, resulting in damage to chilli and vegetable crops, affecting over 400 farmers. The road leading to the Pomburpa ferry point in this area was also left inundated, causing hardships to commuters. Farmers had demanded that the state administration immediately take up the repairs of the bundh.  Local MLA Pravin Zantye, along with Mayem ZP Shankar Chodankar and WRD engineers, took stock of the situation and had assured villagers that a new bundh would be constructed that would solve the problems of farmers . The farmers, however, asked the MLA to first show them the work order, rather than just giving verbal assurances. Talking to TOI, Vadyenkar and Kava khazan bund farmers’ association chairman Shrikant Priyolkar said that Zantye has asked the contractor to urgently carry out the construction work till April 9. However, till April 14, nothing had been done as the farmers and committee members wanted to see the work order first. President of Kava khazan bund farmers’ association Shrikant Priolkar said that around Rs 5 crores have been sanctioned for the construction of the bund. Stating that farmers and locals are facing hardships due to stagnation of water , former sarpanch Srikrishna Haldankar, along with other members have demanded that the state administration resolve this problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chorao-sarpanch-says-tender-for-rs-5cr-worth-bundh-repairs-floated-locals-demand-proof/articleshow/82073966.cms||---
---||World||Joe Biden to pull US troops from Afghanistan, end 'forever war'||WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he will withdraw remaining US troops from the "forever war" in Afghanistan, declaring that the September 11 terror attacks of 20 years ago cannot justify American forces still dying in the nation's longest war. His plan is to pull out all American forces - numbering 2,500 now - by this September 11, the anniversary of the attacks, which were coordinated from Afghanistan. Soon after Biden made his announcement, Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels said the alliance had agreed to withdraw its roughly 7,000 forces from Afghanistan, matching Biden's decision to begin a final pullout by May 1. The US cannot continue to pour resources into an intractable war and expect different results, Biden said. The drawdown would begin rather than conclude by May 1, which has been the deadline for full withdrawal under a peace agreement the Trump administration reached with the Taliban last year. "It is time to end America's longest war", Biden said, but he added that the US will "not conduct a hasty rush to the exit." "We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create the ideal conditions for our withdrawal, expecting a different result," said Biden, who delivered his address from the White House Treaty Room, the same location where President George W Bush announced the start of the war. "I am now the fourth United States President to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan. Two Republicans. Two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility to a fifth." Biden's announcement, which he followed with a visit to Arlington National Cemetery, marks perhaps the most significant foreign policy decision in the early going of his presidency. He's long been skeptical about the US presence in Afghanistan. As Barack Obama's Vice President, Biden was a lonely voice in the administration who advised the 44th President to tilt towards a smaller counterterrorism role in the country while military advisers were urging a troop buildup to counter Taliban gains. Biden has also made clear he wants to recalibrate US foreign policy to face bigger challenges posed by China and Russia. Withdrawing all US troops comes with clear risks. It could boost the Taliban's effort to claw back power and undo gains toward democracy and women's rights made over the past two decades. It also opens Biden to criticism, from mostly Republicans and some Democrats, even though former President Donald Trump had also wanted a full withdrawal. "This administration has decided to abandon US efforts in Afghanistan which have helped keep radical Islamic terrorism in check," said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. "And bizarrely, they have decided to do so by September 11th." While Biden's decision keeps US forces in Afghanistan four months longer than initially planned, it sets a firm end to two decades of war that killed more than 2,200 US troops, wounded 20,000, and cost as much as $1 trillion. Biden spoke with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Wednesday ahead of his speech. The White House said in a statement that Biden told Ghani the United States would continue to support the Afghan people through development, humanitarian and security assistance. "The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan respects the US decision, and we will work with our US partners to ensure a smooth transition," Ghani said in a Twitter posting. Biden spoke, too, with former President Bush ahead of announcing his decision. He also spoke with allies, military leaders, lawmakers and Vice President Kamala Harris to help make his decision, according to the White House. Bush, through his spokesman, declined to comment about his conversation with Biden. Biden emphasized that his administration will continue to support peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban and assist international efforts to train the Afghan military. He noted that the "forever war" has led to service members who weren't even alive at the time of the September 11 attacks serving, as well as young troops following in the steps of their mothers and fathers in deploying to Afghanistan. "The war in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multigenerational undertaking," Biden said. Obama, who had hoped but ultimately failed to end the war during his time in office, said in a statement that he supported Biden's decision, that "it is time to recognize that we have accomplished all that we can militarily, and that it's time to bring our remaining troops home." Following his speech, Biden visited Arlington National Cemetery to honor those who died in recent American conflicts. After paying his respects, Biden told reporters it was "absolutely clear" to him that ending the war was the right decision. Biden, in his speech and during his visit to the hallowed cemetery, reflected on his own late son Beau Biden's service. The President's son, who died of cancer in 2015, had deployed to Iraq with the Delaware Army National Guard. "I'm always amazed that generation after generation, women and men give their lives to this country," Biden said. "It means I have trouble these days showing up to this cemetery and not thinking about my son." CIA director William Burns acknowledged at a hearing Wednesday that America's ability to contain the terrorist threat from Afghanistan has benefited from the military presence there, and that when that presence is withdrawn, "the US government's ability to collect and act on threats will diminish." "That's simply a fact," Burns said. "It is also a fact, however, that after withdrawal, whenever that time comes, the CIA and all of our partners in the US government will retain a suite of capabilities, some of it remaining in place, some of them that we will generate, that can help us to anticipate and contest any rebuilding effort." A senior administration official said the September withdrawal date was an absolute deadline that won't be affected by security conditions in Afghanistan. The long conflict has largely crippled al-Qaida and led to the death of Osama bin Laden, the architect of the September 11 attacks. But an American withdrawal also risks many of the gains made in democracy, women's rights and governance, while ensuring that the Taliban, who provided al-Qaida's haven, remain strong and in control of large swaths of the country. As Biden announced his decision, his top national security aides - secretary of state Antony Blinken and defence secretary Lloyd Austin - were consulting in Brussels to coordinate Nato's withdrawal from Afghanistan with the planned pullout of American troops. Stoltenberg, the Nato chief, said the alliance's full withdrawal would be completed "in months" but did not mention the 20th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. "We went into Afghanistan together, we have adjusted our posture together and we are united in leaving together," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-to-pull-us-troops-from-afghanistan-end-forever-war/articleshow/82076040.cms||---

When asked whether there is crisis of Oxygen in the state, he said, “Since the patients have increased manifold and the Coronavirus strain in the second wave is affecting the lungs faster, there is obviously a sharp increase in the demand for Oxygen supply in Covid- 19 hospital but we have been able to fulfil the demand so far. It’s wrong to say that people are dying in hospitals gasping for breath as there is no Oxygen in hospitals.” When asked about the volume of supply of Oxygen to hospitals in Bhopal and the entire state, he said, “Earlier, we used to supply 30 metric tonne of Oxygen in Bhopal, which has now gone up to 70 to 80 metric tonne.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/o2-crisis-all-is-well-says-administration/articleshow/82076058.cms||---

Each of the four Covid-19 dedicated crematoria has seen a sharp spike in bodies every day.  According to crematoria workers, it takes about 45-60 minutes to cremate a body. Ravi, a worker at Sumanahalli crematorium, said, “We usually get 5-6 bodies a day but now, we’ve been getting about 22-25 dead bodies every day, including 15 Covid bodies. I have worked till 11.30pm for the last two days and come back by 6am the next day. This crematorium can cremate only 16 bodies a day.” There are about 12 electric crematoria in the city but two are not operational. A furnace each in Sumanahalli, Panathur, Bommanahalli, Medi Agrahara and Kengeri crematoria has been reserved for Covid-19 victims, but the Kengeri facility is defunct. The second furnace is used for non-Covid bodies. Ravi said, “We don’t have enough staff. At 8pm Wednesday in Medi Agrahara, they have 14 bodies to cremate and they’re seeking our help.” The situation in graveyards too is grim. Raju, who works at Kalpalli graveyard, said at least 15 bodies were brought there on Wednesday. Mohammed Ismail of Mercy Mission, an NGO ferrying the dead on their last journey, said the civic agency talked about installing freezers but the idea has remained only on paper. “They have neither learnt nor updated themselves after the previous spike,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/body-count-puts-strain-on-crematoria/articleshow/82076056.cms||Kiran Parashar

Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, he said the path of the future world order in many ways would be set in the Indo-Pacific region. “This region has become a global economic and political centre of gravity, and the EU is linked to it, through trade, investment and mobility,” Michel said. Michel said the most pressing challenge currently was Covid-19 and the production of vaccines and their delivery. “India and Europe are major vaccine producers. Together, through Covax, we also support low and middle income countries. Thanks to our joint efforts, Covax has delivered over 38 million doses to 100 countries,” he said. “Ramping up vaccine production is an enormous challenge. We must make sure our supply chains remain open and resilient. This includes expanding global manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector and in developing countries,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/path-of-world-order-to-be-set-in-indo-pacific-eu/articleshow/82076076.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Most coal power plants coming up are govt owned: Report||Nagpur: Government support and public money investment into coal is the only factor keeping India away from shrinking its coal capacity. The latest data shows that private sector has taken a step back and almost all coal-fired power plants which are under construction belong to the public sector. According to the latest ‘Boom and Bust’ report released by various organizations across the globe including Global Energy Monitor, Sierra Club, Centre For Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), Climate Risk Horizons, GreenID and Ekosfer, the report highlights that in 2020, India was second to China in commission and development of coal power. “However, the difference between the two countries is large and growing: while China continues to grow its coal power capacity and proposals, India may well be on the verge of shrinking its coal fleet,” the report states. A steep increase in coal plant development in China offset a retreat from coal in the rest of the world in 2020, resulting in the first increase in global coal capacity development since 2015. The country commissioned 38.4 gigawatt (GW) of new coal plants in 2020, comprising 76% of the global total. Outside China, several Asian countries announced that they are cancelling or reconsidering new coal power projects, while Japan and South Korea pledged to reach net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050. India has both good and bad news. While it commissioned 2GW of coal power in 2020, its retirements were 1.3GW. Considering this, the country’s coal fleet grew by 0.7 GW in 2020 which is the lowest since 2004. Further analysis shows that from 2015 to 2020, coal power capacity proposed for construction decreased nearly 90% — from 238.2GW to 29.3GW. “Coal power under construction has been halved, from 71.4 GW in 2015 to 36.6 GW in 2020,” the report states. More on the brighter side, 2020 saw new records for the country when winning tariff bids for new solar PV plants went down to Rs 1.99/kilowatt hour (kWh) and renewables with storage at Rs.3.6/kWh. “The declining cost of clean energy alternatives in India has helped drive down the amount of coal power under development,” analysts state. There’s a gloomy picture too. While low coal power capacity and competition from alternatives have driven the private sector to withdraw almost completely from constructing new plants, unfortunately same is not the case with public sector. According to the report, almost all the coal plants under active construction are owned by state or federal government entities. This, despite the fact that India’s coal plants are not just deadly but also debt-laden. Thermal sector, one of the country’s biggest stranded assets, is struggling financially due to surplus thermal power capacities, which are far in excess of the actual demand. According to researchers, the average plant load factors (PLFs) have been 60% or below (even lower in the private sector) for years now, against the ideal value of 85%. PLF is the actual power generation out of the total installed capacity and indicates a plant’s performance. “Many projects have no power purchase agreements (PPAs), leading to stressed and stranded assets littering the coal power landscape. The private sector has seen the writing on the wall and not interested in risking more money. It is a different story with state-owned promoters which still find it easy to access finance from public sector banks and non-banking financial companies,” says Ashish Fernandes, lead analyst at Climate Risk Horizons. Stressing that the government needs to move away from the dirty fuel, Sunil Dahiya, analyst at CREA, says, “Drying up of coal pipeline in India over last five years is a sign that everyone apart from government has understood that coal is not the future and not even the present. It is detrimental not just to environment, human health and climate but also to economic benefits of the electricity sector.” Latest data shows that out of the 36.6 GW under construction in 2020, at least 14.1 GW are in relatively early stage and completing them will risk an estimated 92,000 crore (US$12.6 billion) of public money. “Almost all of these plants are public sector units — being built either by NTPC or state generators such as Mahagenco or TANGEDCO and financed by the taxpayers’ money. These plants are not going to be required from an energy point of view, and by the time they are built, they will not be competitive with renewable energy. The danger is that state distribution companies will be locked into more expensive PPAs instead of availing of cheaper options,” says Fernandes. In 2020 electricity generation in India from coal power dropped for the second consecutive year, states the report which also highlights how the country’s National Electricity Plan identifies 48 GW of coal for retirement by 2027. “Looking at drying pipeline of coal-based capacity, utilization of already existing capacity at such lower levels, second year consecutive drop in coal based generation, Covid- led economic slowdown and blooming renewable energy capacity, we are looking at peaking coal capacity within next 3-4 years, which can be further ascertained if government withdraws its support from polluting coal,” says Dahiya. The report presents a case study of the United States to highlight government action. As per it, coal’s long-term decline in the US accelerated during the Trump Administration, with retirements rising to 52.4 GW during Trump’s four years compared to 48.9 GW during Obama’s second term. While the Biden administration has called for the power sector to be decarbonized by 2035, only a third of currently operating coal power is currently scheduled for retirement by 2035. “President Biden’s pledge to decarbonize the U.S. power sector by 2035 will depend on retiring existing plants even faster,” the report concludes. The Dirty Picture of Coal * In 2020, India second to China in commission and development of coal power * Private sector takes a step back, almost all under construction plants belong to public sector * Of the 36.6 GW under construction in 2020, at least 14.1 GW are in relatively early stage * Completing them to risk an estimated 92,000 crores public money * India’s coal fleet grew by 0.7 GW in 2020 – the lowest since 2004 * 2020 saw new records with winning tariff bids for new solar PV plants down to Rs 1.99/kWh and renewables with storage at Rs.3.6/kWh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/most-coal-power-plants-coming-up-are-govt-owned-report/articleshow/82107017.cms||Manka Behl

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in its Annual Threat Assessment report to the US Congress, said although a general war between India and Pakistan is unlikely, crises between the two are likely to become more intense, risking an escalatory cycle. “...Heightened tensions raise the risk of conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, with violent unrest in Kashmir or a militant attack in India being potential flashpoints,” the report said. India and Pakistan are without high commissioners in each other’s capital since the relations between the two countries nosedived after India withdrew the special status of J&K in 2019. India has said it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror and violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/modis-india-may-counter-pakistan-dare-with-force-us-report/articleshow/82076112.cms||---

It has also been decided that all residents in a containment zone will have to undergo a Covid test. Additional chief medical officer Dr Sahir Pal said that testing camps would be set up in the containment zones to ensure that every single person was screened for the deadly virus. He said the health department was keeping a close vigil on Mango, Kadma, Telco and Sonari areas in the city. Sources said that Covid screening took a hit after cases started dipping from November last year. Even random testing of people in public areas was virtually discontinued. But now with the second wave of Covid-19 gaining strength, the administration has again felt the need to test more people. At sadar hospital here, patients and relatives are being allowed entry only after a mandatory Covid test. The second wave has badly hit health workers, too. Sources said that as many as 13 doctors and 20 medical staff of the Tata Main Hospital (TMH) here have been detected positive, thereby affecting health services. The TMH has the highest number of beds in the Kolhan region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/covid-screening-for-all-in-containment-zones/articleshow/82072627.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Thirsty jumbo raids buckets in Jhargram||Midnapore: A residential neighbourhood in Jhargram had a jumbo surprise on Wednesday afternoon when an elephant ambled down the street to a public tap and emptied three water buckets. Thirst quenched, the animal — presumed to be an adult male separated from its herd — quietly made its way back to a forest off NH-6. Video clips of the elephant, recorded on mobile cameras, quickly went viral on social media. According to residents, the first sighting in Beltala was around 1pm when the elephant had just strayed into the village. Some people tried to chase him away, fearing crop damage, while others informed the forest department. Unperturbed by all the commotion around him, the elephant drank from the buckets and went back to Balibhasa forest from where it had probably come. “The temperature was around 41°C. The animal was very thirsty. First, it tried to drink directly from the tap. When that didn’t work, it dunked its trunk into the buckets. It later left without causing any trouble,” said a villager. Forest officials said the elephant seemed to be an adult male separated from its herd. It has been roaming the forest patch near Beltala for the past few days and is being closely watched, they said. Excessive heat and absence of rain have taken a toll on watering holes, which is why the elephant came to the village to quench its thirst, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/thirsty-jumbo-raids-buckets-in-jhargram/articleshow/82073750.cms||Sujay Khanra
---||Kolkata||BJP bringing outsiders for campaign, leading to Covid surge: Mamata Banerjee||SILIGURI/JALPAIGURI: Blaming BJP and the Centre for the surge in Covid cases in Bengal, chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said instead of providing the state adequate vaccines, BJP was bringing in “outsiders” for its poll campaigns that were responsible for the spread of the disease. “We had brought it under control; all they had to do was to vaccinate enough people,” Banerjee said. Accusing the BJP leadership of “not coming for a single day” while the pandemic was raging last year, she said: “Now due to elections, they are coming with outsiders for campaigning and leaving.” Speaking at several rallies in north Bengal on Wednesday, the CM said: “I have been telling them for long to provide us with Covid injections (vaccine). We will pay for it. You please help us provide the vaccines. We do not have it in adequate numbers. It is you, the Central government, who have mandated that you will provide vaccines (to the state). We will comply.” “We have kept the funds ready (to even buy vaccines). So please provide us. But they are not giving us. The little we could arrange is being provided,” she added. Banerjee was referring to her letters to the Centre, urging it to allow Bengal to buy adequate vaccines from suppliers identified by the Centre to roll out a mass vaccination programme on its own for its 10 crore population. Attacking the Centre for lax handling of Covid situation, Banerjee said: “Covid has killed so many people in the last one year. Across the country, there has been almost a dance of death. You got an entire year (to work). (PM) Narendra Modi did nothing. (Union home minister) Amit Shah did nothing.” “None of these leaders came to Bengal once during Covid,” she continued. “Now they are bringing in outsiders and increasing Covid (in Bengal) and leaving. They will flee and we will be left to face troubles.” Cautioning people against Covid, the CM said: “We (Bengal government) are doing whatever we can. But I will urge you to remain safe. Covid cases are increasing across the country... All we must do is exercise caution. We must keep washing our hands and always wear a mask. You may ask why I have pulled down my mask. I always wear one, and will continue wearing one. But speaking for hours at a stretch with a mask on is difficult. I will immediately wear it.” Attacking Shah’s speech at Lebong ground in Darjeeling on Tuesday, Banerjee said: “Shah in Darjeeling said he will not implement NRC. Don’t trust him. Assam went to polls three days ago and since yesterday, the notice has started for detention camps. I will never allow NPR, NRC to be implemented in Bengal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-bjp-bringing-outsiders-for-campaign-leading-to-covid-surge/articleshow/82073781.cms||Roshan Gupta

Currently, 300 beds are operational and 200 will be added soon,” said Gyan Vatsal Swami of Shri Swaminarayan Temple. He added that the temple management has also arranged for pharmacy store, restrooms and separate rooms for the medical staff.  One of the biggest mosques in the city too has got permission to start a 142-bed facility. “The situation was grim and hospitals were running out of beds. We saw people running from pillar to post to get treatment. So, I had a word with the Darul Uluum Tandalja Mosque management that decided to start a Covid facility,” said Sagir Ahmed Ansari, a social activist.  “We plan to expand the beds to 300 if the government gives us permission,” Ansari added. Another mosque in Mogulwada area of the old city too will start a 50-bed facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/religious-bodies-join-war-on-pandemic/articleshow/82071159.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Kolkata||Centre cancels CBSE Class X, defers Class XII board exams||Kolkata/New Delhi: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Wednesday postponed the Class XII board exams and cancelled the Class X boards, originally scheduled to start on May 4, in view of the rising Covid cases and apprehensions expressed by students and school administrators. A decision on fresh dates will be taken on June 1. The decision came after a review meeting with PM Narendra Modi. Initial discussions considered rescheduling both exams, but the PM is understood to have remarked that students should be spared further travails. It was decided that candidates of the cancelled Class X exams would be allowed to take the test later, when possible, if they were unhappy with their results on the basis of an “objective criterion” being developed by the board. The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) said it, too, would announce a decision soon. The Bengal boards for Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examination will take a call later as the scheduled exam dates are June 1 and June 15, respectively. “We shall communicate to the students about any development regarding ICSE (Class X) and ISC (Class XII) board exams at the earliest,” said CISCE chairman and chief secretary Gerry Arathoon. These exams were also scheduled to start on May 4. It was decided not to scrap the Class XII exam because it has a significant bearing on higher education choices. The CBSE, in a statement, said: “The situation will be reviewed on June 1 by the board and details shared subsequently. A notice of at least 15 days will be given before the start of examinations.” CBSE officials said this was the first instance of the board having to scrap the Class X exams altogether. Last year, because of the riots in North-East Delhi and coronavirus infections, the exams were partially cancelled. A formula based on marks scored in the exams a student took was used to calculate the final result. This year, 21,50,761 candidates were scheduled to appear in the Class X exams, nearly 2.5 lakh more than 2020. A total of 14,30,243 candidates registered for the Class XII exams, almost 2.2 lakh more than last year. The review meeting was also attended by education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal and top officials. While the decision has come as a relief for Class XII students and their parents who were on tenterhooks, it led to anxiety among Class X students, who now have to wait to learn about the “formulae” that will be used to determine their results. Some demanded that the criteria be decided in consultation with stakeholders. “Will we have to appear for an objective-type test, or will the results be prepared based on the performance of our pre-board examinations?” wondered Rishav Guha, a candidate. Science students are also preparing for medical entrance tests and the delay in announcing the dates will have an impact on their preparation for NEET. Some have registered for foreign universities and the uncertainty will only add to the stress, some students felt. However, with the fear of exams becoming superspreader events, there was little choice in the matter, said an official. Rupa S Bhattacharjee, the principal of South Point High School, welcomed the board’s decision. “Unnecessary exposure in these difficult times can now be avoided. Schools, including ours, have tried their best to deliver on the online mode. Detailed guidelines from CBSE are awaited since career choices or admission for higher studies are made after Class XII,” she said. The demand for cancellation of board exams had been growing louder since last week, in the wake of the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases. Following Wednesday’s decision, the education ministry said in an official statement: “Unlike state boards, CBSE has an all-India character, and therefore, it is essential to hold exams simultaneously throughout the country. Looking to the present situation of the pandemic and school closures, and also taking into account the safety and well-being of the students.” There are 11 states where Covid cases are spiralling and the numbers have seen a massive outburst. Worst affected state Maharashtra also has one of the highest number of CBSE- and CISCE-affiliated schools. “The students of Class XII had a stressful year,” said Sharmila Bose, director, Sushila Birla Girls’ School. “The Class X students, on the other hand, mostly continue in the same institution. Thus, the decision is not impactful for them. Their future does not hang on it. But, for Class XII candidates, the situation is difficult and they need to cope with it. The Class XII students will have to now simultaneously worry about the college admissions, as the results will be deferred; it is a domino effect. The uncertainty of the pandemic is also decreasing the number of students applying outside the country.” The principals of several schools insisted that students should be prepared for the board examinations. “For the time being, the decision will bring some relief to candidates. But the CBSE has not cancelled the Class XII exams. Those who would be taking their Class X exams have two more years to decide their future. CBSE is likely to frame a policy for them. It is unlikely that any further tests will be taken for Class X students,” said Meena Kak, director of the Lakshmipat Singhania Academy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/centre-cancels-cbse-class-x-defers-class-xii-board-exams/articleshow/82074505.cms||Somdatta Basu

---||Kolkata||TMC releases ‘video on Sitalkuchi’||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress on Wednesday released a viral video footage suggesting that when CISF personnel were firing in Sitalkuchi on April 10, only a few people were seen around them. The video grabs also suggested that the CISF firing preceded angry villagers, some armed with sticks and bamboo, attacking and kicking the polling booth. The unverified clips show police watching as CISF personnel are seen charging near the booth. Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien, who shared the video on his Twitter handle, alleged the video exposed “cold blooded massacre of innocent citizens. Shot. Killed”. The MP further alleged this had exposed the prime minister, home minister and the Election Commission “like never before”. Derek suggested in the Twitter post that more such videos — disputing official version — would be released. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had dubbed the incident a “genocide” and alleged that there “was a pre-planned conspiracy” behind the incident. No police officer was willing to speak on the video allegations. The video allegations, incidentally, surfaced alongside several private media channels airing an interview of the third polling officer, officiating in booth 126 that day, who reportedly injured his hand when attacked by villagers. The officer said there was a deliberate attempt by villagers to disrupt the polling process, forcing into the booth and injuring several polling officials, including him, a home guard and an ASHA worker. The poll officer, however, claimed he didn’t see what happened outside but reported hearing the firing outside first and then their booth was attacked. Claims and counter-claims have been doing the rounds on the April 10 incident, with several BJP leaders first trying to share a video – which was later taken out – showing an injured CISF personnel. The image, however, was of a different incident in another state. Another video did the rounds showing a mob attack on a polling booth. This too could not be corroborated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-releases-video-on-sitalkuchi/articleshow/82073763.cms||---

Monajjem of Chawkbazar masjid Md Sufiuddin was on his way to conduct the morning Ramzan prayers when the trio on a bike intercepted him and asked him to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’. When he refused, they allegedly slapped him and shoved him down the road before speeding away. A resident of Kathgola Lane, Sufiuddin later lodged a complaint with Chinsurah police. Chandernagore city police commissioner Gaurav Sharma said they were probing the incident. “The complainant says he was assaulted. We are looking for CCTV camera footage to zero in on the accused,” Sharma added. Even though polling in Hooghly ended on April 10, the political heat here is yet to cool off. The district BJP tried to distance itself from Wednesday’s incident. “The party does not believe in forcing someone to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’. Police must thoroughly investigate the matter. All I can say is that BJP is on the threshold of a landslide victory in Bengal and people will soon spontaneously chant the slogan,” said BJP’s Hooghly district (organization) president Gautam Chatterjee. Trinamool Congress district president Dilip Yadav said it was “BJP’s culture to destroy communal harmony” preserved for hundreds of years. “They are constantly trying to polarise people with divisive politics. I am sure the people of Bengal have voted against the divisive politics of BJP. I condemn the attack (on the cleric),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cleric-attacked-for-refusing-to-chant-jai-shri-ram-in-hooghly/articleshow/82073892.cms||Falguni Banerjee
