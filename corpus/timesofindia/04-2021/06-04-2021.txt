---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru gets new Covid-19 guidelines to battle second wave||The surge of Covid-19 cases across the country has led to various state governments relooking rules in an attempt to curb the second wave of the pandemic. In Karnataka, the state government has put forth a new set of restrictions for various sectors, especially in hotspots like Bengaluru. Here's what the the new restrictions are... No more than 50% occupancy at restaurants and pubsRestaurants and pubs across the city have been asked to restrict their occupancy to 50 per cent. Masks, sanitisers and social distancing are to be mandatory and violation of these restrictions could lead to the establishment being closed for the entire duration of the pandemic. Event managers say that guest lists are now being screened and kept minimal. 50% occupancy at gymsWhile the KArnataka government initially ordered gyms to be shut, it has now allowed them to function, but at 50% occupancy. No large religious gatheringsNo big religious activities or events are allowed. Places of worship are still allowed to function and people can visit without crowding for now. Swimming pools to remain closedSwimming pools across the state have been ordered to remain closed. Calling the decision unwarranted, Ekalavya Awardee and senior swimming coach for competitive swimmers, Shreesh Reddy says, "Competitive swimming is an exclusive vertical in the domain of swimming and should not be stopped at any cost. Stopping public batches is fine, but competitive swimming cannot stop." Common facilities closed in apartmentsAs per the new restrictions, all common facilities and areas, including gyms, swimming pools and other recreational facilities, have been closed in apartment complexes. Cinema halls to operate at 50% occupancyWhile the government initially ordered immediate implementation of 50% occupancy in cinema halls, on request by the film industry, this has been pushed to April 7.

District level common revision test scheduled to commence from April 8 and practical exams scheduled from April 16 to 23 have come under a cloud. "There is only four weeks’ time for board exams to commence. Covid-19 cases are expected to peak around that time. We feel it is not advisable to conduct the exams as per the present schedule. There is time till June to conduct the board exams," said B Purushothaman, senior principal of Everwin Group of Schools. "The second wave is affecting even the teenagers. Parents and children are expecting the board exams to be postponed to June till the Covid-19 cases subside," said N Vijayan, senior principal of Zion Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Tambaram. The National Testing Agency has scheduled the NEET-UG exam on August 1. "There is enough time to prepare for JEE and NEET even if the exams are conducted in June," he said.  The second revision test will be conducted for Class XII from April 8. The practical exams for Class XII students will be held from April 16 to 23. A headmaster from a government school said students will be at risk if the revision test is conducted immediately after the polls as election commission is also allowing Covid-19 patients also to vote. Another headmaster said the attendance of students dropped after the revision test. "We had above 95% attendance for the first revision test. But , the attendance was sharply dropped to 50% after the tests when the schools conducted classes on March 31 and April 1," she said. However, G J Manohar, principal of MCC Higher Secondary School in Chetpet postponing the exams will affect the preparation of the Class XII students.  He mooted the idea of vaccinating the Class XII students before the board exams. School education department officials said they have not discussed anything about the postponement of the exams yet. "As of now, revision tests and practical exams are on as per the schedule," an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/schools-ask-govt-to-postpone-class-xii-board-exams/articleshow/81926406.cms||---

---||India||Spurious cough syrup: J&K HC upholds compensation for victims’ families||JAMMU: Jammu & Kashmir High Court on Monday upheld the validity of an order passed by National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) granting monetary compensation of Rs 3 lakh each to the next of kin of each kid who died after consuming spurious cough syrup. Twelve children from poor families in Ramnagar area in Udhampur district had died in January and February 2020 after intaking spurious cough syrup. Disposing of a writ petition, the division bench comprising Chief Justice Justice Pankaj Mithal and Justice Sindhu Sharma contended that considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case, the court did not deem it proper to exercise its extraordinary discretionary jurisdiction to interfere with the orders passed by the Commission. Jammu-based social activist Sukesh C Khajuria had filed a complaint in this regard in June 2020 before the NHRC seeking action, claiming that the tragedy had occurred due to negligence of the officials of the drug and food control department. Following a notice from NHRC, a report was submitted by the department of health and medical education stating that an investigation was carried out and 33 samples of the leftover/partially consumed cough syrup were collected and test reports indicated the presence of parabens and diethylene glycol, which may have caused the deaths. Accordingly, an FIR was lodged under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act against the manufacturers of the cough syrup. The NHRC in September 2020 found procedural lapses on the part of the drugs department in keeping a regular vigil on the contamination and contents of medicines sold within its jurisdiction, and ordered compensation of Rs 3 lakh each to the next of kin of each deceased child. On this, the J&K administration, health and medical education department and the state drug controller had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/spurious-cough-syrup-jk-hc-upholds-compensation-for-victims-families/articleshow/81920324.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Srinagar||Islamic State ‘commander’ arrested in Jammu with cash and arms||JAMMU: In another big catch after the arrest of self-styled commanders of Lashker-e-Mustafa (LeM) and The Resistance Front (TRF) early this year, the Special Operation Group (SOG) and Jammu & Kashmir Police averted a major terror strike with the arrest of a ‘commander’ of the Islamic State of Jammu & Kashmir (ISJK) on Sunday late evening. Malik Umair alias Abdullah, a resident of Yaripora village in Kulgam, was arrested by the SOG from Jhajjar Kotli on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway, IGP-Jammu zone Mukesh Singh said. A vehicle was intercepted after a tip off, Singh said, adding that during checking one of the passengers tried to flee. He was chased and apprehended. The IGP added that the man later turned out to be a commander of ISJK. “The terrorist was arrested around 7pm on Sunday and one pistol, eight rounds and Rs 1.13 lakh were recovered from his possession. With his arrest, a major terror attack by the outfit has been averted,” Singh said. Police claimed that during questioning Malik revealed that he had received the weapon and cash to carry out a terror strike in the Union territory. Further questioning of the militant is on and some more clues are expected. “It has come to light that the arrested terrorist was in touch with a number of ISJK operatives and efforts are on to nab them,” the IGP said. Earlier in February, J&K police had arrested a self-styled TRF commander, Zahoor Ahmad Rather alias Sahil, from Bari Brahmana of Samba district. Rather had killed one police personnel in Furrah in Kulgam district and also killed three BJP functionaries — Fida Hussain Yatoo, Umer Rashid Beigh and Umer Ramzan Hajam — in Y K Pora locality of Kulgam in October last year. Prior to this, police had thwarted a bid by terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) to establish a base for its offshoot Lashkar-e-Mustafa (LeM) in Jammu region with the arrest of Hidayatullah Malik alias Hasnain from Kunjwani area of Jammu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/is-commander-arrested-in-jammu-with-cash-and-arms/articleshow/81920427.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

And for many of the parties it is also the most significant for differing reasons. For BJP, Tuesday's polling is in states and areas where it has little to lose and hopes to make significant gains.

But that has changed in the last four weeks. Since March 8, Covid-related deaths have risen at the same pace as the spike in infections, with the seven-day average of daily cases and fatalities both surging by nearly 345% during this period. Daily deaths (seven-day average) have risen from 96 on March 8 to 425 on April 4, which translates to an increase of nearly 4.5 times, exactly mirroring the rise in cases during this period.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); In the previous four weeks (February 8 to March 8), there was a 50% rise in average daily cases but no increase in deaths.The re cent spike in deaths has been the sharpest since the beginning of the pandemic. Coronavirus: Live updatesThere were 2,974 Covid deaths recorded last week (March 29-April 4), a record 59% higher than the count in the previous week (1,875). Nearly 1,100 more deaths were recorded last week than in the previous seven days, which was the highest weekly jump in fatalities since the coronavirus outbreak in India. Read AlsoExplained in 10 charts: How Covid cases are rising, spreading during 2nd waveNEW DELHI: The daily number of coronavirus cases in India crossed the grim one-lakh mark on Monday with the country reporting a record 1,03,558 new infections. Though the ongoing surge during the second wave is more rapid, it is not as widespread as the previous wave in September-October last year. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); The previous two weeks had seen fatalities rise by 51% and 41%, respectively, again the sharpest increases in percentage terms except for the June 15-21 week, when hundreds of backdated deaths were added to the tally. That deaths remain below levels seen when similar numbers of daily cases were being recorded in the past could be because of a lag in fatalities often seen when infections spike rapidly. Clearly, deaths need to be monitored closely in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, India reported 96,517 fresh infections on Monday, a shade lower than the previous day’s record rise of over 1 lakh cases. Cases remained high on Monday, which usually sees a sharp dip in numbers due to lower testing and staff shortages over the weekend, indicating that the pandemic was still surging in the country. There were 445 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours, the sixth straight day of 400plus toll in India. While Maharashtra reported 47,288 fresh cases, nearly 10,000 less than the previous day’s count, there was a massive surge in Chhattisgarh, which reported 7,302 new infections, becoming the second state to cross the 7,000 mark in daily cases this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-covid-deaths-begin-to-surge-at-same-rate-as-cases/articleshow/81921855.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh controls police department...fair probe in Param Bir case unlikely: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Observing that it will not countenance violation of constitutional principles of integrity by anyone howsoever high an office he may hold, the Bombay high court on Monday, while asking the CBI to conduct a preliminary probe into allegations of “corrupt malpractices” against home minister Anil Deshmukh, said the “Constitution envisages a rule of law and not rule of goons having political support.” Former city police chief Param Bir Singh had in a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray accused Deshmukh of setting a monthly “collection” target of Rs 100 crore. “It is unheard of and un precedented that a minister could be so openly accused of wrongdoings and corrupt practices by none other than a senior police officer,” said an HC bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni. The bench added the allegations by Singh “discloses commission of cognizable offences by Deshmukh” and prima facie should be been acted on, under the law. Read AlsoBombay HC orders CBI probe into allegations made by Param Bir Singh against Anil DeshmukhThe Bombay high court on Monday ordered CBI to initiate an investigation into the corruption allegations made by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. The court asked CBI to start a preliminary inquiry in accordance with law and asked the“Deshmukh is the home minister. The police department is under his control and direction... There can be no fair, impartial, unbiased and untainted probe, if the same were entrusted to the state police force. As of necessity, the probe has to be entrusted to an independent agency like CBI,” the HC said, disposing of Singh’s PIL and three other petitions. “Although we do not see an immediate reason to direct registration of an FIR by the CBI based on (advocate Jaishri) Patil’s complaint, interests of justice will be served if there is a CBI preliminary inquiry into the complaint,” the court said. Patil had made a complaint on March 21 to the Mala bar Hill police citing Singh’s letter. “Once preliminary inquiry is conducted preferably within 15 days… CBI will be at liberty to decide on the future course,” said the HC, noting that Deshmukh’s press release said he was “not averse to facing any inquiry”. The order was passed after a lengthy hearing on the first day and no notice was issued to Deshmukh, one of the respondents. The HC said since no respondents were invited to file reply, allegations against them shall not be deemed to have been admitted by them. The HC heard at length state advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni’s objection to maintainability of Singh’s PIL for a CBI probe against Deshmukh in the absence of an FIR. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, for CBI, said it was willing to probe Singh’s allegations but left it to the HC to decide in what form or by which agency. The HC noted Patil’s March 21 complaint had not resulted in an FIR being filed yet and was “not given the attention it deserved”. Her petition presented an “extraordinary” case, said the HC, noting that the AG never said her complaint does not disclose an cognizable offence but “has been fair to say… it was not processed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/anil-deshmukh-controls-police-dept-fair-probe-in-param-bir-case-unlikely-hc/articleshow/81922064.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Bengaluru||Will take decision on assessment for grades 1-9 in 2 days: Karnataka minister||BENGALURU: A decision on assessing students of classes 1 to 9 in state board schools will be taken in the next two days, primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar said on Monday. He was speaking after the department met with stakeholders to discuss the issue. Besides education department officials, 44 people including representatives of unaided schools, parents’ associations and educationists were present at the meeting. “Everyone gave their opinion. We will take all of them into consideration before coming to a conclusion,” Kumar said on Monday. A press release from the minister’s office said most of the delegates favoured some sort of assessment. Most believed that without assessment, it will be impossible to judge where children are lagging and how to equip them for the next class. They also fear children will lose interest in the next grade if learning gaps are not addressed. While many other states have scrapped exams and promoted children from grades 1-9 due to the second wave of the pandemic, Karnataka is yet to take a decision. Last year, students of these grades were not assessed. The Right to Education Act (RTE) bans exams for classes 1-4 and 6-7 but says students should be assessed through continuous evaluation. An amendment was made in 2019 which allowed exams for classes 5 and 8. Private schools say they should be allowed to hold summative assessments this year. The Association of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka (KAMS), in a letter, has told the department that it’s unfair on children who have been attending classes regularly not to conduct exams. The association suggested that the government can provide strict SOPs to conduct assessments. ‘Easy assessments’Parents associations said while examinations are barred under RTE, some sort of easy assessment can be held for all classes. “However, the department has to ensure that private schools should not use it as a tool to collect fees from students,” said BN Yoganand, member, Karnataka Private Schools Parents Associations Coordinating Committee. Niranjanaradhya VP, senior fellow, Centre for Child and Law, National Law School of India University, said, “According to RTE and the amendment made to it in 2019, exams cannot be conducted in classes 1-4 and 6-7.” He added: “Even while assessments can be done for class 5 and 8, in case a child does not perform well, the state government must hold another exam in two months’ time and help prepare the child for it. The state must put all these plans in place before making an announcement. Learning is more important that testing as the primary objective of the test is to identify learning difficulties.” The department also noted that learning was not uniform across the state. Vidyagama was conducted only for two months and there’s no data on the amount of learning in private schools. Some representatives suggested formative assessments to test children. Some teacher’s associations said that it is unfair to hold exams for classes 1-5 as there has been no learning at all in these classes. Niranjanaradhya said he endorsed this view and added that assessment for these grades are “nothing but victimising children”. “There’s a lack of uniformity in learning this year and it’s advisable to promote all children in these grades,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-sees-5k-cases-debate-on-exams-for-classes-1-to-9/articleshow/81922150.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

The move comes after the state technical advisory committee (TAC) for Covid-19, during a recent meeting, told the government that adherence to health protocols was paramount if it intends to contain a second wave of infections from getting worse. Although BBMP marshals are cracking down on those not wearing masks or following social distancing, they are too few and spread too thin. As a result, enforcement is becoming a challenge in Bengaluru. Rajbir Singh, chief of marshals, said there are 216 marshals presently deployed in the city in 27 assembly constituencies. Four work in each division in shifts. Besides there are marshals who patrol the streets in vehicles and keep an eye on people. BBMP commissioner Gaurav Gupta said: “In addition to marshals, a decision has been taken to deploy 2,000 home guards to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour. We want to enforce the rules and be stricter than before.” From March 28 till April 5, Bengaluru reported 24,590 new cases. The active number of cases have increased from15,882 to 30,782 during the same period. From May last year, BBMP booked 3.9 lakh people for violating health protocols and collected Rs 9.3 crore in penalties. BBMP marshals have booked 3.7 lakh people for not wearing masks and have collected a fine of Rs 8.7 crore till March this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2k-home-guards-for-covid-duty-in-bluru/articleshow/81922186.cms||---
---||India||Several red flags missed ahead of Naxal carnage||The first shot was fired from behind — from a location the forces had already crossed. It was the trigger for a fusillade of mortar shells, rifle grenades and machine-gun bullets. Within seconds, the entire jungle seemed to erupt. The forces were surrounded. Some raced for abandoned huts. Death lurked there, too. How did it get to this? How were security forces encir cled and taken by surprise in an area they had already traversed, even as they were retracing their footsteps? In the aftermath of the Tekulguda massacre, questions are being asked about intelligence, operational planning and field work — questions that are uncomfortably similar to those asked after the Tadmetla massacre exactly 11 years ago in which 76 soldiers were martyred. Security experts and officers with experience of anti-insurgency operations told TOI on condition of anonymity that there were several red flags for the troops on the operation that were not heeded, reports Rashmi Drolia. CRPF DG Kuldip Singh has denied there was any intelligence or operational failure. “Had it been so, the operation wouldn’t have been carried out and so many Maoists wouldn’t have been killed,” he had said on Sunday. “The Maoists suddenly started firing at security personnel, taking advantage of their stronghold. The weapons they used were advanced machine guns. Yet, we fought valiantly,” he said. One of the injured jawans has said the forces did realise something was amiss. “When we were heading towards Tekulguda, we sensed something was wrong as the village and the surrounding areas had no population. The houses were empty. There was an eerie silence. We contacted senior commanders and were ordered to keep moving,” he said. “A few hundred meters ahead, came a gunshot from behind. Before we could take positions, we were surrounded from all sides and trapped in an ambush. The Maoists used all sorts of advanced weapons, like sniper rifles, rocket launchers, UBGL and mortars. It was terrible to see fellow jawans falling, one by one,” the survivor said. “We realised the only way to break the ambush was to keep firing.” The troops were ambushed when they were returning after finding no sign of the supposed ‘meeting of top Maoist leaders’ that had led to the operation. Was the ‘intel’ a ruse to pull security forces into the kill zone? Were SOPs followed during the penetra tion into Maoist-dominated territory? Maoist preparedness for the ambush indicates it was meticulously planned, say security experts. Sources say security forces were getting inputs for the past week about Maoist leader Hidma. Another issue may have been the diverse composition of the force — 2,000 strong, as confirmed by home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu. It comprised crack CoBRA commandos, CRPF and its Bastariya Battalion, and state police’s DRG and STF. An officer with long experience of countering insurgency said: “Carrying out such a massive operation with troops from so many units needs precise overall command and coordination. Coming from different training backgrounds, with varied skills, approaches, abilities and immunity, such a massive joint operation into the heartland of Hidma’s territory was a lot to ask for.” While CoBRA commandos are known for their aggressive counter-strikes, DRG personnel are mostly tribal youths or ex-Maoists, while STF is a force created and placed for quick-reaction-based operations. “Coordination is vital in such an operation,” the officer said, pointing out that it was not led by senior commandants on the ground, but a few junior officers. “When such a large force goes on an operation, a ‘technical headquarters’ has to be set up at the nearest camp. A senior officer should have led the five teams that set out from Tarrem, Usoor, Pamed, Minpa and Narhaspur camps,” a veteran of anti-Naxal ops said. The closest camp to the ambush site is Tarrem, 8km away, set up in November 2020. Another one is planned closer, just 2km away in Bendre, but is yet to be set up. “There are several hillocks on either side of the route from Tarrem to Tekulguda. SOP is clear that troops must walk on the hillsides and not on low ground,” said an officer. Maoist spokesman Abhay issued a statement on Monday, saying their fight is not against police or security forces. “Those getting recruited into the forces are also part of the exploited people and it’s our compulsion to fight when they come with weapons to fight us. Our sympathies are with their families,” it said, urging people “not to send their children to join security forces”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/several-red-flags-missed-ahead-of-naxal-carnage/articleshow/81922207.cms||Rashmi Drolia
---||India||IIIT-Delhi on mission to develop method to predict collision from space debris||NEW DELHI: Aiming to develop a method to predict collision from space debris,Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Delhi, has received research funding from the National Super Computing Mission (NSM), implemented by the department of science and technology (DST). The project titled ‘Orbit computation of Resident Space Objects for Space Situational Awareness’ has to be completed in two years. The project will be led by IIIT-Delhi faculty Sanat K Biswas and Arun Balaji Buduru. Elaborating on the project, Biswas said, “There are more than 20,000 man-made objects of more than 10 cm in size floating around in near-earth space that pose collision threats to functional satellites. Predicting collision probability from these space objects is crucial from the national security perspective as well as for the protection of public and private space assets of Indian origin.” He said that the “outcome of this project will directly support the Indian space sector, valued at $7 billion (Rs 51,334 crore) by providing an operationally flexible, scalable, transparent and indigenous collision probability solution.” Space debris poses a global threat to the continued use of space-based technologies that support critical functions like communication, transport, weather and climate monitoring, remote sensing. Academia, industries and space agencies around the world are working diligently to address this issue. Through this project, IIIT-Delhi will contribute to the global effort towards space sustainability, its statement said. The NSM project is being implemented by the DST in collaboration with the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeITy) to ensure the country’s leadership in supercomputing. The real amount of space debris is said to be between 500,000 and one million pieces as current sensor technology cannot detect smaller objects. They all travel at speeds of up to 17,500 mph (28,162 kmph) fast enough for a relatively small piece of orbital debris to damage a satellite or a spacecraft. India has over 50 functional satellites in space. It’s also planning to launch its own space station in the coming years. To safeguard its space assets from space debris, Isro had set up a dedicated Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Control Centre named “Netra” in Bengaluru last December. Netra’s key objective is to monitor, track and protect the national space assets and function as a hub of all SSA activities. Only the US, Russia and Europe have similar facilities in place to track space objects and share collision warnings. Once Netra is fully functional, India won’t be dependent on the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) for tracking space objects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iiit-delhi-on-mission-to-develop-method-to-predict-collision-from-space-debris/articleshow/81922381.cms||Surendra Singh

Five election officials have been suspended for ‘dereliction of duty’. Assam chief electoral officer Nitin Khade said in a statement that the polling station located at A Khothlir LP School was set up for the first time and had just 90 enrolled voters. But on April 1, during the second phase of the elections, 181 votes were cast here. “The presiding and first polling officer in their statements have admitted that they allowed the voters registered against the main polling station to cast their votes in the auxiliary polling station. Taking note of this lapse, the district election officer has suspended the sector officer, the presiding officer and three other polling officers and the booth level officer…” the statement read. This is the second time repolling has been ordered at a constituency.

---||India||Maharashtra HM Deshmukh quits as HC asks CBI to probe 'graft'||MUMBAI: Anil Deshmukh resigned as Maharashtra home minister hours after the Bombay high court on Monday directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry into allegations of “corrupt malpractices” made by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh against him. Singh had, in an eight-page letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, alleged Deshmukh had met subordinate police officers, including suspended API Sachin Waze, and asked for “collection” of Rs 100 crore from various establishments in Mumbai. Deshmukh has denied the allegations, and his party NCP had earlier said there was no need for him to quit though BJP had demanded his resignation. Senior NCP leader and labour & excise minister Dilip Walse Patil is likely to take over the reins of the home department. The excise department will be entrusted to Ajit Pawar. The labour department will be given to rural development minister Hasan Mushriff. A CBI team from New Delhi is slated to arrive in Mumbai on Tuesday to initiate the probe after discussing the court order with its legal team. Accompanied by deputy CM Ajit Pawar, Deshmukh first called on NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Monday to brief him on the outcome of the public interest litigation filed by Singh before the HC. Pawar quickly approved Deshmukh’s plea to resign from the cabinet “on moral grounds”. Deshmukh is counted among the trusted aides of Sharad Pawar but had been at the receiving end for inept handling of the Waze episode. In a brief letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray, Deshmukh said since the HC had directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary probe against him, he did not think it fit to continue in the cabinet on moral grounds. “Under such circumstances, on moral grounds, I feel I should quit. I am quitting on my own, please relieve from my post of home minister,” he stated in the letter. Deshmukh’s resignation was later accepted by governor B S Koshyari. NCP was apparently taken by surprise when the HC asked the CBI to conduct the preliminary probe. All along, NCP had expected that since the Supreme Court has declined to step in and the state government had set up a one-man high-level committee of Justice Kailash Uttamchand Chandiwal to probe into the charges of corruption raised in Singh’s letter, the chapter would be a closed one. In his letter to the CM, Singh had, apart from mentioning his own unceremonious exit from the Mumbai CP’s post, raised two key issues: the “target” allegedly given by Deshmukh to Waze, and the alleged pressure exerted by the home minister on Mumbai police to register an abetment of suicide case in the death of Dadra Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha MP Mohan Delkar. Singh had said that after Waze’s meeting with Deshmukh, the API had come to his office and narrated this interaction. Singh had also written that he had briefed Sharad Pawar, CM Thackeray and Ajit Pawar about the matter in view of its seriousness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-hm-deshmukh-quits-as-hc-asks-cbi-to-probe-graft/articleshow/81922464.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||2 resignations in 2 months: A setback for Uddhav Thackeray?||MUMBAI: Anil Deshmukh of NCP is the second minister in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government to resign in over two months. In February, forest minister Sanjay Rathod of Shiv Sena, who is facing allegations over the death of a 22year-old woman by suicide in Pune, tendered his resignation a day before the state budget session commenced. Sources from Shiv Sena said that the two back-to-back resignations have not only dented the image of the MVA government but has also raised questions on the credibility of Sena, which leads the triparte alliance in the state, and has come as a big embarrassment to the CM. After all Sena, with a different ideology, had tied up with their traditional foes NCP and Congress, an alignment that was too difficult for the old Shivsainiks to digest. Several members from Sena and even within NCP were taken by surprise when supremo Sharad Pawar had picked Deshmukh for the home portfolio. A Sena functionary said following the claims made by Param Bir Singh, Thackeray was not very keen that Deshmukh continue handling the home portfolio and wanted him to resign. However, the CM preferred to be silent as Pawar himself addressed two pressers in the national Capital defending Deshmukh. Finally, on Monday, as soon as the home minister resigned, Thackeray forwarded the resignation to the governor and it was accepted within a few hours. Meanwhile, a few Sainiks are eyeing the vacant post from the Sena quota in the cabinet, created following the resignation of forest minister Sanjay Rathod. But a Sena member said the CM may keep the portfolio with himself and wait for Rathod to come back clean as Sena cannot afford to hurt the Banjara community face, who has a stronghold in Yavatmal and nearby regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2-resignations-in-2-months-a-setback-for-uddhav-thackeray/articleshow/81922466.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||India||Quad exercise begins day after Russia rejects ‘bloc approach’||NEW DELHI: India and the three other Quad countries kicked off a major naval exercise along with France in the Bay of Bengal on Monday, underlining the growing strategic congruence in ensuring a secure and stable Indo-Pacific in face of China’s belligerence in the region. This came a day after Russia said it attached great importance on “rejection of confrontation and bloc-type approaches”, thought to be a reference to Quad and the Indo-Pacific initiative, both of which it views as “divisive” and aimed at containing China. Incidentally, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov landed in Delhi on an official visit Monday. In the Bay of Bengal, India deployed its stealth frigate INS Satpura and anti-submarine warfare corvette INS Kiltan, along with P-8I long range maritime patrol aircraft, for the three-day “La Pérouse” exercise. The exercise will witness complex and advanced naval operations, including surface warfare, anti-air warfare and air defence operations as well as weapon firings, cross-deck flying, tactical manoeuvres and seamanship evolutions such as replenishment at sea,” said Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal. “It will showcase high levels of synergy, coordination and interoperability between the five friendly navies. Participation by the Indian Navy in the exercise demonstrates the shared values with the friendly navies in ensuring freedom of seas and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order,” he added. France has fielded amphibious assault warship Tonnerre and frigate Surcouf for the exercise, while the US is represented by amphibious transport dock ship Somerset. Australia, in turn, has deployed frigate Anzac and tanker Sirius, while Japan is represented by destroyer Akebono. The navies of the Quad, namely India, the US, Japan and Australia, had also come together for the highvoltage Malabar exercise in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea in November last year after a gap of 13 years. The ongoing Quad-plusFrance exercise comes soon after Indian warships and fighters also held another exercise with the mammoth nuclear-powered USS Theodore Roosevelt and its accompanying warships in the same region last week. With the Quad countries declaring their firm intent to deter any “coercion” in the Indo-Pacific during a summit of their leaders on March 12, a multi-tier cooperation and coordination mechanism is now taking shape to advance security as well as counter threats in the region, as was earlier reported by TOI. US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin and South Korean defence minister Suh Wook, both former Army generals, had also made back-to-back visits to India last month to discuss bilateral and multilateral mechanisms to bolster security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/quad-exercise-begins-day-after-russia-rejects-bloc-approach/articleshow/81922492.cms||---
---||Delhi||St Stephen’s reopens amid Covid concerns||New Delhi: Even as St Stephen’s College re-opened its campus for routine work on Monday, a governing body member wrote a letter to the principal, pointing out several concerns related to Covid safety on campus. Earlier, 13 students of the college had tested positive after a group of students returned from a trip to Dalhousie. Three blocks on the college premises were subsequently identified as containment zones. In her letter to the principal, John Varghese, Nandita Narain said, “In the light of fresh information coming in from students in residence, I would like to know how many students and staff were tested for Covid on April 3 and which is the lab that conducted the test.” “Is it a fact that a student, who had tested negative in the college test, later tested positive in the test conducted in a government facility and was subsequently, moved into a quarantined block? Is it a fact that a student, who tested negative in the college test, was now showing symptoms of Covid but was not allowed to get himself tested in a government facility?” she asked. Narain suggested that students and staff of the college should be allowed to get themselves tested in a government facility. Meanwhile, St Stephen’s College stated on its website: “The college with the help of the SDM’s office will be conducting a Covid test tomorrow, April 7 at 11 am in the college café. All members of the college community who are interested are welcome to get themselves tested.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/st-stephens-reopens-amid-covid-concerns/articleshow/81939189.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Second Covid wave’s 1st lesson: 50-60 age group may be at higher risk||KOLKATA: A 53-year-old businessman from the southern fringes of the city is currently admitted in a private hospital’s critical care wing with severe Covid-19 infection. Another 49-year-old north Kolkata resident is being treated in the ICU of a government Covid-19 facility. These are not just two isolated cases. Amidst the sharp surge in Covid-19 cases, the aver-age age of infected patients is coming down from what the hospitals had witnessed during the first wave. Many of them are needing critical care treatment. “Out of the 28 patients who are either critical or semi-critical in our hospital, 40% are below 60. But it is a bit early to conclude that we are seeing a rise in the number of relatively younger patients needing hospital care this time,” said pulmonologist Kausik Chaudhuri, nodal officer for Covid-19 at state-run Beliaghata ID hospital. Hospitals across the city said that it was mostly aged people who would take 80%-90% critical care beds during the first wave, this time they are getting an increasing number of patients in the age bracket of 50 and 60. “Previously, it would be aged people above 60 who mostly got complications after being infected. But now, we are getting many patients between 50 and 55 with severe infection. In fact, the average age — taking into all 32 patients admitted with in our Covid wing right now — is 57 years. There seems quite a significant shift as far as patients needing hospital care is concerned,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO of Peerless Hospital. Critical care specialist Dipanjan Chatterjee of Medica Superspecialty Hospital echoed Mitra. Out of the 95 odd patients getting treated for Covid infection at the hospital at present, four are being put on ECMO support. Out of them two are below 60 years. The two under ECMO support who are above 60 had not got inoculated. “One of the reasons why less number of aged people are getting infected this time could be the vaccine shots. Also, a majority of those getting infected now are from the working age bracket,” said Chatterjee. The vaccination drive was first rolled out for healthcare and frontline workers. While it got extended to senior citizens and those above 45 years of age with co-morbidities, a majority of the economically active people who need to go out for work regularly has not been included in the programme. Those above 45 years without co-morbidities have been added only recently. “I feel it is too early to co-relate vaccination and the age group of people who are now being infected. We need studies on post vaccination to come to a conclusion. Till then, all those who have got their vaccine doses still need to adhere to Covid-19 protocol. What we are noticing this time is a sharper and rapid rise in infection, with more or less the same virulence and mortality,” said Chaudhuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2nd-cov-waves-1st-lesson-50-60-age-group-may-be-at-higher-risk/articleshow/81919242.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

A fortnight ago, active Covid cases in Nalanda was reported to be only 10 with no case in Sheikhpura then. The first case in Sheikhpura in the second wave was reported on March 27. Two persons have so far died in Sheikhpura due to the virus. The Covid patients in Nalanda include the district civil surgeon, four health workers, two teachers, a hospital guard, a guard posted at Rajgir Nature Safari, besides a doctor couple and a health worker, who tested positive after receiving two shots of the vaccines. Nalanda DM Yogendra Kumar Singh and Sheikhpura DM Inayat Khan have directed the officials to strictly enforce the new corona-related guidelines issued by the government recently. They have been told to direct hotel owners, bus owners, local bodies, different social or other organisations to ask people to use face masks and social distancing. They also directed officials to identify micro containment zones and launch sanitation and other related works there.

Police officials said assistant commissioner, GST, Ramesh Kumar Singh lives with his family in flat no. 202 of an apartment in Lakhanpur areay. Singh, a native of Sonbhadra, is posted as assistant commissioner in state GST office in Lakhanpur. Police said his wife Kiran was alone in her room while Singh was watching TV in another room with their son Ayush at the time of the incident. Singh told police that after his wife didn’t come out for long, he went to check on her but found the room locked from inside. On not getting any response after repeated knockings, Singh said he peeped through a window and saw Kiran hanging. “He claims he saw his wife hanging from the ceiling and broke open the door and brought her down and then informed the police. Before he could provide any medical assistance to her, Kiran succumbed at the spot,” said inspector Kalyanpur Janardan Pratap Singh. Though no suicide was recovered from the spot, prima facie it appears to be a case of suicide, but police are still probing all possible angles. The family and other acquaintances of the deceased are being questioned. The autopsy and forensic reports are awaited, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/gst-asstt-commissioners-wife-found-hanging-suicide-suspected/articleshow/81902043.cms||---

The state on Monday operated 4,236 vaccination sites. Of them, 211 were private-run centres. “Apart from increasing the number of sites, we are trying to optimize the efficiency of each centre by increasing the number of vaccinations at each. This is how we are trying to double the daily vaccination count at the earliest,” the official said. While the vaccination drive on Sunday received a lukewarm response as many were unaware of it, officials expect the subsequent weekends to become popular among the service class. A campaign against vaccine hesitancy has also been launched across the state to encourage more people in the 45-plus age group to step forward for inoculation. Poll-bound Bengal has witnessed a steady rise in active Covid cases since election dates were announced on February 26. “We fear cases will rise manifold as Covid protocols are being ignored at large election meetings and gatherings,” said senior pulmonologist Arup Haldar. Districts reporting higher infection rates have also witnessed a bigger rush for vaccination. Kolkata, for instance, operated 166 sites on Monday, out of which 55 were private. More than 6.5 lakh people have been inoculated here. Kolkata is closely followed by North 24 Parganas, where vaccination is run at 347 sites and 4.9 lakh people have received the jab. Vaccines reached Kolkata on January 12 and its rollout began on January 16. Trends show that, on March 19, the vaccination drive attained its peak when nearly 3 lakh people could be vaccinated in a day. The peak was again attained on March 22 and 26. However, from the end of March, the curve of vaccination rate has somewhat flattened to below 2 lakh a day owing to the busy election schedule. Till March 7, the vaccination was slow-paced owing to glitches in the Co-WIN app. Thereafter, the state geared up its vaccination drive. Bengal has since achieved the third highest vaccination among states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-ramps-up-vax-sites-hikes-target-to-create-herd-immunity/articleshow/81919283.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Alike last year, thermal screening and hand sanitisation of visitors have become mandatory in many apartments. Dhirendra Kumar Sinha, a resident of Shaktipuram Society on Gola Road, said minimum outsiders are allowed inside these days. “We are ensuring utmost hygiene through constant sanitisation of metal rods, children playground and garden. We have undertaken such initiatives voluntarily.” he said. Amit Kumar Sinha, a resident of Mundeshwari Enclave near passport office, said all necessary Covid prevention protocols are back in his society. “We have put sanitiser bottles at main entrance of respective apartments,” he said. Pramod Kumar, a resident of Jalalpur City, said his society is to restrict entries of vendors, domestic helps and delivery boys. “We are regularly sanitising the society. Besides, we are ensuing supply of all necessary household items to the flats, where anyone has tested positive for the virus,” he said. Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Himanshu Sharma said the civic body is primarily focusing on sanitising containment zones, micro containment zones, hospitals and public places. “We have started a sanitisation drive where executive officers have been directed to use 300 hand-operated machines. We are focusing on regulating this drive in slum areas,” Sharma said. He added that residents should voluntarily take necessary precautions to safeguard themselves. Meanwhile, doctors have suggested people to stick to Covid appropriate behaviours. “The number of Covid positive cases is similar to May last year. Covid patients are suggested to either stay in home isolation or in government quarantine centre, if finding difficulties in getting beds in hospitals. Symptomatic people should take required medication after consulting any doctor even if staying in isolation,” said Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/societies-take-preventive-steps-amid-covid-surge/articleshow/81918374.cms||---

The footfall of customers is dipping again and likely to plunge further if the Covid situation does not improve. Talking to this reporter, restaurateur Harmit S Chawla attributed the fall in the number of visitors during the last few days to the closure of educational institutes and coaching centres. “Many eateries, which had been attracting a large number of customers for the last five months, are empty again,” Chawla claimed. Expressing grave concern over the Covid scenario, Amit Kumar Pandey, the assistant manager of a hotel near Gandhi Maidan, said, “The hospitality industry was hit hard by the pandemic in 2020. The situation began improving in 2021, but it seems that we are back to square one.” Meanwhile, delivery boys are once again in demand as people have started ordering groceries and vegetables from online portals. Vijay Shah, who works with a firm delivering groceries, said, “Although I am more at risk now, I cannot afford to sit at home. I have to run a family.” Another delivery boy, Aman Raj, echoed similar views. “The present scenario is scary, but I follow all Covid safety protocols while going from one house to another. I have no other option,” he rued. Keeping their safety in mind, many Patnaites, especially youngsters, have switched to virtual shopping. Shivani Yadav, a resident of Jagdeo Path, said, “Since stepping out of the house is risky, I buy everything online.” A student, Akansha Kharga, has also stopped visiting markets, malls and restaurants. “Contracting the virus is easy when people around me are so careless. I, therefore, shop online,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/with-poor-footfalls-is-hospitality-sector-staring-at-another-blow/articleshow/81918365.cms||---

Ariff, who spoke at a women’s meet organised in Kayamkulam on Sunday as part of LDF’s election campaign for its candidate U Prathibha, said, “UDF should remember that this election is not for the milk society but state assembly.” His contention was that UDF was using the economic background of the candidate, who is a dairy farmer who supplies milk to the society, as a campaign plank to seek votes. The video went viral leading to widespread criticism of Ariff with UDF leaders seeking an apology from him stating that it was in bad taste as it amounted to insulting her means of livelihood. Responding to the comment, Aritha said it was painful to hear such words. “As for his comments on milk society elections, I wish to state that I have contested and won membership to the society. So it is not my first election. LDF is a party which claims to represent the working class and yet they make such comments,” Aritha told TOI. She said the UDF committee would meet to decide on whether a complaint should be filed against Ariff. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala too demanded an apology from Ariff and said people of Kayamkulam will give a befitting reply. Last week, Aritha’s house was attacked after Priyanka Gandhi’s visit to Kayamkulam, which has been an LDF bastion for the past 15 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/arifs-remarks-against-aritha-babu-udf-demands-apology/articleshow/81920470.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank too have reported high deposit growth of 54.7% and 27.7% respectively, indicating a gain in market share after a turbulent fourth quarter in FY20. Although industry business figures for the banking sector will be known only in the coming weeks, RBI data up to mid-March indicates that banking sector growth in deposits will be below 11% and advances at below 6%. In a statement to the exchanges, HDFC Bank said that its deposits stood at Rs 13.4 lakh crore at the end of March 2021 — an increase of 5% over the previous quarter and a 16.3% increase for the financial year. The private lender’s loans stood at Rs 11.3 lakh crore — an increase of 4.6% over the previous quarter and 13.9% year-on-year. This shows that a large chunk of the banking sector’s loan growth has come from HDFC Bank. Yes Bank has said that its deposit base at Rs 1.6 lakh crore is 11.4% higher than the previous quarter and 54.7% higher than the previous year when the bank saw a run on its deposits. Its loan book at Rs 1.7 lakh crore has recorded a 1.8% growth quarter on quarter and 0.8% growth over the year. IndusInd Bank has seen its deposits grow 27.7% year-on-year to over Rs 2 lakh crore (7% quarter-on-quarter). The lender’s advances grew 3% over the year and over the quarter to nearly Rs 2.1 lakh crore. According to a research report by Emkay Global, the bank has accelerated the purchase of mortgage loans from HDFC to Rs 7,500 crore in Q4 from Rs 7,100 crore in Q3. “Corporate growth remains strong at 21% year-on-year owing to healthy working capital demand and the bank’s focus on capturing market share in better-rated corporates. The bank expects the momentum to continue as the private investment cycle is likely to revive from H2FY22,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-loans-grow-14-in-fy21/articleshow/81920647.cms||---

Patna alone registered 432 new cases. The number of active cases crossed the 4000-mark in Bihar and reached 4142 on Monday. The new cases were detected out of the 72,418 samples tested in the 24 hours till Sunday. Chief minister Nitish Kumar has instructed the health department to test at least one lakh samples in a day. He said the maximum tests should be done through RT-PCR. “In Bihar also, the number of cases is increasing. I have told the officials to carry out maximum vaccination. Few days back, nearly 20,000 samples were tested in a day. I have asked the officials to take it to one lakh per day,” said Nitish, adding he will hold a district-level meeting on Tuesday to review the situation. Health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit explained the rampant increase in Covid cases witnessed post Holi in Bihar and cautioned people to follow all norms. For instance, in the first and second week of March, Bihar had registered 224 and 267 cases respectively. From March 15 to 21, another 544 new cases were registered. In the fourth week from March 22 to 28, Bihar registered 1,386 cases. This was the time when people had started coming for the festival. Post-festival, from March 29 to April 4, the state registered 3,422 new cases. Pointing towards the trend, Amrit said the virus this time was spreading more rampantly and virulently. “I request people to follow the guidelines, use masks, maintain distance, wash hands and avoid unnecessary movement. Those above 45 years should get vaccinated. These are the only weapons we have,” he said. Three official deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. Apart from Patna, some other districts with substantial number of Covid cases include Jehanabad (63), Purnia (32), Samastipur (32), Muzaffarpur (32) and Gaya (32). Altogether 3834 people are under home isolation, accounting for nearly 93% of the 4142 active cases. In three different categories of isolation centres, there are 1806 beds available in the Covid hospitals, 6240 in dedicated Covid healthcare centres and 8467 in dedicated Covid care centres. Amrit said arrangement for Covid-19 treatment has again been made at ESI Hospital in Bihta. At a press conference, he said there was no dearth of beds as the officials have been instructed to add 100 more beds at NMCH while PMCH had another 100 such beds for Covid patients. “Fifty nurses have been sent to ESI Hospital, Bihta and treatment has started there,” said Amrit. He also said the number of beds at AIIMS-Patna has been increased in the general ward from 60 to 110 and in ICU from 20 to 30. Earlier, he said they were also exploring the possibility of making AIIMS-Patna a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. He asked people to call on 104 in case of any problem or query related to Covid-19. Talking about vaccination, Amrit said they were inoculating nearly 2.25 lakh people on an average daily and had targeted vaccinating as many as possible in the next 20 to 25 days. On Monday, total 2,87,576 doses of vaccines were administered, which included both the first and the second doses. This was the highest number of vaccinations done in a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/935-more-test-covid-positive-in-bihar/articleshow/81918355.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Chief minister Nitish Kumar assures action against Madhubani case accused||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said action would be taken against those involved in the killing of five persons at Mohmadpur village under Benipatti police station area in Madhubani district on Holi. Responding to a query, Nitish said instructions have already been issued to the senior police officers to ensure arrest of the culprits at the earliest and bring the case to the logical conclusion after proper investigation. “There is a clear instruction to the police not to spare anybody involved in committing crimes. The DGP briefed me about the incident today and on earlier occasions also,” he added. The CM clarified that it was the sole responsibility of the police to check crime and initiate action against the offenders whosoever they may be. “What is significant is to conduct proper investigation and ensure prosecution,” he said. The killings, including of three brothers, have generated political heat with leaders of different political parties making a beeline to meet the bereaved family and promising them speedy justice. Twelve out of the 35 accused have been arrested and the properties of the absconders were attached. However, the main accused, Praveen Jha and Navin Jha, were still at large. Benipatti BJP MLA Vinod Narayan Jha defended himself and said some people with vested interests were trying to give the incident a different colour, but truth will prevail. Jha said he was in New Delhi for the treatment of some close relatives. “Had I been there, I would have visited the village despite the site of occurrence falling under Harlakhi assembly constituency. I have great sympathy with the bereaved family. The culprits should be hanged for the crime,” he added. Jha’s reactions came in the backdrop of some RJD and Left party leaders accusing him of shielding the accused. Even BJP MLA Gyanendra Singh Gyanu criticised the state police for their failure to check such daring incidents. “Had the deceased been the members of minority community or Dalits, even the DGP would have visited the spot and shown keen interest in ensuring the arrest of the culprits. But in this case, the deceased didn’t belong to either of the two categories,” he said. Earlier, Neeraj Kumar Singh @ Bablu, a minister in the Nitish government, had expressed his concern over the killings. Senior JD(U) leader Jai Kumar Singh also said the incident has revived the memory of massacres in the state. However, JD(U) MLC Sanjay Singh said justice will be delivered to the family at the earliest. LJP MP from Vaishali, Veena Devi, demanded arms licence to the close relatives of the deceased as they apprehended threat to their lives from the accused and their henchmen. When contacted, Madhubani SP Satya Prakash said 12 accused have already been arrested in the case. The property of the main accused were attached as they were absconding. He said Benipatti SHO Mahendra Singh was put suspended for dereliction of duty. The victims’ family had accused the SHO of not taking action in a case lodged earlier against the rival groups. Authoritative sources said the March 29 incident was a fallout of a dispute over fishing in a pond between Mohmadpur and Gaibipur villages in November last year. Two separate FIRs were lodged by rival groups led by Sanjay Singh and Pravin Jha, respectively. While Sanjay, a resident of Mohmadpur, had lodged an FIR against Praveen and his associates, the latter’s close aide Mukesh Safi had accused the former of hatching a murder conspiracy. Sanjay is in jail in connection with that case. Suraj Narain Singh, a close relative of the deceased, said, “We want justice and nothing else.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-assures-action-against-madhubani-case-accused/articleshow/81918442.cms||Ramashankar

Union minister for agriculture and farmers’ welfare and food processing Narendra Singh Tomar and state industries minister Shahnawaz Hussain made the joint announcement in this regard in Delhi on Monday, reports said. As envisaged by the just cleared mega food park project, the Centre and state government together would make initial expenditure of Rs 103 crore. Of the sum, the Centre would provide Rs50 crore as grant for the project. Tomar said Rs103 crore would be utilized on the construction of the common structure on the land. Following this, investors would pump in Rs300 crore in as many as 30 food processing units to be established there. Together, the two kinds of investments would add up to Rs403 crore, overall. “The work on the project will begin, soon,” Tomar said, adding that it will create 5,000 work opportunities for the aspirants. For his part, the state industries minister said BIADA had moved the proposal on the advice of CM Nitish Kumar for wresting the mega food park project for the state. While the Centre had earlier planned for the establishment of 42 mega food park units in the country. Of them, as many as 40 projects had already gone to different states and only two remained to be allotted. “Of the remaining two mega food park projects, one has finally come to Bihar. It is a big heartening news for the people of the state,” Hussain said and thanked both PM Narendra Modi and CM Nitish Kumar for taking the initiative and interest for the eventual sanction to mega food park for the state at Motipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/centre-clears-mega-food-park-at-motipur-in-muzaffarpur/articleshow/81918424.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Bihar: Transport sector wheels slow down in wake of spurt in new Covid cases||PATNA: With a significant spurt in fresh Covid-19 cases in the state, the transport sector has witnessed a sudden slowdown. Rental car services, airlines and trains have registered a dip in the number of passengers during the last few days. According to the executives of different airlines at the Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport, there has been a sharp fall in the number of flyers during the post-Holi phase. “Due to a sudden decrease in demand, we have stopped operating two flights for the time being,” an IndiGo employee told this reporter, wishing anonymity. A few airlines, however, hope that despite a fresh Covid wave, people prefer flights to trains. “At present, the effect on aviation sector is marginal, the reason for which is people’s preference for air travel over other modes of transport amid the pandemic,” a SpiceJet executive claimed. The chief public relations officer of the East Central Railway, Rajesh Kumar, also pointed out that only 20% of the passenger trains were running these days. “Although most express trains have resumed their operations, only a few passenger trains are running due to the pandemic,” he added. Similarly, rental car services and taxi operators have been reporting a decrease in the number of customers since last week. “We are usually busy during Holi, but no car was booked for any long-distance journey this time,” rued Rajeev Roshan, a city-based taxi operator. Meanwhile, many Patnaites have put their travel plans on hold or cancelled them to reduce the risk of contracting the virus. Patliputra resident Aishwarya Singh said, “We were supposed to go on a family vacation in April, but we cancelled the trip.” Since marketing professional Mansi Mishra’s company has shifted to the work-from-home mode again, she has decided not to return to Bengaluru. The employee of a popular travel agency near Dak Bungalow, Kumud Ranjan, said, “The transport sector has already been reeling from the adverse effects of the first wave of Covid since 2020. A fresh spurt in the number of cases will only add to people’s woes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/transport-sector-wheels-slow-down-in-wake-of-spurt-in-new-covid-cases/articleshow/81918384.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Tejashwi yadav writes to Speaker, blames CM for March 23 violence||PATNA: Leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has written to the assembly Speaker, Vijay Kumar Sinha, for the "dismissal of officials" involved in orchestrating the unprecedented police violence on opposition MLAs on the House premises on March 23. At the same time, Tejashwi has been insistent that the Nitish Kumar government has no right to continue in office for the "attack on the state assembly, considered the temple of democracy". In a letter to Sinha on April 3, calling him the "biggest protector of Constitution, democracy and the House members duly elected by people," Tejashwi said, "Dismiss the officials soon for converting the state assembly into Jallianwala Bagh." Tejashwi has also said the attack took place not just on the opposition MLAs, but also on the assembly, the "temple of democracy", despite the speaker being their "protector". On March 23, the only listed item was the passage of the Bihar Special Armed Police (BSAP) Bill, 2021, which was purported to rename the existing Bihar Military Police (BMP). Its Section 7, however, gave powers to the BSAP officials and personnel to arrest anyone on mere suspicion, which the opposition members considered was the grant of draconian power to the BSAP. Accordingly, they offered unprecedented resistance to the passage of the Bill during which the House was adjourned five times. The Bill was passed, only after the agitating opposition members were physically lifted away from the well of the House by the police requisitioned for the purpose, and the remaining opposition members walked out of the House. Earlier, they had sat on a dharna outside the chamber of the Speaker, blocking all the four doors. It was cleared not by the marshals, but by the police specially called in for the purpose. In between, the MLAs were pulled, pushed, shoved, beaten up, dragged and even thrown in the portico of the assembly building. In the letter addressed to Sinha, Tejashwi has seemingly also put the Nitish Kumar government in the dock. "When this government cannot protect the Constitution-provided democratic rights of protest of people, and instead, crushes them under the boots and shoes, it has no right to continue in office and at the seat of power." In the same vein, the letter puts the onus for the "shameful incident" on the government. "The use of violence and excessive force by the police was at the indication of the CM, who is also the state's home minister. The violence was done against the opposition members alone, sparing those from the treasury benches." Tejashwi’s letter referred to the injured opposition members who are under medical treatment at PMCH or private hospitals. Makhdumpur MLA Satish Kumar was still under treatment in the ICU ward of PMCH, while women members were manhandled in a manner not seen in the parliamentary democratic system, the letter has added. Reacting to Tejashwi’s letter, BJP’s spokesperson Nikhil Anand said, "Tejashwi’s letter to the speaker is an eyewash. He is trying to shift attention from the legislators who maligned the image of the assembly in its 100th year of foundation. The officials who will be found guilty of chaos within assembly premises must be punished but the legislators who went on to abuse the chair shouldn't be spared at any cost," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-writes-to-speaker-blames-cm-for-march-23-violence/articleshow/81918447.cms||Abhay Singh

Police said Pushkar alias Chhotu, whose name had figured in the murder case, surrendered due to mounting police pressure and intensive raids at his hideouts. He was later remanded in 14-day judicial custody. Earlier, two accused — Rituraj and Saurabh—were arrested. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said Saurabh was taken on 72-hour police remand for further interrogation. The investigating officer of the case has been asked to also take Pushkar on remand. “The interrogation of Saurabh and Pushkar will help the police reach a logical conclusion in the case,” Sharma said. Meanwhile, police have intensified raids to arrest the fourth accused. The prime accused, Rituraj, had revealed that Rupesh’s killing was a fallout of a road rage incident. A senior officer associated with the investigation said police would cross-examine the statement of Rituraj with that of Saurabh. “The police have clinching evidences against the accused,” he claimed. Meanwhile, the investigating officer has submitted a petition in the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Patna, seeking remand of a suspect, Pawan Kumar, who was earlier arrested by the Agamkuan police in an Arms Act case. On March 27, the ACJM-cum sub-judge IV Umesh Rai had turned down the bail petition of Rituraj, who is currently lodged in the Beur central jail. Rupesh was gunned down by motorbike-borne assailants outside his Punaichak apartment in his car on January 12. An FIR was lodged with Shastri Nagar police station against unidentified assailants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/indigo-manager-murder-case-accused-surrenders/articleshow/81918484.cms||Ramashankar

Also known as a skywalk, it has been attracting hundreds of visitors from Bihar and neighbouring states like Jharkhand and West Bengal since its inauguration. “The decision was taken in view of the fresh Covid safety guidelines issued by the government,” divisional forest officer Nefamani K told this newspaper on Monday. He, however, denied reports of police resorting to mild lathicharge for dispersing scores of visitors on Sunday. Nefamani added, “Only 15 people can stay on the skywalk at a time.” According to sources, the authorities have roped in only four buses that can carry 200 people to the Nature Safari from Son Bhandar at a time. Private vehicles are restricted beyond this limit. A local visitor from Biharsharif, Lallan Kumar, said, “The management should immediately add more buses and beef up security to cope with the rush of visitors amid the pandemic.” Apart from the 200-foot-high, 85-foot-long and 6-foot-wide glass bridge, the Nature Safari has a zip line, suspension bridge, archery range, wrestling zone, children’s park, cafeteria, butterfly garden, and night camp. Chief minister Nitish Kumar had inaugurated the safari on March 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/only-15-visitors-allowed-to-walk-on-glass-bridge-at-nature-safari/articleshow/81918426.cms||Farrukh Nadim
---||Business||5 appellate tribunals to be scrapped||MUMBAI: The government promulgated an ordinance on April 4 to dismantle five appellate tribunals, including Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB), which takes up disputes between companies on intellectual property, across fields of technology, engineering and pharmaceuticals. The Tribunal Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance 2021 scraps IPAB, among other tribunals, with effectively now high courts expected to take up disputes of patents, trademarks and geographical indications, while copyright matters will be heard in commercial courts. The move, which has come as a shock in legal circles, is possibly being done after the earlier plan of scrapping IPAB through the legislative route was strongly opposed, experts say, adding that it may lead to delays in settling cases. The proposed bill, which was introduced in February in the Lok Sabha, sought to dissolve certain existing appellate bodies and transfer their functions (such as adjudication of appeals) to other existing judicial bodies. Through the ordinance, the government plans to dismantle these appellate tribunals with the objective of streamlining them. The ordinance says “Any appeal, application or proceeding pending before the tribunal, appellate tribunal or other authorities specified in the schedule, other than those pending before the Authority for Advance Rulings under the Income-Tax Act, 1961, before the notified date, shall stand transferred to the court before which it would have been filed had this ordinance been in force on the date of filing of such appeal or application or initiation of the proceeding, and the court may proceed to deal with such cases from the stage at which it stood before such transfer, or from any earlier stage, or de novo, as the court may deem fit”. Opinion is divided on the proposed move, with certain IP experts saying it will burden the already over-stretched high courts. “The delays and pendency plaguing the IPAB have been mainly due to the long vacancies in the posts of its members due to the various legal challenges to the provisions concerning their appointment, or due to the delay in appointments. The transfer back to the high court may lead to additional burden on such courts, where their commercial division deals with varied commercial matters (not limited to intellectual property), and often do not have the requisite technical support (mainly in patents)”, a lawyer told TOI. However, there is a section which believes the abolishment of IPAB is well-reasoned. “The government has been struggling to find qualified persons for appointment to the IPAB. As a result it has gone for years without any appointment — this has caused severe backlogs. Secondly there have been complaints about the quality of adjudication because of the poor quality of appointments. Third, the IPAB is located only in two cities, which is simply not sufficient for a country like India where IP litigation takes place across the board,” T Prashant Reddy, an IP lawyer said. The Ordinance amends the Cinematograph Act, 1952, Customs Act, 1962, Airports Authority of India Act, 1994, Trade Marks Act, 1999 and Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Act, 2001, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/5-appellate-tribunals-to-be-scrapped/articleshow/81920752.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

Earlier in the day ANMI, a pan-India brokers’ association, had asked the government to exempt people working at broking houses from the state’s Covid curbs for smooth trading on the bourses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-rbi-regulated-entities-escape-curbs/articleshow/81920829.cms||---

The consumer electronics maker, whose smartphone business accounts for roughly 7% of its total revenue, said it will continue to provide service support and software updates for existing customers “for a period of time which will vary by region.” Details on layoffs and staff restructuring of the mobile business “will be determined at the local level,” LG said. A spokesperson for LG in India told TOI that existing customers should continue using their smartphones as it will continue providing warranties, software updates and support. “This decision allows us to apply the assets, knowledge and expertise gained over years toward other areas such as IoT,” the spokesperson added. In India, the market share of LGs smartphones has been stagnant at a miniscule 0.2% for a few years now. With a strong feature phone line-up prior to the smartphone era, LG was once touted as a key competition to Korean major Samsung. However, post 2010, LG’s products have been more tuned towards North America, Latin America and Korea, and the focus was not so much on India, analysts said. Talks of either a sale or closure of its smartphone business unit have been going on for almost a year. Despite the advantage of being vertically integrated, the company couldn’t lift the sales of its mobile devices. As a large electronics maker, LG had in-house access to displays ( LG display), camera ( LG innotek), LG chem ( batteries), among other components. “While they are quite good in terms of design language like a minimalistic design plus camera etc., the diffusion of features towards lower price point is what they couldn’t do. They had access to great technology and products but the go-to-market strategy and right portfolio is what seemed missing [in India],” Tarun Pathak, associate director, Counterpoint Research, said.“LG’s strong mobile R&D and innovation capabilities, especially its recent forays in reinventing the rectangular slab are laudable. Unfortunately for LG, its innovation prowess could not be translated into enduring market wins,” Prabhu Ram, head – industry intelligence, CMR India, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lg-exits-smartphone-biz-amid-stiff-competition/articleshow/81919423.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

A student of Simultala Awasiya Vidyalaya in Jamui, Shubhdarshini is a native of Korthu village in Ekangarsarai block of East Champaran district. She, however, is not sure if she will continue her studies in the same school or join some other institution. “After Class XII, I will, anyway, join a reputed medical institution,” Shubhdarshini told this reporter a few hours after the publication of her results on Monday. Science is Shubhdarshini’s favourite subject and she enjoys reading books on plants and human physiology. She also consults reference books and materials available on the internet. Thanking her parents, especially her father, Om Prakash Nirala, who is a schoolteacher, Shubhdarshini said, “They have always supported and encouraged me in my academic pursuits.” Her elder brother, Abhijit Subhash, who had secured the sixth position in the Intermediate exam organised by the BSEB earlier this year, is preparing for the IIT entrance test. Another topper, Pooja Kumari, who is also the daughter of a schoolteacher, Prabhu Sharan Thakur, gave full credit to her parents and teachers for her success. She too wishes to become a doctor. Pooja, a resident of Pipra village in East Champaran, loves science and mathematics. She said, “Sincerity and hard work always yield the desirable results, but one should take interest in extracurricular activities as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-matric-toppers-aspire-to-become-doctors/articleshow/81918504.cms||B K Mishra

STF officials said Shoaib was involved in killing of two doctors in Pratapgarh and Prayagraj. Deputy SP (STF) Navendu Kumar told TOI, “Shoaib was involved in killing Dr. AK Bansal in Prayagraj in 2017 and Dr Prabhat in Pratapgarh in 2015 earlier.” Shoaib and his gang had killed Dr. Prabhat near Chilbila railway crossing in 2015. He was also the prime accused in Chunmun Pandey murder case in 2015 when Shoaib and his accomplices had stopped a roadways bus in Pratapgarh and killed Pandey in front of all passengers. Shoaib also operated an ATM cloning racket with the help of two accomplices in many cities of UP in 2019. He also executed many bike loot cases in Pratapgarh, Amethi and Sultanpur districts, said police officials. While training to be sharpshooter, Shoaib and his aides used to target animals like rabbit and nilgai near Bhuliapur village forest and had fired several bullets to trace 1090 on a tree trunk. Kumar said they are also been probing the role of Shoaib in the murder of a marble trader in Pratapgarh. Besides, Shoaib’s gang was also involved in extortion.

---||Business||Sensex tanks 871 pts on lockdown, Covid surge||Mumbai: Weighed down by the negative impact of the lockdown in Maharashtra, the sensex tanked 871 points to close below the 49,200 level on Monday as financial stocks slid the most. In early trade, the sensex was down more than 1,300 points at 48,581 points, but recovered later to close at 49,159 — down 1.7% on the day. Lower-than-expected reading for PMI for March, an important gauge for manufacturing in the country, also affected investor sentiment, brokers said. According to analysts and economists, since Maharashtra is a major market for several products and houses a large number of manufacturing facilities, the lockdown in the state could affect sales and output of several companies. The lockdown could also impact the services industry and lead to a rise in bad loans for banks and NBFCs. As a result, ICICI Bank, HDFC and HDFC Bank witnessed strong selling on Monday with these three stocks together accounting for over 50% of the sensex’s loss. Of the 30 constituents, only five closed higher. According to HDFC Securities head (retail research) Deepak Jasani, rising Covid cases hit investor sentiment on Dalal Street on Monday. “India’s manufacturing activity hit a speed bump in March after being on the slow road to improvement over the previous few months due to the renewed escalation of the pandemic and subsequent restrictions played spoilsports for factory activity,” Jasani said in a post-market note. This week, two domestic factors are expected to weigh on market sentiment the most. According to Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra, investors would watch out for government actions to curb the surge. “Further, the upcoming RBI monetary policy would be actively tracked by investors. We expect the RBI to maintain its dovish stance and leave key rates unchanged,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-tanks-871-pts-on-lockdown-covid-surge/articleshow/81920639.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar workers heading home fearing lockdown||PATNA: With a spike in Covid cases and certain restrictions put in place, a large number of workers from Bihar are heading for their home towns again as they don’t want to undergo the mental trauma and agony they had to face about a year ago. Trains, buses and other modes of transport are packed to their capacity with the Bihari workers, who had gone to different states for jobs after the restrictions were eased by the central as well as the state governments. But, things have changed now. Mohammad Abdul Rasheed (48), who returned from Amritsar in Punjab, said, “Everybody working outside Bihar is getting apprehensive of the lockdown again to contain the virus spread. I am not alone. Thirty people from Muzaffarpur district have returned by this train.” Pawan Kumar Akela (55) of Sitamarhi district said he decided to return after a spike in Covid cases in Delhi. “I wanted to board a train for Patna ahead of Holi but could not get confirmed berth in any train. Finally I am leaving for Bairgania (ancestral home),” he said, while boarding a bus at Mithapur bus stand in Patna on Monday. Arif Raza (32), a migrant worker from Kursela in Katihar district, said he left Jaipur in Rajasthan when night curfew was imposed there by the district administration. “Who knows what will happen in the next few weeks. We don’t want to face the humiliation like the last year during the nationwide lockdown. Things are moving that way,” he said. Sahil Oran (42), a resident of Ujiarpur in Samastipur district, rushed to a shop for a bottle of drinking water when the bus carrying people from Delhi stopped at the border checkpost in Gopalganj district on Monday morning. “We are returning home before the situation turns for a worse,” Oraon told some local journalists. The migrant workers’ woes don’t end there. Those who had reached their respective villages ahead of Holi are least interested in returning to their workplace fearing lockdown. “I have dropped my plan to go back to work. Even the proprietors of the companies where we worked have suggested us to wait for some time. The situation is not conducive there,” said Rupesh Singh, an electrician, who worked for a real estate firm at Kalyan in Maharashtra. A senior state transport department official admitted that the airconditioned buses coming from Delhi, UP and other states are packed to their capacity and majority of them were migrant workers of the state. They worked in states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. State labour resources department minister Jibesh Kumar said the officials were alert and keeping an eye over the development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-workers-heading-home-fearing-lockdown/articleshow/81918403.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: After rough year, schools to increase teachers’ pay||KOLKATA: After a tough year of no increments, announcements about rollback of increment and pay cuts, schools have now decided to give teachers their due. Most schools have decided to give the increments that will become effective with their salaries from April itself while there are some that will offer increments from the next quarter, after they have hiked the tuition fees. However, retro effects will be given. The High Court had, last October, ruled that schools will not increase tuition fees for the 2020 academic session because of the pandemic. It had also ruled that schools would not offer increments to teachers for the year. Many schools had announced increments according to the sixth pay commission revisions, just before the pandemic shutdown happened, but had to roll back the decision citing the court order and the fact that tuition fees were held up by a large section of parents. “Thankfully, it seems we are through with the worst. We have decided to announce our increments for teachers and the calculations are getting done now, but we will revise salaries with effect from April,” said Aloke Tibrewal, chairman of DPS Ruby Park. La Martiniere schools have already announced their increments. Some schools run by the Church of North India had announced the implementation of sixth pay commission revisions from the 2020 financial year, but could not bring it on. In a recent meeting, Bishop Paritosh Canning, the head of the Kolkata diocese of the CNI, said the new pay commission revisions should be implemented now. “We are likely to give our increments to our teachers from July,” said John Ghosh, secretary of St Thomas Kidderpore. Some schools said that they have increased their tuition fees keeping in mind the increments that have to be given to teachers. Other schools, like Don Bosco Park Circus, said they will hike the tuition fees from the next quarter and then revise teachers’ salaries. “We have decided to go slower, looking at the fresh Covid situation,” said the principal, Father Bikash Mondal. But he agreed that teachers’ pay revision had become imperative. Both Heritage School and South Point School managements have decided on implementing the increments soon. They had announced the pay revisions to bring in the sixth pay commission salaries for teachers last year, but had to roll it back. “The finances were in the doldrums, apart from the court ruling. Finally, after 15 months, we are going to announce salary revisions,” said Krishna Damani, spokesperson for South Point School. In some schools, there will not be any immediate pay revision, but a certain percentage of pay cut had happened which is being restored. Teachers at St Augustine’s Day School, Kolkata, which has two branches, had a 20% salary cut after the first quarter, which is now being restored, said school head Richard Gasper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-rough-year-schools-to-increase-teachers-pay/articleshow/81919268.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Allahabad||Allahabad: STF cracks Dr Bansal murder case after 4 years, nabs shooter||PRAYAGRAJ: The Special Task Force (STF) of UP Police cracked the sensational murder of surgeon Dr Ashwani Kumar Bansal in Prayagraj after four years with the arrest of sharpshooter Mohd Shoaib, a resident of Azad Nagar, Pratapgarh district, from Deva road turn at Chinhat in Lucknow on Monday. STF also seized a pistol of 0.32 bore, five live cartridges, forged EPIC and PAN cards, fake DL, two mobiles and Rs 1,910 in cash from Shoaib, who was carrying Rs 50,000 cash reward. Dr Bansal, owner of Jeevan Jyoti Hospital, Prayagraj, was shot dead by two unidentified assailants on January 12, 2017 evening when he was examining patients in his chamber. A case was lodged at Kydganj police station under section 302 of IPC but police failed to make a breakthrough. Deputy SP (STF) Navendu Kumar told TOI, “Our team arrested hardened criminal Mohd Shoaib today following a specific tip off about his meeting someone near Deva road turn in Chinhat, Lucknow. He revealed the conspiracy to kill Dr Bansal was hatched in Naini Jail.” Shoaib is accused in several cases under Sections 307, 279, 337, 372, 338, 353, 332, 504, 506, and 427 of IPC and Section 2, 3 of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. During questioning, Shoaib revealed that after completing intermediate from KP Inter college, Pratapargh, he went to Kota, Rajasthan, for NEET coaching, but returned soon and formed a gang with Yashir, Javed alias Jabba and Maqsood alias Jaid. The gang had a tussle with one Chunmun Pandey and killed him in 2015 when he was travelling in a bus. Shoaib told STF sleuths that one Alok Sinha had given the contract to kill Dr Bansal and the plan was hatched in Naini Jail. Dr Bansal had given Rs 55 lakh for admission of his son to Sinha who cheated him. Dr Bansal had lodged an FIR against Sinha who was then arrested. Dr Bansal also pursued cases registered against Sinha in Sikkim, Rajasthan and Karnataka. After his arrest, Sinha was lodged in Naini Central jail where he was kept in B class barrack where he came in contact with notorious criminals like Dilip Mishra, Ashraf alias Akhtar Katra, Julfiqar alias Tota and Gulam. Sinha hatched the plan to eliminate Dr Banal and roped in Dilip Mishra and Ashraf alias Akhtar who agreed to his proposal. Ashraf then contacted Maqsood alias Jaid, Yashir and Shoiab through one Abrar Mulla and promised to pay Rs 15 lakh cash in advance and Rs 55 lakh after the killing. Mulla gave Rs 5 lakh cash, two pistols and a bike to them and told them to collect remaining Rs 10 lakh of advance after executing the murder. On January 12, 2017 evening, Maqsood drove the bike to Jeevan Jyoti Hospital and kept standing outside while Yashir and Shoaib entered the chamber of Dr Bansal and shot him dead. Later, Yashir and Maqsood fought over sharing the money, following which Shoaib and Maqsood killed Yashir at the behest of Mulla. Police arrested Maqsood but could not link Shoaib in Yashir’s killing. Later, Shoaib came to know that he and Yashir had been captured in the CCTV footage while fleeing from the hospital, and so he escaped to Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/stf-cracks-dr-bansal-murder-case-after-4-years-nabs-shooter/articleshow/81918254.cms||Kapil Dixit

Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of Ghansali PR Chauhan told TOI, "The case has been registered under section 304-A (causing death by negligence), 306 (abetment of suicide) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The incident allegedly shook three others in the group so much that they consumed pesticide and committed suicide. Rajiv Singh, the main accused has been absconding since Saturday night and a manhunt has been initiated to nab him. The rifle from which the bullet was fired is also believed to be with him. “Our teams are working round the clock to nab him,” said Chauhan. The youths had gone to hunt wild fowl in the Cholah Tok forest near their village on Saturday evening. Disaster struck the group when one of the youths, Santosh Panwar, 19, was hit by a bullet which was accidentally fired from a muzzle-loading rifle carried by Rajiv Singh. Seeing their friend dead, the other youths allegedly went into a state of panic, Chauhan had told TOI on Sunday, adding, “First, they brought back Santosh’s body from the jungle to a cowshed near the village. They were so stricken with grief and a sense of guilt over the incident that they decided to shoot themselves as well but then changed their plan. Three of them —Arjun Singh, 23, Pankaj Singh, 24, and Soban Singh, 23, consumed pesticide. They were taken to the nearby community health centre, where they were declared brought dead.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hunting-trip-gone-wrong-revenue-police-registers-case-of-death-by-negligence-main-accused-still-missing/articleshow/81918639.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Why is CM silent? He’s lost moral authority to govern, says BJP||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Even as Anil Deshmukh resigned after a CBI probe order, BJP on Monday went after CM Uddhav Thackeray, questioning his silence on the issue and claiming he had lost the moral authority to govern as there’s a whiff of a larger conspiracy with involvement of the state machinery. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has forfeited the moral authority to govern. Democracy is run by standards of probity and propriety,” said Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad at the BJP headquarters in the capital. “The consistent conspicuous silence of Uddhav Thackeray is by itself raising a lot of questions,” he added. Citing the resignation of Deshmukh on “moral grounds”, he said: “When will the morality of the CM arise?” In Mumbai, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said: “It is shocking the CM continues to remain quiet…The chief minister’s last reaction was: ‘Is Waze (Osama bin) Laden?’ To save his government, the chief minister has been making all kinds of compromises... The chief minister must admit to the people that a mistake has been made.” He added: “We expect the CBI inquiry will expose and stop the ‘maha vasooli’ ways of this MVA government.” He alleged that the police were being used as a private force for extortion by the government. BJP did not waste the opportunity to take a dig at senior politician Sharad Pawar, who had given a clean chit to Deshmukh after allegations against him by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. “After such serious allegations were made and the (former head of state intelligence) Rashmi Shukla’s report was exposed, NCP and its chief Sharad Pawar should have insisted on Deshmukh’s immediate resignation. For this, we had to wait for the high court order,” said Fadnavis. “Sharad Pawar is a senior leader. He has been Maharashtra CM… has been defence minister and was a senior cabinet minister under Manmohan Singh for 10 years. He should have realised the implications of the whole case and should not have given a clean chit to Deshmukh,” said Prasad. Referring to Param Bir’s allegation that Deshmukh had fixed a target of Rs 100 crore through suspended cop Sachin Waze, Prasad asked: “If this was the target of one minister in Mumbai, what was the target of other ministers for the entire state?” He wondered if Deshmukh was allegedly extorting money for himself, his party NCP or the state government. “Surely there may be many linkages. We expect all the linkages of this shameful conduct of corruption to be investigated properly. We believe all this chain points to a conspiracy of loot in which Waze is a common factor. Who was giving patronage to whom, who was shielding whom? All aspects should be probed,” he said. Waze is being investigated for the planting of explosives outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home and the suspected murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-why-is-cm-silent-hes-lost-moral-authority-to-govern-says-bjp/articleshow/81920478.cms||---
---||Delhi||Compensation for Amrapali flat delay? SC to examine||NEW DELHI: As many flats have so far been constructed in Amrapali's various housing projects under the supervision of the Supreme Court and are ready to be handed over, the court on Monday agreed to examine the demand of home-buyers for compensation for delay in getting possession.  The court, however, made it clear that no compensation would be considered for the period after it took over the management of the real estate firm in 2019 and appointed receiver to finish the pending projects. A bench of Justices U U Lalit and Ashok Bhushan sought assistance from advocate M L Lahoty, appearing for some of the home-buyers, to decide the issue. The court asked him to file a response by April 19. The court passed the order after SC-appointed receiver and senior advocate R Venkataramani told the bench that home-buyers who are yet to clear all the dues are asking for compensation for delay in getting possession. “In the course of verification of home-buyers belonging to Zodiac, Silicon City and Eden Park, an issue has been raised that while considering the amount recoverable from or payable by home-buyers, delay possession compensation be allowed as an adjustment,” he told the bench. The receiver, however, said a substantial amount will have to paid to homebuyers if the compensation is allowed. The compensation amount for delay could be very substantial as in some cases the delay period has been more than a decade. The court said it will examine the issue and posted hearing for April 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/compensation-for-amrapali-flat-delay-sc-to-examine/articleshow/81920513.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Shot in the arm can ease your tax burden too||NEW DELHI: Opt for Covid-19 vaccination if you live in north Delhi and your municipal corporation could give you a 5% rebate on the annual property tax.  North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said on Monday that if all the eligible members of a household got inoculated, it would be allowed the rebate over and above other rebates being offered for amnesty and early filing of property taxes. “I have directed the department concerned to prepare a detailed policy in this regard. It should be approved shortly,” the mayor said. There are around 10 lakh households registered under the unique property identification system in the six zones of the north corporation. Around 4.23 lakh housing units paid property tax in 2020-21. The municipal corporation officials say that the vaccination incentive could also help widen the tax net. The mayor said that family members meeting the central government norms would have to show vaccination proof to avail the rebate. The municipal corporation already provides 15% tax rebate for filing of property tax returns before June. “Residents can therefore avail a total tax rebate of 20% if the family gets vaccinated and files taxes early,” Jai Prakash explained. A similar measure is also under consideration in SDMC, according to leader of the House Narendra Chawla. The north corporation has vaccination centres at 44 dispensaries and four hospitals, where 66,195 people had been vaccinated so far. Data from the civic body till Sunday shows that 7,668 people received the jab at Hindu Rao Hospital, 3,088 in Kasturba Hospital, 3,709 in Girdharilal Hospital, 4,568 in Balak Ram Hospital, and 42,643 in the various dispensaries and mother & child welfare centres. All the three corporations managed to increase their property tax collection in 2020-21 compared with the preceding year despite the pandemic affecting revenues. The north mayor disclosed that the civic body collected Rs 645 crore, which is almost 100 crore more than the last fiscal’s collection of Rs 548 crore. The number of taxpayers also increased under the north body, with 4.2 lakh people paying tax in 2020-21 against 4.18 last year. Jai Prakash revealed that around 48,000 taxpayers have availed the amnesty scheme, which was launched this January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shot-in-the-arm-can-ease-your-tax-burden-too/articleshow/81920511.cms||Paras Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: BJP rebel Laduram Pitaliya says he did not write to CM, meets Satish Poonia||JAIPUR: BJP leader Laduram Pitaliya, who had withdrawn his nomination as an independent candidate from Sahara assembly seat under alleged pressure from party leaders, was seen with BJP state president Satish Poonia on Monday. Pitaliya, who was away from the public since he withdrew his nomination on April 2, reached Poonia’s residence with his family and supporters and assured full support to BJP candidate Ratanlal Jat. Pitaliya withdrew his nomination four days after he allegedly shot a letter to CM Ashok Gehlot seeking security cover and thus courting a major political controversy. In an official release by the BJP, the party denied writing any letter to the CM. “The alleged letter is a conspiracy by the Congress,” reads the statement. Sources said Pitaliya arrived in Jaipur on Monday morning to put an end to the controversy that BJP leaders including a minister in the Karnataka government threatened him of targeting his garment businesses in Bengaluru if he did not withdraw his nomination. He was expected to be in Jaipur on April 2 to clear his stand before the media and party leaders, but arrived on Monday. The delay had given the opposition time to level allegations against the party for engaging in dirty tactics for winning polls. Cabinet minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas had called a press conference to accuse BJP central leaders of engaging in dirty practices ahead of the polls. Refuting the allegations of Congress, Poonia said Pitaliya had withdrawn his candidature by his own will. “Like most of the leaders, he wanted to contest the polls and his name was considered till the last before our leaders had shown its faith on Ratanlal Jat. The party has assured Pitaliya of due respect and position in the party which he deserves,” said Poonia, who said he would be seen in the constituency seeking votes for our candidates. Pitaliya had secured 30,000 votes as a BJP rebel candidate in the 2018 assembly elections leading to the defeat of BJP candidate to Congress by 7,000 votes. His candidature posed a major threat for the BJP which eventually succeeded in averting it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-rebel-pitaliya-says-he-did-not-write-to-cm-meets-poonia/articleshow/81920491.cms||---

While the chopper deployed to douse flames in Garhwal was able to sprinkle water on forests of Tehri district in two rounds, the other one assigned to Kumaon failed to take off due to low visibility and hostile weather. According to IAF officials, a team of 10 pilots and co-pilots have been deployed to assist the Uttarakhand government in dousing forest fires. The officials also confirmed that the state can keep the choppers till they need it. According to divisional forest officer (DFO) of Narendra Nagar DS Meena, the chopper for Garhwal landed at 8:30 am and after filling its 5,000-litre bambi bucket with water from Tehri lake twice, sprinkled 10,000 lire water over Adwani and Khola forest ranges in Kirtinagar in two sorties. Boating was put on halt on Tehri Lake to facilitate smooth functioning of firefighting efforts. “The fires were mitigated at Adwani and Khola. The operation was stopped midway in the afternoon due to high turbulence,” Meena added. After midday, high wind velocity started swaying the chopper when it dropped its bambi bucket. After that, poor visibility due to smoke, rain prediction and cloudy weather did not let the chopper take off. The operation will continue on Tuesday, when the choppers will douse fires in the forests of Thauldhar block. In Kumaon, the choppers could not take off at all. “From Pantnagar base, the chopper could not take off due to poor visibility. Pilots were able to see till 600 metres, while visibility till at least 1,000 is required for a chopper to fly. The operation will start again at 8am on Tuesday,” said head of forest forces (HoFF) Rajeev Bhartari. Forest department employees said they were relieved at the arrival of the choppers. DFO Meena said that it had boosted the morale of workers who are tackling wildfires on a war footing. There have already been 1,200 wildfires till now, with around 85 fresh incidents in the last 24 hours. According to official figures, four persons and seven animals have been killed till now. The state had requested the Centre for helicopters to be pressed into service to douse growing wildfires. On Sunday, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat had reached out to union home minister Amit Shah and called an emergency meeting of officials over the issue. Pauri has so far been the worst affected district, along with Almora, Pithoragarh and Tehri.

Police said that the man was in debt and he had been blackmailing the woman to pay his debt off. The accused has been identified as Shubham Sharma, a resident of Old Delhi. Three mobile phones, four SIM cards and a pen drive used in the crime have been recovered from him. The crime came to fore when a complaint was received from a woman at Seemapuri police station alleging that someone was using her private videos and photos to blackmail her. “She said that she had already paid Rs 15,000 to that stalker. She also alleged that the blackmailer had hacked her Facebook ID,” said a senior police officer. “Multiple teams were set up and efforts to collect his details from Facebook were made. As per the details shared by Facebook, an IP address of Vodafone came into our notice, but the mobile number was registered on fake ID. When the blackmailer again demanded Rs 15,000 from the complainant through virtual number, our cyber cell analysed the mobile number and her ex-boyfriend Shubham Sharma came under suspicion. He was arrested after the probe,” the officer said. Sharma told police that when he and the complainant had a break up, he started chatting with the woman and blackmailing her using a virtual number. “He hacked her Facebook ID and downloaded her private videos. He then threatened her that if she did not pay him, he will upload the videos on the internet,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/23-yr-old-extorts-former-girlfriend-to-pay-off-debt/articleshow/81939201.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Behror police solve murder of school clerk; wife & cousin held||ALWAR: Bheror Police have solved the mystery behind the murder of clerk Krishna Kumar by arresting his wife Kusumlata, deceased’s cousin Sunny Yadav, Ashok Kumar and Pawan Meghwal on Monday. Ram Moorthy Joshy, SP Bhiwadi, told TOI that the deceased was a clerk in the Haripal Yadav School, Behror. “Kumar’s wife lives with their two children in village Bhugarka. His wife had an affair with Yadav. The deceased had an inkling about it due to which he disliked his cousin Sunny Yadav. Kusumlata and Sunny then decided to kill Kumar and hired shooters,” said Joshy. Yadav hired two shooters to kill Kumar while he was on his way to the school. “Kusumlata paid Rs 4 lakh to the shooters who purchased an SUV to kill Kumar. For weeks the shooters did a recce but were not successful in killing Kumar,” said the police. On that fateful day, the shooters hit Kumar who was on his way to the school on his bike. He died in the hospital and the entire episode looked like an accident. Kusumlata and Yadav were under the scanner as police had been tipped off about their relationship. “The technical evidence pointed out that both were in regular touch with each other on Whatsapp call. A probe also revealed that Kumar had a tiff with Yadav,” said the police. The technical evidence proved the role of Ashok and Pawan who were hired by the wife and Yadav. “The shooters’ arrest was enough to frame Kusumlata and Yadav. They were arrested. Now we are trying to figure out who else was involved in this conspiracy,” said the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/behror-police-solve-murder-of-school-clerk-wife-cousin-held/articleshow/81920476.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Over 1,000 renunciates perform rituals to be ordained as Naga sadhus at Haridwar Maha Kumbh||Haridwar: In a mass ceremony held at the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela on Monday, around 1,000 renunciates from across the country performed the rituals to be inducted into the order of Naga sadhus of the Juna akhada, the country’s largest Naga sadhu akhada. The sanyasis were in the age bracket of 5 to 60 years. The rituals started in the early morning hours. Amidst chants of “Om Namah Shivay”, the sanyasis got their heads tonsured at the Birla Ghat near Har-ki-Pauri. This was followed by 17 rounds of pind-daan (an after-death ritual) offered by the renunciates— 16 for their forefathers and the last one for themselves. Providing further details, Mahant Mahesh Puri, head of Kumbh Mela for Juna akhada, said, “The Acharya Mahamandaleshwar of the Juna akhada will impart deeksha to each sanyasi on Tuesday after which they will be officially declared Naga sadhus. These Nagas have five gurus – called the Punj gurus. As part of the ritual, the Naga sadhus walk seven steps along with their gurus after taking a dip in the Ganga during the deeksha process.” Gopal Rawat, PRO for Juna akhada, added, “The Naga sadhus who are ordained at Haridwar Kumbh are known as Barfani Naga - mainly because their ordination area falls under the Himalayas. The new Naga sadhus will take the holy dip in the Ganga on the occasion of Somwati Amavasya on April 12 when the shahi snan (royal procession of akhadas) will happen.” He added that “prior to taking deeksha, the sanyasis under the guidance of their gurus, recite chants for a few hours.” “Then their heads are shaved, ash is applied to their bodies and they detach themselves from the world. After a ceremony called Vijay Hawan, which is held overnight, they again take a dip in the Ganga and seek blessing from their gurus and are thereafter imparted deeksha.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-1000-renunciates-perform-rituals-to-be-ordained-as-naga-sadhus-at-haridwar-maha-kumbh/articleshow/81918676.cms||Kautilya Singh

Many housing societies have put restrictions on their playing in open areas. Clubs and recreation rooms too have been locked up. In Powai, many complexes have barred them from playing in the compound. Common areas having table tennis, carrom boards and reading areas have been shut. At a housing complex in Malad East, a notice issued by the society said there was a steep rise in children and teenagers getting infected (five teenagers reportedly tested positive on April 3). “It is an earnest request to parents to refrain their children from sports or games like soccer involving frequent close contact...,” read the notice. In March, the count of children and adolescents affected in the second wave rose significantly as against the first. Data from the state authority shows over 15,000 children below 10 are among the over 6 lakh infected in the state in March. That number balloons to over 55,000 when clubbed with adolescents (11-20 years) bracket. Together, they account for 10% of total cases. Young adults (21-30 years) contributed to 17% cases or over 1 lakh infections.  Data from the Medical Education department shows roughly 2,000 infections in January and 2,700 in February, Covid cases jumped to nearly 15,500 in March in those under 10. Similarly, for the age-group of 11-20, infections rose from nearly 5,300 and 8,000 in January and February respectively to over 40,000 in March. Since last year, over 87,000 children below 10 and 1.82 lakh between 11-20 years have been hit by Covid19 in the state. At Trikutta Towers, another society, off Adi Shankaracharya Marg, a notice was put out on Sunday asking residents to not use the society premises to play in the garden or taking a walk. A resident of a Sion building said, “Our society hasn’t issued any notice, but parents are not sending children down. About two weeks ago, three tested positive and all mothers decided to keep them at home for now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kids-locked-in-as-bldgs-ask-them-to-stop-playing-games-in-mumbai/articleshow/81921617.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Dehradun||Dehradun: Lt Colonel gets 10-year rigorous imprisonment in bribery case||DEHRADUN: A special court of CBI in Dehradun on Monday convicted a serving Army Lt Colonel and an assistant garrison engineer-rank official in a five-year-old bribery case and sentenced them to 10 years and 5 years of rigorous imprisonment respectively. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 55,000 on the Lt Colonel and Rs 15,000 on the other official. The Army officer, Lt Colonel Bharat Joshi, who was then posted in Instruments Research and Development Establishment (IRDE) in Dehradun as garrison engineer was arrested by CBI on July 8, 2016 while taking bribe from a private contractor. His deputy, Manish Singh who was then serving as assistant garrison engineer, was also arrested by CBI sleuths for forcing the complainant to pay the bribe, according to the prosecution lawyer Satish Kumar. Before pronouncing the quantum of punishment, the court of special CBI judge Sujata Singh on Monday convicted Joshi under sections 7 and 13 of Prevention of Corruption Act along with section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). Singh has been convicted under section 120-B of IPC and section 12 of Prevention of Corruption Act. Providing further details of the matter, prosecution lawyer Kumar said, “Lt Colonel Bharat Joshi who was then serving as garrison engineer in Military Engineering Services (MES) had demanded a bribe of Rs 38,000 from a private contractor for clearing his bills. His deputy Manish Singh was forcing the complainant to give the bribe amount in one go.” The contractor from whom the bribe was asked, approached the CBI stating that Lt Colonel Joshi had demanded Rs 38,000 at a rate of 1.5% of total contract amount and 2% of the bill for issuing the completion certificate. The contractor had got a contract for constructing two-storey residential buildings in the IRDE campus. The contractor paid Rs 10,000 as first installment of the bribe to Joshi on July 4, 2016 and made the entry in his personal diary. He also recorded the conversation between him and Joshi on an SD card and submitted the same to CBI. On the basis of the complaint made by the contractor, CBI registered a case and caught the Lt Colonel red-handed while accepting the second installment of the bribe of Rs 10,000 from the complainant, Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/lt-colonel-sentenced-to-10-yrs-rigorous-imprisonment-by-cbi-court-in-5-yr-old-bribery-case/articleshow/81918665.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Goa||Ramzan may delay start of ACL games in Goa||Panaji: Several teams have asked the organisers to delay kick off for group E games of the AFC Champions League in Goa later this month. Except FC Goa, all other teams have told the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) that 5pm kick off would not be possible since the players would be fasting during the holy Muslim month of Ramzan. All other teams in group E – Persepolis (Iran), Al-Rayyan (Qatar), Al-Wahda (UAE)/Al-Zawraa (Iraq) – are from Islamic countries. During Ramzan, devout Muslims refrain from all food and drink during daylight hours. The AFC had earlier scheduled two matches a day at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda with the first match kicking off at 5pm and second at 8.30pm. However, that will now change with matches likely to start at 8pm and 10.30pm. “If the players fast throughout the day, it would not be possible for them to take the field at 5pm,” a source told TOI on Tuesday. “The match timings are almost certain to change. Alternatives are being worked out. A 10.30pm start for a football game in Goa is unheard of, but the organisers may not have any choice.” FC Goa are hoping most, if not all, of their games are scheduled for an 8pm start. “Our players are not used to such late starts. Our entire schedule will be affected,” said one official. A final decision is expected within the next 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ramzan-may-delay-start-of-acl-games-in-goa/articleshow/81938240.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

As per the government records, 1,174 couples got married under the mass marriage scheme in Gorakhpur during the past three years. According to the Gorakhpur district officials, as many as 81 mass marriages have been performed in the financial year 2017-18, 671 in 2019-20 and 622 in 2020-21. In total, 1,174 couples have tied the knot in the district. As part of the mass wedding scheme, a financial assistance of Rs 51,000 is given to each couple. Mass marriages under Samuhik Vivah Yojna are organised by the state government led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for economically-weaker sections of the society. Ram Pyare of Jagdishpur Bhaluan under Vikas Khand Kaudiram says, “When my daughter Neelam reached the age of marriage, I became worried as I have no permanent income source and arranging a wedding ceremony was really difficult for me. I tried to take out loans from various sources including my close relatives but they refused me due to my financial condition. A friend of mine suggested me about mass marriage after which I applied for the same at block level. Now my daughter is happily married without leaving me in the trap of loan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/1174-mass-marriages-performed-in-past-3-years-in-gorakhpur/articleshow/81919859.cms||---

Pitaliya is among the 90 persons who have been served the notice by the chief medical and health officer office for flouting Covid protocol of not presenting a negative RT-PCR report.CMHO Dr Mustaq Khan told TOI that the notices of self-quarantine have been served to those who arrived from outside the state. “On the basis of inputs, it has come to the light that Pitaliya and 89 others entered the state from outside but did not produce a negative RT-PCR report. If these 90 persons have any objections, they can report to the authorities and if they fail to prove that they have not been outside, they have to serve the self-quarantine period,” said Khan. Interestingly, the notice was served to Pitaliya at a time he is in Jaipur meeting BJP state president Satish Poonia assuring him of campaigning for the party’s candidate in Sahara. He filed his nomination on March 30 and was in Jaipur on March 24-25. BJP has seen it as a politically motivated move. Poonia asked CM Ashok Gehlot, Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra and Tonk MLA Sachin Pilot of presenting the RT-PCR tests since they have been travelling to poll-bound states. “What about Congress leader Ajay Maken who travelled to all three-assembly segment from Delhi.

---||Mumbai||Chapter is ‘not closed’: Bombay HC order takes NCP by surprise||MUMBAI: Anil Deshmukh on Monday became the second minister of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, in power for one year and four months, to quit in the wake of a controversy. His resignation, the first in the ‘Wazegate’ controversy, comes a little over a month after Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Rathod quit as forest minister following a scandal over the suicide of a 22-year-old woman in Pune. Accompanied by deputy CM Ajit Pawar, Deshmukh first called on NCP president Sharad Pawar on Monday to brief him on the outcome of the public interest litigation filed by Singh before the HC. Pawar quickly approved Deshmukh’s plea to resign from the cabinet “on moral grounds”. Deshmukh is counted among the trusted aides of Sharad Pawar but had been at the receiving end for inept handling of the Waze episode. In a brief letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray, Deshmukh said since the HC had directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary probe against him, he did not think it fit to continue in the cabinet on moral grounds. “While disposing of a petition filed by Jayashree Patil, the High Court has asked the CBI director to conduct a preliminary probe against me. Under such circumstances, on moral grounds, I feel I should quit. I am quitting on my own, please relieve from my post of home minister,” Deshmukh stated in the letter. Deshmukh’s resignation was later accepted by governor B S Koshyari. The NCP was apparently taken by surprise when the HC asked the CBI to conduct a preliminary probe in the matter. All along, the NCP had expected that since the SC had declined to step in and the state government had set up a one-man high-level committee of Justice Kailash Uttamchand Chandiwal to probe into the charges of corruption raised in Singh’s letter, the chapter would be a closed one. In his letter to the CM, Singh had, apart from mentioning his own unceremonious exit from the CP’s post, raised two key issues: the “target” allegedly given by Deshmukh to Waze, and the alleged pressure exerted by the home minister on Mumbai police to register an abetment to suicide case in the death of Dadra Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha MP Mohan Delkar. Singh had also written that he had briefed NCP president Sharad Pawar, CM Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar about the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/chapter-is-not-closed-bombay-hc-order-takes-ncp-by-surprise/articleshow/81920588.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Allahabad||Rlys approves Rs 80 hike in feefor medical help onboard train||Revised Prayagraj: Train passengers who need medical help or emergency consultation during the journey will now have to shell out extra Rs 80 for the service. Earlier, the Railways used to charge Rs 20 as a consultation fee from passengers who wanted medical attention during the journey. However, to avail of the service, the passenger would now be charged Rs 100 as the consultation fee of the doctor attending a patient. In addition to this, the patient would also be charged for the medicines. A doctor or a medical team, depending upon the severity of the case, will attend to the patient at the next en-route station. The hike in the consultation fee follows the directives of the Railway Board wherein this all-important decision was taken after a proposal submitted by North Central Railways (NCR) to the board. In the last financial year (2020-21), zonal railways of NCR reported 2,465 cases wherein train passengers had requested medical attention and the same was provided by the railway authorities at the next station en route of the train concerned. “If a train passenger needs medical attention onboard train, he or she has to inform that train ticket examiner (TTE) who will, in turn, inform the control room and the train would be stopped at the next station, irrespective of the fact whether the station is under the scheduled stop of the train or not,” said chief public relation officer (CPRO), NCR, Ajeet Kumar Singh. Earlier, IR used to realise an amount of Rs 20 from the passenger availing the service, which has now been increased to Rs 100, he added. The official added that this is just a token amount as compared to what the Railways spend in attending to these medical emergency calls. Sources said the decision to increase in consultation fee has been taken because there were a lot of cases wherein the passengers were seeking medical help for pity ailments too, which could have been otherwise avoided. For attending to these calls, not only the doctor and the supporting staff has to be pressed into service, but the train is also halted depending on the seriousness of the case. “The fee increase has been made with the idea that this may act as a deterrent for people who take things lightly and ask for medical help even for avoidable issues which otherwise do not come under ‘emergency’ category,” said a senior official of NCR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/rlys-approves-rs-80-hike-in-feefor-medical-help-onboard-train/articleshow/81918273.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘We are equipped to deal with graft’||Ahmedabad: Former Gujarat DGP Shabbir Hussain Shekhadam Khandwawala, who has been appointed as the head of Anti-Corruption Unit of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), said that “informants in teams (of IPL) will help in preventing corruption in the tournament”. The 1973-batch IPS officer, who was appointed DGP Gujarat in 2010, was given the new responsibility from April 1. On his association with cricket, Khandwawala, 70, said that he had organized cricket tournaments when he was Surendranagar SP, and later when he was DCP in Ahmedabad in 1988-89. “I was crazy about cricket since my childhood and started various cricket tournaments for Gujarat police which has become a regular feature now. I later started inter-services tournaments in which teams of police, customs, income tax and other central agencies participated with IAS and IPS officers playing in the tournament. That way, I was very well connected with cricket. That was my inclination for sports, especially for cricket,” he said. But he stressed on the fact that the new responsibility is less about cricket and more about anti-corruption. “In police department, I had also worked in anti-corruption department for five to six years. The new responsibility will be different but basic issues are the same. I am going to stop all types of gambling, betting and match-fixing activities taking place in cricket. This is our (BCCI) main intention. We are well equipped to deal with it. A lot of good work has been done by my predecessor (former Rajasthan DGP Ajit Singh),” he said. On a query about mechanism to curb corruption in the IPL, he said, “We have security liaison officer, we have team integrity officer, we have relationships with the team managements and we also have some informants within the teams.” “We would not like to tell you about them (informants). But they will help us. If anything wrong happens in the team, we will come to know about it. But no system could be 100 per cent foolproof. It is always a tussle of talents (between law- breakers and law-enforcement agencies). We will try our level best. It will be a challenge; we cannot be happy by detecting or preventing one incident. It will be a continuous struggle,” he said. He listed two priorities — to detect and to prevent corruption. “New players coming into the scene are most vulnerable. We need to protect them. They unknowingly pass on the information and get exploited (by bookies),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/we-are-equipped-to-deal-with-graft/articleshow/81920577.cms||Ashish Chauhan

The 23 Vantangia villages were declared revenue villages by the Yogi Adityanath government on January 1, 2018. CM Yogi has been celebrating Diwali with Vantangias in Gorakhpur for more than two decades. Maharajganj’s Vantangia people came into limelight last year on December 25, when PM Narendra Modi had virtual interaction with Ram Gulab, director of an FPO ‘Maharajganj Vegetable Producing Company’ for setting an example of contract farming. The farmers of Vantangia villages in Maharajganj had signed an MoU with an Ahmedabad-based company for the purchase of golden sweet potato. “Around 99 years before Independence, the British Government started using people for cleaning forests, these people were called Tangia farmers. Tangia farmers were allowed to do farming on nine foot land between the rows of forest trees. They were not allowed to grow crops of their choice as it was decided by forest authorities so that the crop doesn’t harm the trees around and doesn’t degrade the fertility of soil. The farmers didn’t have any ownership right on the land and they had right only on the crop. Vantangias were totally dependent on forest for their livelihood. Due to negligence of previous governments, the Vantangias remained deprived of basic amenities and even 70 years after Independence,” said Sandeep Rai, a research scholar of DDU Gorakhpur University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/23-vantangia-villages-to-witness-panchayat-polls-for-the-first-time/articleshow/81919823.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

At this waste bank, one can bring waste plastic bottles or other waste materials to exchange them with money. The collected plastic waste is then sent for recycling. The plastic waste bank is being run on public-private engagement (PPE) model by KGN company in Maldahiya locality under the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). According to the municipal commissioner Gaurang Rathi, a plant of 10 MT capacity has been established in Ashapur area, and about 150 ‘safai mitras’ are engaged in plastic waste management. Though there is a ban on the use of polythene in the city, the tetra packs and water bottles are in use, which are disposed here for recycling. KGN Director Sabir Ali said that nearly two tons of plastic waste is generated every day in the city. The plastic waste is collected by the volunteers of the bank. The people also deposit the plastic waste. This bank involves transactions through plastic waste. If the quantity is less, then an individual is given a cloth bag or face mask in lieu of that plastic waste. On bringing a larger quantity of plastic waste, money is given to the people depending on weight of the waste. Ali said, the used drinking water bottles are purchased at the rate of Rs 25 per kg while plastic buckets, cans, mugs are purchased at Rs 10 per kg. The bank also takes waste like cardboard for recycling. The plastic waste collected in this bank is deposited at the Ashapur plant, where the plastic waste is separated. The polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles are pressed with a hydraulic machine and collected in the form of bundles which are sent to other places for further processing and recycling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bring-plastic-to-this-bank-take-money/articleshow/81919872.cms||---

---||Mumbai||30 central teams to fan out to worst-hit Maharashtra districts||MUMBAI: Thirty central teams will rush to review Covid care and management in 30 of Maharashtra’s districts worst hit by the pandemic’s second wave. The decision comes a day after Maharashtra, including capital Mumbai, witnessed its highest-ever single-day tally of Covid cases to 57,074 and 11,206, respectively.  Monday’s updates, though, show case detections dipped by 17% and 12% in Maharashtra and Mumbai, respectively, mainly because fewer tests were conducted. While 47,288 cases were detected out of the 1.75 lakh tests performed in Maharashtra on Sunday (results given out on Monday), the tally in Mumbai was 9,857 from 36,878 tests. A day prior to it, the state had carried out 1.97 lakh tests, including 51,319 in Mumbai. According to the central government’s communication, the high caseload and continued mortality prompted the Centre to send out 50 teams immediately to Maharashtra (30 teams), Punjab (nine) and Chattisgarh (11). Each of these 30 teams, comprising a clinician or an epidemiologist and a public health expert, will “assist state health department and local authorities on Covid-19 surveillance, control and containment measures”. The teams will also review enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour, availability of hospital beds and oxygen and logistics, including ambulances. The nodal officer for Maharashtra’s teams is Kunak Kumar, who is the joint secretary from the union ministry of housing and urban affairs. Along with daily detections, the number of deaths, too, registered a dip on Monday’s charts with 155 fatalities in Maharashtra (including 21 in Mumbai). “The next 10 to 14 days are crucial for Mumbai and Maharashtra. It will be a test of our patience and skills,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, an intensivist with Fortis Hospital and a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19. As the caseload increases, the case fatality rate may seem low. “But in absolute numbers, the deaths are rising,” he said. BMC’s additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the main problem in Mumbai is people’s preference for private hospital beds. “It is not always possible to get a private bed as they are limited in numbers. People should seek help from physicians at the earliest, instead of waiting for a bed in their known private hospitals,” Kanaki said. Kakani added the BMC is constantly increasing the number of beds available at its facilities. “We have increased the number of beds at the BKC jumbo centre from 1,000 to 2,000. At present, 600 beds are vacant there,” he said. Meanwhile, Thane city recorded the highest volume of daily positive patients on Monday with 1,580 new cases and five deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/30-central-teams-to-fan-out-to-worst-hit-maharashtra-districts/articleshow/81919589.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Hyderabad||Vax centres run out of Covaxin in Hyderabad; 2 jabs safe: Doctors||HYDERABAD: Desi Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin seems to be running out of stock in its own backyard – Hyderabad. Most vaccination centres in the city, be they government or private, don’t have stock. The reason: A sudden spike in demand for the indigenously developed vaccine. Such has been the surge in demand for the vaccine that many of those waiting in queues for a Covaxin shot, have had to return home without getting the jab, especially after the vaccination drive was opened up to everyone over 45 years of age. Right from making frantic calls to hospitals and friends in right places to reaching out to contacts through social media, people are leaving no stone unturned to get their hands on Covaxin. There are some who have even deferred their vaccination plans till Covaxin is available. “We are seeing many people walking in and demanding Covaxin, but we have no stocks. Only some stocks for the second dose have been kept. It will be available again only when it is supplied by the government,” a senior corporate hospital representative said when asked about Covaxin availability. The handful of vaccination centres still having stocks were also not giving a choice to beneficiaries and were administering the vaccine as per the automatic allocation by CoWin. The shortage has also left those, who have already been administered the first dose of Covaxin, a worried lot with many calling up their vaccination centres to check on the availability of their second dose. “My neighbour had gone to the same vaccination centre, where I took my first dose of Covaxin, for his first shot but was told that Covaxin is out of stock. My second dose is due next week. When I called them, they said they will inform me later. I am worried since we cannot mix vaccines. If they do not have supplies next week, will that mean that my first dose will go waste?” wondered a worried Moin Khan. So, what is the reason for the shortage? For one, supply of Covaxin has been limited. Of the total supply of 25 lakh doses received by the state from the Centre so far, it has received only 4.5 lakh doses of Covaxin. The remaining 20.5 lakh doses the state was allocated are that of Covishield, the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine. Queries sent to Covaxin’s developer Bharat Biotech on its current manufacturing capacities and the quantum of doses it has supplied to the Centre went unanswered. However, state health authorities and experts said that both the vaccines -- Covaxin and Covishield -- are equally potent. State health authorities advised people not to panic and take whichever vaccine is available at their designated vaccination centre. “Covaxin and Covishield, both are meant to prevent Covid-19 and people should take whatever is available. The option to choose is not available,” director, public health, Dr G Srinivasa Rao said. In a bid to assuage fears of those who have already taken the first dose of Covaxin, Rao said there is no shortage of second doses. “People who have taken the first dose will be given the second dose of the same vaccine. Supplies are controlled by the Centre and more will be allocated based on availability at the national level,” he explained. Talking about the insistence of a few people on taking Covaxin, Dr Maddur Gowtham Reddy, director, Omni Hospitals, Kothapet, said, “Both the vaccines are equally good and safe with a marginal difference in efficacy. Somehow, it has got into the people's mind that Covaxin is better. There is no proof of this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vax-centres-run-out-of-covaxin-2-jabs-safe-docs/articleshow/81921618.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot accuses PM Narendra Modi of ignoring Indira’s role in Bangladesh liberation||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ignoring Indira Gandhi’s role in the creation of Bangladesh, saying he failed to mention her during his recent visit there to mark the 50th anniversary of its independence. Modi had participated in the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Bangladesh’s independence in 1971, when Indian forces defeated the Pakistani army and took thousands of its soldiers as prisoners. Addressing North Western Railway Employees Union via video conference, Gehlot said Modi skipped any reference to the then PM during the visit. “Indira Gandhi did not bow down to US threats. But it is the country’s misfortune that the Prime Minister goes to Bangladesh and does not mention how Indira Gandhi contributed to the liberation of Bangladesh and how 90,000 Pakistani soldiers surrendered,” Gehlot said. The Congress leader added that the respect that Modi has got from foreign governments and Non-Resident Indians during his visits abroad is not just for him. It is respect for independent India’s 70-year journey. Now, a US paper has written that democracy in India is shrinking, and the country’s institutions and system are stressed, the CM said. He claimed that the nation is heading towards a ‘dangerous turn’. The BJP is committed to carrying out RSS’s agenda, Gehlot said, referring also to ‘love jihad’ – the right-wing allegation that Muslim youth are marrying Hindu women to convert them. Gehlot alleged that the judiciary, Election Commission of India, Income Tax department and other agencies are working under pressure. On railways, he said it was a priority sector for former PM Jawaharlal Nehru. He said rail network has played an important role in keeping a country of different languages and religions united.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-accuses-pm-of-ignoring-indiras-role-in-bdesh-liberation/articleshow/81920580.cms||---

Suspecting him to be a thief, a group of people caught hold of him and beat him up severely following which he died,” the official said, adding that five persons have been booked under relevant sections of IPC, including 304 (A). The police were trying to find out why the victim had gone to the area, he said. The deceased was identified as Aneesh son of Raees, a native of Fareedpur village in Kakori, Lucknow. The dial 112 police were alerted about an unidentified man, having multiple injuries, lying in the village in Behta Mujawar police area. The police rushed to the spot and rushed the injured man to Bangarmau community health centre, where doctors declared him dead. The police thereafter sent the body for postmortem. His father Raees, meanwhile, has demanded arrest of the named accused in the case. He claimed that his son was innocent and was beaten to death when he had gone to Unnao’s Behta Mujawar area.

---||Lucknow||BJP fight against TMC will end violence, caste bias in Bengal: Maurya||UP deputy chief minister Keshav Maurya, who has been travelling in West Bengal for campaigning along with senior Union ministers, says BJP will never forget the wounds and scars left on its workers during the violence unleashed by Trinamool Congress and the fight is to restore pride for every community including Matuas. He spoke to Rohan Dua. Excerpts: Along with several Union ministers like Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Sanjiv Balyan and Arjun Munda, you have been handed a key role for West Bengal. Is it because of your caste factor like in UP or otherwise? * Party gives each one of us some responsibility time to time. There are 35 assembly constituencies which I am looking after for strengthening my party's canvassing. My party BJP and PM Narendra Modi have always batted for sabka saath sabka vikas. It’s not about any caste. I am glad I could contribute to party’s success in 2017 when I was BJP state president under the stewardship of Amit Shahji then. I am hopeful that we will be able to bring positive results in more than 25 seats easily. But the BJP has put the spotlight on Matua community which comprises 30 million people across West Bengal and influences more than 80 seats? * It’s a myth that just because they are from SC community and BJP is eyeing a votebank in them. Most of the Matuas came and settled in West Bengal after facing atrocities elsewhere but neither Congress, nor Left or TMC attended to their demands all these years. Now that we have decided to address their grievances and find them representation, other parties are looking to hear them too. Why didn’t any other PM or leader ever decide to give respect to sacred shrine of Matuas in Orakandi? Didi has only openly supported infiltrators and illegal immigrants. TMC has accused the BJP of wielding central agencies such as ED and CBI on its leaders ahead of polls. * Similar accusations were made during UP elections and 2019 Lok Sabha elections as well. The probes in most of the cases have been going on for years. We also know how TMC siphoned off money from Cyclone Amphan funds instead of distributing it among people. TMC is scared of future investigations. Do you agree BJP’s direct fight is against regional parties in most states like that against SP and BSP in 2017 and 2019 in UP. * What can be said of Congress when it is fighting the Left in Kerala and joined hands with the same Left parties in West Bengal? TMC has said that BJP could not find suitable candidates and instead roped in its central leaders like Babul Supriyo. * Isn’t that a proud moment that in BJ P which is a parivar, we can give any responsibility to anyone in state and Centre. We in the BJP want to fight but TMC are unleashing violence on our party members and leaders like JP Nadda and an 85-year-old woman in North 24 Parganas. We are not going to get cowed down and will avenge killings of our workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-fight-against-tmc-will-end-violence-caste-bias-in-bengal-maurya/articleshow/81903283.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Month on, Satellite man’s suicide revealed by note||Ahmedabad: When Kalpana Shah went to give her husband Dipak his medicines in the morning and found him dead, the family was upset at the sudden death. They thought it was God’s will till, a month later, Kalpana opened his cupboard to look for some documents and found Dipak’s suicide note. In it, the 70-year-old had blamed his daughter-in-law, a citizen of New Zealand, of harassing him and driving him to take his own life. Satellite police on Monday filed a complaint against Netra Patel for abetment of suicide. According to the FIR with Satellite police, Kalpana and Dipak’s son Jigar got married to Netra on December 11, 2011. The couple began living with the Shahs at Someshwar Bungalows in Satellite. On February 27, 2021, Dipak — a coal trader operating from Gomtipur — went to his bedroom to sleep. On the morning of February 28, Kalpana found him lying dead on the bed. The family called a doctor who declared him dead and they cremated him according to rituals. The family was in trauma due to the sudden death of the head of the family. So, no one even entered his room. On March 31, however, when Kalpana began checking Dipak’s clothes and documents, she found a note inside the cupboard. In it, Dipak had held Netra responsible for his death. The suicide note stated that Netra would often pick fights with other family members and threaten to implicate them in some false case. He also stated that she would often barged into his room and he feared that she would do something wrong to him. The suicide note also mentioned that Netra had accused her husband and sister-in-law of having an illicit relationship — an allegation that left Dipak quite hurt. Kalpana, too, stated in the FIR that Dipak had once cried a lot in front of her, saying that he could not live such a pitiful life. On her complaint and on the basis of the suicide note, Satellite police have filed a case of abetment to suicide and criminal intimidation against Netra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/month-on-satellite-mans-suicide-revealed-by-note/articleshow/81920594.cms||---

His abductors, however, managed to flee. The police said, “Abhishek, a resident of Ganj Chowk locality under the limits of Bahadurgarh police station in Darbhanga district of Bihar, was on his way to attend tuition classes when he was allegedly abducted after being sedated by four unidentified men on Saturday evening.” However, on Sunday morning, when he regained consciousness, he found himself in a train at Kanpur Central railway station. Soon, he alerted his fellow-travellers, who immediately apprised about his location to his parents on phone in Darbhanga. As per the police, the kidnappers had till then made several ransom calls to Abhishek’s father Ravindra Thakur and told him that his son had been kidnapped and asked him to pay ransom for his safe release. The matter was immediately brought to the notice of the Bahadurgarh police, who in turn tracked the mobile details of the ransom call and apprised Kanpur police after tracing their location. Deputy commissioner of police (Crime) Kanpur Salman Taj Patil subsequently formed a team and launched a search operation to locate Abhishek. “As the train had left for onward journey from Kanpur Central, a police team was deputed at Aligarh railway station. As soon as the train reached Aligarh, sleuths of the Crime branch conducted a search and recovered Abhishek from seat no: 80 in the coach no: S -8 of the Swarna Jayanti Express. The boy was found to be in possession with a school bag, a lower, school report card and few other documents. After procuring details with regard to the abductor’s identity, the investigators handed him over to his relatives, who had come from Delhi,” the DCP said on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kidnapped-darbhanga-student-rescued-from-train-in-aligarh/articleshow/81919904.cms||---
---||Delhi||HC warns against ‘wishy-washy’ papers to get bail||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has warned against “skimpy and wishy-washy” medical documents being used to seek bail. Taking note of one such report, the court said it won’t tolerate “ambiguous, incomplete documentation in illegible handwriting” in the future. It added that status reports filed by the jail doctors on condition of undertrials/convicts should be clear, while explaining the medical terms, not just in medical jargon. Justice Subramonium Prasad commented that the medical reports filed by the jail superintendents were unclear and the medical terms used not easily decipherable by the judges. “The doctors preparing the status reports must clearly give their final impression and opinion as to whether the condition warrants any urgency/ emergency. Further, it must explicitly state if the condition of the patient is likely benign/malignant/infective, and state clearly if surgery is needed for that specific condition,” the high court said.  “Applications on medical grounds are now being made as a ruse to get interim bail and then prolong it for indefinite period. Sketchy, wishy-washy medical documents from any random private doctor with ambiguous, incomplete documentation in illegible handwriting will not be entertained in the future, rather viewed seriously with suspicion,” it noted. The court was dealing with a case where an accused was granted interim bail on the ground that his medical report showed “right-sided gynecomastia” or enlargement of male breasts, and piles, apart from diabetes and blood pressure. “If an attempt is being made to simply prolong or use lame excuses and take the help of such ambiguous medical documents provided by doubtful or questionable private doctors, it will be viewed seriously by the court and action taken against those doctors,” the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-warns-against-wishy-washy-papers-to-get-bail/articleshow/81939209.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune: District touches 10 lakh doses mark; 1 lakh given both shots||PUNE: The district now has a million people who have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The key milestone was achieved 89 days after the vaccine drive began on January 16. On Monday, civic officials across the region ensured their vaccination sites had a steady stream of beneficiaries. In remote parts, the zilla parishad booked state transport buses to take people to the centres. But the day’s overall turnout in the district was still below the target one-lakh mark with just over 85,000 vaccinations. Pune rural recorded 48,423 vaccinated beneficiaries, the PMC had 21,086 and the PCMC had 15,637. Officials had said that a baseline of one lakh daily jabs is important to keep, especially when the inoculation programme expands to cover more age groups. Ayush Prasad, the chief executive officer of the zilla parishad said, “The rural administration, which includes gram panchayats, nagar palikas and cantonment areas, improved on their previous numbers by over 30%. We started the drive in January with just six centres. Today, we have 294. We also increased the number of daily doses administered per centre - from 127 to 167.” Prasad said most of rural Pune's vaccine sites are operating out of small public health centres (PHCs). A single PHC has been set up to handle the vaccination of at least 15 villages. He said, “The 167 daily vaccine beneficiaries per site was achieved through careful crowd control and elaborate seating arrangements. We also ensured each site had toilets, drinking water and shelter.” The district's vaccine drive gained substantial pace after March 1, when coverage expanded to include senior citizens and those above 45 with underlying medical conditions. Many officials have said that the turnout among the elderly has been better than expected. Prasad said the district collector, Rajesh Deshmukh, and Pune divisional commissioner, Saurabh Rao, are constantly monitoring vaccination turnouts in the district. Elected representatives in these parts have also played a key role in encouraging vaccine acceptance. Rajesh Patil, commissioner of the PCMC, said the involvement of NGOs and industries helped increase daily vaccinations. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “The overall million mark will now act as the baseline for all upcoming drives. Our main aim is to bring up daily inoculation figures to one lakh people, which is yet to be achieved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-touches-10l-doses-mark-1l-given-both-shots/articleshow/81919585.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Mumbai||Despite fund abuse row, Sena re-elects BMC apex panel chief||MUMBAI: Despite recent allegations of funds misuse against him, Shiv Sena’s Yashwant Jadhav was elected chairperson of the BMC’s standing committee for the fourth consecutive term on Monday. He polled 14 votes, and BJP corporator Rajshree Shirwadkar 8 votes. Sena’s Sandhya Doshi was elected chairperson of the civic education committee. Congress, which had fielded corporator Asif Zakaria for the Standing Committee post, withdrew the candidature on Monday and refrained from voting. NCP and Samajwadi Party voted for Sena in what political observers said was an indication of the shaping of alliances for next year’s BMC elections. “I will take Shiv Sena’s development agenda forward. Our main aim is to help the civic administration tackle the second wave of coronavirus at the moment. Once Covid-19 is under control, we will push for infrastructure and health facilities in the long term. Maximum funds will be used for it. We will also keep the administration under check,” said Jadhav after the election. Over the last few months, Jadhav had come under sharp attack from BJP for misuse of funds and faced allegations of usurping the maximum funds for his constituency in Byculla. BJP’s Vinod Mishra had also alleged that Jadhav had abused him during a chat on a messaging platform. Jadhav had denied all allegations. “Sena nominated Jadhav despite opposition from several quarters within the party as they could not find any corporator who could take on BJP and push the Sena’s agenda in the crucial election year,” said a political observer. Congress’ dithering, and NCP and SP moves during the voting show the MVA partners are unlikely to be partners in the BMC polls in 2022. “We don’t have the numbers so we withdrew our candidature but at the same time, we didn’t vote for the Sena as we are the principal opposition party in the BMC,” said Congress’s Ravi Raja, the opposition leader in the BMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-despite-fund-abuse-row-sena-re-elects-bmc-apex-panel-chief/articleshow/81920622.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

A case was registered with the Dehu Road police in the early hours of January 14 and ACB later arrested two more. Jatkar, who was then posted at the Vadgaon Maval court, surrendered before the court on April 1 and was remanded in police custody, which ended on Monday. Public prosecutor Vilas Ghogare-Patil submitted a report on behalf of the ACB recommending Jatkar’s remand in judicial custody, following which she moved a plea for bail after arrest. Judge Navander said, “The applicant (Jatkar) is a public servant. She has a small baby who is nine-month-old. Nearly entire related evidence has been collected by the investigating officer. Keeping the applicant in judicial custody appears unnecessary. In addition, there is surge of Covid-19 pandemic. The situation is critical. If bail is not granted, the applicant will have to stay in jail with the small child. Considering all these circumstances, it would be proper to release the applicant on bail, putting suitable conditions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/court-grants-bail-to-vadgaon-maval-magistrate-in-corruption-case/articleshow/81919587.cms||Vishwas Kothari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Walse Patil had declined home berth when MVA govt formed||MUMBAI: Dilip Walse Patil (65), a trusted aide of NCP president Sharad Pawar, is set to be the new state home minister. Currently, Walse Patil is minister for excise and labour. The biggest challenge for him will be to end the groupism among IPS officers and set the house in order. When the MVA government was being formed, Walse Patil, along with Jayant Patil, was front-runner for the home portfolio, and Anil Deshmukh was not in the zone of consideration. But Walse Patil then declined to accept the home department on health grounds, while Jayant Patil too had refused to accept the job, saying he had been home minister earlier and would like to take up a new department. Later, Deshmukh’s name was finalized as Pawar felt he would help NCP to expand its wings in Vidarbha. Pawar had had a discussion with Deshmukh on challenges in the home department, and when the latter agreed, the responsibility was entrusted on him. Walse Patil, who began his political career as political assistant to Sharad Pawar, was first elected to the legislative assembly as a Congress nominee in 1990 from Ambegaon in Pune district. He has been elected to the assembly for six consecutive terms. In 1999, he joined NCP then set up by Pawar. Known as an orator, Walse Patil was cabinet member during Cong-NCP rule from 1999 to 2009. He held key portfolios including medical education, higher and technical education, finance planning and energy. A product of Government Law College, Mumbai, Walse Patil was speaker of the legislative assembly from November 2009 to November 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-walse-patil-had-declined-home-berth-when-mva-govt-formed/articleshow/81920673.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Lucknow||Worried about vax side-effects, allergies? Doctors clear the air||LUCKNOW: Are you looking forward to getting vaccinated but unsure about your allergies and subsequent reaction to the vaccine? TOI brings you a lowdown on who all can go ahead with the vaccination process and who should wait for some time. According to doctors, a person who has a history of anaphylactic/allergic reactions to injectable (intramuscular or intravenous) therapies, pharmaceutical products or particular food items, are ineligible for vaccination. They should, however, seek medical advice. People who have developed allergies after taking the first dose of vaccination against Covid-19 should avoid the second shot. An anaphylactic reaction usually occurs within seconds or minutes of exposure to a substance you are allergic to, therefore, the vaccination process includes a 30 minute observation period following the jab to closely monitor any such reactions. However, an allergic reaction does not constitute air allergies such as pollen, dust or the likes. It also does not include allergies to pets, insects, environmental triggers, according to Yale University. “Covid-19 vaccine is one made up of virus protein, hence all those with protein-related allergies should wait for the time being until more studies come in. It is not fully known how many drug-related allergies are covered in the category,” said head of microbiology department at the King George’s Medical University Prof Amita Jain. “People allergic to penicillin and sulfa in certain medicines can also go ahead with the vaccine as these are not linked to Covid-19 vaccine,” she added. The two Covid-19 vaccines currently available in India, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Serum Institute of India’s (SII) Covishield, have also demarcated their eligibility criteria for people with allergies. SII states that any person who has had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of Covishield or to any of its ingredients, should not get vaccinated. This vaccine is made up of L-Histidine, L-Histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, Polysorbate 80, ethanol, sucrose, sodium chloride, disodium edetate dihydrate (EDTA) and water for injection. “Ingredients are clearly listed out so that people should seek medical advice for better understanding of their body’s reaction. Most people already know if they are allergic to these chemicals so they should skip the process,” said Prof Jain. “Those who do not know of the composition of things they are allergic to, are advised against the vaccine if there are reported allergic reactions to certain drugs and food items,” said the head of SGPGI’s microbiology department Prof Ujjala Ghoshal. As for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, people with a history of allergies have been asked not to get vaccinated until there is favourable medical advice from their physician. Both the organisations have also clarified that mixing up of the two vaccines for two separate doses should not be done. Since there is a possibility that many people do not know if they are allergic to certain products – edible, injectible or otherwise, an observation period of 30 minutes for all beneficiaries is mandatory at all vaccination centres. “Side-effects to any vaccine are normal. But in case someone undergoes a severe allergic reaction such as swelling of throat or face, difficulty in breathing etc, the 30-minute observation period has been set aside for this very purpose. Although there are hardly any chances of a severe reaction as the vaccine is being given in a small amount and is not a live vaccine which may interfere with the body,” Prof Jain explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/worried-about-vax-side-effects-allergies-doctors-clear-the-air/articleshow/81903470.cms||Yusra Husain

The home ministry, which has been monitoring child pornography videos and related online activities since 2019, has sent at least 4,500 such links to the Pune cybercrime police for action. The rise can be gauged from the fact that last year, the ministry had sent only 845 such links for action. The police then filed eight cases and arrested four persons for uploading child pornography videos on the internet. Overall, the ministry found 35,000 such links on a pan India basis in 2019-20. As per the POSCO Amendment Bill approved by the Union Cabinet on July 10, 2019, anyone found in possession of digital or even computer-generated sexually explicit images depicting children will have to face punishment as prescribed under the law. Deputy Commissioner of Police (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake told TOI, “The links forwarded by the home ministry have been uploaded from different parts of Pune district. We are segregating these links and based on their IP addresses and other details the links will be passed on to the Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune rural police for further action.” Cybercrime police inspector D S Hake said, “We will either delete the links or file cases against persons who uploaded these links on the internet or shared them on different social media platforms. We will take action against persons who upload and circulate child pornography video links on internet or social media sites”. Police said the numbers (4,500 links) indicate the kind of activities relating to downloading, uploading or circulation of video clips going on in the district. “People have been warned against uploading videos related to child pornography on the internet and sending them through internet-based mobile messaging applications,” Hake said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-get-4500-child-porn-links-from-home-ministry/articleshow/81919590.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Wait time for RT-PCR test results gets longer||Aurangabad: The wait time for getting the RT-PCR test reports has gone up drastically as the number of people getting themselves tested has gone up manifold. Earlier, the administration used to declare the test results by the first half of the next day when the samples were collected. But now due to the increased workload the administration is having a tough time in getting the swab samples tested and declaring the results. The results are now being declared by the evening adding to the anxiety of the people waiting for the test outcome. When contacted, authorities concerned said that increased number of daily testing of RT-PCR was delaying the announcement of results on many occasions. “It is highly essential that those undergoing RT-PCR tests must isolate themselves till the results are out. Such preventive measures can ensure safety of the families of the suspected patients and the society at large,” Ravi Sawre, medical officer with the local civic body, said. The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is conducting over 4,000 Covid tests on a daily basis, out of which around 45% tests are RT-PCR tests while the remaining are antigen tests. “There is certainly increased awareness among the citizens about early testing even if a section of population still averse to testing. Besides, suspected patients are turning up for testing on their own. We also have employees and other workforce who need to be tested on a regular basis as per the norm. These factors have led to increased daily testing and increasing the workload on the current workforce,” civic authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/wait-time-for-rt-pcr-test-results-gets-longer/articleshow/81910124.cms||---

In a letter to Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, minister for water resources, Mahendra Singh said a cruise vessel requires high water levels to operate. “It has been reported that necessary permissions have not been secured by the firm concerned or by others who have made their own jetties to secure access to Pichola,” the letter read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pichholas-increased-water-level-likely-threat-to-udaipur/articleshow/81920632.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Temperature soars, but another spell of respite is likely||NEW DELHI: After a brief respite, the maximum temperature rose to 38.8 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal, at the Safdarjung observatory, the city’s base station, on Monday, while the mercury even crossed the 40-degree mark at a few others. Another relief is, however, likely after Tuesday. While nights have mostly remained cooler last week and the minimum temperature recorded on Sunday was 14 degrees Celsius, five degrees below normal, it was 18.5, around the normal for the season, on Monday. The day temperature was 40.5 degrees Celsius at Sports Complex, 40.3 at Narela and 40.1 at Pitampura. According to the forecast of India Meteorological Department (IMD), the temperatures are expected to rise till Tuesday but are likely to dip from Wednesday. “A western disturbance is set to impact the region and would cause formation of thundery development that is likely to cause a dip in the mercury. Due to a western disturbance, the relative humidity is predicted to rise and wind direction to change,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head of Regional Weather Forecasting Centre. Met officials said the maximum and minimum temperatures would remain around 39 and 20 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Tuesday. However, the mercury is predicted to hover around 36 and 37 degrees Celsius from Wednesday. “Both maximum and minimum temperatures will remain below 40 and 20 degrees Celsius, respectively, from April 7 to 11. The day temperature is likely to touch 40 degrees Celsius on April 12,” said a Met official. Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality was in the ‘poor’ category on Monday with an overall air quality index (AQI) of 205. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, a central forecasting body, “PM10 continues to remain as the lead pollutant due to dominance of dust lifting wind under dry and warmer environment. Surface wind speeds are moderate and southerly.” AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate and remain in the moderate-to-poor category in the next three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/temp-soars-but-another-spell-of-respite-is-likely/articleshow/81920768.cms||---

---||Delhi||Lab on wheels to give joy of learning in remote areas||New Delhi: “To make education a mass movement, educational institutions will need to set minimum benchmarks of learning,” deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Tuesday. He was addressing an event held to mark the launch of Delhi Technological University’s ‘Lab on wheels’ programme. Sisodia said, “The programme will bring joy of learning for students in remote areas.” The mobile lab is a customised bus with 17 computers, two televisions, one 3D printer, cameras and one printer. The aim is to impart education to students of all sections, said AK Srivastava, associate dean of Centre of Extension and Field Outreach at DTU. Students of DTU will be deployed in the bus to teach children of Delhi government schools. Eighteen schools have collaborated with DTU to participate in the outreach programme for guiding students in the domains of maths and science. Srivastava said, “Though work on the programme started in 2018, it is now relevant because of the Covid-19 crisis. Our students will conduct classes for government school students and teach them because peer learning helps.” BTech student Akankshs Vidyarthi, who is also one of the peer teachers, said that “since the age gap between us and the school students isn’t much, it will be easier to teach them. Our plan is to assist them in learning powerpoint and software as well as teaching them on how to use the internet. Many of these students do not have a PC or laptop.” Apart from launching the bus, Sisodia also inaugurated a classroom complex and a centre at the department of design at DTU. Speaking about the mobile lab programme, Sisodia said, “It is our dream that our nation adopts various unique and innovative approaches in the field of engineering. The introduction of modern engineering courses at DTU will be relevant for the progress of our nation in the next 10 years.” The deputy CM added: “Delhi government is planning to start an initiative to encourage students of Delhi government schools to fulfil their dreams and stand on their feet. I appreciate the volunteers of DTU, who will help 44 lakh Delhi government school students find their own path and also think, implore and realise their dreams. I urge all the 14,000 students of DTU to become mentors for at least one student each so that students of Delhi government schools can receive the best guidance to become future-ready.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lab-on-wheels-to-give-joy-of-learning-in-remote-areas/articleshow/81939215.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Five more safari routes planned in R’bore park||Jaipur: Five more safari zones for tourists have been planned at the Ranthambore National Park (RNP), which has become a shining example of wildlife tourism in the country.The forest administration at the RNP has included the proposal for five new tourist zones in its Tiger Conservation Plan (TCP). If the proposal sees light of the day, the safari zones in the tiger reserve will increase to 15.RNP DFO Mahendra Sharma said, “Safari zones will be opened on a rotation basis. Safari in many existing zones will be closed to strike a balance, as the department cannot exceed the 20% limit on opening a tiger reserve’s area for tourism.”Tourism in and around the tiger reserves envisaged that 20% area of a reserve could be permitted for tourism activities. This is also as per the Supreme Court guidelines. Officials claimed that at present 17% of the RNP is open for safari.Around 103km area, which is inaccessible for tourists at present, will be opened for safari as per the new proposal. “Of the proposed routes, three safari zones will be developed in Khandar range and one each in Kundera and Range of Project Tiger (ROPT) ranges,” said the official.Experts believe that regulated tourism will not only improve tourism prospects, but will also help in effective monitoring and tiger conservation. They, however, hinted that the forest department should not make tourism the only tool for tiger monitoring.Dharmendra Khandal, conservation biologist, told TOI, “It is a good proposal as it will settle the disturbance occurring in Khandar and Gilai Sagar area. At the same time, authorities must not close the lake areas, which are a major attraction for tourists in Ranthambore.”Sources said, contrary to general perception that Ranthambore forest was being exploited for tourism, the reserve boasts of a healthy tiger population. “The baby boom in the reserve has been the biggest tourist attraction, with cubs being sighted by most tourists. Many times tourists sight two to three tigers during a safari,” said a wildlife enthusiast.As per the data presented by the forest officials in the state assembly, the park has a total of 70 tigers, including 23 males, 29 females and 18 cubs.“There are tigresses with cubs in zones, which will be opened for tourists. For instance, T-102 gave birth to its cubs in the Ama-Ghati area. Similarly, photographs of tigress T-107 were captured in the camera traps at the reserve in Amreshwar forest. Wildlife tourists and nature guides play a significant role in tiger monitoring during safaris,” said a forest staff.The Ranthambore reserve has a core area of 392sqkm, with a buffer zone of 1,342sqkm, having a total area of little over 1,700sqkm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/five-more-safari-routes-planned-in-rbore-park/articleshow/81920616.cms||Ajay Singh

---||Nagpur||Residents unite against illegal tree felling by society member||NAGPUR: Raising their voice for environment protection, residents of a colony have come together to protest illegal felling of trees by authorities of their own society. The conscious citizens reside at Leverage Green Society off Koradi Road which witnesses severe air pollution due to emissions from Koradi Thermal Power Station. Two days ago, residents were shocked to find three full-grown trees completely chopped. On enquiring, they found out that the society’s secretary himself got the trees cut without taking the mandatory permission from the garden department of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). “The trees used to be a dwelling for birds and also provided shade to residents. As we live in a polluted area, the trees did their bit by circulating clean air,” said residents. The infuriated residents later approached Koradi police. “We did our homework and found out that the action is a non-bailable offence under relevant sections of the Maharashtra Preservation of Trees Act, 1975. When we took a feedback from the concerned police officials, we were told that action is under process,” residents told TOI. Fed-up with the inaction, residents have now filed a complaint with the chief conservator of forest, NMC and the superintendent of police. Narrating the incident in their complaint, the residents wrote, “While the entire world is crying for the ‘Save Trees’ initiative, which is also our primary goal under the Paris Agreement, such deliberate attempts to kill our green cover should be strictly dealt with.” NMC officials have assured to look into the matter and take appropriate action. This is not for the first time that trees were felled illegally inside a residential place. In the last few years, the number of illegal tree felling cases has been on the rise. Officials stressed that trees inside personal premises too are NMC’s property. “We have been repeatedly creating awareness that even for felling trees planted by you inside you house, NMC’s permission is needed,” officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/residents-unite-against-illegal-tree-felling-by-society-member/articleshow/81920644.cms||Manka Behl

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC nixes ouster of nominated BJP member from standing committee||MUMBAI: Holding that his removal on the grounds of being a “nominated member” has no legal basis, Bombay high court on Monday allowed Balchandra Shirsat to remain a member of the BMC’s powerful standing committee. Shirsat was nominated a BJP corporator on March 17 last year, inducted in the standing committee on September 25, and removed on October 21. “The HC has accepted my petition and I will now continue to serve Mumbai as member of the BMC standing committee,” he said after the ruling. On Monday, the bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni was unimpressed with the civic stand that under the BMC Act, only elected councillors and not “nominated councillors” can be made standing committee members. “If indeed a ‘nominated councillor’ was to be left out of the fray for induction in the standing committee, such ineligibility ought to have been clearly stated or positively spelled out, which is not the case here,” said the HC, setting aside his removal order and confirming the interim order for Shirsat’s continuation as standing committee member. Shirsat, an electrical engineer, had challenged his removal as “illegal and perverse’’. After hearing his counsel Amogh Singh and Jeet Gandhi, the HC had on October 23 stayed the BMC general body meeting decision on his ouster. In final hearings, senior counsel Aspi Chinoy for BMC had submitted that after civic elections are conducted, “there is no scope for a nominated councillor to be made standing committee member”. But Singh said there is no specific bar in the BMC Act and cited an SC ruling to say a restriction thus cannot be read into the law. The HC agreed. “A literal reading of all the statutory provisions points towards the legislative intent of not imposing any restriction, which does not appear to us to be absurd or preposterous, and thereby no strained interpretation of the Act to fit in with the interpretation on the law placed by the corporation is required to be made,” said the HC. Shirsat is one of the five nominated councillors in BMC after the 2017 civic polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-nixes-ouster-of-nominated-bjp-member-from-standing-committee/articleshow/81920726.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Amritsar||Farm bodies come out against direct payment, protest in Punjab||BATHINDA: Raising a voice against the new directives of Food Corporation of India (FCI) about uploading the land records on a portal for direct payment into the bank accounts of the farmers, the farmer unions held protests at the FCI depots across the state on Monday, observing the day as ‘FCI Bachao Divas’ to oppose “attempts to dismantle both PDS and MSP procurement”. The farm organisations also sent letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that thousands of farmers had been camping at the Delhi borders for nearly four-and-a-half months braving bitter cold, rains and now the scorching heat. They have been demanding repeal of the three farm laws, and enacting of a law guaranteeing MSP and procurement at remunerative prices, but the government has not conceded to the demands and has stopped all discussions after January 22. The Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) said the attack of the central government on FCI, MSP, procurement of food grains and the public distribution system began with the report of the Shanta Kumar committee placed in January 2015. It recommended reduction in the number of beneficiaries under the Food Security Act from the then 67% to 40%, allow private players to procure and store food grains, stop bonuses on minimum support price (MSP) paid by states to farmers, and adopt cash transfer system so that MSP and food subsidy amounts can be directly transferred to the accounts of farmers and food security beneficiaries, FCI should involve itself in full-fledged grains procurement only in those states which are poor in procurement, in the case of those states which are performing well, like Haryana, Punjab, the states should do the procurement. The morcha said it was evident that the three farm laws enacted by the government carry forward some of these recommendations “as these compromise on FCI, MSP, PDS and procurement of foodgrains”. It said the government claims that the cost of handling food storage is huge, Rs 37/kg for rice and Rs 27/kg for wheat. For the last several years, GOI has not cleared all dues of this FCI expense as a result of which the total debt on FCI today has reached Rs 3.81 lakh crore. It pays more than 8% interest on this. On the contrary, for the last several years the budget of the FCI has been reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/farm-bodies-come-out-against-direct-payment-protest-in-punjab/articleshow/81920666.cms||---

Sreepathi Sanjeev Kumar, 48, who lives in upscale Madhapur, wanted to pull a fast one on All Fools Day, but is instead cooling his heels in jail after his prank backfired. City police commissioner Anjani Kumar said sleuths of Commissioner's Task Force along with Cyber Crimes scanned records of some 1,800 mobile phones and zeroed in on Sanjeev Kumar for his role in forging an old GO and circulating it on WhatsApp groups. “He said he had done it to fool his friends and did not realize that his plan would terribly backfire,” said a Task Force investigator. “He is now in judicial custody,” he added. On April 1, a fake GO claiming that a shutdown in Hyderabad was in force from 6 pm to 8 am to control the surge of Covid-19, went viral. The government was quick to dismiss it as fake and ordered a probe as the GO had gone viral on social media and had created panic among the general public. The original GO, ordering the shutdown of all commercial shops and play zones in 2020, was tweaked, police said. Sanjeev, a native of Nellore in Andhra Pradesh, tweaked GO No. 45 of Telangana government issued in 2020 on his laptop. “The accused forged the previously issued GO by changing the year to 2021. He later circulated it through his WhatsApp number by sharing it in one of his groups,” Anjani Kumar said. “Through Whatsapp, he circulated the PDF of fake GO in a group, which has 40 persons and members of a badminton players group. From here, it was shared to other groups on social media and created panic,” the police commissioner said. Police seized the laptop and the mobile phone used in preparing the fake GO and warned that admin of social media groups would be arrested if fake content is shared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/april-fool-prank-boomerangs-ca-lands-in-jail/articleshow/81921656.cms||---

The home sales in Ahmedabad surged 34% to 3,045 units during the first quarter (January-March) of the current calendar year from 2,268 units in the same quarter last year, stated a report by Knight Frank India, a leading real estate consultant. Similarly, the new property launches also rose 89% to 3,977units in Q1 of 2021 from 2,102 units in the corresponding quarter last year, the report further added. The quarterly sales volume continued to improve from the second quarter of 2020 and surpassed the quarterly average sales registered in pre-Covid time during 2019, the report added. The average price of residential property in Ahmedabad declined by 1.8% to Rs 2,800 per square foot (sq.ft.) in the first quarter of2021 from Rs 2,850 per sq.ft. in the same quarter in 2020. In the preceding quarter of October-December in 2020, the housing sales had also jumped 139% to 2,810 units and the new launches had surged127% to 3,294 units. “Ahmedabad represents the cheapest residential real estate market among the top eight cities under our coverage. However, this market also faced the same demand lull seen in the other Indian markets. Covid-19 had only magnified these issues when sales had dropped to near negligible levels duringQ2 of 2020,” said Vivek Rathi, director - research, Knight Frank India. “The market, however has rallied well since then and has seen sales volumes grow by a healthy 34% year on year (YoY) to 3,045 units inQ1 of 2021, reaching 73% of the pre-COVID quarterly sales rate. Developers have also upped the ante on new launches to capitalise on the increasing momentum,” he added The cumulative sales across top eight cities in India increased by 44% (YoY) at 71,963 units in January-March 2021, while new launches rose 38%at 76,006 units, the report added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/home-sales-launches-rise-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/81920684.cms||---

The identified Covid hotspots will witness implementation of necessary measures for effective surveillance and improved testing to curb the spread of the pandemic. Assistant project manager with Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Limited (ASCDCL) Sneha Mohan Nair said Covid cases are geographically scattered over different areas unlike last year. Therefore, three categories of containment zones have been formed and this would help contain the infection rate. “Apartments or societies that have 15 or more active cases or where 2% of the total residents are Covid positive have been declared as micro containment areas. Localities that have 50 or above active cases or areas where 3% of the total households have active cases fall in medium containment areas,” she said. “The large zones comprise more than 2 medium containment zones and have more than 100 cases from buffer zones,” she added. Nair said as per earlier orders, it shall be mandatory to test all residents of a containment zone with rapid antigen test kits for early detection and treatment of Covid-19. “The surveillance operation will be scaled down if no confirmed Covid-19 case is reported from a containment zone for at least 14 days after the last confirmed case. De-notification of the containment zone will be done 14 days after the discharge of last confirmed case instead of earlier limit of 28 days,”she said. Unlike past, the civic administration will not use tin sheets to close the containment zones, but will only notify by putting up banners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/26-containment-zones-declared-in-aurangabad/articleshow/81910162.cms||---
---||Delhi||Now Open: At 51m, Delhi’s Widest Flyover-Cum-Railway Overbridge||New Delhi: A nearly 2-km, six-lane flyover-cum-rail overbridge , built by Delhi Development Authority in Narela was virtually inaugurated by Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday. The facility is likely to not only help decongest the area, but also provide a fillip to the development of Narela sub-city. The overhead corridor is the widest flyover in the city with a width of 51 metres spread across two separate carriage ways of 25.5 metres each. Each of the carriageway consists of three lanes for motorised traffic, a dedicated bus lane, cycle track, utility corridor and a footpath with patterned colour concrete. The flyover is expected to cater to more than 15 lakh commuters a day and has been built keeping in mind the mixed traffic in the area. The 1,680-metre structure is part of the Urban Extension Road project (UER-I) and is expected to be an important missing transit link. It has come up around 2.5 km from NH-44, connecting NH-44 (GT Karnal Road) and Bawana-Auchandi Road. A 10.6-km stretch of UER-I from NH-44 to Auchandi has been completed and is planned to ultimately link with NH-8. Apart from Puri, Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, housing and urban affairs secretary Durga Shanker Mishra, DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain and North-West Delhi MP Hans Raj Hans took part in the event. Puri said that the flyover-cum-railway bridge was in sync with the plan to decongest Delhi and it also emphasised the focus on the development of Narela. The ministry said the railway bridge would provide smooth connectivity between Narela and Bawana, which are upcoming residential and industrial hubs in northwest Delhi. The ministry statement said that the area suffered from traffic congestion because the railway crossing was a bottleneck on the route. Over 150 trains passed this busy crossing every day, leaving very little time for opening of the gates for the around 80,000 vehicle users who drove past the crossing every day. The project cost Rs 389 crore to complete and was funded under the ministry’s Urban Development Fund, with 80% share coming from that fund and the rest being the share of DDA. The ministry said that Narela was a priority area for development, and DDA was committed to develop it on the lines of Dwarka sub-city. In DDA's annual budget for 2021-22, a significant component has been earmarked for the Narela sub-city development project. Allocations were made for transport infrastructure projects such as grant to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation for construction of the Phase-IV Rithala-Bawana-Narela corridor and the construction of UER-II stretch in Delhi by National Highways Authority of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/now-open-at-51m-delhis-widest-flyover-cum-railway-overbridge/articleshow/81939279.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Scores of nurses and other hospital staff rely on the bus service for their daily commute. Many told TOI they are now facing serious transportation issues.A head of a vaccination centre in Pune city said, "Most vaccinators are nurses who don't have their own vehicles. They were dependent on public transport. With PMPML shut, several staff are facing commute issues. The vaccine drives start at 8am and many are finding it difficult to reach the centre on time because there's no public transport."HK Sale, the executive director of Noble Hospital, said, “Stopping of PMPML buses will make commutes difficult for staff who don't have personal vehicles and who live at least 10km away from the hospital. It's nearly impossible to arrange hospital transport for staff every day.”Sale said it's not feasible to rent buses as the rate is at least Rs 8,000 for eight hours. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said on Monday that PMPML buses would stay off the roads — except for the ones part of essential services — until a decision is taken during a review meeting on Friday. “Pune district’s Covid situation is more severe than other districts of the state. So we have decided to mix and match local and state government orders and pick the more stringent provisions from both. In that context, until Friday's review meeting, the earlier order by civic bodies stands,” Rao said. He added that all hospitals (private and government-run), industries and companies have been asked to submit staff transportation requirements and hire the adequate number of PMPML buses. “These establishments can collect the rent amount from employees or sponsor the sum as PMPML is essentially a paid service,” he said, adding that an online meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday between senior officials, hospitals and industry stakeholders to address these problems. PMPML traffic manager Dattreya Zende said, “The PCMC has hired 16 buses to ferry vaccine beneficiaries and another eight to ferry employees of the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital staff. We also had a meeting with PMC on Monday. It will be giving us the number of hospitals within its limits that require staff transport as well as the requirements for beneficiaries. The hospitals will have to rent the buses.”Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner, said the PMC has written to PMPML for buses on major routes for hospital staff, paramedics and essential services.“The idea is to ply these buses on identified routes in two to three shifts so that hospital staff do not face problems in transportation,” Agarwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bus-ops-suspension-hurdle-for-vaccination-sites-staffers/articleshow/81919609.cms||Neha Madaan

Charuni is among the top leaders of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is spearheading the ongoing protests against the three farm laws passed last year. Speaking to TOI after attending a mahapanchayat by arhtiyas at Baghapurana in Punjab on Monday, Charuni said, “If the government tries to forcibly provide direct payment to farmers, we will go against it. If the government gives an option to farmers of either getting direct payment or through arhtiyas, we will not oppose it. We feel under such circumstances, more farmers will choose arhtiyas. If the farmers will want direct payment without any force, we will not oppose this.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/charuni-for-giving-options-to-farmers/articleshow/81920691.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chandigarh||Unionists by their side, arhtiyas agitate in Moga||BATHINDA: Enthused by the support extended by senior leaders of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), arhtiyas (commission agents) called a mahapanchayat in Baghapurana town of Moga on Monday to demand a rollback of the central government’s decision to introduce the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme. Under DBT, payments for crop procurement would be made directly into the bank accounts of farmers. At the mahapanchayat, speakers served an ultimatum on the central government to withdraw the directions pertaining to DBT and asking farmers to upload land records. They said arhtiyas will go on strike from April 10, the day the procurement of wheat is to start in Punjab. The arhtiyas have decided not to support the procurement if government did not concede to their demands. SKM leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Gurnam Singh Charuni, Ruldu Singh Mansa, Nirbhay Singh Dhudike and Satnam Singh Ajnala, while participating in the mahapanchayat, made it clear that farmers and commission agents were inseparable, and both would oppose the directives jointly. On Sunday, arhtiyas participated in a kisan mahapanchayat in Abohar. Farm leaders said the government wanted to break the bonds between farmers and arhtiyas, but they were together and would oppose direct payment and not provide land records. Federation of Arhtiya Association Punjab president Vijay Kalra said, “The central government is trying to teach arhtiyas a lesson for wholeheartedly supporting the farm struggle against three laws, which we will continue to do so till government does not repeal these, without going into the consequences. We are diehard against land records of farmers being uploaded on a portal and will wait till April 9 for central government to withdraw the directions or we will go on strike from April 10, when procurement will start.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/unionists-by-their-side-arhtiyas-agitate-in-moga/articleshow/81920679.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Business||86% insolvency cases pending over 270 days||NEW DELHI: Over 85% of the ongoing corporate insolvency cases have dragged beyond 270 days, which was the upper limit for finalisation of the process. Latest data released by the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) on Monday showed that up to December, 1,481 of the 1,717 pending cases had extended beyond 270 days. The four-year-old Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code — which is credited with changing the debt repayment culture —had provided for resolution within 180 days, with a possible extension of another 90 days. But, adjournments and multiple legal challenges in cases have meant that they usually go past the prescribed timelines. Following the lockdown last March, the government had imposed a freeze on fresh cases. But with the restrictions lifted 10 days ago the number of fresh cases being filed before the various benches of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is expected to rise, at least for the time being. IBBI data showed that since December 2016, when the law came into force, 4,139 cases have commenced, with over a quarter or 1,126 went for liquidation, a large number of which are related to the pre-IBC days. But numbers also revealed that nearly 15% of the cases that were admitted were settled following admission. Of the over 600 cases, in 279 a settlement had been reached with the creditor, IBBI data showed. In any case, by all accounts nearly 75% of the applications for insolvency action are resolved before the admission stage itself as promoters have paid up fearing that they would be ousted from their company the moment NCLT appointed a resolution professional. IBBI chairman M S Sahoo had recently said that 16,000 of the applications had been resolved even before admission. So far, lenders have used the new law as a potent tool to get errant promoters to clear their dues or face the prospect of losing their companies. Of the dozen high-profile cases, nine have yielded results, including Bhushan Power and Steel, Bhushan Steel and Essar Steel. Of the remaining three, Lanco Infratech and ABG Shipyard are headed for liquidation, while Era Infrastructure is not out of the resolution process. Jaypee Infratech and Amtek Auto, which are shown to have seen successful resolution, are still not completed. But financial creditors, including lenders, were responsible for around 43% of the cases with other creditors, such as suppliers, accounting for over half the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/86-insolvency-cases-pending-over-270-days/articleshow/81922510.cms||---
---||Goa||Brandon ready for Asian football’s big stage||Panaji: Brandon Fernandes doesn’t really know what to expect from the AFC Champions League. No Indian has played in Asian football’s premier club competition. No Indian club has been here before, and as FC Goa prepare for the games of their lives later this month, Brandon knows this is their chance to make it count. “Everyone is looking at this as a big positive in our careers. We can say we played at the highest level (of club football) in Asia. It will be a very good thing for Goa and the players,” Brandon told reporters during an online interaction on Tuesday. Brandon, 26, was part of the strong Goa squad that won the ISL League Winners’ Shield last season. It was their ticket to Asia. It was also a chance for Brandon, along with the rest of the squad, to prove their worth, rubbing shoulders with the best in business. “For me, this will be a new experience. I played in age-group (tournaments) at this level with the national team. But this is a completely different competition and we play against top teams in Asia. “We have to play as a team, be together in difficult situations and all of us need to give our best. There is a need to be mentally strong. We may not be able to do what we are doing in ISL, but whenever we get a chance, we have to prove ourselves. This will be a very good experience,” said the star midfielder who has trialled with former Premier League champions Leicester City. An important player for coach Juan Ferrando at Goa and Igor Stimac with the national team, Brandon hasn’t exactly had a season to remember. He was the highest Indian assist provider last season, but an injury meant he missed games at the start. When he was beginning to get into his groove, picked up an injury that kept him out for nine matches. He returned for the decisive second leg semifinal against Mumbai City FC, but missed a penalty. All that is in the past. The future, in his own words, looks promising. “I feel we can only improve as a team. We need to work hard. A lot of players will be together for the next two or three years. Once we play together, it will help us get good results,” said Brandon. Brandon was probably referring to the likes of Glan Martins, Princeton Rebello, Dheeraj Singh, Amarjit Singh, Saviour Gama, Makan Chothe, Phrangki Buam, Redeem Tlang, all of whom have long-term contracts with the club. Then there is Brandon himself, who alongside Seriton Fernandes, is the longest-serving domestic player at the club. “I am very happy here right now,” said Brandon. “I am looking forward to winning (with Goa) and doing well in the (AFC) Champions League. I will continue to work hard. The vibes are positive. Personally, I am very happy at FC Goa.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/brandon-ready-for-asian-footballs-big-stage/articleshow/81938297.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Chandigarh||‘Centre infringing on states’ rights’||Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday accused the BJP government at the Centre of "encroaching upon the rights of the states" in its bid to dominate them. Reiterating his support to farmers and the ‘arhtiyas’ (commission agents), he also criticised the central government for its one-sided decision to forcibly impose the new farm laws and the direct benefit transfer (DBT) on the state’s farming community. "States never faced such problems earlier," he said, slamming the Centre of trying to destroy the existing systems that had worked well for more than 100 years, in the name of imposing the so-called reforms without taking the stakeholders into confidence. Punjab’s farmers and ‘arhtiyas’ have age-old cordial ties, which the Centre is hell-bent on damaging, he said, terming the Government of India’s tough posturing and ill-conceived decisions as being against the basic spirit of federalism. He also said during his earlier tenure he enjoyed the full confidence and support of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and subsequently of Manmohan Singh, in all major policy decisions related to Punjab. Virtually launching the two-day Kisan Mela organized by the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, Amarinder expressed solidarity with the farmers against the “farm laws imposed by the Centre, in violation of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution" which states that agriculture is a state subject. The Centre has deliberately impinged upon the state’s power, thus jeopardizing the basic structure of democracy, he said. "Had the Centre been sincere about finding a workable solution to this problem, it would have either consulted the Punjab government or the state’s farmers, as Punjab alone contributes over 40% of foodgrains to the national pool," he asserted. Pointing out that 144 farmers have died so far during their agitation, he said his government was giving Rs 5 lakh and a job to a kin of the deceased farmer, while the Centre continued to be insensitive to their pain. Amarinder urged the farmers to go for drip irrigation in a big way to save the state from becoming a desert in the near future. The fast depleting water table, resulting from the melting glaciers, is a major challenge for the state and the only solution is to get out of the paddy-wheat cycle to save this precious resource, he said. He further emphasised that efforts should be made to adapt to horticultural crops which have a global market with chances of enormous profitability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-infringing-on-states-rights/articleshow/81920733.cms||---

The hospitals are currently awaiting permission from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). “Since most medium and small private hospitals are mainly treating non-Covid patients, eligible citizens will be willing to approach them for vaccination,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI), Pune branch. PMC’s immunisation officer Vaishali Jadhav said, “We have sent a list of 301 private hospitals to the state government. We are awaiting approval.” Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director of the state health department, said, “We are trying to increase the vaccination centres in Pune district. We aim to vaccinate about 1 lakh people daily.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/involve-more-pvt-hospitals-suggests-ima/articleshow/81919618.cms||Umesh Isalkar

It was necessary to make transport arrangements,” Velhe Zilla Parishad member Amol Narvade said. Over 20,000 beneficiaries are getting vaccinated every day in Pune’s rural areas. Public transport is not available at several places. Ankita Patil, a ZP member from Indapur, said, “We are not only providing transport, but also creating awareness about the need for vaccination.” The ZP’s CEO, Ayush Prasad, said he told gram panchayats to utilise their funds for providing such transport assistance. “The ZP has been conducting video conference meets to provide guidance to elected members and hear their issues,” hesaid.  “Villagers go to their farms in the morning and return in the evening. So, the timings of public transport vehicles don’t match with the vaccination schedule. As a result, arranging private transport is apt,” he said. “Many senior citizens don’t want to travel by public transport as they fear getting infected. Privately arranged transport has madethem to overcome such fears,”Asha Buchke, ZP member from Junnar tehsil, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/panchayats-zp-provide-transport-to-expedite-jabs/articleshow/81919613.cms||Sandip Dighe

Four such beds were, however, made available in the civic areas late in the night. The PMC areas have 430 ICU beds without ventilators in both private and government-run hospitals, two of which were vacant on Monday night. In September last year, there were 463 ICU beds without ventilators, out of which only seven were vacant then. The other areas in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) had 90 ventilator supported beds vacant for Covid patients on Monday. “We have kept 23 teams at private hospitals to make sure that hospital beds are made available to the needy patients,” said Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner of PMC. The PMC is expecting 1,000 beds for Covid-19 treatment, of which over 60 are expected to be ICU beds. PMC has started a helpline to help citizens. “Earlier, only five lines were available for the helpline but now 10 are working,” said mayor Murlidhar Mohol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-ventilator-bed-vacant-till-evening-4-available-at-night/articleshow/81919619.cms||Prasad Kulkarni
---||Mumbai||MVA govt, Deshmukh to move apex court||New Delhi: The MVA government and Anil Deshmukh on Monday decided to file separate petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the Bombay high court’s direction to CBI to carry out a preliminary inquiry into former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh's allegations. The state government led by Uddhav Thackeray is learnt to have rushed its advocate general to Delhi to consult senior advocate A M Singhvi for filing special leave petitions against the HC order. Lawyers involved in the process of drafting the appeals, which are likely to be filed on Tuesday or Wednesday in SC, said it was wrong on the part of HC to direct a CBI inquiry into Singh’s allegations at the interim stage and that too, without hearing the counsel for Deshmukh, who is the focus of Singh’s petition. Deshmukh will rely on the cardinal natural justice principle – “nobody should be condemned without being heard” - while seeking stay of the HC order. The Maharashtra government will challenge the HC order on three counts — one, that the state government has withdrawn general consent for CBI probe into cases within its jurisdiction; two, SC/HC could direct CBI probe only after hearing all parties and in a final judgment and not at the interim stage; and three, directing CBI probe into state matters would jeopardise the federal structure. Singhvi is likely to be lead counsel in both matters when they are heard by SC, which is likely on Friday. Sources said the state would argue before SC that HC showed haste in ordering a CBI probe and that the agency was conspicuous by its presence through counsel before the HC, expressing willingness to take up the probe. The state government will also inform SC that the government has already instituted an inquiry headed by retired HC judge K U Chandiwal into Singh’s allegations. The Justice Chandiwal inquiry committee, set up on March 31, has been given six months to submit its report to the state government. Singh had moved the SC last month seeking a CBI inquiry into the minister’s alleged corrupt acts and claimed he was transferred out immediately after he briefed CM Thackeray about Deshmukh’s “nefarious activities.” The SC had refused to entertain the petition and asked him to approach the HC, following which Singh had moved the Bombay HC. Singh had said, "The petitioner submits that unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation is immediately required in the corrupt malpractices of Deshmukh before the evidences are destroyed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mva-govt-deshmukh-to-move-apex-court/articleshow/81920778.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Nagpur||A Vidarbha person should have replaced Deshmukh: Politicians||NAGPUR: After almost six-and-a-half years, Maharashtra’s home portfolio shifts to a non-Nagpur resident as Anil Deshmukh resigned on Monday. Deshmukh quit to avoid any conflict of interest whenever investigations start into IPS officer Parambir Singh’s allegations of Rs100 crore a month collection demand. Between 2014 and 2019, Devendra Fadnavis held the home portfolio followed by Deshmukh after the Maha Vikas Aghadi took charge. With Dilip Walse-Patil taking over the home department, many local politicians feel that a Vidarbhite should have been given the post. Prashant Pawar, an NCP leader from city, said, “I would have definitely loved to see another Vidarbha person occupy the home minister’s chair, but then they probably could not find someone as senior to handle the high profile department. And it’s possible that after the enquiry, Deshmukh will be back as home minister. It’s sad that just based on simply allegations, a minister had to resign.” Cutting across party lines, city chief of Samajwadi Party Ravikant Khobragade too said that a Vidarbhite should have been Deshmukh’s replacement. “My personal, not party’s stand, is that the post has to be given to a person from Vidarbha. In fact MVA should look at transferring the post to Congress and making Nana Patole, who’s got a clean image, the home minister,” said Khobragade. Prakash Gajbhiye, former NCP MLC, said though local leaders can have their preference, the final decision will be of party chief. “Tough for us to say anything officially because these decisions are always taken in the larger interest of the party. Party supremo Sharad Pawar makes these decisions after looking at various dynamics and political equations,” said Gajbhiye. Hemant Gadkari, district chief of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), said he was ‘disappointed’ with Deshmukh. “I would have been very happy if Deshmukh had continued, but one cannot ignore the gravity of allegations against him. I am sad that Deshmukh messed up a golden opportunity as a Nagpurian to do some good things in his new portfolio.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/a-vidarbha-person-should-have-replaced-deshmukh-politicians/articleshow/81920775.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Chennai||Is the future of social networking all talk?||Chennai: Recently, people across the world got to spend an evening with a TN election candidate who discussed his career, his experiences and his ambitions as a politician. The hangout took place in the most happening invite-only audio chat app, Clubhouse, which drew global attention when Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made an appearance. Other members of the app include Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates."It was a great experience interacting with people who had a real desire to get to know me," says the candidate who feels physical campaigning must stop as going digital saves cost, levels the playing field and also helps reach out to more people.With the rise of audio-based social networking apps, life seems to have come full circle. While humans have always used talking to communicate, texts, chats and videos took over. And now, in a pandemic-afflicted world where people are craving time away from screens, audio has made a comeback. It’s helping people unwind, find like-minded people, have casual conversations and also network.The lack of video is one of the pluses of this kind of social networking, says Vijay Menon, storyteller and founder of The, a creative collective, who began using Clubhouse recently. "Not having to be on video makes me comfortable. Also, speaking to people brings about a personal connect. It’s not as impersonal as texting," says Menon. "I have joined The Malayalee Club, where I can speak in my mother tongue and discuss everything from politics and literature to food and movies. In a way it’s like a journey, where I can enter anybody’s house, and leave quietly if I don’t like the conversation," he says.These spaces are also a great place to network. "I have connected with a few writers and musicians. Sitting in Chennai, I was able to speak to a scriptwriter in Los Angeles. And since you can add your Twitter and Instagram handle to your profile, people can connect with you there," says Menon.Audio-based social networks appeal to people as you can speak about what you want without fear of it being recorded, says techie, musician and author of ‘Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking’, Krish Ashok. "For the better part of history, talking was the only way we communicated. It’s the oldest form of communication. Then came writing, radio, and TV, which added visual images. But all these things had access control issues as not everyone could get on radio or TV. The internet is a more democratised space," says Ashok.The evolution of the internet also started with text — blogs, Orkut — as it needed fewer bytes. "We jumped from text to video, Insta Live, Periscope, Twitter Live, etc but video is not for everyone as there is the pressure to look a certain way as well as stage fright to deal with. For a podcast or a video on YouTube, it’s out there and you can be judged for it for years to come," says Ashok. "That’s why these audio spaces are comfortable. It digitally replicates having an evening conversation with your friend, and you can talk without the fear of being recorded," says Ashok, who has been a Clubhouse member for two months and now hosts two regular programmes on Twitter Spaces. ‘Salem Junction’, which he co-hosts with author Sidin Vadukut every Friday, is a set of interconnected stories on a wider range of topics, while ‘Masala Trail’ which he co-hosts with food blogger Nandita Iyer, every Saturday, is about food."In both, we speak for 30 minutes and then open it up to the audience," says Ashok, who began by hosting a food room on Clubhouse. "Then Twitter reached out to me with Spaces. You have to build followers on Clubhouse but since I already have followers on Twitter, I shifted to it for wider reach."The pandemic has made these platforms more appealing, he feels. "As opportunities to hang out with friends have reduced, these platforms replicate it. Also, creativity rises not in isolation but when you converse with people. Talking to others helps fine-tune ideas," he says.The platforms do have some safety rules in place. Spaces and Clubhouse also temporarily record the live sessions. For instance, a recording of the Space is saved for a limited time in case you want to report it. "The host can also grant and revoke speaking permissions to participants," says Ashok. Clubhouse also temporarily records audio in a room while it is live to investigate any claims of abuse. But some users are apprehensive about these recordings and of other security issues as an incident was reported in early February about a user streaming audio feeds and metadata from multiple rooms in Clubhouse to another website.Vikas Chawla, co-founder of Social Beat, an integrated digital marketing agency, says the popularity of any platform depends on what is convenient for users. "People are looking at screen-free time, so you can tune into these audio platforms without having to actively read or watch. These are passive interactions, where only a small set is hosting, and others are listening."The pandemic and screen fatigue have also underscored the need to have alternatives to video chats and interactions, he says. "But these are still niche when compared to YouTube, Twitter and Instagram. It takes a long time to build that kind of traction and momentum to surpass it. So, it is in a nascent stage," says Chawla.Email your feedback to southpole.toi@timesgroup.com||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/is-the-future-of-social-networking-all-talk/articleshow/81920772.cms||Priya Menon
---||Aurangabad||80% RTE applications only for 7 schools in Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Around 80% of the applications — over 9,500 of the 11,905 requests — received across Aurangabad district under the Right to Education (RTE) Act for the financial year 2021-22 correspond only to seven schools. Now sensing high chances of parents resorting to malpractices to seek admission for their wards in top schools, educational activists have sought an inquiry into such applications. “The concept of neighbourhood school is followed under the RTE Act that defines the limits of such schools to be within one-kilometer radius from the residence of the beneficiary. With only handful of schools being flooded with admission pleas, this concept has definitely gone for a toss,” educational activist Prashant Sathe said. As reported by TOI in recent past, one of the modus-operandi for bogus applications involves intentional spelling errors in name,middle name or surname of the beneficiaries that can be later rectified. A section of parents were also seen producing bogus address proofs to claim admission in top schools. “The process of admissions under RTE Act is plagued with many unethical practices over a period of last few years. The process needs stringent scrutiny in order to protect the interests of genuine applicants,” he said. As per official data, a total of 603 schools from Aurangabad district registered for admissions under the RTE Act for the academic year 2021-22 — a cumulative intake capacity of 3,625 seats under 25%reserved quota. When contacted, S P Jaiswal, education officer with Aurangabad zilla parishad, said all the applications for admissions under the RTE Act would undergo stringent scrutiny.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/80-rte-applications-only-for-7-schools-in-aurangabad/articleshow/81910186.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rs 17cr red sanders, headed for HK, seized; 4 arrested||MUMBAI: In one of the biggest seizures of the year, two executive directors of a cargo firm were arrested along with two others with two tonnes of red sanders worth Rs 17 crore, which was to be exported to Hong Kong via Dubai, from near the airport. Red sanders has a huge demand abroad, especially in China and Japan, where it commands a good price. The wood is used in traditional medicines, particularly as aphrodisiacs, and woodcraft across China, Myanmar, Japan and East Asia. But it is available only in Seshachalam forests of Andhra Pradesh and is listed among endangered species. Prasad Khamkar (33), Manish Patyane (35), Nishant Malhotra (42) and Harindra Tiwari (48) were arrested. Khamkar and Patyane are directors of SCA Cargo Systems, while Malhotra is a middleman, and Tiwari a transporter. All were booked under IPC sections for theft and sections of Indian Forest Act along with Maharashtra Forest Regulation Act, 2014. Crime branch (unit V) led by Mohini Lokhande on Saturday evening laid a trap at Sion-Mahim link road, near T Junction in Dharavi and followed a tempo. “Our team got information that it was carrying red sander logs from Bengaluru. The team followed the tempo to the cargo godown at Sanjay Nagar cooperative housing society at Parsiwada, Sahar Road, Andheri (E), where we got hold of the red sanders,’’ said Prakash Jadhav, deputy commissioner of police (crime). Police said they recovered 1,800kg and the price in the international market is around Rs50,000 per kg. Police found 54 logs in the godown. Tempo driver Tiwari named Malhotra, who spilled the beans on Khamkar and Patyane. The four were produced before 37th Esplanade Metropolitan Magistrate court and remanded to police custody. Police are likely to visit Bengaluru to trace the source of the contraband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-17cr-red-sanders-headed-for-hk-seized-4-arrested/articleshow/81920782.cms||Ahmed Ali

The DMG Sub Area is the local military authority (LMA) for all army establishments in Pune and some other districts.At the peak of the Covid-19 situation in July-September last year, the AICTS, a dedicated Covid hospital (DCH) for patients from military establishments, had provided 10 beds in its ICU for civilian patients from the Pune cantonment area.

---||Kolkata||Where realty plays a key election role||BISHNUPUR: High-rise complexes replacing tiled roof huts, shopping malls coming up on farmlands and electric buses replacing cycle vans and motor vans — large parts of South 24 Parganas’ Bishnupur on both sides of Diamond Harbour Road is fast shedding its rural tag and catching up with city life as the vote seekers struggle to adapt themselves to the aspirations and changing demography at this part of the district bordering Kolkata. With 15 other assembly constituencies in this district, Bishnupur, bordering Thakurpukur and Joka, is going to polls on Tuesday. A TMC stronghold for the last 20 years, this mix of rural and urban belt has undergone a sea change in last five years with almost all big names in the city realty industry, building big residential complexes on both sides of DH Road between Joka and Amtala. Complexes are even coming up on Nepalgunj Road and interiors of Bishnupur, leading to a drastic change in poll agendas. “We have been living here for the past three years and everyday, returning home is a pain because of the traffic snarls on DH Road. Also, if you don’t own a car, it is difficult to live here as the place lacks adequate public transport,” said Arijit Basu, who owns a flat at a high-rise near Pailan. As per industry data, the Behala-Thakurpukur-Joka belt has accounted for 47% of realty sales in last two years, a majority of which falls under this Bishnupur constituency. “Real estate development has been on in full swing in LIG and MIG segments in this area. There are bungalows for high-net-worth individuals as well. We expect the approach road from Joka to Amtala to be developed and broadened to minimize the traffic snarls,” said Saket Mohta, MD, Merlin Group. Eden Group’s MD Arya Sumant said: “We had started investing in this area considering its potential and proximity to the city. If only the road gets widened and the Joka-Esplanade Metro work picks up pace, there will be more urban population coming in here.” TMC candidate and sitting MLA for the last 10 years, Dilip Mondal agrees to the same as he says he has made large scale changes to his poll promises this year keeping up with the changing demography. “In the next five years, there will be at least 25% of urban population living in complexes and high-rises in our area. Hence, we are focusing on widening of the DH Road by 10 metres and construction of a 6km flyover between Konchowki and Ibiza. DPRs of both the projects have been sent to the National Highway Authority of India,” said Mondal. The spurt in construction activity has also contributed to the local economy as many locals and farmers now work at these projects as labourers and supervisors. While signs of development are evident along DH Road, the situation is not the same in villages like Rashkhali, Tapna, Julpia and Panakua. “We don’t have piped water. We fetch drinking water from the only hand pump on the other side of the village and for cooking we depend on pond water,” said Kshitish Sardar of Doodhbeshali village in Julpia. BJP candidate Agniswar Naskar, a petrol pump dealer, wants to cash in on these issues. “Modernisation is important but basic amenities should be the priority,” said Naskar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/where-realty-plays-a-key-election-role/articleshow/81919622.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Man kills 16-year-old sister, dumps body on railway track||BENGALURU: A 21-year-old youth allegedly murdered his 16-year-old pregnant sister and tried to project it as suicide by dumping the body before a moving train near Horamavu railway bridge, northeast Bengaluru, early Monday. But his plan failed as an apartment resident saw someone dumping the body on the railway track and fleeing from the spot around 1.45am. The resident alerted the police control room and Ramamurthynagar cops rushed to the spot, shifted the girl’s body minutes before a goods train arrived. Police identified the girl as the daughter of daily-wage labourers and lived with mother and an elder brother in a shed in Ramamurthynagar. Recently, her brother learnt that his sister was in relationship with a boy and had become pregnant. He and his mother worried about the consequences if the matter came to light. The duo chided the girl. Her brother reportedly took it as a matter of prestige. He decided to eliminate the girl and planned to dump the body on the railway track, about 50 metres from the shed. He allegedly smothered her to death late Sunday night when she was in sleep. Later, he shifted her body and dumped it on the railway track before returning home. Body found on railway trackAfter receiving a tipoff, Ramamurthynagar police alerted Cantonment Railway cops as the body was found on the railway track. DR Siri Gowri, superintendent of police (railways), and Ashok D, deputy superintendent of police (railways), formed a team to crack the case. “We identified the girl with locals’ help. Her mother and brother told us she left home at midnight to answer nature’s call and never came back,” Gowri told TOI. Preliminary probe suggests the brother is a suspect, and police have detained him for questioning. He confessed to the crime and further probe is on to know others’ involvement in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-kills-16-yr-old-sister-dumps-body-on-rly-track/articleshow/81922611.cms||---
---||Kolkata||In 2021, Baruipur votes to tide over 2020||BARUIPUR/CHAMPAHATI: At Baruipur in South 24 Parganas that will go to polls on Tuesday, everyone has a tale to share. The Covid-induced lockdown and Amphan have left a mark in the district. From a software professional at Baruipur town, who is finding it difficult to pay his EMIs after a pay cut, to the litchi and guava farmers of Sikharbali in rural Baruipur, whose produce took a huge beating due to Amphan last year, everyone wants to forget 2020. Even, firecracker traders of Champahati faced the heat after the ban during Kali Puja. And yet, the Trinamool Congress that has been winning an undivided Baruipur seat since 1991 (except in 2006) seems to have a tough fight in hand. “From converting secondary schools to higher secondary ones, constructing roads and bridges to arranging drinking water in semi-rural belts of Baruipur West, our development agenda is for all to see. You can talk to residents, too,” said 72-year-old Biman Banerjee, the speaker of the last state Assembly. Alok Naskar and Niranjan Naskar from Sikharbali — both litchi traders — had other takes. “He has developed our school, put up lights and paved the road for litchi cultivators,” said Alok. But Niranjan added, “We had lost 40 guava and litchi trees during Amphan. The loss has run into lakhs. Around 25,000 such cultivators depend on these fruits for a living at Baruipur West. We had calculated our losses and sent them to the administration. But no help arrived,” he said. “But, We are a happy family here in South 24 Parganas. We need no divisions among us,” he said. At Baruipur Station Road, Sandip Sarkar said a lot of issues needed attention, including alternative income avenues for youth. A plan regarding the redevelopment of Champahati firecracker industry has been made, said Sudhangshu Das, one of the organizers of Champahati Haral Atas Baazi Byabsayi Samiti. “We want infrastructure to improve here. Just like Sivakasi, we need a testing facility for the chemicals,” said Das. Champahati falls under Baruipur East from where Trinamool’s Bivas Sardar is contesting. But Das, just like his counterparts in the West assembly segment, felt “resentments” could be addressed only through dialogues. The opposition insisted TMC would “crumble under its own misdeeds”. “The TMC is no more a party. It is a party of ‘tolabaj’. BJP has emerged as the only viable alternative,” said BJP candidate from Baruipur East, Chandan Mondal. Swapan Naskar of CPM contesting from the same seat said the need of the hour was to establish democracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-2021-baruipur-votes-to-tide-over-2020/articleshow/81919632.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The shooters, who have been part of the Indian team since almost two decades, will be getting married later this month in Hyderabad. “There is no particular moment when we decided to get married. We have been teammates since 2002 and are friends since then. We have been together since long and have been around during each other’s highs and lows. I guess the feeling of tying the knot grew with time,” Annu Raj, an Arjuna award recipient and London Games participant, said. “My mother is fond of her and her parents liked me too, so it is partially an arranged marriage,” Gagan said. The ace shooter said staying with parents since Covid pandemic helped them reach the decision. “We both have been representing the country since many years and when you are busy competing, your priorities are different. We didn’t think of getting married till last year when we finally got some time to think about things other than shooting,” he said. The shooters have represented the country at various international meets, including the Olympics. Gagan said the sport gave them an opportunity to know each other well. “We know the nature of the sport and that made it easier for us to know each other well. We have seen the lows and highs together. This sort of helped us take the decision,” he said. Annu, who has been part of the national team till recently, said her professional commitment delayed the wedding plans. “I was part of the Olympic core group and every now and then there was some competition or trial, which we couldn’t skip. Gagan wanted me to stay focused on my shooting,” said Annu, who hails from Aligarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gagan-annu-raj-to-tie-the-knot/articleshow/81921727.cms||Tushar Dutt

A total of 30 candidates had filed their nominations, out of which 11 withdrew on Saturday — the last for withdrawing the names. Now 19 are in fray for the bypoll that has been effected by the demise of Nationalist Congress Party MLA Bharat Bhalake. For the election, the NCP has given the ticket to Bhalake’s son Bhagirath. NCP state president Jayant Patil inaugurated the campaign for Bhagirath by visiting the Mahadev temple at Ranjani near Pandharpur. While speaking to the party workers, Patil said, “Bharat had to fight hard to get funds for development of the constituency when BJP was in power. The BJP deliberately ignored the issues of the constituency. We are a government of three parties and the state government will stand behind Bhagirath all the time.” Patil also took a dig at leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis who is expected to hold rallies to campaign for BJP candidate Samadhan Awatade. “The fuel prices have increased and farmers are agitating. But Fadnavis and his party leaders do not have time to speak on these issues. Rather attempts are being made to disturb the state government,” he said. Despite being close to the Maha Vikas Aghadi, Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana has fielded Sachin Patil for the bypoll. “We are not part of the MVA. We have a large support base here in Solapur district and therefore we are sure of winning the bypoll.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/pandharpur-mangalwedha-bypoll-campaign-begins-19-candidates-in-fray/articleshow/81910203.cms||---

While a majority of the complaints were about not recollecting the password, inactive registered cellphone numbers, or email id, there were also some complaints about technical errors. Actual university examinations will begin on April 10 and mock tests are a way to make the students familiar with the new software used in the online examination. An undergraduate student of the science faculty complained that his calls to the helpline number were not being answered. “I have a good and stable internet connection. But despite this, some questions were taking too long to load. Some questions took over 2 minutes to load. Then there was another problem of answers not getting registered. For example, when a question appeared, we would select the answer and move forward to the next question, but when I would check the entire question list, which showed which questions were answered and which remained unanswered, at least three questions that were answered didn’t register and still had the remark ‘unanswered’ in front of them. Twice I tried calling up the call centre but the clock timer which is supposed to stop at these times was still ticking. Both my calls were never answered,” the student said. Of over 1.10 lakh students expected to take the test on the first day, 68,470 took the test which includes 54,107 undergraduate students, 12,527 postgraduate students, and 1,836 postgraduate diploma students. “We got over 350 complaints and most of them were about problems in not getting the password, or inactive registered email id or cellphone number,” Mahesh Kakade, director, Examination and Evaluation, SPPU, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/68k-take-first-mock-test-sppu-receives-350-plaints/articleshow/81925996.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Delhi||Delhi: Why north corporation is stuck with plastic waste residue||NEW DELHI: Already facing difficulty in handling excess inert generated after processing legacy waste at the Bhalswa landfill, North Delhi Municipal Corporation now can’t find space to keep plastic waste generated after biomining. As of now, 2.7 lakh tonnes of inert and around 1 lakh of refuse derived fuel (RDF)/plastic waste are lying at Bhalswa after processing and biomining. Considering that the waste-to-energy plant at Narela-Bawana is unable to process the increasing amount of RDF, the civic body has invited tender for empanelment of contractors for disposal of such waste. The landfill is estimated to have 80 lakh tonnes of legacy waste above the ground level, out of which only 14.1 lakh tonne had been processed. “To speed up the exercise, we have increased the number of trommel machines to 26, of which 24 are functional. But storing the segregated waste is a big challenge due to space constraint at the already saturated landfill,” said an official. The corporation has planned to install a second waste-to-energy plant at Bhlaswa to meet the requirement, the official added. Commissioner Sanjay Goel said the corporation was trying its best to reduce the height of legacy waste at the landfill. “We have successfully disposed of 2.9 lakh tonnes of inert at NTPC eco park, a school at Mukundpur and other places. Likewise, about 1.6 lakh tonnes of RDF has been sent to waste-to-energy plants and 2 lakh tonne construction and demolition waste utilised at the landfill for making kuccha road or layering,” Goel said. The tender for disposing RDF will include inviting the contractors who have already tied up with cement or waste-to-energy plants in Delhi-NCR for supplying RDF material and are recognised by a regulatory body. “We are expecting to complete the process by mid-May,” said an official. Regarding the disposal of inert, the civic body has already issued a circular inviting people to take it for free to fill low-lying areas and claimed to have received encouraging feedback from individuals and government bodies. “We have mentioned the name of the officials to be contacted for getting the inert free provided the person will arrange for its transportation. We have already received a demand from Delhi Transport Corporation and one more government body. Officials are also getting calls from individuals,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-north-corpn-is-stuck-with-plastic-waste-residue/articleshow/81920794.cms||Vibha Sharma

The October 2021 deadline for the pilot project on seven stretches should be met, the chief minister said. Kejriwal chaired a meeting with public works department minister Satyendar Jain and PWD officials. Work has been progressing rapidly on the 35km pilot project in different localities, officials said. Later in the day, the chief minister also visited a stretch on Sriniwaspuri Ring Road. “The process of designing the roads should be done in a swift manner and the project should be completed within the stipulated deadline, i.e. 2023,” the chief minister said. “PWD should ensure the removal of all obstacles. The tender process and other formalities should be completed as soon as possible for rapid completion of the project,” he added. Officials informed him that the tender process would be completed in the next one to two months and work would begin by the middle of this year. Of the pilot project stretches, redevelopment of about 5.5km from Ring Road to Ashram has been completed and that of about 6km from Wazirpur Depot Crossing to Rithala Metro station is ongoing. Work is also underway on 5.2km from Britannia Chowk to Outer Ring Road in Pitampura’s West Enclave. Similarly, beautification of 3.1km stretch from Shivdaspuri Marg to Patel Road, Moti Nagar T-point to Pusa Road and Laxmi Nagar to Karkari Mor on Vikas Marg is underway. The redesigning project aims at tackling dust pollution and traffic jams by removing bottlenecks, increasing green cover alongside roads and paving open surface areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/complete-pilot-on-road-redesign-by-october-says-cm/articleshow/81939392.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Maharashtra State Council of Examination has also extended the enrolment for the examination to April 10. Commissioner of the council Tukaram Supe said, “Students have been engaged in online classes this year and the preparation for scholarship exams may have been disturbed. This extension of the exam date will give more time for students to prepare.” Many schools had conducted online classes for the scholarship also but students said they have not got enough time to prepare for the exam. Assistant teacher in Velhe, Ravindra Kshirsagar said, “The scholarship exam is vital for students to prepare for the competitive exams. Hence, we always encourage students to appear for the exam. We are conducting mock tests for scholarship students through the online mode.” The exam is usually conducted in February by the education department each year and lakhs of students take the exam held on Sundays. The council has also received very few registrations this year and with the extension in the registration date, Tupe said there are chances of more students enrolling. For the exam to be conducted from May 23, students can do online registrations. It is for the third time that the council has extended the date for registration. Jayashree Kate, another teacher of a civic school in the city, said, “The state government has also announced that students will be promoted without exams. So, the state board students can now fully concentrate on the scholarship exam preparation.” The exam went hi-tech ten years ago with the introduction of OMR answer sheets for objective papers. The compilation of results is done by computerised data entry process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/scholarship-assessment-postponed-to-may-23/articleshow/81919640.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Earlier, in February, forest minister Sanjay Rathod of Shiv Sena, who is facing allegations over death of 22-year-old woman by suicide in Pune, had tendered his resignation a day before the state budget session commenced. Sources from the Shiv Sena said that the two back-to-back resignations in the state cabinet have not only dented the image of the MVA government, but has also raised questions on the credibility of the Sena, which leads the tripartite alliance in Maharashtra. A Sena leader said that Deshmukh’s resignation could be a major setback for the government and give the opposition BJP an opportunity to further target the MVA. Several from Sena and even within the NCP were taken by surprise after NCP president Sharad Pawar selected Deshmukh for the home portfolio after the MVA formed the government in the state. A Sena functionary said that Thackeray following the allegations made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh was not very keen that Deshmukh continue on the post, but kept silent as Pawar himself addressed two press conferences defending Deshmukh in the national capital. Finally, on Monday, as soon as Deshmukh tendered his resignation following the Bombay high court order initiating a preliminary probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the corruption charges levelled by Singh, Thackeray immediately forwarded it to governor B S Koshyari who accepted it within a few hours. Meanwhile, a few Sainiks are eyeing the vacant forest minister post from the Shiv Sena quota in the state cabinet. A core Sena functionary said that the party is not in a mood to fill the post in a hurry, but would want to wait for a few months “till Rathod returns”. He further said that Thackeray may keep the forest portfolio with himself and wait for Rathod to “come back clean” as the party cannot afford to hurt the community (Banjara) leader, who has a stronghold in Yavatmal district and the nearby region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-resignations-in-mva-a-setback-for-uddhav/articleshow/81920868.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Hyderabad||Now, Chinese traders smuggle human hair out of India||HYDERABAD: Human hair exporters and processors from India have unearthed a scam where Chinese nationals are smuggling out human hair from Hyderabad to China, via Myanmar. They have alleged that a bunch of Chinese importers have made Hyderabad the hub of the illegal trade by under-invoicing hair to evade import duty in Myanmar and China. The Indian exporters have written to the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to crack down on the illegal trade running into crores. Analysis of shipment data of raw human hair from Hyderabad air cargo to Myanmar revealed huge under-invoicing as well as to get the rest of the money through hawala, mainly in the form of gold. An alert note from the Kolkata customs department sent to Hyderabad and other zones, says, “It has come to notice that certain exporters are artificially decreasing value of export consignments of human hair (goli/thutthi/choti) to Myanmar, Bangladesh and Vietnam.” The note adds that the modus operandi adopted by traders mostly in West Bengal and Telangana is to deflate procurement price of export quality raw human hair. “The objective is to under report foreign exchange to escape FEMA compliance and income tax and also to smuggle Indian origin human hair to China via land routes to escape close to 28% Chinese import duty,” the note says. Human hair is bought in auction from temples, church shrines in Andhra, Telangana and raw hair (goli) collected from domestic households and saloons, before being smuggled out. Smugglers are also believed to be taking the train route to Kolkata or Guwahati from Secunderabad and then on the road to Myanmar. Export data from Hyderabad air cargo between April 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019, revealed that the average price per kg of hair ranged from $2 to $ 62 for unworked human hair. The total raw hair exports during this period was Rs 26 crore from Hyderabad air cargo. Between April 2017-18, exports had been worth Rs 42 crore while in 2016-17, it had jumped to Rs 132 crore. There was a sudden boom in exports from April 2020 to November 2020 where Rs 33 crore worth of raw human hair was exported. It is suspected that the actual worth would 25 times more than the invoiced quantity. Using trains, the amount of human hair smuggled is 20 to 30 times more than that is going by air cargo. Human Hair and Hair Products Manufacturers and Exporters Association of India, in a written communication to DRI said, “Chinese and Korean factories have been importing semi processed hair legally from India. China gives an export incentive of 9% if the locally available Chinese hair is used. Some unscrupulous Chinese nationals figured out ways to smuggle raw hair from Myanmar borders.” Raw human hair is exported at $2 to $60 per kg with an average of $15 per kg, whereas the current market price would be $75 to $80. Investigations revealed that exporters are buying genuine hair from temples like Tirupati, Kanaka Durga and Gunadala Matha church in Vijayawada, Simhachalam and Yadadri temples and are selling it for a higher price instead of processing it. The same is either smuggled or sent to Myanmar legally but is under-invoiced. Hair collected from non-religious places is smuggled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-chinese-traders-smuggle-human-hair-out-of-india/articleshow/81921758.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Wearing a mask is critical in Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Experts have cited that, 70% is the efficacy we get by wearing a mask which is similar to vaccine efficiency,” said Suleman in a candid press conference, here on Monday. “There are very strong economic and commercial fallout of a lockdown. Last year’s lockdown was propelled as our health system was not prepared (to meet challenges of the pandemic),” he added. He confirmed that current wave of the Covid-19 infection wave in Madhya Pradesh is higher than the peak of 2020. “The rise in infection increase has surpassed our assessment in the first week of March,” said Suleman. “For the first time, it feels that our hospital infrastructure is going challenged (given the increase in Covid-19 cases),” said ACS Suleman. “We are expanding our services. It remains to be seen what percentage of case load the system would be able to bear. Private sector is being motivated to pitch in,” he added. Besides some 14000 beds in government run hospitals, private hospitals in the state can pitch in with 12000 beds for Covid-19 treatment. “Availability of beds in speciality hospital is already a challenge,” he added. Some 60% of cases are under home isolation while 40% require hospitalisation in the MP,” he said. Current spike in infection cases is much higher in Madhya Pradesh. Case load in the big four Indore, Bhopal, Jabalpur and Gwalior is 26%, 19%, 7% and 4% respectively. Abnormally high positivity rate in Bhopal: Positivity rate in the last week has been highest in Bhopal at 19%. Indore, Barwani and Ratlam have reported a 16% positivity rate. “Positivity rate is abnormally high in Bhopal. Average positivity rate for last seven days is 19%,” said ACS health, Mohammed Suleman. Khargone has 15% positivity rate which is calculated by the number of people who tested and those who are diagnosed with the infection. As per WHO, positivity rate should be under 5% for flatting the Covid-19 curve. 83% testing target met this week: Health department has met 83% of its testing target of 30000 samples per day in the last week. The 7-day average testing in MP was 24,878 per day. Positivity rate in the state is about 10%. “Testing conducted through fever clinics has increased in the recent past. Our policy is no questioned asked Covid-19 testing to anyone,” said ACS Mohammed Suleman. Ahead of the spike in cases, Covid-19 average has dipped to around 15000 per day in MP. Health infra stressed to limit: In Madhya Pradesh, 27% of active cases are on oxygen beds, HDU or ICU beds. Some 14,387 beds are planned in government-run hospitals while 12,692 are ready to cater to Covid-19 patients. Looking beyond, gross numbers, which looks comfortable, ACS Mohammed Suleman warned that situation differs from district to district. “ICU bed availability for the state is 37% occupied. In some districts the occupancy of critical care beds is as high as 70%,” he said. 28% of 60+ have got the jab in MP so far: “Supply and demand side are challenges for the administration of Covid-19 vaccine. Of the target population, 28% of 60+ age group have been inoculated so far while 7% of 45 to 60 years have got vaccinated,” said ACS Mohammed Suleman. More than 42 lakh doses have been administered and 5.43 lakh people have received both the doses in MP. Rs 1.85 crore in fines for not wearing mask: In the month of March alone, 1.61 lakh people were fined for not adhering to Covid-19 protocol and Rs 1.85 crore was recovered through fines levied in the month. As many as 636 shops or commercial establishments were sealed for violation of Covid-19 protocol. In different cases, 1580 FIRs have been filed, said a health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/masks-jabs-the-way-forward-in-covid-fight/articleshow/81919649.cms||Jamal Ayub

---||Amritsar||Home away from home: Village names dot Delhi border protests||BATHINDA: Four months have passed into the struggle at the borders of Delhi against three contentious farm laws and with the matter far from being resolved, the protesting farmer have taken along their village names into the protest. Activists from some villages have set up separate enclosures under the banners of their villages while many have put up bamboo structures naming these as rest house. It has been done to give a distinct identity to their villages and give a feeling that they (protesters) are putting up at their own villages while holding protests against the Union government. Even as the farmers have been putting up for long at the borders of Delhi that has been witnessing protesters from various places holding agitation jointly, the farmers want to keep the identity of their respective villages intact. Hence, the farmers have put up tents or different structures under the names of their villages and some have even parked their tractor trolleys in the space around their temporarily set up “villages” at Delhi borders, said farm leader Shingara Singh, who is putting up at Tikri. The protesters from Kanjhla village of Sangrur district have named an enclosure in the name of their village and a gate has been prepared marking the “village” territory where trolleys have been parked with some even having air conditioner fitted in these. At the said gate, “Kisan ekta zindabad” banner has been put up with a photo of Bhagat Singh on one side and of a farmer on the other. A bamboo enclosure has been prepared by activists from Jalalabad East village in Dharamkot sub division of Moga district. Along with putting up a solar panel for electricity, they have also set up a dish antenna for watching television inside the enclosure. Similarly, activists from Behrampur village of Gurdaspur have set up a rest house by putting up structure with bamboo sticks and marking the roof with stubble.“The love for ones village becomes more intense when you are away from it for a long period of time that has happening due to longevity of the protest,” said Randeep from Sangatpura village in Sangrur, who had spent many days in the farmers’ protest as an ardent activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/home-away-from-home-village-names-dot-delhi-border-protests/articleshow/81920864.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chennai||Growing trees with a bit of digital help||The patient task of nurturing a tree is set to get some tech help as the Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding (IFGTB) is working on an interactive digital platform bringing together various stakeholders in tree farming. From tree growers, to nursery owners, wood-based industrialists, state forest departments and research institutions, the platform will help connect all of them. It is mainly meant to help tree growers find suitable tree varieties or clones, quality planting material, solutions for diseases or pests attacking their trees and finally buyers for their trees. IFGTB director C Kunhikannan said, "We are coming up with a digital interactive portal that will include a website, a mobile application available for both android and iOS phones and a web portal. Both the app and website will allow tree growers and farmers to post their queries or post a picture of sites for finding suitable trees, or insect on their trees, leaves or branches, wanting to know what it is, if its dangerous and how should it be contained," he said. Once the query is up, the research outreach from IFGTB can give their diagnosis and suggest a solution. Besides getting solutions for problems, tree growers can mention their demand for quality planting material, which nurseries can address, and availability of wood that industries can pitch for and express their interest to purchase. "Ease of planting, growing, maintaining and later marketing of trees is crucial to get youth into tree farming. For this, they need easy access to information, and that is what we are trying to provide," said project in charge and head of extension activities at IFGTB, Rajesh Gopalan. "Besides replying to farmers’ queries, the institute will also provide regular weather updates, prevailing market price of wood and timber, department schemes and subsidies and information about new clones," he said.  The platform is expected to be operational from October. The IFGTB organises periodic interactions with farmers through tree growers’ mela, different training sessions and stakeholder meetings, but this platform takes the exercise digital so that it can reach more farmers. It will also answer queries. Last week, the institute had conducted a stakeholders’ meeting to elicit feedback on the prototype of the portal and get their inputs and suggestions on the design, information and ease of use.  "We will keep getting feedback and making changes, before the project completion" said the director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/growing-trees-with-a-bit-of-digital-help/articleshow/81920860.cms||---

According to deputy director of state agriculture department Kailas Shirsat, the export of grapes will continue till April 20. “The district is expected to export another 15,000 tonne of grapes in the next 15 days. The export figure of the district is expected to be around 1.35 lakh tonne,” he said. Manik Patil, director of Grape Exporters’ Association of India (GEAI), said grape harvest usually gathers momentum in January, but it was delayed by a fortnight this year due to delayed pruning by the farmers. “Taking lessons from the past two years, as unseasonal rains had lashed the ready-to-harvest vineyards in the month of January, the grape farmers had delayed the pruning activity by a fortnight. As a result, the grape harvest started gathering pace in the second half of January,” he said. “This is the reason, the grape export was slow in the first half of January, but steadily kept increasing,” he added. As per the government norms, it is mandatory for the farmers wanting to export grapes, to register their vineyards with the state agriculture department. As a result, a total of 37,090 farmers have registered their vineyards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-1-20-lakh-tonne-of-grapes-exported-this-season/articleshow/81910240.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Mumbai||Nair hosp docs threaten mass leave against Covid-only work in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Resident doctors from Nair Hospital have threatened to go on mass leave on Tuesday if their demands to have equal number of beds for Covid and non-Covid patients are not met. In second wave of infection, Nair Hospital is likely to slip back in its role as a dedicated Covid hospital like it did last year. This, however, had caused irreparable academic losses to the postgraduate doctors, especially ones from the surgical branches. The fear of losing out on their academics, yet again, has pushed them to oppose the re-covidisation of the hospital. The doctors have asked the civic authority to recruit more ayurveda, homeopathy doctors, nursing staff and divide the Covid work equally among all civic hospitals. In their letter to additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, representatives of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors, have mentioned that non-Covid patients with chronic illnesses should not be deprived of treatment. “We appeal to the authorities to manage infrastructure and internal installations for equitable distribution of Covid and non-Covid beds in all four BMC hospitals without any delay,” they said in their letter. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nair-hosp-docs-threaten-mass-leave-against-covid-only-work-in-mumbai/articleshow/81920900.cms||---

In addition, if these property owners clear their dues for 2020-21 between June 1 and August 31, they will be eligible for 100% rebate on interest dues. The committee proposed an additional Rs 576-crore budget works over the municipal commissioner’s proposed Rs 7,475-crore budget proposal, taking the budget value to Rs 8,051 crore. With a new Rs 15-crore mid-size hospital near Zydus hospital, the committee also announced 70% property tax relief for trust-run hospitals and physiotherapy centres in municipal-owned buildings. A few additional projects have been proposed by the committee. Interestingly, the final budget proposed for 2021-22 is still 16.8% less than Rs 9,685-crore budget that was suggested for the previous financial year. A break up of the present budget reveals developmental works worth Rs 285 crore in addition to revenue expenditure of Rs 318 crore, that were suggested by councillors for the final budget. This was decided at a meeting held by municipal standing committee members at AMC’s Danapith office. “The budget will now be placed before the general board for approval within five days for approval,” says a senior official in the municipal secretary office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/6l-homes-smaller-than-40-sq-m-to-get-full-tax-exemption/articleshow/81919645.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||SKM turns to activists to sustain stir amid harvesting||BATHINDA: In a bid to keep the farmers’ struggle going strong during the crucial wheat harvesting period, Sanyukta Kisan Morcha members have started mobilising activists from various sections of society, mainly central trade unions, employees and student organisations. Morcha leaders feel that since wheat harvesting continues for nearly three weeks, the strength of farm activists at protest sites on the Delhi borders is expected to decrease. However, the morcha has planned many programmes during this period, including the march towards Parliament, Baisakhi celebration and 24-hour blockade of KMP, for which more activists are needed. In view of this, people were urged to join the movement during a joint meeting held in Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana on Saturday. A forum, “Punjab for Farmers” was formed for the purpose. Its first meeting has been called in Jalandhar on April 7, where a coordination committee will be constituted to coordinate with the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha. The coordination committee will assign duties to reach protest sites and will apprise the morcha leadership about the number of activists arriving, after which morcha members will make arrangements for activists’ lodging and food. Senior SKM leader Prem Singh Bhangu said though activists of supporting organisations were reaching protest sites, it was an on and off process. Now however, activists would be more organised and committed, he said, adding that this process would continue for three weeks, probably till the end of April, when harvesting season would come to an end. Various organisations have assured full support to the protests. SKM leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Darshan Pal, Jagjit Singh Dallewal, Nirbhay Singh, Manjeet Singh Dhaner, Harmeet Singh Kadian, Surjit Singh Phool, Baldev Singh Sirsa and other leaders attended the meeting, apart from farm workers, women, employees, students, youth, commission agents, teachers, university staff, PAU Teachers' Union members, PAU Employees' Union members and PAU Students' Union members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/skm-turns-to-activists-to-sustain-stir-amid-harvesting/articleshow/81920889.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chandigarh||High moisture content: 90% wheat unsold in Karnal grain markets||By: Amit Kumar KARNAL: Around 90% of wheat coming to the mandis does not fulfill the procurement criteria due to the higher moisture content in Karnal district. As per official data till Sunday, a total of 9,000 metric tonnes of wheat had arrived in the mandis across the district, but only 871 metric tonnes out of the total has been procured so far. Notably, as many as 1,151 MT, out of total arrival of 1551 MT, has remained unsold at Karnal grain market alone. On Monday, TOI visited the Karnal grain market and found that a large number of farmers were facing difficulty in selling their produce due to high moisture content in wheat. As per the norms, the produce should not have more than 12% moisture content. The farmers demanded that the government should relax moisture content rules in view of the long winter spell this year. “I brought my produce at Karnal mandi on April 4, but a government inspector rejected my crop saying it had 13% moisture content. Now, I have to wait at least a day more to sell it. The government should purchase it as per last year moisture criteria,” said Satnam Singh, a farmer from Vikash Nagar, Karnal. “I brought my crop in the mandi on Sunday, but it is yet to be sold as it has 13.3% moisture content. Thus, I have been asked to dry it for a day or two,” said Rajpal, a farmer of Kutel village. Karnal mandi secretary Surender said, “About 9000 metric tonnes of wheat has arrived in 23 purchase centres of the district so far, but 8,129 MT produce had remained unsold as it has moisture content higher than the permissible limit. We will procure every grain of the farmers on MSP when it fulfills the procurement criteria.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/high-moisture-content-90-wheat-unsold-in-karnal-grain-markets/articleshow/81920870.cms||---

Rai said the Centre had set the target of expanding 2,338 hectares of green cover in the capital, but Delhi government had increased it to 4,654 hectares. Like the previous year, the Kejriwal-led government will be working extensively on tree plantations this year, too, and similar campaigns will be initiated, he added. The government aims to plant two crore trees within a span of five years. “During the pandemic, the forest department identified 13 medicinal plants, which on World Environment Day were distributed for free in the city. Jamun, neem, arjun, anwla, kari patta, giloy, and other medicinal plants were distributed through nurseries across the capital,” he added. Rai said the government had formed a committee that would work on replacing Vilayati Kikar trees with endemic plants of international standards. This work will take place under Delhi Ridge Project. “There are plants that purify the air quality more than others, including peepal, neem, guler, amaltaas, and pilkhan. We are going to try and plant more such trees. With this, we will be further ahead in combating air pollution,” he said. Rai congratulated various departments on the success of the plantation drive. “The Kejriwal government will present the roadmap of the coming year in another month after conducting joint meetings with various departments. We will make sure we achieve the targets set by the central government and will put up greater benchmarks for ourselves,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/32l-saplings-planted-210-higher-than-target-rai/articleshow/81939420.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh quits as home minister as HC asks CBI to probe ‘graft’||MUMBAI: Anil Deshmukh resigned as Maharashtra home minister hours after the Bombay high court on Monday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary inquiry into allegations of “corrupt malpractices” made by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh against him. A CBI team from New Delhi is slated to arrive in the city on Tuesday to initiate the probe after discussing the court order with its legal team. Singh had, in an 8-page letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, alleged Deshmukh had met subordinate police officers, including suspended API Sachin Waze, and asked for “collection” of Rs 100 crore from various establishments in Mumbai. Deshmukh has denied the allegations, and his party NCP had earlier said there was no need for him to quit though the BJP had demanded his resignation. Another senior NCP leader and labour and excise minister Dilip Walse Patil is likely to take over the reins of the home department from Deshmukh. The excise department will be entrusted to Ajit Pawar, while the labour department will be given to rural development minister Hasan Mushriff. Deshmukh is the second minister of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, in power for one year and four months, to quit in the wake of a controversy. His resignation, the first in the ‘Wazegate’ controversy, comes a little over a month after Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Rathod quit as forest minister following a scandal over the suicide of a 22-year-old woman in Pune. Accompanied by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Deshmukh first called on NCP president Sharad Pawar on Monday to brief him on the outcome of the public interest litigation filed by Singh before the HC. Pawar quickly approved Deshmukh’s plea to resign from the cabinet “on moral grounds”. Deshmukh is counted among the trusted aides of Sharad Pawar but had been at the receiving end for inept handling of the Waze episode. In a brief letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Deshmukh said that since the HC had directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary probe against him, he did not think it fit to continue in the cabinet on moral grounds. “While disposing of a petition filed by Jayashree Patil, the High Court has asked the CBI director to conduct a preliminary probe against me. Under such circumstances, on moral grounds, I feel I should quit. I am quitting on my own, please relieve from my post of home minister,” Deshmukh stated in the letter. Deshmukh’s resignation was later accepted by governor B S Koshyari. The NCP was apparently taken by surprise when the HC asked the CBI to conduct a preliminary probe in the matter. All along, the NCP had expected that since the Supreme Court has declined to step in and the state government had set up a one-man high-level committee of Justice Kailash Uttamchand Chandiwal to probe into the charges of corruption raised in Singh’s letter, the chapter would be a closed one. In his letter to the CM, Singh had, apart from mentioning his own unceremonious exit from the Mumbai CP’s post, raised two key issues: the “target” allegedly given by Deshmukh to Waze, and the alleged pressure exerted by the home minister on Mumbai police to register an abetment to suicide case in the death of Dadra Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha MP Mohan Delkar. Singh had said that after Waze’s meeting with Deshmukh, the API had come to his office and narrated his interaction with the home minister. Singh had also written that he had briefed NCP president Sharad Pawar, CM Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar about the matter in view of its seriousness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukh-quits-as-home-min-as-hc-asks-cbi-to-probe-graft/articleshow/81921786.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Ahmedabad||Pothole appears on new flyover at Hatkeshwar||Ahmedabad: The new Chhatrapati Shivaji flyover in Hatkeshwar, which was opened to commuters in August, has developed a pothole of about 1.5 feet in diameter right on top of the carriageway. A team of experts including engineers of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) visited the spot on Monday morning. The team claimed that the wearing coat of the carriageway had been “punctured” by a truck with an impact of 70 tonnes or more. This damage exposed the steel reinforcements beneath the macadam and left locals wondering how a new bridge got damaged so quickly. None of the officers at the site divulged any reasons nor did they comment on whether the contractor of the bridge will be questioned on the issue. The engineers found that even the macadam layer close to the punctured spot on the carriageway has come undone. A senior AMC official told TOI that the spot will be repaired by concrete stamping. “The process will take place at the night when there is less traffic,” says the senior AMC official. The Hatkeshwar flyover was inaugurated along with the Maharana Pratap flyover in Bapunagar in August. “The puncture was right on top of the pier or pillar of the flyover, which stalled further expansion of the pothole,” said a senior AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pothole-appears-on-new-flyover-at-hatkeshwar/articleshow/81919662.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Medical oxygen usage jumped 516% in 43 days||NAGPUR: A staggering 516% jump in medical oxygen use in 43 days between February 21 and April 4 this year underlines the severity of the Covid infection spread in the district. Data released by Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) showed that oxygen consumption was 19 metric tonne on February 21 this year. On Sunday (April 4), the data revealed consumption of 117 metric tonne medical oxygen. The rise had been steady and uniform over the period with the steepest jump registered between March 25 and March 26 when it had increased from 81 metric tonne to 91 metric tonne followed by another seven metric tonne (98 MT) on the following day, i.e. March 27. In view of the scarcity and growing demand vis-à-vis shooting number of Covid patients requiring hospitalization, district collector Ravindra Thakare had instructed the lone liquid oxygen manufacturing unit of Nagpur — Inox Air Production Private Limited — to produce and supply the gas only for medical use by suspending production of industrial grade oxygen. FDA authorities, under joint commissioner Mahesh Gadekar and assistant commissioner PM Ballal, too have suggested judicious use of oxygen by the hospitals. Strict monitoring of production, supply and proactive measures like getting supply from Bhilai by FDA and the central control room did now allow oxygen stock to dwindle so far, said sources. Despite high demand, the balance stock of oxygen in the district has remained around 142 metric tonne. Though the production had decreased from around 182 MT on March 3 to 174 MT on March 4, the increased outsourcing of around 67 MT had led to an optimum stock position. “We are exploring all options to save and supply oxygen to hospitals so that there is no shortage, but at the same time we cannot afford over-stocking. The hospitals have been told to conduct checking of their oxygen supply mechanisms,” said a FDA source, adding oxygen audit at the hospitals is set to kick start soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/medical-oxygen-usage-jumped-516-in-43-days/articleshow/81920909.cms||Soumitra Bose

The details of these geosites, discovered by the geologists of Kutch University over the 20 years, have been recently published in the reputed journal of ‘The European Association for Conservation of Geological Heritage.’“This basin is a natural museum of geology. Some geosites even date back to the Jurassic Age. If declared a geopark, it will also help in the socio-economic development of the locals as they will become tourist spots,” said MG Thakkar, head of department, earth and environment science, Kutch university.The 75 sites are grouped under nine geo stations which can be declared as India’s first geopark which covers Lakhpat Fort, Mata Na Madh, Dholavira, Mandvi Beach, Bhujiya Hill, Gangeshwar Temple, Gadhsisa bauxite field among others.The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has started recognizing geoparks across the world under its UNESCO Global Geopark programme with an objective of giving due recognition to these sites which can be an important source of study and research as well as preservation.The Geological Survey of India (GSI) has identified 26 geosites across the country to be developed as geoparks but not a single from Kutch figures in the list.The paper emphasizes that the Kutch basin merits a place amongst the important geoheritage sites of the world.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray asks PM to allow vax for all aged above 25||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday to allow vaccination for everyone aged above 25 years as inoculating a higher number of young and working population could reduce the intensity of the Covid-19 spread. In Maharashtra, more than 38% of the 30.5 lakh cases have been reported from the age groups of 21-40 years that currently do not qualify to get the vaccine. Thackeray has also asked the Centre for 1.5 crore doses to vaccinate the population over 45 in six districts currently seeing a surge. “Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad can be covered in a matter of three weeks if 1.5 crore doses are made available to the state,” the CM wrote, adding Maharashtra has administered the highest doses by any state so far. Till Sunday, around 76.9 lakh doses were administered, with a record high of 4.6 lakh being given on a single day on April 3. This is the second instance where Maharashtra has asked the Centre to lower the age barrier and allow younger people to get vaccinated. Prior to this, deputy CM Ajit Pawar had asked the Centre to make an exception for Maharashtra and allow vaccination for all above 18 years. The Centre did not respond to the request, though its decision to allow vaccination for all above 45 years, irrespective of comorbidities, came shortly after Thackeray’s formal appeal. Doctors have backed the state’s move. Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death audit committee, said nearly 50 of the around 740 deaths from MMR were among people below 45. “Around 15-20% of them had some comorbidities, but the rest were healthy. Some succumbed due to late arrival while others due to complications,” he said. Infectious diseases expert Dr Om Srivastava said, “Infections among adolescents and young adults have grown in a big way. At least the young with comorbidities should be given the vaccine,” he said. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, an advisor to the state, said the Centre should make an exception for Maharashtra by allowing vaccination of people above 25. Meanwhile, vaccination picked up in Mumbai on Monday with 52,740 jabs compared with 28,000 on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-uddhav-asks-pm-to-allow-vax-for-all-aged-above-25/articleshow/81919672.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Coimbatore||Bribing of voters rampant across Coimbatore||Curtains came down on campaigning on Sunday, but political party cadres appear to have become even busier on Monday with allegations of cash distribution for votes flying thick and fast across Coimbatore.Flying squads were occupied throughout the day as political parties kept complaining about the other of bribing voters. The flying squads did rush to the spots but had to return disappointed as the cadres managed to flee the spot. In some places, cadres of rival parties came close to exchanging blows as they either vied with each other to distribute cash or prevent the other from doing so.The Thondamuthur assembly segment was at the centre of controversy as DMK and AIADMK levelled charges. Social media was agog from the morning that up to Rs 10,000 was being distributed per vote in the Thondamuthur constituency.That sparked off a flurry of phone calls and messages by politicians, police and media if the messages about the astonishing sum being given were true. Inquiries revealed that political parties did distribute money in Thondamuthur, but it ranged from Rs 500 to a maximum of Rs 2,500 only. “The highest of Rs 2,500 was paid in certain pockets of the segment populated by a section of people,” an intelligence officer said.In constituencies like Kavumdampalayam and Mettupalayam, the sum paid to a vote ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000, a cross-section of voters, police and party men confirmed. “We were receiving telephone complaints that at Singanallur, one party gave Rs 1,000 while the other gave up to Rs 2,000,’’ the officer said.But then the cash was distributed to all the voters in the segments. The political parties chose only localities that favour them and those considered politically neutral. “There are some localities where the entire population would vote for a certain party. In such places, only those candidates who are hopeful of getting their votes would distribute,” a political functionary said. This was to ensure that they don’t shift allegiance to another party.In some segments, though political parties had initially decided to distribute cash, candidates had tightened their purse strings at the last moment fearing that they would lose and the money distributed would go waste.Complaints of money distribution started more than 20 days back when DMK MP R S Bharathi lodged a complaint that AIADMK leader S P Velumani was collecting mobile numbers of voters in his segment. This he alleged was to transfer money through Google Pay. There were multiple searches since then and several seizures as well.About 12 people have been booked for cash distribution in the last few days – two in Kattoor, four in Kuniamuthur, one in Saibaba colony, three in Sulur, two in Podanur. All these men invariably had a list of voters in their locality and cash ranging from a few hundred to several thousand. There were searches at the resident of former Mayor P Rajkumar who had joined DMK recently on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bribing-of-voters-rampant-across-coimbatore/articleshow/81920939.cms||---

Following government intervention, the price of remdesivir injection has now come down to almost one-fourth of its earlier price (from Rs 2,700 to Rs 650). The drug is extensively used in treatment for Covid patients with moderate to severe symptoms,” he said.Lale said there are no district guidelines in place for administering remdesivir injections and treating doctors have to take a call on when to use the antiviral drug depending on the level of Covid infection. “Patients with moderate to severe infection may be administered remdesivir injections,” he added.As per FDA data, till February 1, the daily consumption of remdesivir was about 276 units. By March 1, the usage went up to 287 injections per day. By April, the number rose to 2,114 per day. The consumption has further increased to the current 2,774 injections per day as on April 4.“Despite a rise in the demand for remdesivir injections, Aurangabad district has enough stock available. In case of any complaints related to availability or pricing of these, patients or their families can contact on the phone number 9767270368,” M K Kaleshwarkar, joint commissioner (drugs) of FDA, Aurangabad, said.As per official data, Aurangabad district has 9,937 active Covid cases, including 2,346 patients taking treatment at private hospitals, 190 patients at district civil hospital and another 495 patients admitted to the government medical college and hospital (GMCH).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/10-fold-rise-in-daily-remdesivir-use-in-aurangabad-since-march-1/articleshow/81918382.cms||Prasad Joshi

Now, we are selling the same quantity for Rs 70 to Rs 80,” he told TOI.“Farmers in the region had spent over Rs 1 lakh for cultivating tomatoes in an acre. They will have to spend a few thousand more to harvest and transport tomatoes to commission mandis. We have to pay a farmhand Rs 800 a day to harvest 12kg tomatoes. We also need to spend at least Rs 25 for transporting a box. As farmhands from nearby districts including Salem are yet to reach the district, we are witnessing labour shortage. Wages have gone up,” Jagannathan said.Only marginal farmers are harvesting and sending tomatoes to markets, said P Kandasamy, state secretary of the Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Association. “An oversupply has resulted in tomato prices crashing. As they don’t want to bear a huge loss, farmers have stopped harvesting and are feeding it to their cattle,” he said. Tomatoes are sold in the market for Rs 10 to Rs 25, said vegetable trader Ramaraj. “This year, tomato production has gone up by 50% due to good rain, leading to price crash.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tomato-farmers-stare-at-loss-asprice-crashes-on-bumper-crop/articleshow/81920944.cms||Nivedha Selvam

He is contesting as an independent candidate. Durgaa Prasaahd was expelled from the party for contesting as an independent candidate from Yanam constituency after All India NR Congress (AINRC) was allotted the constituency under the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). He went missing on April 1. His wife Shanthi Pemmadi lodged a police complaint on the same day.Yanam SP Rajasankar Vellat said police registered a case under Section 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine a person) of the IPC and launched a hunt for him. “We got information that the independent candidate was admitted to Kakinada government general hospital on Sunday night,” said Vellat.Vellat said Durgaa Prasaahd in his statement said, a couple of strangers had approached him near his house on April 1 and assaulted him. They gagged and blindfolded him and took him in a car to an undisclosed location where he was assaulted again. The SP said police have started an investigation to ascertain his version of the story. “He could not furnish any vital information that would help us in identifying the attackers,” said Vellat.His brother Pemmadi Paparao, a software professional, said Durgaa Prasaahd does not have any visible injuries except one on his neck but has severe internal injuries. “We suspect political rivalry behind the kidnapping and attack. The constituency was allotted to the AINRC under NDA and hence he could not contest on the BJP ticket. So, he filed his nomination papers as an independent candidate. He paid a huge price for his decision as the party sacked him. We are living in fear. We urge police to arrest those involved in the crime,” Rao said.Five-time MLA and former minister Malladi Krishna Rao decided not to contest in the forthcoming polls and pledged his support to AINRC founder N Rangasamy, who is contesting from two constituencies including Yanam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/missing-former-president-of-yanam-bjp-unit-found-in-ap/articleshow/81920984.cms||Bosco Dominique

---||Amritsar||BJP MLA assault case: Main accused among 5 arrested||BATHINDA: Police on Monday arrested five persons allegedly involved in thrashing and stripping BJP MLA Arun Narang in Malout town of Muktsar district on March 27. Narang had gone to Malout to hold a press conference when a mob had thrashed him and stripped him. The arrested accused include Lakhanpal Sharma, block president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Sidhupur). He is alleged to be leading the farmers who reached the BJP office on March 27. Other four arrested have been identified as Alamwala village residents Jasmel Singh alias Nikka and Sandip Singh, Kuldip Singh of Enna Khera village, and Kulwinder Singh of Danewala village. Muktsar senior superintendent of police D Sudarvizhi said police had arrested 30 persons in the case so far. Earlier, BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) district president Sukhdev Singh from Bura Gujjar village, district general secretary Nirmal Singh from Jasseana village, and treasurer Nanak Singh from Fakarsar village, had surrendered in the case. SSP said the police have traced all accused after scanning video footage of the incident and on the basis of statements by the complainants. A police source claimed that Midha threw black ink on the MLA, while Kuldeep Singh and Mandeep Singh tore his shirt. Kulwinder Singh, Sandeep and Jasmail Singh were seen beating the MLA during the protest, added the source. In the meanwhile, photos of Lakhanpal Sharma have surfaced with leaders of Aam Aadmi Party, including MP Bhagwant Mann. It is said Lakhpanpal was active during the previous parliamentary elections. BJP leader Vineet Joshi said it had become clear that AAP was behind the incident as Lakhanpal was often seen with AAP leaders and another person, Bachittar, had spoken against BJP on March 30 and he was also associated with AAP. AAP MLA Harpal Cheema said false allegations were being levelled on AAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/main-accused-among-5-arrested-in-bjp-mla-assault-case/articleshow/81920974.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Five years’ RI for 61-year-old man who sexually assaulted 4-yr-old neighbour||MUMBAI: Observing that a 61-year-old man, a grandfatherly figure, had betrayed the trust of his neighbours who had allowed their four-year-old child to play in his house, a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court recently convicted and sentenced him to five years’ rigorous imprisonment for sexually assaulting the minor. “The accused breached the trust and committed sexual assault upon the victim of tender age. Considering the factual aspect no leniency can be shown to the accused and the... sentence will meet the ends of justice,” the court said. The accused was also fined Rs20,000. which is to be given to the child as compensation after the appeal period is over. In July 2015, the child and her siblings were at home with their grandmother, and others of her family were away at hospital tending to her ailing paternal grandmother. The child confided in her aunt when she returned home. Even as the accused claimed that he was falsely implicated as he had refused to rent out his flat, the court refuted his defence. The court said the the child’s aunt and their family immediately confronted the accused about the incident. The court said there was no reason for the family to falsely implicate the accused when there were good relations between the families and children were regularly going to the house of the accused. “It is unbelievable that the future of a four-year-old child will be put at stake for no reason,” the court said. The court said evidence of the child and her aunt was consistent. “There is no evidence to show the victim was tutored or in the first place there was reason for tutoring for false implication. In the circumstances, the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt,” the court said. The court did not accept the defence submissions that the child was too young to know the difference between good and bad touch. “Children are the most vulnerable targets of perpetrators since very young age. Hence, the need was felt to teach children about good and bad touch,” the court said.

---||Coimbatore||376 fresh Covid-19 cases take tally past 60K-mark||Coimbatore: The district recorded 376 fresh Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the total number of cases past the 60,000-mark, to 60,534.With 138 people getting discharged, the number of active cases stood at 2,436. No deaths were recorded due to the virus. Though the mortality rate of the current wave has been low, officials are alarmed at the rate of increase, which they say is the fastest among the city’s four waves. Data shows that the number of active cases in the district has increased six-fold in the span of one month and daily fresh cases have increased more than seven-fold in one month. At the continuing rate of increase, which is pegged at 10% daily, health department officials fear the daily fresh case count will increase to 500 a day within Monday.“The impact of election on increasing cases will be seen only after two weeks. Once movement of people reduces, the fall in cases or the curve could also be drastic,” an official said.With 376 cases and hardly 3,300 samples tested, positivity rate already has crossed 10%.Coimbatore has notably seen four waves of the virus — one in last April, when returnees of the Tablighi Jamaat cluster tested positive, followed by international, inter-district and inter-state arrivals, followed by the gold cluster in Selvapuram and the most recent spike.“While in April we saw days where there was a spike in cases due to tracing and testing, it was not a consistent increase. In June also, the daily fresh case figures ranged from four to 26 a day. However, in July after the gold cluster broke out, the number of cases rose slowly and steadily right up to October beginning,” said the official.The gold cluster, with hubs in Selvapuram and Town Hall combined with industrial clusters, saw cases increasing from 45-odd a day to 400-cases a day in two months.However, this time cases have increased from 50 a day in and around March 5 to 376 cases a day in exactly a month. “This is the fastest spike we have seen,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/376-fresh-covid-19-cases-take-tally-past-60k-mark/articleshow/81921017.cms||---

His father donated him a kidney but within a day, the nephrotic syndrome triggered the fear of failure of the transplanted kidney. Yash, a native of Gir-Somnath district, thus had to undergo plasmapheresis. It is a very costly therapy to remove blood plasma from the body by withdrawing blood and transfusing cells back into the bloodstream. After as many as fifty plasmapheresis sessions, the transplanted kidney began responding positively. It now maintains normal creatinine levels. “Plasmapheresis usually costs up to 2,000 USD per session overseas but at IKDRC this therapy has been hugely subsidized through governmental and charitable support,” said Dr Vineet Mishra, director of IKDRC. Even so, each session costs Rs 15,000. His entire cost was over Rs 25 lakh which was covered under the school health programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/teen-undergoes-plasmapheresis-at-ikdrc/articleshow/81919703.cms||---
---||Mumbai||High-end nozzles to be installed in coastal rd tunnels in Mumbai||The BMC will install Saccardo nozzles also known as impulse nozzles inside the tunnels of the coastal road to improve ventilation. Officials said that the coastal road has two 2.07km tunnels and these high end nozzles will be installed in both the tunnels to supply external air into the tunnel, officials said. Officials said, Saccardo nozzles introduce an air jet into a tunnel at high velocity. This air jet imparts most of its momentum to the tunnel air, and helps to drive the tunnel air in a particular direction. The nozzles supply external air into a tunnel by fans situated in a fan chamber outside the tunnel. “This system will be installed in road transport tunnels for the first time in the country,” said Suprabha Marathe, chief engineer, coastal road project. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/high-end-nozzles-to-be-installed-in-coastal-rd-tunnels-in-mumbai/articleshow/81921085.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Track electrification work to be completed by June||Coimbatore: Electrification of railway line between Pollachi, Kinathukadavu and Podanur is expected to be completed by June.The 41km stretch is part of Railway Electrification Organization’s programme to electrify the line between Palakkad town, Pollachi and Dindigul, and Pollchi and Podanur. The work is being executed by L&T. For electrification of the stretch between Podanur and Pollachi, 906 masts sourced from Raipur, each weighing 400kg and measuring 9.5m, were erected. Portals and cross booms are being erected in Kinathukadavu yard, an engineer said. 25kV for the service will be supplied from Podanur. Two switching stations are being constructed at Chettipalayam and Kinathukadavu.Work at stretches including Pollachi and Dindigul, and Pollachi to Palakkad are expected to be completed in December.Electrification will improve speed, save money and ensure smooth operation, an official with the Palakkad railway division said. “An electric train takes two minutes for initial energization compared to the diesel train, which takes 15 minutes. Engine can accelerate and decelerate much faster, saving travel time. Mainline electric multiple unit (Memu) trains are bidirectional, reducing need for engines to be moved or changed. This will reduce travel time,” he said.“Electricity to operate trains cost lesser than diesel. Electric engine does not have to be replaced by a diesel engine from Podanur, which delays goods trains, just because the stretch is not electrified. Since we don’t have to change diesel engine, it will give us more flexibility in operation,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/track-electrification-work-to-be-completed-by-june/articleshow/81921014.cms||---

The new facility will cost the exchequer Rs 1.5 crore. Currently, Goa sends its samples for genome testing to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune in the absence of the facility here. “The results of 15 samples sent to NIV last month, are yet to be received,” said Rane, adding with such a facility in the state, tests can be conducted expeditiously. He said that Goa Medical College dean S M Bandekar will submit the proposal in this regard to the government shortly. As of now, Goa is the dark if any new strain other than regular Covid-19 has its presence in the state. Genome sequencing of samples of the UK returnees to Goa last year was conducted, and four samples had shown the presence of the UK strain. All four persons were isolated and sent home only after their samples returned negative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-mulls-genome-testing-facility-to-check-covid-strains/articleshow/81921065.cms||---

Such incidents have been on the rise over the last couple of years in Goa. In the last eight months itself, Monday’s case is the fifth reported where either the body of a newborn or a healthy new born has been discovered in abandoned state. Bicholim police said the day-old newborn girl was found wrapped in a plastic bag. Residents, who were out to dispose their garbage found the baby after they heard its cry. The residents immediately informed the police who arrived at the scene and took possession of the baby. The infant has been sent to Goa Medical College and Hospital. Bicholim police have filed a case against unknown persons and further investigations are on. In October last year, a mutilated body of a female infant aged around two months was found at Siridao, creating a furor among locals. In August 2020, an infant’s body was similarly found in a garbage pile at Vasco. A year earlier, in August 2019, an infant baby boy was discovered abandoned in the garbage at Mapusa and the police were able to identify the parents, who said they had abandoned the child as it was their third and they had no means to care for the baby.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/infant-found-abandoned-in-garbage-at-sakhali/articleshow/81921094.cms||---
---||Pune||Maha RT-PCR diktat lacks scientific basis, say experts||Pune: Experts have found that the diktat in the Maharashtra government’s April 4 notification to either get vaccinated completely or carry a negative RT-PCR report valid for up to 15 days lacks scientific basis and reason. Covid vaccination, experts say, only protects an individual from developing a severe disease, but the vaccinated person may still catch the infection or transmit it to others. Besides, an RT-PCR negative report only reflects the person’s status at the time of testing and does not mean that she or he may not turn positive if tested again. Hence, allowing a negative report validity of 15 days, experts say, is illogical. Senior officials from the state health ministry and task force, however, defend the order as “just an attempt to find a midway to catch superspreaders from people engaged in essential services that have been allowed during the period of stringent restrictions”. “The objective is to identify the superspreaders fast and keep them away from mingling with a large chunk of the population they are likely to come in contact with owing to the nature of their jobs. This norm will come into force from April 10,” a senior state task force member said requesting anonymity. The SARS-COV-2 incubation period is generally about 3-5 days. This means an infected person can develop the disease generally within five days and up to 14 days after coming in contact with the virus. “It is often seen that close contacts of an infected person test negative initially but the same individual, when tested on the fifth day of coming in contact with infected person, tests positive. This is because the commonest incubation period (of developing the disease) is five days of contracting the virus. This may go up to 14 days,” said senior physician D B Kadam, who heads the task force in Pune. Since the state government’s main thrust is to catch the asymptomatic carriers, every person involved in essential services, including public transport drivers, needs to undergo the RT-PCR test at least once during the period of the stringent restrictions. “If an essential worker is asymptomatic and has tested negative on RT-PCR, then it could be held a valid certificate for 15 days unless he/she develops symptoms in between or is termed as a close contact of an infected person. In that case, she or he will have to undergo the RT-PCR test again,” a health ministry official said. A senior health official said, “Mandating a negative RT-PCR test is just a midway. We need to have a cut-off for RT-PCR tests. It has no scientific basis.” Some experts also feel that the vaccinated individuals are “poor spreaders”. Community and preventive medicine expert Arvind Kushwaha of All India Institute of Medical Science, Nagpur, said, “A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that those who have had the shot may actually be far less at risk for transmitting Covid-19. The study was done in Covid vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. The similar data will emerge in our Covishield and Covaxin as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-rt-pcr-diktat-lacks-scientific-basis-say-experts/articleshow/81921087.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The civic body has replied that, “there was no such office circular.” Two RTI applications were filed with the AMC central office in early March demanding a copy of the office circular.In fact, in the second RTI application, Kalupur resident Pankaj Bhatt sought a reply as to why the mandatory “standard vigilance notice board” informing people to not pay bribes and providing contact details of vigilance and anti-corruption bureau (ACB) helpline were not provided. “The AMC reply clearly stated that there was no office order mandating the IPC board. While on the other hand none of the AMC sub-zonal offices today have basic information on functions and duties and powers of its officers and employees as per Section 4(1)(b) of the RTI Act,” says Bhatt. Most of the boards have come up at ward offices of various zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rti-activists-reveal-board-game-in-the-civic-body/articleshow/81919711.cms||---

GCCI president Manoj Caculo has also said that the government should allow industrial units to vaccinate all their employees irrespective of their age. Indicating concern within the private sector of a fresh lockdown and an impact on the demand-supply ecosystem, GCCI also made a public appeal for Covid appropriate behaviour in the state, including the use of masks and restrictions on public gatherings and events. “We are noticing that a lot of people are avoiding the vaccination drive and a lot of doses are going to waste,” said Caculo while speaking to TOI. “We request industrialists to take the Covid vaccine if they are eligible. I would further request them to encourage their employees and their families to go in for vaccination and extend them whatever help required to facilitate their vaccination.” Caculo said that while the government and various agencies were making all efforts to control the pandemic, citizens and industrialists are also responsible for ensuring Covid appropriate behaviour is “strictly observed” in public places. “After a sustained decline in the number of active Covid-19 cases in the country for about five months, we have recently witnessed a fresh surge in such cases in our state. We will be putting a strain on the economy once again if the cases increase,” said Caculo. GCCI has also supported the proposal moved by Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry seeking permission for industrial units to take up vaccination drives for their employees irrespective of the age. “Even after vaccination there should be no let up in following Covid appropriate behaviour in public places since the immunity against Covid-19 does not develop immediately after the inoculation,” the GCCI president said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/get-vaccinated-follow-covid-norms-gcci-tells-goa-inc/articleshow/81921076.cms||---

The vehicular movement in the area remained disrupted for hours due to the protest. “This water crisis has been going on for months now. We have asked the concerned officials to fix the hand pumps in the area multiple times but all in vain so far. We are forced to wait in queues for hours to get two buckets of water. Even the kids are losing on their crucial study hours as they have to wait in these queues. This water shortage is impacting our daily lives adversely,” said Ganga Devi, a local. Even as the Uttarakhand government has been making tall claims regarding the “Har Ghar Nal” (tap in every house) scheme, the residents of the ward say that they had been dependent on the hand pumps in their ward for years and even those have been lying dysfunctional for months now. Upon getting the information of the road blockade, the police reached the spot and somehow convinced the protestors to clear the Bhagirathi-Aare bypass road. Later in the day, Jal Sansthan Board arranged water tankers for the residents of the area. DR Verma, inspector, Kapkot police station, said, “The problems will be looked into by the concerned departments.” Locals in the Khatyari area of Almora are also dealing with a similar water crisis due to a lack of rain spells. Each household is provided with 10 litres of water by the Jal Sansthan Board. Irked with water shortage, locals met with department officials on Monday and demanded that piped water should be provided in each household at the earliest possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/women-block-road-in-bageshwar-demanding-regular-water-supply/articleshow/81918858.cms||---
---||Goa||Edu keen to use his La Liga experience to guide FC Goa in ACL||Panaji: Edu Bedia knows what it means to punch above the weight on a consistent basis. For four years during his time with Racing Santander in La Liga, Spain’s top-tier football league, his team were pitted against heavyweights. Edu made his La Liga debut in 2008 and saw the club survive for three seasons with mid-table finishes until they got relegated in 2012. “I’ve spent a lot of my career playing against teams who are far superior than us,” Edu told TOI on Tuesday. “It means there was lot of running, lot of hard work and we had to position ourselves smartly to contain other teams. It will take something similar when we play teams in the AFC Champions League.” FC Goa will become the first Indian club to take part in the AFC Champions League, Asian football’s premier club competition, when they debut later this month at home. The teams in the group are all heavyweights, and includes last year’s finalists Persepolis FC from Iran. Qatar’s Al-Rayyan SC – coached by France’s World Cup winner Laurent Blanc – is another heavyweight, while the playoff winner will also provide a tough test. “Keeping in mind what sort of level we are playing in the Champions League, we will have to work hard. We are training with a lot of intensity, working hard to be as competitive as possible. We have to remember that this is not something that we have experienced before. It means situations will be different. “We are a team who like a lot of the ball, but we may not have the ball (for most of the game). It might be a positional game and we need to be smart about it. Obviously, it’s important that whenever we get the chances, we take them. Chances will be few and far between,” said the FC Goa captain. While in the Indian Super League (ISL) Goa are used to having more of the ball -- highest average possession (58%) and second most number of passes (9665) – Edu said the Asian Champions League will be a different ball game. “It’s about being smart in how we play. The teams will be significantly stronger than teams in ISL. What we do in the ISL may not be the most beneficial thing to do in ACL. We have to be little smarter. “We will have to change certain aspects. What we will do is compete hard and ensure that we don’t let anyone have an easy time. We have to make it difficult for teams who will be up against us,” he said. The group stage will be played entirely at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda, Goa’s home since inception. Edu himself has played here for the last four seasons. But while other teams will play here for the first time, the absence of fans will make it a level playing field. “The one thing that might help us a little bit is the climate,” said Edu. “We are more used to it than the other teams. Once we enter, the pitch and everything will be the same. There can't be any excuses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/edu-keen-to-use-his-la-liga-experience-to-guide-fc-goa-in-acl/articleshow/81938554.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Kolkata||BJP celebs slam Dilip for ‘rogre debo’ comment||Kolkata: BJP state president Dilip Ghosh’s “rogre debo” comment about artistes has elicited strong reaction from all corners, including celebrities supporting the party. Advising artistes to restrict themselves to song and dance and to leave politics aside, Ghosh in an interview to a Bengali newspaper said, “...na hole rogre debo. Aar shilipira janen ami kibhabe rograi (If they don’t leave politics aside, I will take care of them. And, artistes know how I do it).” Left-minded Sreelekha Mitra wrote on Facebook she felt “sorry” and “pity” for celebs in BJP. Even actor-turned-BJP worker Rupanjana Mitra took to social media to protest against “such disrespectful behavior”. Urging all BJP-supporting celebs, she wrote, “… stop being coward. Enough is enough! I do not support such disrespectful behavior.” Actor Rupa Bhattacharya, who is also a BJP member, said she was “shocked and hurt” at Ghosh’s choice of words and content. “This might be the way he speaks. As an artiste, I am not OK with it. But my personal experience says BJP doesn’t disrespect artistes. But I don’t support the selective rants of Tollywood’s rebels. They go all out against one party but turn blind when it comes to glaring errors of others. I don’t respect such intellectuals,” she said. Bhattacharya also pointed to a deeper malice in the system that often treated celebs as second-grade citizens in the political eco-system. “Many politicians don’t acknowledge celebrities’ contribution to their parties. Celebrities only go for campaigns but are not given a responsible portfolio. Deep down, there is a prejudice against celebs that insists the real field work can only be done by hardcore politicians. Unfortunately, celebs themselves are responsible for this. I can name only a few celebrities who have been performing, including Dev from Trinamool, Debdoot Ghosh from Left and Locket Chatterjee from our party,” she said. When TOI got in touch with Ghosh, he said, “Every person has the right to join politics. We have many examples of celebrities who have joined politics. I welcome celebrities from all professions to politics. Our candidate list shows that as well. But I have reservations about a class of artistes who are so-called apolitical. They selectively support a party and verbally abuse us. They do not say a word against Mamata Banerjee. If they want to do real politics, they should take us on directly. They must file nominations and contest the polls. ‘Rogre debo’ is a very colloquial term. In this context, I used it to mean defeat them in a democratic process.” Actor-director Kaushik Sen doesn’t buy Ghosh’s argument. “That’s just his political mastani at work. Time again, many like me have proved our apolitical stance, opposed the Trinamool government and spoken against CPM. In order to oppose one political force, we do not need the shelter of another political party,” Sen said. When Ghosh was told that artistes within BJP, including Mitra and Bhattacharya, have criticized his comments, he said many celebrities were in politics but they were not politicians. Referring to BJP’s Srabanti Chatterjee, Paayel Sarkar and Tanushree Chakraborty playing Holi with Trinamool’s Madan Mitra, he said, “Three or four celeb candidates from BJP danced with a leader of the opposition. Does this kind of thing happen in politics?” According to him, celebs who do “politics as a hobby” will never understand the sentiments of seasoned politicians who risk their lives. “A celeb has to prove what kind of politics he or she wants to do. Where are Moonmoon Sen and Sandhya Roy now?” he said. About artistes in his party, Ghosh said, “Celebs are new in our party. But we have the likes of Babul Supriyo, who is a minister. The party asked him to contest the assembly polls and look how he is giving his all to it. Many seasoned politicians might not be able to campaign the way Mithun Chakrabarty is doing at this age,” he said. Srabanti and Paayel, he said, were young and new in politics. “They will learn if they want to take politics seriously. They will be given a chance to prove themselves,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-celebs-slam-dilip-for-rogre-debo-comment/articleshow/81919559.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Goa||Time To Act||Even as Goa’s hospitals run out of beds and ICU facilities and Covid-positive patients are left stranded on stretchers, chief minister Pramod Sawant continues to claim that “the government is monitoring the situation” while asking people to “take care of themselves”. There is a year’s worth of evidence to point out that this kind of babuspeak is no match for the virus, which continues to spread and kill. There is an urgent need for enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviours. Instead of strictly implementing the SOPs and imposing heavy penalties for its violation, the government has been hiding behind empty rhetoric. While health minister Vishwajit Rane seems to continuously speak of strict curbs without making any effort to implement it, science and technology minister Michael Lobo thinks tourists won’t come to Goa if strict rules are enforced. Goa remains one of the only states that is still a free-for-all, with no testing, screening or Covid-negative certificates demanded at entry points. It comes as no surprise that it is also among the top states in the country with its positivity rate in double-digits. This must change. It is imperative that mask-wearing and social-distancing are enforced in the state, even for tourists, many of whom appear to believe that Goa is outside the virus’ jurisdiction. Goa can ill-afford another lockdown—it would have a devastating impact on various sectors of the economy. The time to act was a few weeks ago. The second-best time is now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/time-to-act/articleshow/81921095.cms||---
---||Pune||‘Functioning of weekly farmers’ markets will help reduce crowding’||Pune: The operators of weekly farmers’ markets in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad have decided to approach the Pune divisional commissioner and municipal commissioners with a demand that they be allowed to function in order to reduce overcrowding at local markets and Market Yard. Weekly farmers’ markets have been told not to operate in the latest restrictions imposed in both the cities since last week. “We had successfully held weekly markets last year when similar restrictions were in place. Even now, we can set up temporary markets at 95 places in both the cities to provide vegetables and fruits to residents in their neighbourhood. The functioning of the markets will help the administration in managing the crowd,” one of the operators said. The latest restrictions sparked huge crowding at Mahatma Phule Mandai and Gultekdi Market Yard in the last two days as people anticipated more curbs to come into effect. Narendra Pawar, convenor, weekly markets, said, “Social distancing and other Covid-19 related measures are followed diligently at weekly markets as against open markets, where monitoring becomes a major challenge. We have told the operators to maintain adequate distance between stalls. Also, the farmers are advised to follow norms and wear masks. The operators are strictly told not to overcharge and maintain variety in vegetables.” Pawar said that during last year’s lockdown, the weekly markets played a key role in providing fresh kitchen staple to residents. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) had identified the designated spots for farmers’ markets. The operators expect similar response from the administrations during the current restrictions as well. “We are approaching the authorities and are expecting a breakthrough in the next few days. We will also seek support from the state agriculture marketing board,” an operator said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/functioning-of-weekly-farmers-markets-will-help-reduce-crowding/articleshow/81919760.cms||Sarang Dastane

Talking to media, he said tourists have been coming in large numbers since October, while the Covid cases have started rising again only in March. During December, there were lakhs of tourists in the Calangute-Candolim beach-belt, but there were hardly any Covid cases, he said. “We cannot stop tourists because the economy is largely dependent on them, right from resorts, guest houses, to restaurants, rent-a-bike, rent-a-car operators, taxis, grocery stores, etc. It has been one year since the pandemic started. We cannot have another lockdown. We have to continue with our lives by taking precautions,” Lobo said. “We have to make sure all tourists wear masks. In fact, the Calangute police have collected the highest amount of money by fining tourists who were not wearing masks. I also urge all Goans to get themselves vaccinated because that is the only way to stay safe,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourists-coming-since-oct-surge-not-due-to-them/articleshow/81921105.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra RT-PCR diktat lacks scientific basis, say experts||PUNE: Experts have found that the diktat in the Maharashtra government’s April 4 notification to either get vaccinated completely or carry a negative RT-PCR report valid for up to 15 days lacks scientific basis and reason. Covid vaccination, experts say, only protects an individual from developing a severe disease, but the vaccinated person may still catch the infection or transmit it to others. Besides, an RT-PCR negative report only reflects the person’s status at the time of testing and does not mean that she or he may not turn positive if tested again. Hence, allowing a negative report validity of 15 days, experts say, is illogical. Senior officials from the state health ministry and task force, however, defend the order as “just an attempt to find a midway to catch superspreaders from people engaged in essential services that have been allowed during the period of stringent restrictions”. “The objective is to identify the superspreaders fast and keep them away from mingling with a large chunk of the population they are likely to come in contact with owing to the nature of their jobs. This norm will come into force from April 10,” a senior state task force member said requesting anonymity. The SARS-COV-2 incubation period is generally about 3-5 days. This means an infected person can develop the disease generally within five days and up to 14 days after coming in contact with the virus. “It is often seen that close contacts of an infected person test negative initially but the same individual, when tested on the fifth day of coming in contact with infected person, tests positive. This is because the commonest incubation period (of developing the disease) is five days of contracting the virus. This may go up to 14 days,” said senior physician D B Kadam, who heads the task force in Pune. Since the state government’s main thrust is to catch the asymptomatic carriers, every person involved in essential services, including public transport drivers, needs to undergo the RT-PCR test at least once during the period of the stringent restrictions. “If an essential worker is asymptomatic and has tested negative on RT-PCR, then it could be held a valid certificate for 15 days unless he/she develops symptoms in between or is termed as a close contact of an infected person. In that case, she or he will have to undergo the RT-PCR test again,” a health ministry official said. A senior health official said, “Mandating a negative RT-PCR test is just a midway. We need to have a cut-off for RT-PCR tests. It has no scientific basis.” Some experts also feel that the vaccinated individuals are “poor spreaders”. Community and preventive medicine expert Arvind Kushwaha of All India Institute of Medical Science, Nagpur, said, “A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that those who have had the shot may actually be far less at risk for transmitting Covid-19. The study was done in Covid vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. The similar data will emerge in our Covishield and Covaxin as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-rt-pcr-diktat-lacks-scientific-basis-say-experts/articleshow/81921101.cms||Umesh Isalkar

This time, it took place at Merces and was the result of a verbal spat between two poultry businessmen over a labourer. Businessman Prasad Fadte, 40, a resident of Betki, sustained injuries to his left arm. One bullet grazed his left arm while the other passed through, a senior police officer said. “The accused, who is since absconding, used his licenced gun to shoot at Fadte,” the officer said. The officer said that, around six months ago, a labourer who used to work for Fadte switched jobs and joined the accused’s poultry. However, the labourer had taken an advance of Rs 50,000 from Fadte, which he had demanded back. When the labourer told Fadte that he was unable to repay the amount, Fadte offered to allow him to rejoin his poultry, which was agreeable to the labourer, the police officer said. On Monday, Fadte went to the accused’s poultry farm to pick the labourer, which is when the altercation broke out. “After the verbal spat, the accused fired two bullets at Fadte,” the officer said. Fadte was immediately shifted to Goa Medical College. Police said that they have launched a search for the accused. A case has been registered under Section 307 (attempt to murder) and the Arms Act. In June 2020, one person was shot dead and several cars damaged in a shootout at Santa Cruz in the wee hours. Goa police said that a gang went to attack a person they had a previous rivalry with, but a member of the group itself succumbed to injuries after being shot in the chest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/one-shot-at-merces-over-business-spat/articleshow/81921115.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Rising mercury levels: Forest dept filling pits in Terai forests with water for wild animals||Rudrapur: Given the rising temperature levels and the scorching heat, the Uttarakhand forest department has started filling troughs and pits in the forest areas of the Terai region with water so that the wild animals do not stray into human habitation. “We aim to create water facilities so that animals do not have to walk for more than 1.5 kilometres,” said Jeevan Chandra Joshi, conservator of forests. The wildlife department is using water tankers with a capacity of 12,000 litres to carry out the task. Officials also said that there is no scarcity of water in the forest but there are a few places where there are no pits. This forces animals to venture out of their habitats into the human territories. Meanwhile, RK Singh, meteorologist at the GB Pant University, said that temperature will rise by at least two notches in the coming week. “The region has not received rainfall this season. Not only water holes in the forests will dry up soon but the water level in the region is set to drop by two feet. Even farmers will have to deal with a water crisis in the months before monsoon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rising-mercury-levels-forest-dept-filling-pits-in-terai-forests-with-water-for-wild-animals/articleshow/81918882.cms||Aakash Ahuja

---||Ahmedabad||Covid surge: 50% drop in passenger footfalls at Kalupur station in March||AHMEDABAD: The number of passengers in March at the Ahmedabad railway station in Kalupur saw a drastic fall, coming down by nearly 50% compared to February and January numbers. Officials at the Ahmedabad railway station said last-minute cancellations has increased many times over. If 10% of tickets were cancelled in December and January, since mid-March this figure increased to 30% and it is 50% or more in April. Senior divisional railway manager Ravindra Srivastava said passenger numbers have gone down dramatically. “Several states have made RT-PCR tests compulsory and with the increase in cases, people have put off travel plans. Only those who are compelled to travel are doing so. Casual travellers are cancelling their tickets.” A railway official said the Duronto Express from Pune had more than 550 tickets available in the 3-Tier AC segment for the Monday train, which was to leave Pune at 9.35pm. Some 550 seats were available was at pm on Monday. In 2-Tier AC, for the same train, 131 seats were available. Officers said that usually the fare for the Rajdhani Express changes with demand but on Monday the fare for 3-Tier AC was Rs 1,475, the base price. Within a week from the departure, train fares increase considerably and prices are usually over Rs 2,000 for a 3-Tier AC ticket. A senior officer said a family of four will pay Rs 3,200 extra to get themselves tested. “If a person comes from Mumbai, he will pay Rs 785 for a chair car ticket on the Shatabdi Express, and will have to spend Rs 800 for an RT-PCR test, more than the travel fare,” he said. Officials added that those returning after four days will have to get themselves tested again before going back. Officials said that the situation was the same for travel from Ahmedabad to Mumbai and Delhi. Officials said there are 600 chair car seats available on the Shatabdi Express leaving Ahmedabad for Mumbai on Tuesday, while there are 250 2-Tier AC seats available on the Rajdhani Express leaving Ahmedabad on Tuesday for Delhi. “It is clear that with the increase in Covid cases, there has been a decline in travel from and to Ahmedabad. Daily passenger footfalls at Ahmedabad station was more than one lakh per day in 2019,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-surge-50-drop-in-passenger-footfalls-at-kalupur-station-in-march/articleshow/81919767.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Total lockdown not needed, but stop train congestion, gatherings, say experts||MUMBAI: Some of the steps taken by the state like weekend lockdown, night curfew and movement restriction during the day could prove only “partially effective” in breaking the Covid infection chain unless congestion on local trains and other gatherings are not stopped effectively, feel doctors and epidemiologists. Cluster infections in closed spaces must be curtailed by enforcing work from home policies more stringently, they said. According to epidemiologist Giridhara Babu, strategies like night curfew could induce seriousness in the minds of people, but in terms of stopping the viral transmission, it may not be a major contributor. “Unless parties and pubs activities are completely stopped at night and congregations, be it religious, social, are not prevented during the day, most of the transmission dynamics won’t change much,” he said. In his opinion, what is required most is the prevention of clusters in enclosed spaces. “Where people are working in close spaces without masks, this is the time to allow them to work from home,” he said. Experts are unanimous that a total lockdown would have proved futile when there is full-blown community transmission, but several stressed on restricting train services. Local train arrangements should have gone back to the pre-February 10 routines when only emergency service providers could travel in general compartments, said former KEM dean Dr Avinash Supe. “No physical distancing is possible on local trains,” added Supe, who heads the Covid death audit committee. Incidentally, Mumbai witnessed a surge in cases 10 days after the local train restrictions were relaxed. Although trains are currently permitted to ferry the general public in three time slots, there is overcrowding. “Wherever people can gather, say shops, malls, hotels, cinema halls, schools, rallies --- all that has been stopped and it was the right move,” he said. Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava too backed the thought of curtailing local train timings, while hailing the decision to impose night curfew. “Post-8pm, trains shouldn’t run at all probably or with lesser frequency. The curbs during the daytime have to be enforced strictly if we want to see any results,” he added. On Sunday evening, the state announced a slew of restrictions to curtail people’s movements in the wake of rising cases. Called, ‘Break the Chain’, the restrictions include complete lockdown from Friday evening till Monday mornings, prohibition on assembly of more than five people during the day, night curfew daily from 8pm to 7am, closing of malls, religious places and shops selling non-essentials. The number of people who can travel in autos, taxis and buses have also been reduced. Srivastava, a member of the task force on Covid, said the state must evaluate the results closely in a few weeks to tweak them. Another task force member, who didn’t wish to be named, said more curbs should have been imposed during the day, even if for two weeks. TOI has learnt that the Covid task force had recommended shutting down malls, cinemas at least two months ago, but the government didn’t agree. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, adviser to the state government, said the government had to find a balance between life and livelihood. “People would not have supported a lockdown. Even these measures are being protested,” he said, emphasising that implementation would be the key. Dr Abhijit More from Jan Swasthya Abhiyan said the government should bring in more private beds for Covid care and not simply bank on the measures taken to control the second wave. The Covid taskforce member too added that the state must strengthen the basics of testing, tracing and creating containment zones as those are the areas where it has been found lacking. The Central teams that have visited Maharashtra have raised red flags over poor contact tracing and failure to implement micro containment efficiently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-total-lockdown-not-needed-but-stop-train-congestion-gatherings-says-experts/articleshow/81921120.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Environmentalist Arvin Bhatia’s Angels NGO has promoted organic food for 13 years, growing it in used plastic drums on his terrace first, from where the municipal corporation picked up the idea of motivating people to make compost out of wet waste on their rooftops. Bhatia said: “But before the initiative could take off, the lockdown was imposed.” Bhatia didn’t lose hope and taught people to turn kitchen waste into compost and use that to grow rooftop kitchen gardens. More than 500 households in Rohtak stopped dumping their wet waste and took to making compost at home. Ayurvedic medical officer Dr S S Kajal said: “I made plant beds out of junk items such as kitchen sink, desert cooler tank, utensils, buckets, bins, and plastic bottles. Atop my two-floor house, I grow all the tomato, onion, cauliflower, spinach, okra, and fennel seeds I need, and the family doesn’t need to buy it. Government schoolteacher Damini Sharma used the fee time of lockdown to find a new hobby in gardening after being motivated by the MC. Private school principal Kiran Bhutani said: “Looking for a creative pastime in the lockdown, I joined Rohtak Terrace Gardeners group on Facebook and WhatsApp, where I learnt the basics of terrace gardening to be able to do it successfully today.” Rohtak dentist Dr Sonia had a great interest in gardening but until the lockdown could not take to it. Today, she has a vegetable garden on her rooftop, which grown on her kitchen waste. Municipal commissioner Pardeep Godara said: “The urban landfills are growing bigger and bigger, so we planned the ‘Silent Revolution’ project to change the situation. The families that used to chuck their waste now recycle it. It reduces the time and resources that go into garbage management and gives the families fresh food for free.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lockdown-made-rohtak-city-of-rooftop-kitchen-gardens/articleshow/81921118.cms||Sat Singh

The Government Primary School Dungri in Dhumakot was reduced to ashes by the massive flames on Sunday night - three days after a primary school in Pauri's Tunkhaya which was left completely destroyed. Documents of students and the school administration were also lost. Forest officials have now directed school authorities of Pauri to clear the bushes in and around schools to avert future mishaps. School principal Roshan Lal said, “The old building caught fire. It was being used only for administrative work, not for classes. The school's old documents, files and furniture were stored there.” The school is upto Class V and as per the district basic education officer, KS Rawat, it was due to "negligence of the villagers that the building caught fire". “Villagers had lit fires in their farms and it had reached the old building,” Rawat alleged. There are some school buildings in the state which are old and dilapidated. It often comes under scanner during rains and inspections of the Child Rights Commission who then direct the state to demolish it. And in these two cases too, the buildings were over three to five decades old. “In Tunkhya, the school building was of 1962 while in Dungri, the building must have been built in late 70s or early 80s. Its entire base was on ‘chir pine’ logs and roof was made up of tin shades. The chir pine logs acted as a good source of fire and turned everything into ashes,” Rawat added. Meanwhile, Rawat inspected the Tunkhya-bases school on Monday - which was ravaged last Friday. The education department will submit a report to the district administration and then try to retrieve data of documents damaged in the fire. In Uttarakhand, Pauri district has lost the most number of forest land - 500 hectares - to more than 305 forest fire incidents in the past few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pauri-loses-one-more-school-to-forest-fire/articleshow/81918917.cms||Shivani Azad

Babulnath Mandir, Mumbadevi, Siddhivinayak and Ram Mandir (Wadala) were off bounds for devotees, as was Haji Ali Dargah and all churches. Archdiocese of Bombay announced that churches will be closed till April 30. Archbishop of Bombay Oswald Cardinal Gracias issued guidelines for sacraments, including baptism, confirmation, confession, marriage and burial, to be followed until then. He supplemented the circular with a video message to priests, urging them to obey Covid protocol, like masks to prevent even “accidental infection”. Since Section 144 has been imposed throughout the state (which limits a maximum of five people to a gathering), baptisms will be held in a small group. The minister, the child, its parents and godparents may be present for the sacrament. For marriages, which cannot be postponed, the Cardinal has directed just the nuptial blessings to be given without mass. Here, a maximum of 10 people may attend. Given that there is a complete curfew on weekends, marriages cannot take place without special permission from government authorities. The state government has decreed that up to 20 people may attend burial ceremonies, and the archdiocese has repeated that order. Bodies are to be taken directly to the cemetery. Burial prayers are to be said without burial mass. Confirmation ceremonies scheduled for April have been postponed until lockdown, which can be determined in consultation with the bishop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shrines-shut-church-issues-guidelines-for-sacraments/articleshow/81918316.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

Those booked include one of the staff members of New Civil Hospital (NCH), an employee of the agency hired for the cremation of bodies at NCH and three family members of the Hindu family who cremated the body mistaking it to be that of their family.  An inquiry has been ordered by the NCH superintendent to find out how the mistake was committed. NCH authorities have also asked doctors to check each body before handing them over to perform last rites. The complaint was lodged by Aqib Ansari (22), a resident of Saiyedpura area, and the accused were booked under various sections for IPC pertaining to negligence. In the incident, Ansari’s mother Shabana’s body was handed over to the family of Sushila Bagul on Saturday. The Bagul family cremated the body. When the Ansari family reached the hospital to collect the body, they came to know about the blunder. They staged an angry protest at the NCH after which police was called to ensure law and order.  Meanwhile, the Bagul family was also informed that the body they cremated was that of Shabana. Bagul's family had already left the city after cremation to reach their native in Maharashtra but was called back to take custody of the body of Sushila. “We have started registering statements of those named in the complaint and other concerned officials. After the detailed investigation, action will be taken against those responsible for the negligence,” said a police officer at Khatodara police station.  NCH superintendent S M Patel said, “The committee has already started an inquiry and based on the report, actions will be taken. Meanwhile, we have started a new arrangement in which the bodies will be handed over for last rites after a certificate is issued by the doctor on duty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/body-blunder-five-booked-for-negligence/articleshow/81919784.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: One year later, jobless daily wagers, migrants leave for villages again||MUMBAI: A year ago, 40-year old zari worker Shaligram Yadav had fled the lockdown after spending Rs 3,000 for a spot on a packed bus headed from Mumbai to Sultanpur. On Monday, the middle-aged tailor was among those jostling for a seat on the Faizabad-bound train pulling out of Kurla station. Yadav earned barely anything last year. The family mostly lived off the crop on their field. He returned to the zari unit in Mankhurd in November 2020. In five months, though, he was back to square one. “Last night, the seth told us that our tailoring unit is shutting down and we have to go home. I borrowed Rs 700 from a friend and bought a train ticket in black,” said Shaligram. With the Maharashtra government shutting shops, restaurants, markets and private offices as part of its lockdown-style restrictions to battle the second wave of the pandemic, it’s daily wagers who are worst hit. Many of them are migrants left without money or shelter in this expensive city. Their only option is to make the uncertain journey back to a precarious life in the village. Sitting next to Shaligram in the train bogey is Rajesh Rajput who was employed in a flower shop serving the iconic Siddhivinayak temple. “I used to earn Rs 500 a day in the shop but now there is no work left,” says Rajput who is heading back to Banda district in UP. He can no longer afford to pay rent worth Rs 3,000 a month for the shanty in Prabhadevi, which he shared with his others from his hometown. Auto driver Binay Choudhary says the two-passenger rule in auto-rickshaws, part of the new restrictions, was the last straw. “Over the last month when the cases started rising and people stopped venturing out, my earnings fell. Now with this new rule, the earnings through shared-autos will also fall,” he said. Instead, he plans to return to his village and try and earn during the harvest season. “At least I can earn Rs 200-300 per day as long as the season lasts,” he says. Binay had just enough money left to buy the train ticket. “I used to earn Rs 15,000 a month but by the end of it, I was just breaking even and had no savings,” he says. Some, like electrician Subhash Chandra Yadav decided to leave because their earnings had plummeted even though work was available. “I used to earn Rs 600 per day doing odd-jobs for building contractors but since March, my earnings had come down to just around Rs 300-350 per day. After the new rules, I will earn even less,” says Yadav who is headed back to Jaunpur in UP. Will he return to Mumbai? “Of course, we will all be back. After the harvest ends, there will be no work back home.” With the fear of a second complete lockdown in Maharashtra, migrant workers leave Mumbai||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/one-year-later-jobless-daily-wagers-migrants-leave-for-villages-again/articleshow/81922030.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

As per the protocol, all should have done Covid test,” the ACMO said. Sonika Srivastava from media cell of IIT Roorkee told TOI that all the students who are arriving at the institution are not being given entry without a Covid negative report. The institution is also adhering to seven days mandatory quarantine for the new joiners, Srivastava said. The institution also informed that Kotle Bhawan, Kasturba Gandhi Bhavan and Vigyan Kunj hostel has been made containment zone and the Covid negative students have been asked not to leave the campus. “Apart from students, many faculty and staff have been confirmed to have Covid infection.

A joint team of superintending engineers of Karnataka, Maharashtra had visited the Kalasa site in Kankumbi on March 19. Earlier, the apex court had directed the joint inspection committee to inspect the Kalasa project and submit a report in view of the state government’s claim that Karnataka has illegally diverted water from the Mhadei river. In October 2020, the state government filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court against Karnataka for illegal diversion of the Mhadei’s water to the Malaprabha river basin and sought a direction to restore the natural flow towards the state. The plea also stated that there is a sharp drop in water flow to Surla nullah that passes through the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, thus violating the Wildlife Protection Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sc-wants-kalasa-report-in-1-week/articleshow/81921117.cms||---

Industrial representatives further urged the authorities to allow vaccination for employees of all age groups. “The new requirement will still strain testing infrastructure in these areas. How will the authorities enforce this in any case? Will officials conduct inspections, or will companies be told to set up a task force?” an analyst said. Industrial bodies further said it was illogical for authorities to urge them to get workers vaccinated at the earliest. “In most sectors, most employees — formal and informal — are in the 18-45 age group and are not eligible for the vaccine. Vaccinations should be opened up to for every for this reason,” Prashant Girbane, director-general of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/industries-oppose-new-testing-mandate/articleshow/81919790.cms||---

---||Chennai||Counting in Tamil Nadu begins before polling, it is cash before votes||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu votes on Tuesday amid complaints of voter bribery from both AIADMK and DMK and seizures of more than Rs 230 crore in cash, besides a protest demonstration in one village demanding cash. Chief electoral officer Satyabrata Sahoo said his office has not received any communication from the Election Commission of India (ECI) on rescinding polls, following complaints of distribution of cash to voters by parties, in any assembly segment. Earlier in the day, the ruling AIADMK complained to the chief electoral officer seeking countermanding of polls in five assembly segments, where DMK leaders are contesting. These were Kolathur (DMK president M K Stalin), Chepauk – Triplicane (Udhayanidhi Stalin), Katpadi (general secretary S Durai Murugan), Trichy West (principal secretary K N Nehru) and Tiruvannamalai (former DMK minister E V Velu) where the AIADMK alleged its rival had distributed cash on a large scale to voters. Live updates: Polling underway in Tamil NaduIn a counter move, DMK organization secretary R S Bharathi petitioned governor Banwarilal Purohit for permission to file a criminal complaint against chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, deputy CM O Panneerselvam and revenue minister R B Udhayakumar for alienation of 10.5 acres of prime land at Koyambedu in the city. The governor’s office had just acknowledged the acceptance of the petition but did not issue any direction till late on Monday night. District administrations and the flying and static squads of the ECI, meanwhile, had a tough time as complaints of voter bribery poured in throughout the day and kept them on tenterhooks. The “cash for votes” ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 in several constituencies, where top leaders and ministers were contesting. Sahoo said the elections department had sent reports on seizure of cash and other materials from each constituency/sensitive constituency to the commission. Complaints of voter bribery flew thick and fast, as both the ruling AIADMK and the opposition DMK raised alerts throughout the day. “So far, we have no communication from the commission on that (rescinding polls in select assembly segments). All 234 seats will go to polls between 7am and 7pm,” Sahoo told TOI. The election control room in the Trichy collectorate received more than 100 complaints. While all the complaints were forwarded to the flying squads, some of the complaints turned out to be fake, said Trichy collector S Dhivyadarshini. From political parties bribing voters, Tamil Nadu has moved to an even more disturbing trend of people demanding cash for their votes. At Rasipuram constituency in Namakkal district, a group of people protested on the road alleging that they were left out by a political party during the cash distribution exercise in their village the previous day. No case was registered, while the police warned them to disperse. The flying squad teams and special surveillance teams and other enforcement agencies had seized cash and other materials worth Rs 433.92 crore until Monday. This included, cash seizure of Rs 230.27 crore, liquor worth Rs 5.14 crore, drugs and narcotics worth Rs 2.20 crore and precious metals like gold, silver ornaments worth Rs 176.22 crore, ECI said in a statement.

---||Chandigarh||Sukhbir ridicules govt’s proposed ‘white paper’ on PPAs||Nadala (Bholath): Ridiculing the announcement by the Punjab chief minister on bringing a white paper on power purchase agreements (PPAs), Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday said why Congress government couldn’t do the same in the past four years. Address a SAD rally at Nadala, he attacked the Congress government for providing expensive power to the consumers in the state even when the cost of production was quite low. “Their white paper has also turned black now. It is already over four years. It is their government, why could not they check the things in those years,” Badal said, while taking a jibe at Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh’s statement that government would come out with a white paper on the issue. He said their government made Punjab power surplus, but Congress government was providing expensive power to the state to earn profit. “The state government is purchasing power at Rs 2.80 per unit, but selling it to the industry at Rs 9 per unit and to domestic consumers at Rs 8 per unit,” he said. He said Congress leaders were looting Punjab. Alleging that around Rs 2,000 crore was lost due to illegal mining, Badal said mining mafias were brought to the state from Rajasthan and Jammu. He even named two persons, alleging that they were handling mining operations at the behest of people in power in Punjab. “Congress leaders are sure that they would not return to power and they are looting the state now,” he alleged. Box: No announcement on candidate Though Sukhbir Badal had been announcing candidates from the constituencies where he had held rallies, he did not make any announcement of this sort at Nadala as the rally was organised by SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur, who earlier represented the seat in the Punjab assembly. It is learnt that Bibi had told him not to make any announcement about the candidature for next polling as she did not deem it proper when she is heading the SGPC. Meanwhile in his address, SAD leader Jagmeet Singh Brar praised Bibi Jagir Kaur for ending corruption in SGPC and putting things in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sukhbir-ridicules-govts-proposed-white-paper-on-ppas/articleshow/81921122.cms||IP Singh

More stress was given on creating awareness on restrictions. But from Monday night, we shall either confiscate driving licences or impound vehicles of those found flouting night-time movement norms,” he said on Monday.Shisve said, “The offending vehicle users will also be required to pay the mandatory fine for violating curfew orders and Covid-19 directives.”On April 2, the Pune district administration announced a 6pm-to-6am restriction on movement of vehicles, barring those engaged in essential services, and other stringent measures, effective from April 3.On Sunday, the state government, too, issued the “Break the Chain” order of 8pm to 7am night curfew on weekdays; lockdown on weekends from 8pm on Friday to 7am on Monday; ban on assembly of more than five persons during daytime and several other restrictions.

The control room will inform when to send the bodies to the crematoriums which have been witnessing a heavy rush due to an increase in the number of deaths in Covid hospitals over the past few weeks.According to sources, at Ramnath Para crematorium, on Sunday, while four bodies were being cremated, three had to be kept waiting outside as there was no space to cremate them. This crematorium is the nearest to Rajkot Civil Hospital and the biggest in the city. It has two electric furnaces which are reserved for cremation as per Covid protocol. However, one of the two furnaces is out of order and the second is also in need of maintenance. So it takes nearly two hours for a body to be cremated, added sources.The non-covid bodies are cremated using traditional wooden pyre. Sources said that on an average daily 7-8 bodies are cremated as per Covid-19 protocol.RMC commissioner Udit Agarwal said, “We have started a control room to avoid waiting at the crematoriums. The government and private hospitals will call the control room number to get details of where and when to take the bodies for cremation. The control room will coordinate with all the four crematoriums in the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rmc-starts-control-room-to-manage-rising-cremations/articleshow/81919800.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Mussoorie tourism sees sharp decline post RT-PCR advisory||Mussoorie: After Uttarakhand recently issued an advisory recommending tourists from 12 states including Delhi and UP show negative Covid-19 RT-PCR reports on arrival at the state, Mussoorie recorded a sharp decline in tourist footfall, with restaurants in the Queen of Hills contemplating temporary closure and taxi drivers turning to other means of livelihood. Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders Association, said, “There is no point in imposing restrictions like last year, the administration must strictly impose social distancing and other Covid-control measures instead. We are entirely dependent on tourism and after last year’s losses, had our hopes pinned on this year’s tourist season to get back on our feet. The recent restrictions have dashed our hopes and reduced tourist footfall to nearly zero here.” Restaurants, with their high recurring costs, have been the worst hit. “Our business has dipped by nearly 80% since April 1. If it continues like this, we will be forced to shut down,” said a restaurant owner who did not want to be named. Businessmen who have taken premises on lease and pay hefty rents say that most of them have already been forced to cancel their leases and others would follow suit. Sundar Singh Panwar, president of Uttarakhand Taxi Operators union, said, “Taxi operators are sitting idle and business has reduced to barely 10% of what it used to be. Many of us had taken loans last year, how will we repay the banks now? Many taxi drivers are trying to find work as daily wagers to support their families.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mussoorie-tourism-sees-sharp-decline-post-rt-pcr-advisory/articleshow/81919006.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Pune||Must molecular check to strain testcentres, dent pockets: Lab experts||Pune: Mandating a molecular (RT-PCR) test for individuals involved in providing essential services is going to strain the laboratories, which are already overwhelmed, and force a sizable chunk to bear the cost of testing, lab experts fear. “Mandating every individual involved in essential services to get negative RTPCR is going to add up the pressure further and this move may even stretch the turnaround time,” a virologist from a private laboratory in the city said on the condition of anonymity. A private Covid testing facility that was conducting 700 home-based collections during the initial phases of the pandemic is currently doing 1,000 home visits for swab collection. Besides, the facility tackles another 1,000 people who walk in for the Covid test daily. “In all, a single laboratory is handling a load of 2,000 RTPCR tests a day. There are 25 private labs alone in Pune city,” said another lab expert. Again, the Covid testing labs are more in the private than the public sector. “Hence, the diktat is likely to force people to make out of the pocket expenditure. This is because there are only three government-run laboratories in Pune, where Covid testing is free of cost. There are 25 private labs in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, where one has to bear the expense,” a PMC health official said. In Pune city, the Sassoon hospital tests 2,000 samples a day. Besides, the National Institute of Virology and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) test 250 samples each. “That means of the 20,000 samples tested in the PMC limits every day, only 3,000-4,000 tests are carried out by government labs. The remaining 16,000 tests are carried out by private labs. This clarifies the financial burden on people,” said another lab expert. Senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee said, “RT-PCR test has its own issues. Even dead virus particles can be picked up as false positives by RT-PCR days and weeks after recovery from infection. But these persons are not infectious.” When contacted, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao told TOI, “We have enough capacity to conduct tests, especially since the state order does not direct these tests to be conducted every day. Two options have been given, vaccinate people aged 45 years and above or conduct RT-PCR tests for those not in the category.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/must-molecular-check-to-strain-testcentres-dent-pockets-lab-experts/articleshow/81919864.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Reacting to one such rumour around the project, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday said there is no proposal before the government to shift Goa Engineering College (GEC) out of Farmagudi. Earlier, MGP’s Marcaim MLA Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar and educationist Prabhakar Timble had alleged that there were plans to shift GEC out of its Farmagudi campus to establish the IIT there. Timble had further said that the GEC was being shunted to the Goa University campus in Taleigao. “I would like to inform the people of Goa that there has never been a proposal before the government to shift Goa Engineering College from Farmagudi. It will always remain at the existing campus. Some politicians are struggling to find relevance by spreading fake news,” Sawant tweeted. Reacting to Sawant’s statement on Monday, Dhavalikar insisted that the IIT Goa director had discussed shifting of GEC out from Farmagudi with representatives from Goa University, the directorate of technical education and with the education secretary, among others.

---||Mumbai||Cluster infections playing a key role in Mumbai 2nd wave||MUMBAI: Cluster infections appear to be playing a significant role in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. City doctors say rapid spread of the infection in much bigger groups and failure to prevent entire families from getting infected despite isolating index cases are emerging as key factors in the ongoing transmission. Some of the city’s major hospitals bear testimony to that. In the past three weeks, the Nesco jumbo hospital in Goregaon has treated three big clusters. The first group was of 49 construction workers from a Metro site. The second group was that of 13 labourers who picked up the infection while carrying out renovation work at an apartment in Mahalaxmi. It emerged that a family member from the household was carrying symptoms. Everyone from the family too was infected, said Nesco dean Dr Neelam Andrade. The third major cluster was a family of 16 members that had picked up the infection following a wedding celebration. “We did see one or two members from the same family or co-workers getting infected together, but never in such big groups,” said Dr Andrade, adding that fortunately all were detected and treated on time. Weddings and social gatherings have been the source of infections in most big clusters, according to Dr Deepa Shriyan, dean of Dahisar jumbo facility. She said people have not just travelled within the city or state but criss-crossed across the country and picked up the infection. At SevenHills Hospital in Andheri, 40% of the cases fall under the cluster category. Dean Dr Deepak Adsul confirmed of the 1,650-odd beds occupied, more than 600 cases would be family members, contacts or people from the same workplace. A judge, his wife and children are among those who are admitted. “Family clusters are definitely on the top, but there are many with a history of religious and social gatherings,” he said. The hospital has been sending weekly samples of mild, moderate and severe patients for genome sequencing. “But no mutations or variants of concern have been found that could explain this. Prima facie, the disease appears to be more transmissible now,” he added. Genome sequencing of 223 samples from Mumbai has found the presence of the UK strain in 22 so far. Civic officials have made another vital observation. Previously, taking away the index case from a household could prevent the spread of infection among other family members to a great extent. That no longer seems to be happening, said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. “We have seen that with one of our own staffers. We hospitalised her as soon as she tested positive, but her husband tested positive after five days regardless. Their daughter tested positive three days after the father. It could be that asymptomatic carriers and pre-symptomatic people are infecting,” he said. A state official said cluster infections have been seen in every district. Dr Milind Kamble, dean of Government medical college in Yavatmal said at any given point they have six to seven families with all members infected, which was uncommon in the first wave. Kakani said contact tracing and testing is the only way to beat it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cluster-infections-key-to-2nd-wave-despite-isolating-index-cases/articleshow/81918713.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Actor-businessman bail in laundering case kept in abeyance||MUMBAI: A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Saturday granted bail to actor-businessman Sachin Joshi in the Rs 410 crore money laundering case involving Omkar Group. The order was kept in abeyance, though, after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) moved a plea. “In view of grounds put forth by the ED, in the interest of justice, if one week time granted to assail the order of bail will make it proper. Hence, till then, the order of bail is kept in abeyance till April 9. The ED to bring necessary order, else the order of bail will come in force to release the accused no 5 (Joshi) on compliance of imposed conditions,” the court said. Joshi was arrested in February. The ED recently submitted its first chargesheet against Joshi, Omkar Group promoters Babulal Varma, Kamal Kishor Gupta and 14 firms associated with them. Omkar Group promoters allegedly took Rs 410 crore from Yes Bank to construct rehabilitation buildings under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) scheme at Wadala but diverted the money to their other group companies. Joshi allegedly helped Omkar Group for the laundering of Rs 87 crore. The loan money was used for other purposes, alleged the ED. In a separate order, taking cognisance of the chargesheet, the court recently said through the submissions, complaints and statements recorded under PMLA, it appeared accused Varma and Gupta had fraudulently availed the loan on the notional FSI which would have been available after construction of the buildings. “However, the rehab buildings were not constructed and the loan amount was diverted and not used to its intended purpose, for which it was sanctioned. It is also revealed during investigation that accused No 5 Sachin Joshi and his Viiking Group of companies have never engaged in SRA-related services, still funds have been transferred to Joshi and his Viiking Group of companies,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-actor-bizman-bail-in-laundering-case-kept-in-abeyance/articleshow/81918769.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Their poor economic condition has not stopped them from pursuing their dream of doing something for the poor and downtrodden. The total movable and immovable assets, including cash in hand is not more than 1.50 lakh each for M Uma Maheshwari of Praja Ektha Party and independent candidate Chanthamalla Saidamma. Uma Maheshwari, now 41 years old, knows the misery a family goes through when its head loses the job due to shutting down of the factory and wants to exert pressure on the government to create jobs at least in the private sector. “I was in school when my father lost his job due to shutting down of the factory. We sought help from everyone to sustain ourselves. Nagarjuna Sagar constituency has a lot of unemployment problems. I have been working among the downtrodden for the past few years,” said Uma Maheshwari, who holds a masters degree in social welfare. Interestingly, Only Uma is from Nagarjuna Sagar and other two women contestants are from outside the constituency. On her part, Saidamma is demanding the formation of a scheduled caste gram panchayats on the lines of ST panchayats. “Several tandas were formed into gram panchayats by this government. Then why not upgrade SC colonies into village panchayats. I worked as an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) for some time and later quit to do social work for upliftment of the SC and ST communities. Much has been done for the two communities but a lot more needs to be done for welfare of SCs and STs,” she said. Though Noor Jahan Begum of All India Majlis-e-Inquilab-e-Millat (AIMIM) is a resident of Rasoolpura in Secunderabad, she has gone all the way to contest the Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll. “None of the parties are encouraging Muslim women to enter politics. I want to prove a point that no one can stop us. My entire family, including in-laws are supporting me to go and out work for the society. I want to become the face and the voice of the deprived sections of society, particularly minorities, SCs and STs,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/three-women-candidates-in-bypoll-fray-want-to-highlight-problems/articleshow/81921180.cms||Roushan Ali

On Monday, gym owners presented memorandum to home minister Narottam Mishra, urging the government to allow them to run business or give them permission for euthanasia. Gym managements have faced the toughest times ever since the lockdown was imposed last year. “During the unlocking process, all kind of business were allowed to open but gyms continued to be closed. After several requests, we were allowed to open, but once again the state government asked to close down,” said a gym owner, requesting anonymity. Another owner said that such situation has forced them to go for euthanasia. “What to do when your entire business has been ruined after pumping such a huge money? I have to feed my family also but nobody understands our problems,” said he. Many gym owners even claimed that not a single Covid case was detected in a gym in the city. “We are in the wellness industry. People come and improve their immunity and fitness here. Each gym has been following strict Covid norms but state government is not ready to understand our problems,” lamented another gym owner. Gym owners claim that they have written several times to higher authorities to allow them to run business. They said, many of them are not even able to pay the rent, a fact which has put their businesses into deeper trouble. They said, due to pandemic, many gym-goers are battling several health issues, so they have appealed to the government that they should be allowed to run business, following strict Covid norms and heavy fines should be levied on those who fail to abide by the rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/gym-owners-to-govt-allow-us-to-run-the-biz-or-give-permission-for-euthanasia/articleshow/81919025.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Challenge for officials as chilli floods market||GUNTUR: The agriculture market yard has been flooded with massive stocks of chilli over the past few days. With the market yard closed for four days due to public days, the situation has turned complicated for authorities. The yard’s premises which is currently packed with over 2.5 lakh bags of chilli is expected to rise to 3.5 lakh bags by Tuesday when transactions are expected to resume. As a result, authorities swung into action manage the arrival of stocks. Interestingly, chilli stocks have reported record prices this season with almost all varieties fetching good returns for farmers. While the best varieties of Byadigi Deluxe and Teja Deluxe are fetching prices around Rs 15,000 to Rs 16,500 per quintal while average varieties are commanding prices of Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 per quintal. However, farmers are concerned that traders might try to lower prices after the market resumes, citing the huge availability of stocks in the yard. Meanwhile, exporters claimed the market is steady and might not go down so soon. “Although the demand is not so huge, prices might not crash just because of the availability of stocks in the yard. The trend might continue steadily for next few days,” said Lanka Kranti Sekhar, an exporter. Sources said that Byadgi deluxe variety fetched a price of Rs 16,400 per quintal when market closed on Thursday. Similarly, Byadgi regular variety fetched around Rs 14000 to Rs 16000 while some lots of Teja deluxe also bagged Rs 15,200. Teja stocks from local crop were picked up at around Rs 13,000 to Rs 14,800 per quintal while deluxe was quoted above Rs 15,000 per quintal. Sources said top varieties from other brands such as DD, Suvarna Byadgi, Synzinta Byadgi were in high demand as traders quoted prices between Rs 12,500 and Rs 15,000 per quintal. “Average prices for medium brands were somewhere around Rs 9,000 to Rs 10,000 per quintal while Bangaram and Armur varities were purchased at aroundRs 11000 to Rs 13,000 per quintal,” a market yard official said. Agriculture market yard chairman Chandraigiri Yesurathnam said that they were taking all measures to help farmers fetch best prices during the season.

---||Pune||Must molecular check to strain testcentres, dent pockets: Lab experts||Pune: Mandating a molecular (RT-PCR) test for individuals involved in providing essential services is going to strain the laboratories, which are already overwhelmed, and force a sizable chunk to bear the cost of testing, lab experts fear. “Mandating every individual involved in essential services to get negative RTPCR is going to add up the pressure further and this move may even stretch the turnaround time,” a virologist from a private laboratory in the city said on the condition of anonymity. A private Covid testing facility that was conducting 700 home-based collections during the initial phases of the pandemic is currently doing 1,000 home visits for swab collection. Besides, the facility tackles another 1,000 people who walk in for the Covid test daily. “In all, a single laboratory is handling a load of 2,000 RTPCR tests a day. There are 25 private labs alone in Pune city,” said another lab expert. Again, the Covid testing labs are more in the private than the public sector. “Hence, the diktat is likely to force people to make out of the pocket expenditure. This is because there are only three government-run laboratories in Pune, where Covid testing is free of cost. There are 25 private labs in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, where one has to bear the expense,” a PMC health official said. In Pune city, the Sassoon hospital tests 2,000 samples a day. Besides, the National Institute of Virology and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) test 250 samples each. “That means of the 20,000 samples tested in the PMC limits every day, only 3,000-4,000 tests are carried out by government labs. The remaining 16,000 tests are carried out by private labs. This clarifies the financial burden on people,” said another lab expert. Senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee said, “RT-PCR test has its own issues. Even dead virus particles can be picked up as false positives by RT-PCR days and weeks after recovery from infection. But these persons are not infectious.” When contacted, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao told TOI, “We have enough capacity to conduct tests, especially since the state order does not direct these tests to be conducted every day. Two options have been given, vaccinate people aged 45 years and above or conduct RT-PCR tests for those not in the category.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/must-molecular-check-to-strain-testcentres-dent-pockets-lab-experts/articleshow/81919907.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Bhopal||Motivation alone not the key, need for better arrangement at vac centres||Bhopal: Divisional commissioner Kavindra Kiyawat’s call to those who have got vaccinated for Coronavirus to bring 10 persons each for vaccination, may motivate many but district administration also needs to tighten arrangements at the vaccination centres. A first person account of how vaccination work is being carried out at vaccination centres opened at government hospitals, dispensaries and health centres brings forth a some points to ponder. Those who go for vaccination have to unnecessarily wait and face problems which can easily be avoided if a proper system is in place. Place: Civil dispensary at 1100 Quarters Time: 9 am People have already started trickling in for vaccination like every morning. However, the vaccination staff is yet to arrive. The ‘help desk’ put up by local party leaders ahead of the civic elections, too is empty. As the process of registration got delayed, the number of people at the dispensary coming for vaccination (many of them had come so that they get vaccinated early and leave for office thereafter) started increasing and soon, there was a queue in place, where there needed to be none. The district administration asked shopkeepers to draw circles outside their shops, so that shoppers stand at a safe distance from each other but here, there is no such circles and people were not leaving space amongst themselves so that somebody else may not get into the queue out-of-turn. All this could well have been avoided if the vaccination work was started on time. When the person who was arranging the tokens, was asked why vaccination has not started on time, all that he had to say was: “It will start soon.” When asked about in-charge of the vaccination work, he said, “She is out of station.” It further turned out that the computer used by the staff for registration of persons to be vaccinated, was out of order. Somebody who could manually do the job was summoned. After arranging the tokens, he sent them to the person sitting in the room outside and the queue of vaccine aspirants also moved into the room from outside, each one not caring for social distancing norms himself but asking the person standing next to maintain distance. After looking at the Adhaar cards, tokens were given to them. After distribution of tokens, the woman, who came to do registration work manually, started registration in a register, taking down everybody’s names, phone numbers and examining their Adhaar cards. By this time, the staff nurse who was to carry out vaccination work had also arrived and she would hardly take any time to inject the vaccine in the left arm. Those vaccinated were being asked to wait outside for sometime before leaving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/motivation-alone-not-the-key-need-for-better-arrangement-at-vac-centres/articleshow/81919037.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Nagpur||Traders oppose govt move imposing stricter curbs, call it backstabbing||Nagpur: The weekend lockdown and stricter curbs to contain the virus spread in the state have invited some sharp reactions from traders community, calling the decision an injustice meted out to them and charging the government with backstabbing. They said film shooting has been permitted, IPL is going to be played in Mumbai, roadside food stalls on, factory on, restaurants parcels, bus, taxi, train services on, but only shops closed. They asked how could just shutting down shops break the chain and what was the fault of honest tax-paying shop owners and businessmen? “The lockdown order is not just arbitrary but also against the traders. The government fails to address the core issue of containing Covid-19 virus in the state,” said Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT) president Dipen Agrawal in a memorandum submitted to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. The state government order claims that the lockdown has been enforced to enable the government to make certain emergency measures to prevent and contain the spread of the virus. “The government has not mentioned even a single step that would be a part of the emergency measures. One fails to understand why the administration has not implemented the ‘emergency measures’ over the last one year and instead adopted a chalta hai (casual approach) attitude after the first wave of the Covid-19 curve flattened,” Agrawal said. Traders also objected to the government decision to include e-commerce in the list of essential services. “There is not even a single provision of penalty for persons engaged in e-commerce activity for not haveing negative RT-PCR certificate. The relaxation in the penalty appears to be a deliberate attempt of the government to promote and favour e-commerce giants likes of Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Snapdeal etc against the brick and mortar shop owners in the state,” the CAMIT stated. The association further said that the administration, instead of ordering shutting shops, private offices and other establishments, should deploy resources to ensure that people who have tested positive should strictly confine themselves to their home. It should also consider random testing in market places as done in Mumbai. International Vaish Federation Maharashtra executive secretary Sharad Khandelwal too termed the decision as injustice. “As it is the first week of the month, we need to pay salary to staff, utility bills, file GST returns and other payments, bank EMIs, bank interest, custom duties and IGSTs, dispatch of goods from factories and warehouses. Perhaps, the government thinks that we, the businessmen, are super humans to complete all these listed tasks in a single day and manage the rest of the month with closed shutters,” Khandelwal said. “What help will the government extend in return? It will cut the electricity meter for not paying exorbitant electricity bills in time, it will collect your property tax, water tax, municipal taxes and all other government dues with interest and penalty. There is no consideration for not receiving payment during lockdown. You sell your house, office, shop, sell even yourself but pay your government,” a miffed Khandwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/traders-oppose-govt-move-imposing-stricter-curbs-call-it-backstabbing/articleshow/81919947.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: CoWin continues to play truant||HYDERABAD: Problems with CoWin software continue to cause delays and cancellation of scheduled vaccination slots. Hours before getting the shot, a prospective beneficiary received a message on Monday announcing cancellation of the first shot, which was registered on the software.  “I was preparing to go for the vaccine shot when I received this message. Subsequently, I called the hospital, but they too said that it is an automated message and the vaccine cannot be given if the software shows a cancelled slot,” the prospective beneficiary, who did not wish to be named, said.  At other places, names and details were not reflecting at the centre, beneficiaries not getting the time and date of the slot and not receiving a vaccination certificate have been reported as well. “Although, I have been vaccinated a fortnight back, I am yet to receive the certificate. There was some issue and I was told at centre and that it will be issued later, but that is yet to happen,” M Srinivas, a software professional, told TOI. Health authorities, meanwhile, deny any major issues. “While there might be some minor issues here and there, but we have not got any reports of any major issues from any of the vaccination centres. Technical glitches, which were there earlier by and large were resolved in CoWin version 2.0 and all vaccination-related work was being done through the software,” director, public health, Dr G Srinivasa Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cowin-continues-to-play-truant/articleshow/81919919.cms||Amrita Didyala

Ganesh Walunjkar, president, Maharashtra Nabhik Mahamandal, Pimpri Chinchwad, said, “We have 6,500 salons and 25,000 workers as part of the association. During the lockdown last year, from April to August 19, members of our association faced financial constraints as their businesses were shut for long. Some could not pay back the loan they took for their daughter’s wedding, there were some who could not afford treatment, etc.” He felt that this time, too, many members will be in financial despair. “We have appealed to the chief minister to reconsider total shutdown of our shops and allow us to operate with strict adherence to sanitisation, social distancing and all other safety protocols. It is not just about the continuance of business, but of our survival,” he said. Kiran Shinde, a salon owner from Kasba Peth, said, “With income less than half of what it was before the lockdown, we all have been struggling to run our homes, pay EMIs and rent. It will become very difficult to keep the business running if we are told to shut down just when we were starting to get some business. I have two employees from UP and Bihar. I have bought tickets to send them home because I can’t afford to pay for their food and lodging in the city when I will have barely any income from the shop this month. I cannot afford to take care of them if they fall sick. I can barely make ends meet.” Manasee Dogra, who runs a chain of eponymous beauty parlours across the city with her family, said, “After the lockdown last year, we had to reduce staff by 50%. There is a big confusion regarding the orders among owners of beauty parlours and salons as we don’t know what’s going to happen to our businesses -- how will we pay rent and salaries of employees. We were calling our staff to work on alternate days and paying them accordingly as we could not afford to pay them full salaries. Our clientele was also cut by half as we could only use 50% of our capacity. Now with a complete shutdown of our business, we will have to re-evaluate everything.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shutdown-will-be-fatal-for-business-say-salon-and-beauty-parlour-owners/articleshow/81919970.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||‘Kaliyuga Pandavulu’ keen to prove a point||Hyderabad: The ‘Kaliyugu Pandavulu’ have jumped into the electoral fray again – this time in Nagarjuna Sagar bypolls where they will be testing their luck. The five candidates, who entered the Dubbak bypoll fray in 2020 under the banner of ‘Kaliyugu Pandavulu’ as independents, lost the battle but have not given up on the idea of wanting to make a difference in politics. “It is all about having good intentions. Change is possible with right thinking and honesty,” said Revu China Dhana Raju, the brain behind the ‘Kaliyuga Pandavulu’ idea. Of the five, two of them withdrew their nomination at the last minute. “Major political parties played a role in getting several contestants to withdraw from the race using their usual tactics,” Dhana Raju said. It will be the third election from Dhana Raju, who hails from Uppal, Hyderabad. He had earlier contested from the Uppal assembly segment in 2018 and from Dubbak in 2020. He tried to enter the fray from the Malkajigiri Lok Sabha constituency in the 2019 elections but could not succeed. In this election, Gouti Mallesh and Loggari Ramesh are the other contestants under the ‘Kaliyugu Pandavulu’ banner. Mallesh works as a supervisor in a private company and has contested from Dubbak twice in the past. Ramesh, a driver, is contesting from the second time, having contested in Dubbak earlier. “We are entering the fray with the main demand that the government should provide jobs and issue notifications for vacancies. This is what we are fighting for,” Dhana Raju said. The trio said they found the constituency underdeveloped. “Conditions in some villages are deplorable. There are no basic amenities,” they said. The trio’s campaigning will pick up once they are allotted a serial number on the ballot paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kaliyuga-pandavulu-keen-to-prove-a-point/articleshow/81921268.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The initiative under the state smart city project has been delayed for over a year with "non-payment of the first instalment". With the state government now releasing the first instalment of Rs 9.51 crore, project work will start soon. Under the state smart city, nearly Rs 38.05 crore will be spent on the Integrated Traffic System. The first instalment of Rs 9.51 crore will reach the MMC this month. Following this move, the MMC will tie up with the traffic police department and set up CCTV cameras on nine major crossings of the city. Currently, the crossings of Delhi Road are not a part of the plan because of the ongoing rapid rail work here. "The project of ITMS is a great move for Meerut. As soon as the first instalment is received, the work on the crossings will be completed," said Braj Pal Singh, additional municipal commissioner. The CCTV camera which will be set up as a part of the initiative, will keep a check on whether people are following traffic rules or not and in case people do the contrary, an e-challan will be issued to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/smart-traffic-system-to-bring-relief-to-commuters-in-meerut/articleshow/81918367.cms||Ishita Bhatia
---||Hyderabad||Parents told to pay up first term fee||Hyderabad: With the 2020-21 academic year coming to an end, several schools have started asking parents to pay first term fees instead of collecting monthly fees. “My daughter’s school made me pay over Rs 25,000 as first term fee. Now, that I want to cancel the admission, they are saying that they will only refund Rs 10, 000,” said Venkateshwar Rao, a parent, whose kid is studying in LKG adding that he had to withdraw admission as he lost his job and is not in a position to afford the fee. As per GO No 46, schools have to collect only tuition fees that too on monthly basis for the academic year 2020-21. However, the GO doesn’t talk about the academic year 2021-22. Parents said that the situation of new joinees is much worse as they have to pay additional fees along with the term fee. “Not just term fee, new admissions have to shell out admission fee, caution deposit and term fee at the time of admissions. They are not even issuing books unless the term fee is paid. Parents have no option except to follow school instructions,” said Sowjanya K, a parent, whose children are studying in class 8 and class 6. She said that the school in Kushaiguda asked them to pay over Rs 28,000 each for both her sons to give them admission. “As 2020-21 academic year ended, schools are increasing fees and are asking parents to clear the first term fee. The state should immediately release a new GO and ensure that it is implemented at least this year,” said Subramanyam N, president, Hyderabad Schools Parents’ Association (HSPA). He said schools are offering discounts to parents who are willing to pay the entire annual fee in one go.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parents-told-to-pay-up-first-term-fee/articleshow/81919995.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Pune||PMC curtails food delivery time till 6pm from today||PUNE: The 8pm food delivery deadline, which had become a sore point for many youngsters and working professionals looking for a quick bite on Monday night, was further curtailed by the PMC to 6pm in Pune for food parcel deliveries from Tuesday. As per the latest state order, takeaway orders, parcels and home delivery services are to be allowed between 7am and 8pm from Monday to Friday. Barring takeaways, only home delivery services are to be allowed between 7am and 8pm on weekends. But the Pune Municipal Corporation in a separate order on Monday evening further reduced this deadline to 6 pm with effect from Tuesday. Event executive Nikki Arora told TOI, “I opened a food delivery app at 8.10 pm and it showed zero restaurants delivering. I finished my work late on Monday and could not order before 8pm. My domestic maid hadn’t cooked and I had nothing to eat.” Working professional Shruti Gupta (24) said, “The 6pm deadline for ordering food from restaurants seems like a joke. How can I order dinner at 5pm? The PMC’s order will have a huge impact on the students and working professionals.” Ganesh Shetty, president, Pune Restaurants and Hotels’ Association (PRAHA), told TOI, “The mandatory tests or vaccination for home delivery personnel from April 10 is likely to have an adverse impact on the food delivery services. Only 20% or about 2,000 restaurants in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad have a tie-up with online food delivery platforms, while another 10-15% or about 1,000-1,500 smaller restaurants have their own delivery boys. Either they would have to get their delivery boys tested. And if it would be unaffordable, then they would not do deliveries at all.” He said, “Vaccination would only be possible for those aged 45 years and above. The new order has triggered a sudden exodus of restaurant staffers, with over 50% of them deciding to leave Pune during the next few days.” Preet Singh Ahluwalia, owner, Nawab Asia, Balewadi High Street, told TOI, “Major parcel delivery business happens only in the evenings. About 20% of our resto staffers will leave after the imposition of the latest restrictions. Praful Chandawarkar, Director, Malaka Spice, said, “Parcel deliveries on Monday touched rock-bottom. Monday’s parcel orders were lower than delivery sales done during last year’s lockdown; because back then, parcel orders could be delivered till 11 pm. Parcel deliveries, which are usually 10% of the total sales for a restaurant, were not even 5% on Monday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-curtails-food-delivery-time-till-6pm-from-today/articleshow/81919993.cms||Neha Madaan

We are planning to move another application urging action on the orders of the court”. “In our petition we had informed the court that guidelines of the union ministry are not being adhered to.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Physical classes in doubt, yet schools increase fees||HYDERABAD: Many city schools have announced a fee hike of 10% to 30% for the academic year 2021-22. This, even as there is lack of clarity on whether students will be able to get back for physical classes as number of Covid-19 cases are on the rise across the state. While the Telangana High Court has questioned the state government about the number of schools following the directive to collect only tuition fee, many parents say school managements have restructured the school fee and are charging everything under the tuition fee component. “We have collected data from various parents and found that 20 to 30 schools have increased the fee for the ensuing academic year. Many have blatantly added all the fee components such as computer fee, development fee etc. under the tuition fee head,” said Venkat Sainath, joint secretary, Hyderabad School Parents Association. In some schools, parents are also being asked to pay for new school dress, shoes, books and stationery. Government Order 46 asking schools to collect only tuition fee was limited to academic year 2020-21, leaving parents worried. “Now, the schools are free to collect whatever amount they wish to as the GO issued last year is not valid for the next academic year. It’s time the government issues new orders,” said Bhavana Pandey, a parent. Owing to the pandemic, many schools had not hiked the tuition fee last year and had even offered discounts and relief to some parents on conditional basis. This year schools have refused to extend any relief to the parents. “We would like to bring to your attention that there would be no special or individual concessions in the upcoming academic year as we accorded to you last year. We request you to plan the payments in three instalments as has been the system over the previous years,” read an email by a private CBSE school in Sun City.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/physical-classes-in-doubt-yet-schools-increase-fees/articleshow/81919982.cms||---
---||Bhopal||It is like justice denied, Jaspal Rana on Chinki’s omission from Oly team||Bhopal: Representing the country in Olympic is the biggest dream of any athlete. It hurts more when a player ranked World No-1 spot and is also the top ranked Indian shooter fails to make it to the Olympic national team. Ace shooter Chinki Yadav of MP is one such athlete who is still not able to believe that despite hard work and securing top ranking globally, she is named as a reserve shooter for Tokyo Olympics in the 25m women’s category. Shocked with disbelief, several coaches and former players said that it is a big disappointment for any shooter. Former Olympian shooter Jaspal Rana reacted sharply over the NRAI for not considering Chinki Yadav. “It is no less than killing a performer. It is like justice denied. I have no words to comment about it. If a shooter who has put everything and achieved best scores for the country at every possible platform is not considered, then I have serious objections on the selections,” said Rana. Chinki had secured India’s 11th Tokyo Olympic quota in shooting with a career-best qualification score of 588 at the 14th Asian Championship in Doha in 2019. He added, “Chinki has been doing best in the past several events. She had won the Olympic quota for the country. I want to know what is the criteria to be in the team? This is not done. This is unacceptable.” Coaches even claimed that such selection process will put best talent out of the fray in the future. “This is not done. Chinki has worked hard and proved her talent in the recently concluded World Cup. She is World No-1. Now, what else a player should do to secure place in the Indian team,” said a senior coach wishing anonymity. Chinki became Madhya Pradesh’s first shooter to secure a World No. 1 rank in any sport. With two back-to-back gold medals in the ongoing World Shooting Championship in Delhi, she has become the world’s top ranked pistol shooter in the women's 25m category, with 1,110 rating points. Senior coaches even said that such selections would demotivate the shooters. “This will have a deep impact on a shooter who has been working hard for past several years to get into the team,” said another coach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/it-is-like-justice-denied-jaspal-rana-on-chinkis-omission-from-oly-team/articleshow/81919074.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan's private schools and parents worried about fees||JAIPUR: The decision to keep up to class IX shut has again put private schools in a difficult position. Already faced with non-payment of fees, private schools now worry that the problem will rise again. According to school authorities, classes from VI and above will be affected as those below are still continuing with online lessons. After the interim order of the Supreme Court in which parents were asked to pay 100% fees, parents had started depositing the amount, but schools fear that the current situation will have an adverse impact. School Shiksha Pariwar president Anil Sharma said, “Not more than 20% parents have paid fees. Usually, only after the final examination, the parents pay the fees and with the threat of lockdown again, our livelihood is in turmoil.” He said an emergency meeting was called by the school authorities on Monday in which they decided to ask the government to allow students living outside containment zones to schools for consultation. Sharma said, “We have given a week’s ultimatum to the government after which we will start protesting in front of the MLA bungalows all across Rajasthan. Most big schools with fees in lakhs will not be impacted by this but only the lower middle-class schools.” Society for Unaided Private Schools of Rajasthan president Damodar Goyal said the final judgment of Supreme Court will settle the matter of school fees. “We are with the government regarding the decision and online classes seems to be the only alternative. Judgment of the Supreme Court will actually put an end to the problem of fees,” said Goyal. Parents on the other hand are finding themselves to be stuck again to pay fees for online classes. Abhishek Jain Bittu, spokesperson of Rajasthan Abhibhavak Sangh, said he has been getting calls from parents who are not happy to pay fees just for online classes. “Already pandemic has broken people financially. Every school has increased the fee this year despite the pandemic. We do not pay fee just for sitting in front of the computer, but also for the facilities provided in the schools,” said Bittu. Preparations for online classes have begun. Many schools have sent messages to students that their online accounts in various software will be created soon and passwords will be shared with them so that classes will begin from Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pvt-schools-and-parents-worried-about-fees/articleshow/81920003.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Long queues at Rajasthan border as cops turn away commuters without positive test report||JAIPUR: Long queues of vehicles were seen at Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat borders following Rajasthan government’s April 4 order allowing commuters who produce a negative RT-PCR report at least 72 hours old, in the state. The district administrations of Alwar, Bharatpur and Dungarpur have set up checkpoints at the border checking the test reports, which has come as a surprise for many commuters travelling in public and private transport. The sudden move is creating a confrontational situation between the commuters and the police in these places. Dungarpur administration said that they have allowed 350 persons and asked 1,200 persons to return at Ratanpur checkpost for not having a test report till 2pm. “Our teams have swung into action and are checking the test reports at the border. Unfortunately, those who are not able to produce the test report are being requested to return,” said Sudhir Joshi, SP Dungarpur. The highway is an important route that connects the state with south Indian states. The administration is also alert due to the aggravated situation in Maharashtra. The reports of movement of migrant labourers from there to native states including Rajasthan has put the Dungarpur district authorities on high alert. By afternoon, a team of nursing staff was also deployed at the border for random sampling and checking the temperature, which has been made compulsory for all entering the state. Similar situation prevails at the Delhi-Haryana border at Shahjahanpur. The traffic has been running at snail pace since last evening with heavy jams at the checkpoints at the border. Ram Moorthy Joshy, SP Bhiwadi said that they are turning away 85 commuters coming from Delhi and Haryana for not being able to present the RT-PCR negative report. “I appeal to everyone entering Rajasthan to bring test results else you should be responsible for the inconvenience caused to you. In any condition, we will not allow anyone without the negative report,” said Joshy. Since the checkpoints came up last evening, a Sunday, it led to hundreds of vehicles from Delhi being stuck in the traffic for hours. The goods transport vehicles are exempted from checking, which is being misused by some commuters using it. The Alwar administration has clarified that they will start booking people under the epidemic act to prevent people from entering without following rules. Bharatpur, which is an entry point for commuters from several districts in Uttar Pradesh, has put up similar checkpoints since late Sunday evening. Devendra Kumar Bishnoi, SP Bharatpur told TOI that they have provided its force for ensuring all protocols to be followed in view of the latest situation. The local police in the bordering areas are also keeping a vigil on the interiors to ensure that those heading via short routes shouldn’t enter without producing the test report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/long-queues-at-raj-border-as-cops-turn-away-commuters-without-ve-test-report/articleshow/81920006.cms||---

The Maoist attack on policemen in Bijjapur district of Chhattisgarh on Saturday only increased their vigil on the border with policemen on their toes. To prevent the entry of Maoists into Telangana and locate them in case they have already entered the state through the porous border, Telangana police have started intense combing operations in the forest areas under Mulugu and Kothagudem, both districts bordering Chhattisgarh. Massive vehicle checking has been taken up by armed policemen for the last two days. As there is a suspicion that the Hidma battalion (reportedly the first battalion of CPI-Maoist) unleashed the violence against the security personnel in Bijjapur, Telangana police said that there was no information of any Telangana native involved in the Hidma battalion. “As of now, we don’’t think there is any Telangana native in the Hidma battalion, which has cadre from Chhattisgarh only. However, the vigil in the border areas has been intensified,’’ inspector general of police (North Zone) Y Nagi Reddy told TOI.  People who have threat from Maoists were warned by police to relocate themselves to safe places for some time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-cops-step-up-vigil-in-border-areas/articleshow/81921273.cms||---

Many are said to be showing a lack of concentration and interest. “Students have been unresponsive. They are either on mute or completely away from the system. Many are assuming that they won’t have to write the exams and will be passed just like last year.,” said B Shivaraj, a maths teacher working in a private school. Teachers said that they are in touch with parents so students attend classes and take revision tests. “Every day messages are posted in my child’s class group about children missing tests and classes. Children are finding it hard to concentrate in online classes,” said V Prakash, a class 9 student’s parent. Some principals, however, said though kids were excited to come back, with Covid-19 restrictions, many prefer online classes.“Students are happy to go back to virtual mode as they can wake up late and need not travel,” said B Usha Sree, principal, Johnson Grammar School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-struggle-to-go-online/articleshow/81920007.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

How will daily wagers feed their families if their employers will lose their income? There are about 35,000 members in our association who collectively employ about 4 lakh people. Even if we count four family members per worker, about 16 lakh people will suffer due to the prevailing situation. Unemployment is going to be a huge problem,” Fatehchand Ranka, president, the Federation of Traders Association of Pune, said.He said they were pinning hopes on Gudi Padwa this month, but new restrictions brought them to square one. “Authorities have assured us that arrangements will be made for all our members above the age of 45 and their family members to get vaccinated at the earliest. Today, we submitted a list of such members,” Ranka said.Anita Dalal, a garment shopowner, said, “The garment industry has been hit in a big way. Sales were only about 25-30% of pre-Covid levels and with new restrictions, it seems very difficult to keep the business running.”The shops that did not suffer a lag in the sales pick up after the last year’s lockdown are stressed too. “The moment liquor shops were allowed to open last year, people queued up to make their purchases. The business went back to pre-Covid levels without much delay. Obviously, there will be losses this month as we will have to still pay our staff, look after their lodging and food. To adapt to the pandemic, we started home delivery for a certain amount, which had worked well but we cannot depend on it,” owner of a liquor shop in Wanowrie said. Citizens are also apprehensive about the closure of “non-essential” shops till month-end. “Learning from our past experience, we are stocking up on non-essential items too. I don’t see how closing the shops is going to affect the spread of Covid, instead there should strict implementation of rules,” said a resident of Aundh.“We hope that liquor shops will be allowed to open for a few hours on a daily basis. Otherwise, there will be a rush again when they open,” said a resident of Wanowrie.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/non-essential-shopowners-stare-at-uncertainty-huge-losses-say-difficult-to-stay-afloat/articleshow/81920009.cms||---
---||Goa||Spending Rs 50cr on Kala Academy is worth it: CM||Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday said the money spent on strengthening Kala Academy (KA), Panaji, is worth the cost. He was speaking after laying the foundation stone for renovation work of KA, which will be done at a cost of around Rs 50 crore. Sawant said the work would be completed within10 months. “Kala Academy has played a major role in creating artists and in preserving art and culture since 1970. Even if the state is spending around Rs 50 crore, it would come back to Kala Academy within a period of 10 years. It is money worth spending,” he said. Reacting to the statement by the Charles Correa foundation (CCF) that the repair work at KA would cost a fraction of the budgeted amount, Sawant said that after evaluating the quotations received by the government, it was decided to take up the work. He also said that basic structure would not be touched. “We will use advanced technology to complete the work,” Sawant said. Art and culture minister Govind Gaude said that there have been discussions for over a year on whether to renovate and strengthen KA or if it should be demolished, “but today this discussion has come to an end with the laying of foundation stone for strengthening and renovation of Kala Academy”. Gaude said that PWD engineers will monitor the project and that the government will welcome suggestions of the people of the state about the work.  On July 24, 2019, TOI had reported that the Charles Correa-designed masterpiece was likely to see its popular open-air auditorium demolished. After a series of reports published by TOI stating the government’s plans towards this end, the high court of Bombay at Goa had taken suo motu cognisance and had sought a response from the state. Gaude had subsequently changed tack and had said that the structure would be strengthened and not demolished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/spending-rs-50cr-on-kala-academy-is-worth-it-cm/articleshow/81921307.cms||---

---||Lucknow||UP govt: Cong shielding, helping don||Lucknow: The state government on Monday hit out at the Congress for ‘shielding’ gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari by preventing him from being transferred to UP from Punjab. Government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said that despite a Supreme Court order for his transfer, the Congress-led Punjab government was providing Ansari with facilities like a private ambulance and a separate bungalow instead of a prison cell. “The Punjab government tried its best not to hand over Ansari to the UP police, but it has to abide by the SC’s directive. The UP government has fought fiercely in the SC to bring back Ansari. This issue had not only exposed Congress, but put a question mark over the political propriety of other parties like the SP and the BSP which have not spoken out against Congress’ conduct, but instead tried to support it by giving a communal colour to the matter,” he said. Another government spokesperson said that not only is Ansari a history-sheeter of the Mohammadabad police station in Ghazipur district, but there are 52 cases against him for heinous crimes like murder and kidnapping in UP and other states. Meanwhile, the UP police have attached Ansari’s properties under the Gangster Act and demolished those it has claimed were illegal. The value of the property seized or demolished which is linked to Ansari and his associates is about Rs 192 crore. Around 96 associates have also been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-cong-shielding-helping-don/articleshow/81921282.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Not just Covid wards, even the ICUs were full and health minister Vishwajit Rane was forced to admit that the situation was grim. “Although things look peaceful, bed capacity is getting full at GMC. Today (Monday), we have 10 patients on trolleys. This is the situation in GMC,” Rane said after chairing a meeting of the expert committee on Covid. The state’s premier public hospital, which treats severe Covid patients, has 150 beds allotted for it, all of which are occupied. Even the hospital’s ICU, which treats the state’s most critical Covid patients, is full. A similar scene prevails at the South Goa district hospital, which treats moderate Covid-19 patients. “The ICU is full. Only one bed in the ICU for a kidney failure patient (with facility for dialysis) is vacant,” said a doctor. The situation isn’t much better in private hospitals, all of which are full. A doctor attached to a South Goa private hospital said that on Monday, there were five-six patients on its waitlist. “We have around 15 beds for Covid patients, and they’re all taken,” he said. As cases continue to rise, Rane said that the government has proposed to add 300 more beds at the South Goa district hospital within a week. It currently has 170 beds, of which just nine beds in male ward and 20 in the female ward are vacant. On Saturday alone, it received close to 30 admissions. The hospital is also set to open a nine-bed intensive treatment unit (ITU), a step down from ICU. “It has all facilities of ventilators and high flow oxygen. The hospital only requires medical officers to monitor the patients round-the-clock,” a health official said. “The hospital needs nurses, helpers and medical officers. Once it gets these, the hospital can straightaway open the first floor with 150 beds, as mattresses, PPE and all infrastructure are in place. The pharmacy is also stocked,” a health official said. But the doctor said all these measures should be implemented soon. “We don’t want a situation to arise where the hospital receives 50 admissions in a day and has to turn them down,” he said. Daily hospitalisations, which were around the 10-mark not too long ago, now average over 30 a day. The new wave also means that Goa’s active cases have shot up from under 500 five weeks ago to well over 2,000, putting tremendous strain on health infrastructure and posing an additional challenge to drained doctors and other healthcare workers. While two floors of the ESI hospital have been requisitioned as a Covid care centre, Rane said that he was of the view that it should be used for treating patients, as was done previously. The ESI hospital, the first Covid hospital in Goa, was denotified as one after infections began dropping sharply after November. The South Goa district hospital continues to serve Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/beds-short-icus-full-10-covid-patients-on-trolley-in-gmc/articleshow/81921274.cms||Bindiya Chari

Shamli’s 25-year-old Azeem Mansuri has found his bride -- Hapur’s Bushra (known by her first name). However, the couple will have to wait for a year before their nikaah is solemnized. For 30-inch-tall Azeem finding a bride was a tall order to fill. Unable to find a suitable match on his own, a dejected Azeem knocked on every door -- from local police to UP’s former CM Akhilesh Yadav -- for help. The ordeal is forgotten. His bride-to-be is as tall as he is. On Wednesday, Azeem’s parents went to Majidpura in Hapur, met 21-year-old Bushra and fixed the marriage after blessing her with some money as “shagun” and an engagement ring. She is presently pursuing graduation. Speaking with mediapersons, Bushra gushed, “Azeem will take me on a tour after our marriage. He and his family are good and love me. My parents are also searching for a groom for my sister and once we find a good boy for her, our wedding will take place,” she added. Back in Kairana in Shamli district, Azeem danced with joy on learning that Bushra’s family had approved their match. He said, “I am very happy now, my dream has come true. After the wedding, I will take my bride on ‘umrah’ in Saudi Arabia to thank the Almighty.” A class V dropout who runs a cosmetics store in Kairana, Azeem’s fortune changed after TOI published his story and proposals began to pour in. But the choice of the right girl happened by chance. Shahid Mansuri, a resident of Hapur, played a key role in fixing the marriage. He said, “Bushra passes by my office every day and I know her. After reading Azeem’s news, I contacted her family and then called Azeem’s father, Naseem Mansuri.” Thus, ended Azeem’s five-year search for a suitable bride with both sides happy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/30-inch-tall-man-finds-his-match-in-hapur-girl/articleshow/81918379.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The accused were allegedly using a police siren on their private vehicle. KPHB police said the accused, 32-year-old G Arun Kumar, who is a doctor, and his friend M Srinivas Yadav, a software engineer, were arrested and later released on station bail. Arun is the son of a former police officer. The accused were travelling in an SUV, allegedly in a drunken state. They stopped at a soda cart, where they asked the vendor for water to mix in liquor. Following this, an argument broke out, and the accused manhandled the vendor and damaged his cart, the police said After getting an alert on dial 100, the police reached the spot and took both the accused into custody. The police also seized the SUV, which had ‘Police’ written on it. “The SUV was driven by Arun. The private car had a police siren, which is an offence,” KPHB inspector S Lakshmi Narayana told TOI. A breathalyser test for Arun gave a reading of 169mg/100ml, while for Srinivas it was 342mg/100ml. The police are investigating the case further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/doc-techie-held-for-drunken-brawl/articleshow/81920022.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||HC sets deadline to demolish commercial building in Adilabad||HYDERABAD: The high court has questioned the state and municipal administration authorities as to why they remained mum when Munnur Kapu Sangham in Adilabad was raising a commercial complex on a plot allotted to it for building a hostel for students of the community. The hostel was never built there and, in its place, a commercial complex was constructed. Following a public interest petition by Gottimukkala VRRG Raju of Hyderabad, who brought to the notice of the court the flouting of norms by the Sangham, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy questioned the state counsel as to why the authorities kept quiet when the allottee was flouting norms openly. G Simhadri, the counsel for Munnur Kapu Sangham, told the court that they got permission from the municipal authorities for raising the complex. The bench wanted to know who was the municipal commissioner at that point of time. “Tell us what action you initiated against him because he allowed the illegal structure to come up contrary to the norms of allotment,” the bench said, giving two weeks to the state to complete the process of disciplinary action. State’s special counsel A Sanjeev Kumar informed the court that the municipal commissioner was later transferred to Jagtial municipality. “We framed articles of charges against him. We also sealed the building. The Sangham is not allowed to operate it,” he explained. The bench said it was not satisfied with the mere sealing of the building. “Put the Sangham on notice and ask them why the building should not be razed,” the bench asked. “Tell us when are you demolishing it,” the judges asked. Several communities, which too secured land for hostels, earmarked a portion of the same for raising commercial shops to earn some money for maintaining the hostels. However, the case of Adilabad stood in sharp contrast as the Munnur Kapu Sangham did not raise the hostel, the intended purpose, at all. Instead, it raised a commercial complex there. Now, the Sangham has to explain its case as to why it abandoned the cause totally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-sets-deadline-to-demolish-commercial-bldg-in-adilabad/articleshow/81920024.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Bhopal||Cong says healthcare collapsed in state, seeks White Paper||Bhopal: Congress on Monday charged that the government healthcare system in cities like Bhopal and Indore, reeling under the second Coronavirus wave, has virtually collapsed and Coronavirus patients are running here and there for treatment. On the other hand, private hospitals are charging them exorbitantly for admission and treatment. Addressing a press conference, former minister, PC Sharma and Bhopal district Congress president, Kailash Mishra, said that announcements that beds for Covid-19 patients are being increased are made daily but beds don't increase. There is a shortage of Oxygen in government hospitals and the death of two persons at JP hospital for lack of Oxygen supply is only an example. They further said that kits for rapid antigen tests are also out of stock and test reports are being communicated to Coronavirus suspects in a week and the reports are not reliable either. They further said that the chief minister is appealing to every eligible person to get vaccinated but at several places in the state, vaccines are out of stock. Speaking about exorbitant fees being charged by the private hospitals for treatment of Coronavirus patients, they said that they have made treatment packages and a patient has to deposit Rs 1.5 lakh at the time of admission and the money is not accepted through cheques. They demanded that the system of contract with the private hospitals for free treatment of patients as existed in 2020 should be restored and the state government should pay for treatment of all the Coronavirus patients. The Congress leaders demanded a White Paper on the status of Coronavirus pandemic in Madhya Pradesh and facilities available for its treatment and further demanded that the state government should announce a blueprint on how it proposes to tackle the menace over the next three months. They also demanded that the number of vaccination centres must be increased so that the pace of vaccination picks up. Imposing hefty fine on not wearing masks or night curfew and lockdown have hit the common man hard. They said that the state government should distribute masks to poor people free of cost, they said. The two leaders also vehemently opposed any move to hike civic taxes in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cong-says-healthcare-collapsed-in-state-seeks-white-paper/articleshow/81919086.cms||---

On Monday, the health department gave a sigh of relief to people after it confirmed absence of any such mutation or new strain prevalent in the state. The health department is continuously sending samples to Delhi to check if the virus has mutated, but the state has not received any information about any sort of mutation. The officials claimed that it is the same virus circulating in the state, which has been infecting people for months. The health department has been sending samples since 15 cases of UK’s Covid strain were found in January. “We have been sending samples of Covid patients to Delhi for finding that if any new strain was infecting people. But, we have not received any report,” said Raghu Sharma, health minister. He said the state government was taking measures to start testing samples for finding if there was any mutation. The health department send random samples of people to CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB, Delhi) for checking the strain. Before UK-returnees tested positive for the new strain, the state government used to send the samples to the National Institute of Virology in Pune to check any mutation or change in strain in the virus, but now they have been continuously sending the samples to Delhi for the same purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-new-variant-in-state-health-minister/articleshow/81920031.cms||---

The incident took place at 8pm when the prisoners after dinner were going back to their barracks. Suddenly, a group of prisoners threw chilli powder in a woman guard and other jail staff’s faces. “It was found that a vehicle was parked outside the jail which was used by the inmates to flee,” said a senior officer of jail department. Most of these were booked under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. “We have around 60 inmates in this sub-jail where only undertrials are kept. We have intimated the local police. These men have made the biggest mistake of their lives by adding one more offence in their list. A massive hunt has been launched by the local police. All of them were locals and were booked in various cases. They were facing trials in the court,” Rajiv Dasot, director general (Prisons) told TOI. As per the information received by the police, the inmates also thrashed some of the jail staff before escaping. “Out of these prisoners at least three are from Bihar while rest of them are from areas including Phalodi, Baap and other villages in Jodhpur district,” said an officer. According to sources, the old jailer was under suspension and the new jailor is yet to join. In the evening, Anil Kayal, superintendent of police, Jodhpur (Rural) initiated barricading in the areas close to Phalodi and on the main roads connecting Phalodi and Jodhpur to other districts. “We have also got CCTV footages of toll plazas. Hopefully they will be nabbed soon,” said a senior officer of Jodhpur (Rural) police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/16-undertrials-throw-chilli-powder-in-guards-face-escape-from-phalodi-sub-jail/articleshow/81920033.cms||---

Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan told TOI, “For marriage halls flouting norms for the second time will be fined Rs 10, 000 and on violating for the third time, will result in the sealing of the hall till the pandemic is over.” The same applies to restaurants, hotels and other business establishments, which will be sealed, he said. Recently in a joint action by Chavan and police commissioner Nikhil Gupta, several restaurants, petrol pumps and other business establishments have been sealed. When contacted. Gupta said, “We are already registering offences against those found violating the norms and imposing a spot fine for not wearing masks.” The officer said stricter action will definitely be considered against habitual offenders. City police are registering offences under sections 188 (disobeying orders duly promulgated by authority), 269 (unlawfully or negligently doing any act which is likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life), and 270 (Whoever malignantly does any act which is likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) of the IPC.

---||Nagpur||Perishables at speciality restaurants may go waste||Nagpur: Speciality restaurants, either stand alone or those part of star category hotels, are fuming over the government’s decision to ban dining facility as they forsee massive amounts of perishable stock going waste. While online orders are allowed, restaurant owners say in Nagpur only a dozen food items are ordered through that mode. A fine dining restaurant owner told TOI that venturing into a niche category in the hospitality industry has now become ‘suicidal’. The owner said, “No one will order exotic French or Mexican cuisine through online delivery apps. Fine dining restaurants are as much about the experience as the food. The presentation, the garnishings are best brought out on the plate only when it’s served professionally. With no dine-in order, our business has been wiped out.” Another restaurant’s manager said online deliveries are for select items only. “For non-vegetarian dishes, over 95% orders are for mutton biryani, chicken tandoori, butter chicken, saoji curries and chilli chicken type of items. Vegetarians go for their all-time favourite paneer and various types of daals. These standard type of dishes are ordered not from well-known restaurants only, but also from places that offer best discounts,” said the manager. For such star category restaurants, the perishable items will now have to be disposed off. “We keep at least two to three days of perishable commodities stock. Technically, chicken, mutton and fish can be kept frozen for a month without a problem, but we would not like to serve our customers that when restaurants reopen on May 1. That is, if we are allowed to reopen,” owner of an upscale multi-cuisine restaurant said. All non-veg items will now have to be disposed off or consumed by the staff. “Apart from these raw perishables, we have pre-cooked perishables too in the form of gravies,” said a restaurant owner. The gravies, known commonly as masalas, are of three types. “Yellow gravy is for your normal chicken curry type of dish. Red is for butter chicken or paneer curry while white is for malai kofta type of recepies. Almost everyone keeps two days to up to a week of masala prepared. In most Chinese restaurants, the Schezwan masala is kept in stock for a week. So all this will be thrown out,” said the owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/perishables-at-speciality-restaurants-may-go-waste/articleshow/81920041.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The India Meteorological Department, Hyderabad, attributed the drop to a trough running north-south, which is aiding a cyclonic circulation over northern Telangana. Under its influence, Bandlaguda received a slight bout of rain measuring 4.8mm on Monday. As per IMD, Hyderabad forecast, maximum temperatures are expected to be in the range of 37 degrees Celsius to 38 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperatures are expected to be in the range 21 degrees Celsius to 23 degrees Celsius for next three days. Highest maximum temperature of 37.3 degree Celsius was recorded at Himayatnagar, according to the Telangana State Development Planning Society figures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/max-temp-drops-in-city-three-degrees-below-normal/articleshow/81920044.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||IIT-Hyderabad researchers develop dual carbon low-cost battery||HYDERABAD: Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) researchers have developed an alternative for lithium-ion batteries — a dual carbon battery. It is more sustainable and low cost. This battery may find potential use in high-voltage applications, sophisticated battery-run medical devices, regenerative braking systems in electric vehicles and stationary grids. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are projected to meet future electric mobility, electric aviation and stationary grid energy storage targets within 2030. However, LIBs need toxic and costly metals. “The advantage of these batteries is that they don’t use any toxic, heavy and costly metals such as cobalt, nickel, manganese as a current collector. These metals are not easily available in India. The batteries use carbon as an active material thereby making it 25% cheaper and lighter,” said Surendra Kumar Martha, associate professor, department of chemistry and lead investigator of research team. In the dual carbon battery, developed by IIT-H, the researchers have utilised self-standing carbon fiber mats as both electrodes (cathode and anode). The fabricated 5.0 voltage (nominal voltage 4.6 V) cell provides an energy density of approximately 100-watt hour per kilogramme and could be extended up to 150-watt hour per kg with further modifications. “The study will be extrapolated to push the energy density limits further and their broad vision includes introducing the dual carbon system as a cheaper LIB alternative to the Indian market,” said Martha. The research was supported by Naval Research Board (Defence Research and Development Organisation) and was recently published in ‘Advanced Energy Material’, a peer-reviewed journal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-h-researchers-develop-dual-carbon-low-cost-battery/articleshow/81920029.cms||---

Many of the city’s commercial areas including Itwari, Mahal, Sadar, Sitabuldi, Jaripatka etc witnessed a huge rush after the NMC notification. Shops selling coolers witnessed a mad rush of customers as the day’s temperature breached the 40 degree Celsius mark. On Monday, the NMC announced a partial lockdown from 8pm on Monday till April 30, with complete shutdown on weekends, stricter night curfew and prohibition of assembly of more than five people during daytime. As part of the lockdown, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B ordered shops and establishments dealing in non-essential commodities, restaurants, eateries, malls, theatres, multiplexes and religious places to remain shut. Apparently, there was a lot of confusion among people about the restrictions. Not only NMC, even TOI received many calls seeking clarity as to what will remain open and what will stay shut. There was a general perception among people that the city would have restricted market timings (including those dealing in non-essential commodities) and complete weekend lockdown. But the NMC notification clearly spelt out which sectors/services would remain open or shut. Uncertainty and the prevailing confusion may have put people into a panic-buying mode. In most markets, people were seen flouting Covid protocols, including physical distancing, which was conspicuous by its absence at Cotton Market and even on roadside vegetable markets. Panic buying was witnessed even in wholesale grain markets in Itwari, Gandhibagh and Gokulpeth. Many citizens were upset with the administration’s decision. While some were miffed with the imposition of the lockdown, the others criticized its delay. Ramesh Sinha, a resident of Zingabai Takli, had cancelled his scheduled work just to buy an air-cooler. “There was no hint from the government about the imposition of another lockdown in April. The sudden decision forced me to seek leave from office to purchase an air-cooler,” he said. Another buyer, Shankar Deshmukh, could not arrange for an electrician and thus was forced to buy a new air-cooler. “My family would have had to sweat in the Nagpur summer,” he said. Similarly, the garment markets in Gandhibagh and Mahal areas too witnessed a huge rush. Many shoppers told TOI that they had postponed shopping for marriages in their families. “The sudden lockdown forced us to go shopping for my son’s wedding schedule early next month,” said Savita Wankhede, a resident of Indora. Huge rush was also spotted outside wine shops across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lockdown-confusion-leads-to-panic-buying/articleshow/81920030.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Hyderabad||Spillover vultures from Maharashtra to migrate to Bejjur||HYDERABAD: After studying the vulture population in and around the nesting colonies of Maharashtra, Telangana forest department officials said some of these vultures are set to migrate to Telangana within the next one month. Every year, after the cliffs in Gadichiroli range in Maharashtra are completely occupied by the existing vulture population in the region, the spillover vultures migrate to Palarapu Gutta, a cliff in Penchikalpet forest range at Bejjur in Kumaram Bheem Asifabad district, to build new nests, lay eggs and bring up their chicks. While this annual phenomenon usually happens in the winter months, officials said this has been delayed this year. Asifabad district forest officer S Shantaram said the delay in nesting was due to untimely rains in the region this year. “However, we are constantly tracking their movement and have observed that they are currently hovering in and around Palarapu Gutta, conducting a recce of the nesting sites. Once, they figure out that there is no place left to build nests in Gadchiroli, they will migrate to Palarapu Gutta” he said. The DFO said some villagers have also seen the birds perching atop the Palarapu Gutta cliff and then flying back. He said the distance between both the nesting sites is about 50 km and there is no other place more suitable between both these places other than Palagrapu Gutta for these long-billed vultures to build their nests. “Another reason we think that these birds will start migrating to Telangana by next month is because we have observed that there is no decline in population of these birds in the last few years. Also, since summer is at its peak, the spillover population will eventually need shelter and they will start migrating once the nesting sites in Maharashtra are completely occupied,” said Shantaram. Every year, these vultures go back to Maharashtra after they lay eggs and raise their chicks in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spillover-vultures-from-maha-to-migrate-to-bejjur/articleshow/81920027.cms||---

His remarks came hours after chief minister Pramod Sawant said there was no decision yet on imposing restrictions. “Personally and as health minister, I feel that some restrictions have to be imposed,” Rane said. “Otherwise, the situation will get out of hand and it will be difficult to control later. I will brief the CM about the situation in Goa. I have sought time with him. If you ask me, at this stage, some sort of restrictions are a must in the state. He said that everyone needs to be cautious for the next four months. “This does not mean you impose a lockdown, but bring in some restrictions to bring it to the notice of people that Covid cases are going up. People need to be alert,” he said. Rane was speaking to reporters after a meeting of the steering committee on Covid management. He said some states have a night curfew, but what measures need to be imposed in Goa would be decided by the disaster management committee by correlating ground realities and projections for the coming days. “We should not close down everything as a knee-jerk reaction,” Rane said. “It has no meaning if we are not able to implement measures properly. The decision needs to have a scientific basis.” The role of the expert committee, he said, is to discuss everything related to health infrastructure and check Covid trends. He said there are other committees in place, such as the disaster management committee, to decide on measures such as if the movement of people need to be restricted. “It will definitely consider the upcoming municipal polls,” Rane said. “I will also discuss it with the chief minister and I’m sure he is aware of it.” He was replying to a question about what measures would be in place to ensure that there is no crowding and that social distancing is maintained during campaigning for the April 24 municipal election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/restrictions-must-will-speak-to-cm-rane/articleshow/81921294.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP: Mukhtar Ansari booked, aide held in ambulance documents case||LUCKNOW: Barabanki police on Monday named don-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari as a co-accused in the case related to forging of documents to purchase an ambulance that ferried the gangster from Ropar jail to Mohali court in Punjab. Police also arrested Ansari's alleged aide Rajnath Yadav on charges of forging documents to provide fake addresses for registration of the ambulance with the additional road transport office (ARTO) Barabanki. Probing the details of the ambulance used by Mukhtar, investigators claim to have come across sufficient evidence to suggest that the Mau MLA had hatched a criminal conspiracy to purchase the ambulance in the name of Shyam Sanjeevani Hospital and Research Center in Mau and later got the vehicle registered with the Barabanki ARTO using forged documents. As a result, police included the name of Mukhtar Ansari as an accused who entered into a criminal conspiracy to forge documents and use the ambulance for private purposes. Apart from Mukhtar, investigators have come across evidences that suggest that Shyam Sanjeevani Hospital and Research Center’s Dr Alka Rai, her associates Dr Sheshanath Rai were also a part of the criminal conspiracy in the case. In a related development, Barabanki police arrested one Rajnath Yadav and detained his associate Mujahid for their involvement in the case. “So far, it has come to light that Rajnath Yadav prepared the forged documents which had the name of Shyam Sanjeevani Hospital and Research Center of Mau but the address of a fictitious location in Barabanki. He got the documents signed by Dr Alka Rai with the help of Dr Sheshnath Rai and then contacted a middleman working at Barabanki ARTO to get the ambulance formally registered,” said Superintendent of Police (SP), Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad. Rajnath Yadav, who has identified himself as a resident of Mau and claims to have been associated with Mukhtar Ansari, has been arrested by the police. He was now being interrogated to identify other individuals who helped him prepare forged documents and address proof and those who helped him to get the ambulance registered with the ARTO in Barabanki on the basis of these forged documents. The arrest was made in connection with the FIR lodged on Friday on the complaint of ARTO Barabanki alleging that forged documents were used to register the ambulance and that the original documents related to the vehicle were missing from the ARTO records. The complaint had identified Dr Alka Rai as the owner of the ambulance and others as co-accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mukhtar-booked-aide-held-in-ambulance-docus-case/articleshow/81921291.cms||---

Time has come to gherao Gandhinagar and block roads. If needed, we will have to break barricades too,” Tikait said after his visit to Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad on Monday. He was accompanied by former Gujarat chief minister Shankersinh Vaghela.Tikait claimed farmers in Gujarat were unhappy and suffering. “Farmers are suffering because there is no agitation here. There is no backing from courts also. Farmers are compelled to say they are happy and making a profit. Please give us that technology which is helping Gujarat’s farmers to reap benefits,” he said.He claimed that farmers of Banaskantha are compelled to sell potatoes for Rs 3 per kilogram. “Is that enough to make farmers happy? We have come here to remove fear from the minds of farmers. We will agitate in a peaceful manner,” Tikait said. Later, Tikait and Vaghela reached Karamsad town in Anand and paid tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at his native place.The farmers union leader then visited a Gurudwara in Chhani area of Vadodara on Monday afternoon in presence of senior Congress leaders like Chandrakant Srivastava, Sagar Brahmbhatt, Narendra Ravat and Ami Ravat. Tikait urged the milk famers in Gujarat to protest against the government. “An agreement is happening from outside for supply of milk and it will finish Amul. Milk farmers here should protest against it,” he said.Later while addressing a rally in Kedareshwar Temple at Bardoli, Tikait said, “This is the land of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who fought for farmers’ rights during the freedom struggle. I call upon farmers here to fight for their rights and join the national protests against the central government.”He alleged that the government is run by corporates. “Farmers’ land is being taken away by the government in Gujarat and those who protest against it are being jailed.

The incident took place at 8pm when the prisoners after dinner were going back to their barracks. Suddenly, a group of prisoners threw chilli powder in a woman guard and other jail staff’s faces. “It was found that a vehicle was parked outside the jail which was used by the inmates to flee,” said a senior officer of jail department. Most of these were booked under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. “We have around 60 inmates in this sub-jail where only undertrials are kept. We have intimated the local police. These men have made the biggest mistake of their lives by adding one more offence in their list. A massive hunt has been launched by the local police. All of them were locals and were booked in various cases. They were facing trials in the court,” Rajiv Dasot, director general (Prisons) told TOI. As per the information received by the police, the inmates also thrashed some of the jail staff before escaping. “Out of these prisoners at least three are from Bihar while rest of them are from areas including Phalodi, Baap and other villages in Jodhpur district,” said an officer. According to sources, the old jailer was under suspension and the new jailor is yet to join. In the evening, Anil Kayal, superintendent of police, Jodhpur (Rural) initiated barricading in the areas close to Phalodi and on the main roads connecting Phalodi and Jodhpur to other districts. “We have also got CCTV footages of toll plazas. Hopefully they will be nabbed soon,” said a senior officer of Jodhpur (Rural) police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/16-undertrials-throw-chilli-powder-in-guards-face-escape-from-phalodi-sub-jail/articleshow/81925109.cms||---

It was the city’s highest daily tally – or one new case every two minutes. The city is also recording a high number of deaths – 20 in the first five days of April at an average of four per day. “The surge is unprecedented in the sense that despite the ramped-up facilities and better preparedness compared to the last surge in November, hospital beds are fast filling up. The working population and entire families are getting infected. Due to mild symptoms, people are not careful enough in its initial days and thus become unwitting carriers,” said a city-based critical care specialist. Almost all arms of the government are also seeing infections with over 10 firemen along with chief fire officer Rajesh Bhatt testing positive on Monday. At IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A), the surge continued with 28 new cases recorded in the first five days of April at the average of nearly six cases a day. On Monday, the state government decided to give powers to the local administration to manage the pandemic including requisitioning beds at private hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 patients. “The emphasis is on improving inoculation, covering the working population and identifying positive patients at the earliest to prevent further spread,” said a senior state health department official. Experts appealed to citizens not to ignore signs and get tested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/coro-nage-city-passes-700-cases-16-jump-in-24-hours/articleshow/81921310.cms||---

The decision to do so was taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in the state wildlife board meeting on December 4, 2020. After the decision, there was stage-managed opposition by villages opposing the sanctuary. The 269.40sqkm sanctuary includes 18.02 sqkm area of Central Chanda forest division and 251.38sqkm area of Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM). Of the 105 sanctuary compartments, 10 belong to Central Chanda and 95 to FDCM. The notified areas doesn’t have any villages. In the case of compartment number 78A (272.35 hectares), forest colony, range office, and Zaran nursery are situated on 57.20 hectares. This area has been excluded from the sanctuary. Thackeray on Monday reviewed FDCM works and asked the corporation to develop waste and barren lands into green zones. The FDCM demanded 25,000 hectares of productive forest (250sqkm) in lieu of the area handed over for Kanhargaon sanctuary. It also demanded to absorb van majoors from the area. In April 2013, the original Kanhargaon proposal consisted of 370 sqkm forest. It included 58 sqkm area of Kothari range in Central Chanda and 312 sqkm area of FDCM. However, amid opposition from locals and politics, the proposal was curtailed to 269sqkm. On December 5, 2018, former CM Devendra Fadnavis agreed in principle to declare it a sanctuary but it was opposed by former forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. Kanhargaon is a key link to Chaprala sanctuary in Gadchiroli and Kawal in Telangana. It is a compact block and dispersing population from Tadoba not only makes the area rich in tigers but it is also a natural habitat of a variety of wild animals. Other wildlife here includes leopard, jungle cat, jackal, fox, deer, sambar, barking deer, blue bull, wild boar, sloth bear, wild dog, and gaur. “With more area becoming available, the gene-pool proportion will rise to a satisfactory level, and ill-effects of inbreeding can be eliminated to ensure a healthy population of wild animals,” said state wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-finally-notifies-truncated-kanhargaon-sanctuary/articleshow/81920053.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Hyderabad||As sales grow, insurers rev up for electric vehicle segment||HYDERABAD: With the government pushing for electric vehicle (EV) adoption, insurers expect it to emerge as a key segment in the coming days. Currently, whether one drives a petrol, diesel or electric vehicle, insurance cover is a must. In March 2020, insurance regulator Insurance Regulatory & Development Authority of India (IRDAI) had announced that insurers will have to offer a discount of 15% on motor third party premium for electric vehicles to incentivise their use. While the discount announced by the regulator is a good incentive to start with, Adarsh Agarwal, appointed actuary at Digit General Insurance, said EV insurance offers a huge opportunity for insurers due to lower risk. “EVs have lesser exposure on highways and so have a better risk,” he explained. However, he pointed out that in terms of challenges, the theft of batteries in certain locations can increase the loss ratio on insurers. Even Animesh Das, head (product strategy), Acko Insurance, pointed out that the number of EVs on the roads are very less as it is mainly early adopters who are opting for them. This means that the risk of an EV being involved in accidents will be much lower than an equivalent traditional vehicle, offering a good opportunity for insurers to make some profit within the auto insurance sector. As per IRDAI data, the motor business continued to be the largest general insurance segment with a share of 36.50% in 2019-20 (38.08% in 2018-19) followed by health segment with 30.10% market share (30% in 2018-19). Currently, the EV insurance product is similar to the traditional motor vehicle insurance product, but with a rise in EV sales the regulator is expected to allow further differentiation in the product construct, said Amitabh Jain, head (health & motor underwriting & claims), ICICI Lombard. “Some of the differentiating factors in an EV are the presence of battery (which entails major part of the EV’s cost) and the charger...We are evaluating the scenario and may approach the regulator for approval to offer add-on covers for battery and charger,” Jain added. Subrata Mondal, executive VP, IFFCO Tokio General Insurance Company, also added that due to the lack of data on EVs, the insurance pricing might follow the traditional method in the initial stages. However, as the usage increases and subsequent time passes, insurers can arrive at the right premium for EVs. “Though initially the cost of several movable EV parts will be higher, they will come down as the volume increases. As a result, the servicing time at garages or workshops will be lower, ensuring a quicker turnaround. These factors will also favourably impact the premium,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-sales-grow-insurers-rev-up-for-electric-vehicle-segment/articleshow/81920095.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Nagpur||Covid-19 spell intensifies in Nagpur division as it reports 78 of 99 deaths in Vidarbha||Nagpur: After wreaking havoc in five districts of the Amravati division in February and March, it seems coronavirus is spreading its tentacles to the hitherto less-affected districts of Nagpur division in April. On Monday, all six districts in Nagpur division reported deaths due to Covid-19. Including Nagpur, the division reported 78 deaths out of 99 deaths in Vidarbha. Even if we exclude the 57 deaths reported in Nagpur district, the remaining five districts reported 21 deaths, which is their highest count in the present surge. On the other hand, no death was reported in Amravati district. Bhandara, Gondia, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur not only reported deaths, but also a sudden spike in number of cases and the sample positivity rate, akin to the way Amravati, Yavatmal and Buldhana reported in mid-February. In Chandrapur, 265 samples out of 540 tested in last 24 hours were positive, a positivity rate of nearly 50%. The rural part of Nagpur division appears likely to be the next target of Covid-19. As the previous day was a Sunday, many districts could not conduct on-spot and mobile testing. Due to this, 29,488 tests were done in Vidarbha in last 24 hours against 50,000+ tests in last three days. Out of these, 6,443 tested positive. On the other hand, 7,246 patients recovered in a day — which is highest-ever number of recoveries. Now, out of 5.13 lakh total cases, 4.32 lakh have recovered in the region. Even though it’s an effect of less tests, the number of recovered patients was more than the number of new cases on Monday. This happened for the first time in many days. Recovery rate, which was under 84% yesterday, also witnessed a jump and reached to 84.30%. With 99 deaths on Monday — highest in the second surge — death toll of Vidarbha reached 9,299. However, case fatality rate is still 1.8%. Covid-19 deaths in rural parts of Nagpur division are the major concern for the administration now. Yavatmal: The district reported 10 deaths, which took the toll to 697. The administration received 2,651 test reports of which 301 (189 men and 112 women) were found positive. Currently there are 3,119 active patients of whom 1,584 are in hospitals, while 1,535 are in home quarantine. Out of 30,952 total patients so far, 27,139, including 345 on Monday have recovered. The positivity rate is 10.75% and the death rate is 2.24%. The district administration has taken a lot of preventive measures, which include launching of e-mail ID and WhatsApp number for lodging complaints regarding charging of extra fees by private hospitals. The e-mail ID is covid19takrar@gmail.com and the WhatsApp number is 7276190790. In case any private hospital charges extra fees, patients should lodge complaints through the above channels as visitors are prohibited from entering government offices. Their complaints will be looked into and if found guilty, strict action would be taken against the hospitals. All the officers and employees of government and semi-government organizations must take vaccine shots on or before April 9 and the defaulters will be fined Rs1,000 per day. In another circular, the administration has made it clear that there is no shortage of remdesivir injections in government hospitals and the medical stores across the district. Oxygen should also be restricted to the Covid-19 centres. In case there is any artificial shortage of the injection and O2, it should be brought to the notice of the assistant commissioner of food and drugs department, Savita Datir, it is further informed. Chandrapur: There were 265 new cases and 207 recoveries, leaving 2,778 active cases. Five deaths were registered during the day, taking the toll to 440. The Covid caseload has climbed to 29,371, while total recoveries now amount to 26,153. Amravati: Even as the district reeled under fresh restrictions to “break the chain” of coronavirus, it reported just 241 cases on Monday, that took the caseload to 50,067. No patient died of the virus today and the recoveries were 381, which took the total to 46,438. This left 2,942 patients under treatment. Wardha: Two men (60 and 75-year-old) from Wardha died due to coronavirus during treatment, taking the toll to 465. The district crossed 20,000 Covid cases after 136 new cases were detected on Monday. The caseload is now 20,006, while 308 patients were discharged and recoveries are 17,953. 1,588 patients are active positive in district.

---||Goa||From May 1, pay enhanced fines for road traffic violations||Panaji: From next month, errant motorists will have to pay hefty fines for violating traffic rules as the state government has notified penalties for violations under the new Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act, 2019, which will come into force in Goa on May 1. Although the notification reads that the Act will be implementation from April 16, transport minister Mauvin Godinho told TOI that the implementation will commence in Goa from May 1, and that a corrigendum would soon be issued. “The new fines are quite steep and will pinch the pockets of the motorists,” Godinho said. “We have to implement the Act, and it is a request to the people to obey traffic laws and not break the rules, (in) which way they will not have to pay any fines.” He added that traffic police would use this entire month to carry out awareness programmes and educational activities to inform people about the enhanced fines. “The Act is being implemented keeping in mind road safety,” director of transport Rajan Satardekar said. “This notification gives powers to officers to compound offences in lieu of prosecution. Now, officers on duty can issue a challan for the violations.” The transport department on Monday empowered the traffic police, assistant directors of transport and RTO officers to prosecute traffic violators and impose fines under the Act. The department will subsequently hold an exhaustive press conference over the nitty-gritty of the Act’s enforcement. He further said that the Act will also give immunity to good Samaritans who help accident victims against civil and criminal liabilities. There is also a provision for cashless treatment of victims during the golden hour. The amended Act came into force from September 1, 2019, and all states were expected to implement it. After some governments, including Gujarat and Uttarakhand, raised concerns about some of the hiked fines, they were permitted to lower penalties for certain traffic violations. The Goa government was to take a similar route, however, they deferred it after citizens demanded that the poor road conditions across the state be improved first. At many places, roads that were dug up either for expansion of highways or for laying of cables or sewerage lines, were not restored to their original condition. The state decided to further postpone the implementation owing to the pandemic in a bid to avoid causing financial duress to citizens that were affected due to the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/from-may-1-pay-enhanced-fines-for-road-traffic-violations/articleshow/81921299.cms||Nida Sayed

Most of these patients are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Doctors say it’s important for patients who are under home isolation to keep in touch with a physician during isolation — either through teleconsultation or periodic visit. “Low levels of oxygen saturation, persistent cough, breathlessness and feeling very weak should be treated as warning signs,” Dr Sumit Ray, head of department of critical care at Holy Family Hospital, said. Follow live updates on CovidDr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said that delayed admission was one of the main factors behind deterioration in condition and, in some cases, death due to Covid-19. “Some people keep taking medicine on their own. And when the situation goes out of hand, they rush to the hospital. We have seen cases where assistive ventilation was necessitated due to delayed admission,” he added.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Read AlsoSpike shows Covid-19 is spiralling out of control in Delhi: ExpertsThe Test Positivity Rate — the number of positive cases from those tested — of Covid-19 in Delhi crossed five per cent on Monday, a landmark figure that reflects how the disease has spiralled out of control.

But, he added, they were also seeing many patients coming with diarrhoea. “With experience, we know better how to manage the Covid-19 patients. But even now, we are getting many cases requiring ICU care. This disease shouldn’t be taken lightly,” he said. Read AlsoNow, Covid deaths begin to surge at same rate as casesThe first few weeks of the Covid pandemic's second wave in India did not see a corresponding rise in fatalities. But that has changed in the last four weeks. Since March 8, Covid-related deaths have risen at the same pace as the spike in infections, with the seven-day average of daily cases andTreatment for Covid-19 involves three key components — drugs to reduce the viral load, steroids that can suppress a cytokine storm and drugs to prevent clotting of blood. A number of drugs used for other illnesses, in addition to Hydroxychloroquine, were tried for treating Covid-19 patients last year because there was no known cure. Convalescent plasma therapy was also used extensively. “As cases increase, there is a significant increase in demand for convalescent plasma again,” said a senior doctor at the Institute of Liver Biliary Sciences that houses a dedicated plasma bank. Delhi witnessed three peaks in Covid-19 cases last year, in May, August and November, respectively. December onwards, the number of cases started to come down. However, there has been an exponential increase in new cases over the past two weeks. The presence of mutated strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is considered a key factor behind this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-self-medication-in-even-mild-cases-is-a-no-no/articleshow/81920116.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

It also directed 54 large private hospitals to reserve at least 30% of their ICU beds and ward beds or double the occupancy, whichever is higher, for Covid-19 patients.The order issued by the directorate general of health services of the government will result in an immediate increase of 2,598 Covid ward beds and 719 Covid ICU beds. As per the Delhi Corona application, 3,126 out of 6,880 Covid-19 beds, 482 of 822 Covid-19 ICU beds with ventilators and 684 of 1,447 Covid-19 ICU beds without ventilators in Delhi were occupied on Monday evening.On March 31, the government had directed 33 private hospitals to reserve at least 25% of their ICU bed capacity or double the occupancy as on March 30, whichever is higher for Covid-19 patients. The overall occupancy of these beds on Monday was 78% and 68%, respectively. The order also takes into account the fact that while the positivity rate was 2.71% and the number of active cases was 8,838 in Delhi on March 31, the positivity rate went up to 4.67% and the number of active cases stood at 13,982 on April 4.The order states that in order to augment the bed capacity for Covid-19 patients and to also ensure that treatment of non-Covid critical patients is not compromised, 54 private hospitals with 100 beds or more are directed to reserve at least 30% of both their ICU bed capacity and ward bed capacity or double the occupancy of both as on April 5, whichever is higher, for Covid-19 patients.The government has also directed medical directors of 11 of its hospitals to upgrade the number of beds indicated against their hospital with immediate effect and logistics required, if any, may be sourced by using powers delegated under section 50 of Disaster Management Act.After this order, the number of Covid-19 beds will go up from 300 to 1,000 in Lok Nayak Hospital and from 50 to 100 in Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital. GTB Hospital will see an increase of 500 beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fresh-surge-forces-11-govt-hospitals-to-add-covid-19-beds/articleshow/81920110.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Traffic police officials attributed this to ‘fear of coronavirus’. “Traffic was at least 20% lesser in the western suburbs as compared to previous weeks,” said DCP Traffic (west) Somnath Gharge. Joint commissioner (traffic) Yashasvi Yadav said that overall traffic volume on the streets seemed to be lesser... Numbers are likely to dip to further from Tuesday.” An interior decorator from Andheri said “confusion” prevailed over whether shops would stay open as also over the timings. “Also, what constitutes ‘essential travel’ was not clear. We chose to not head out till there was clarity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-traffic-thinned-out-in-city-even-before-curbs-came-into-effect/articleshow/81921312.cms||---
---||Delhi||Red zones go from 2,000 to 3,000 in less than a week||New Delhi: After the number of containment zones crossed the 2,000-mark on March 31, the count went above 3,000 less than a week later on Monday. Out of the 3,090 containment zones in Delhi, 2,701 are active zones, with 25.5% of these located in South District. The district not only has the highest number of active zones among the 11 districts in the capital but also has added the highest number of new zones in recent times. Compared with South district, North (377) and West (301) districts are a distant second and third in the list.Health minister Satyendar Jain said the micro-containment zones were being created wherever two-three Covid-19 cases were detected to prevent the spread of the virus. He also said middle and upper middle class localities were reporting more cases but the severity of cases and fatalities in the fourth surge were less than the previous ones Delhi had faced.While South district has the highest number of red zones, Central district has seen the active zones more than double since April 2 — 53 to 108. North East district, which still has the second lowest number of red zones, has seen its numbers go up by 66% in three days. South West district, too, has seen an increase of 56.3% — from 133 to 208 active zones. The lowest increase has been in East district at 7.7%. The district has 56 active zones, the lowest among all the districts.“Delhi government is taking appropriate measures, the most significant one being boosting the daily testing capacity. Around 80,000-90,000 tests are being done every day,” Jain said. Among the infected patients, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients are being home-isolated, and moderate-to-severe cases are being isolated and treated in the hospitals, he added. “Genome tracing is also being carried out and about 30 people are being traced for the coronavirus infection.” The health minister said, “Random testing is being done at a fast pace in Delhi. We are doing five times more tests than that of the national average.” Responding to a question about variants, Jain said, “Let scientists look over the variants and it would not make much difference. Scientists say that the current corona variant is spreading at a fast pace with less severity and the mortality rate is also low. The central lab is doing the study on the variants.”At a press conference, the minister appealed to all Delhiites to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and not show any negligence. “Taking necessary precautions is of utmost importance to stop the infection.” Jain also appealed to the people who have recovered from the viral infection to donate plasma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/red-zones-go-from-2000-to-3000-in-less-than-a-week/articleshow/81920125.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Nagpur||NMC begins 20 satellite vaccination centres to cover more 45-plus people||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is probably the first civic body in the state to start satellite Covid-19 vaccination centres. Twenty centres were kicked-off on Monday. The number is likely to increase to 51 on Tuesday. The 20 satellite vaccination centres are at the indoor sports stadium, schools and community halls. These centres are linked with the existing ones at hospitals and urban primary health centres (UPHCs) of the civic body. The beneficiaries of satellite vaccination centres will be added to the total number of inoculations at NMC hospitals and UPHCs. Vaccination centres were opened at hospitals and UPHCs run by NMC. Centres are also being operated in hospitals run by the government and private medical institutions. With spike in cases and deaths in the district, guardian minister Nitin Raut and divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar had kept a target of inoculating 20,000 per day within NMC limits and rural areas where Zilla Parishad (ZP) is running the vaccination programme. The civic body started satellite vaccination centres to cover as many as possible from the 45-plus age group. NMC officials said the satellite vaccination centres started in residential areas will be convenient for those above 45. “It has been observed that people from nearby areas come and get vaccinated whenever a new centre in opened. The number of beneficiaries then goes down after a few weeks. It means that eligible people are not interested in travelling to get inoculated. That’s the reason we came up with the concept of satellite vaccination centres,” said officials. No case of adverse event following immunization (AEFI) was registered within 30 minutes of vaccination in the district since the roll out of the vaccine for those above 60 and 45 plus with specified comorbidities on March 1. This also helped the NMC in taking the decision to take vaccination centres to non-medical premises. For vaccination, the NMC has re-appointed over 100 medical officers and nurses who were relieved after cases declined in November last year. To check cases of AEFI, a medical officer has been appointed at each satellite vaccination centre along with three healthcare workers in the waiting arena and observation room apart from one nurse for administering the vaccine. Also, AEFI and medical emergency kits are provided at all satellite vaccination centres. Ambulances have not been engaged at these centres which should have been a top priority for rushing beneficiaries to hospital in case of any AEFI. Few turned up at the satellite vaccination centres on Monday which was the first day. Total vaccination in the city was 9,794 on Monday which was less than those registered on April 3 (15,871). Vaccination was much more in rural areas compared to the city on Monday. Nearly 25,174 people took the jab in rural on Monday. Total vaccination was 34,968 in the district on Monday which was second-highest in a day after the record inoculation of 41,736 on March 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-begins-20-satellite-vaccination-centres-to-cover-more-45-plus-people/articleshow/81922057.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Delhi||RWAs say they are unaware of +ve patients in their localities||New Delhi: With the increase in Covid-19 cases in the city again, some residents welfare associations (RWAs) have expressed concern over delay in updating information about containment zones/clusters of houses by local administrations.Despite testing positive, residents often don’t share the information and flout quarantine norms such as proper disposal of garbage, thereby increasing chances of spreading the infection, RWAs alleged. Local officials, however, claimed the districts were doing the job for micro-containment diligently and coordinating with the affected families on quarantine norms.Chitra Jain, a member of New Friends Colony RWA, said they had got to know about a few cases after the list of containment zones was released recently. “While residents of two houses voluntarily informed us, the rest didn’t. We couldn’t also get updates from any authority. Now when we approached the corporation and residents to dispose of their waste separately, we got to know that 10-12 days have already passed,” said Jain.The authorities are not liable to share information with RWAs, but there should be a way of updating people/RWA representatives, she added.Sanjay Rana, president of GK-II RWA, said only after some infected people informed the RWA, it pursued the corporation to lift garbage as per norms. An official from South East district said they had launched a website on Monday with updated information on containment clusters, vaccination centres, etc. “Unlike last year, we aren’t containing the entire lane or area, but micro-containment,” he added.RWAs in some areas said they were now getting information on district websites. Ruby Makhija, secretary of Navjiwan Vihar RWA, said they got to know about cases after deployment of civil defence volunteers. But “things have improved comparatively”. A South district official said they were regularly updating the website with relevant information and regularly informing other bodies, including corporations. “But we don’t inform RWAs officially,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rwas-say-they-are-unaware-of-ve-patients-in-their-localities/articleshow/81920141.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 54-yr-old sister of journalist killed by Chhota Rajan gang in dire need of help||MUMBAI: Nearly a decade after journalist, J Dey, was gunned down by henchmen of gangster Chhota Rajan, his sister is battling the emotional scars left by the tragedy and is also struggling to make ends meet. Dey was shot down near his residence in Powai on June 11, 2011. In 2018, a special MCOCA court sentenced Chhota Rajan and eight others to life imprisonment for the murder. A few social workers and activists who recently interacted with Leena Dey, 54, said that the trauma of losing her brother and later their mother, Bina Dey, in 2018, has made her anxious and lonely. “I recently met Leena at her Ghatkopar (west) house as she had randomly started calling several of J Dey’s old contacts from his telephone book. The pension which used to come to her mother from the Indian Navy also stopped three years ago since there was some issue in re-submitting the pension form for its continuation,” said former journalist and social activist of Desh Seva Samiti NGO, S Balakrishnan. When TOI spoke to her, she said, “After my brother was killed, my mother used to take care of me. But she too has passed away. Who will take care of me now?” Chairperson of Mumbai Press Club, Gurbir Singh, said the Mumbai Press Club had raised funds for Dey’s family after his death, and handed it over to his mother. “It is sad to see the family members suffer due to the acts of violence by underworld criminals. The incident has also ruined the career of another young journalist who was accused of having incited Chhota Rajan to kill Dey. She was later acquitted and freed, but it spelt the end of her journalism career.” Singh further added, “If necessary, the press club can again come together to help Leena Dey in her current situation.” Mumbai-based social activist Vijay Mohanani of Bombay Animal Rights, told TOI, “J Dey never hesitated in helping people during times of trouble. I am trying to see how his sister can be given some assistance so that her suffering is alleivated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-54-yr-old-sister-of-journalist-killed-by-rajan-gang-in-dire-need-of-help/articleshow/81921343.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Nagpur||Last ‘ambush’ deaths in Maharashtra were in 2009||Nagpur: Maharashtra had last suffered mass casualties in ambushes laid by the Maoists in 2009. Around 51 cops were killed in three encounters at different places. Since then, casualties in ambushes had been barely one or two. As per the security experts, the bigger movement of troops, like the 1,700-2,000 in the Chhattishgarh operation, with many vehicles can be very dangerous, especially in a place where Maoists have been practicing guerilla warfare like ambush for decades with a seasoned commander like Madvi Hidma at the helm. DIG, Naxal (Gadchiroli) range, Sandip Patil said Maharashtra’s security forces have stopped moving in large numbers because they get noticed easily and information often gets leaked. “We send our commandos in small groups in one or two vehicles. Our back-ups have helped us deter several ambushes,” he said, adding, “In many ambushes, Maoists have been surrounded by a web of our forces.” The latest ambush of the combined security forces in the Bastar district of Chhattishgarh where 23 jawans were killed and another 33 injured brings back memories of 17 personnel killed and another 15 injured in Sukma in March last year. While Chhattisgarh security forces continued to bleed in ambushes, their neighbour Maharashtra, ever since the 2009 setbacks, adopted an anti-ambush strategy and has been outsmarting rebels in their own strongholds. Maharashtra police had suffered blast casualties in Pushtola in 2012 where around 13 CRPF were killed, 10 C-60 commandos lost their lives in Murmadi and 15 jawans were slain in 2019 in Jambhulkheda but none of them was a planned ambush with a gun battle on the ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/last-ambush-deaths-in-maharashtra-were-in-2009/articleshow/81922058.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||With no word on Covid guidelines, wildlife tourism spared for now||Nagpur: The statewide restrictions that came into force on Monday will be not impact wildlife tourism unless the respective district collectors come out with any special orders. The park managers have put the ball in the court of district collectors who head the Disaster Management Authority (DMA) and implementing government orders during the pandemic. Chandrapur district collector Ajay Gulhane told TOI tourism in Tadoba core and buffer zone will be as usual with Covid-19 protocols being followed. Pench CCF and field director Ravikiran Govekar said, “As there is no specific mention about wildlife parks, we are waiting for the Nagpur and Wardha district collectors to clarify the matter. Until then, tourism will be as usual in Pench and Bor tiger reserves, Umred-Karhandla, and Mansinghdeo wildlife sanctuaries.” Similar views were expressed by M Ramanujam, conservator and field director of Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR). “Tourism will continue as usual as there is no clarity on wildlife tourism,” he said. This is peak wildlife tourism season and closure of tourism would mean a huge loss to the tiger foundations as well as thousands directly and indirectly dependent for livelihood on tourism. Tadoba conservator and field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar said since the start of tourism from October 1, 2021, Tadoba had been following the protocols and there have been no positive cases. Till the lockdown is in force till April 30, six persons of a family will be allowed in one safari vehicle. “If the tourists do not belong to a single family, four persons will be allowed, excluding guide and driver.” In Tadoba, the timing of the morning safari will be from 7 am to 11 am and afternoon from 2.30 pm to 6.30 pm. On Saturdays and Sundays, when full lockdown has been announced, entry to only those tourists who have done advanced bookings and are staying in the resorts for the purpose of safari on these days will be allowed. There will be no spot booking or offline quota. There is no change in the rest of the conditions like the use of masks, social distancing, hand sanitization, etc. However, even as tourism has been allowed on Saturdays and Sundays, resort owners said, “There have been several cancellations due to complete lockdown in the state and hence logistics and transport will be an issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-no-word-on-covid-guidelines-wildlife-tourism-spared-for-now/articleshow/81920149.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Phase III clinical trials of PegIFN, which the company sells under the ‘PegiHep’ brand name, have shown promising results in treating Covid-19, the Ahmedabad-based group said on Monday. Zydus said interim results indicate that the drug, when administered early during the course of infection, could help patients recover faster and avoid many of the complications seen in the advanced stages of the disease. “The treatment regimen would be less cumbersome and more affordable for patients as Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b is a single-dose regimen,” the company said. “It would also ensure better compliance.” For years, the drug has been safely taken by chronic hepatitis B and C patients. The drug has been repurposed for the treatment of Covid-19. According to Zydus, patients on PegIFN also showed lesser need for supplemental oxygen during the clinical trial, indicating that it was able to control respiratory distress and failure. Respiratory problems have been among the major challenges in treating Covid-19. “With these positive results, the company has applied for an approval for additional indication with DCGI for the use of PegIFN in the treatment of Covid-19,” the company said. “We are encouraged by the results of Phase III study which has confirmed the potential to reduce virus titres when given early in the disease,” said Sharvil Patel, MD, Cadila Healthcare Limited, the flagship company of Zydus Cadila Group. ‘Titre’ means concentration. Phase III trials of the drug were conducted on 250 patients across 20-25 centres in India and detailed results will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, the company said. Besides conducting a Phase II trial in Mexico, the company is working with the United States Food and Drug Administration to initiate appropriate clinical trials for Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b in the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/zydus-seeks-nod-to-use-repurposed-drug-for-covid/articleshow/81921317.cms||---

The special drive was held to make up for the blood shortage in the blood banks of the district. According to the primary estimates, the blood banks in the district are left with blood stock adequate for not more than four days. The shortage is due to the Covid vaccination drive. As per the rules, the vaccinated person cannot donate blood for few weeks after the first and second dose is injected. District guardian minister Satej Patil, who is also the district president of Congress, led the drive. He donated the blood and appealed to Congress workers and citizens to step forward and donate blood. Patil said, “Our society has a kind heart. I am confident that to fill in the shortage of blood, the citizens across the state will turn up for donating blood and save lives of people waiting for critical surgeries to take place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/over-200-cong-workers-donate-blood/articleshow/81918438.cms||---

As per the new government norms, shops selling non-essential items will remain closed till April 30. Only shops and establishments dealing in essential supplies/services have been exempted. Traders of non-essential goods said the Covid pandemic has already taken a toll on their businesses and they are under severe financial stress. They also wondered how they were supposed to pay their employees’ salaries if their businesses are to stay shut. Traders have demanded that these restrictions be rolled back so that they can ply their businesses. “It is a sort of a lockdown, but the name has been changed — purportedly to ‘break the chain.’ The public and the traders do not want a lockdown,” said Santosh Mandlecha, the president of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MACCIA). “As traders, we are ready to follow all norms and instructions issued by the state government. But the trade business also supplies raw materials. Will it be possible for the industries to run their manufacturing units after a few days if there is a shortage of raw materials?” he asked. Digvijay Kapadiya, the president of Nashik cloth merchants’ association, said the traders are not against the steps taken by the government to curb the spread of Covid, but they should have taken the traders into confidence before taking such a strict measure. “Most of the workforce is engaged in industrial and farming activities. In comparison, a small number of people are engaged in running the shops selling non-essential supplies. Then why are lockdown norms only enforced on such shops?” asked Kapadiya. He added: “We have already purchased goods ahead of the wedding season that begins next month. Moreover, how will we pay the salaries of our staff?” “The district guardian minister on Sunday had said people will be informed three days before the implementation of the restrictions, but all of a sudden, the government has announced the curbs on all, barring essential services and industries.

These officers will act as a single point of contact for seafarers to voice their grievances while dealing with the government, unions and the shipping company, president Frank Viegas said. “According to ITF, seafarers are among the most exploited and abused group of workers in the world...it is therefore important that there is an appointed SRO in each company whom seafarers can approach for any legal guidance, support and for seafarers to ensure their safe and secure voyage in international waters,” stated the association’s letter to minister for shipping Mansukh Mandaviya.  This along with other demands were officially handed over to the commissioner of NRI affairs Narendra Sawaiker on Monday and also sent to director general shipping, maritime union of India among other stakeholders. The association has also put forth the demand for shorter contracts periods of seven months for seafarers stating that the shorter contracts many companies are offering are not available for crew from all ranks and departments. The “shorter contracts” will motivate seafarers to go to sea and encourage more people to join the industry, Viegas said. The association has also highlighted the need for 2GB internet to be provided to seafarers by their companies to connect with their families along with repatriation up to their final destination, irrespective of the destination mentioned in the SEA, and not to the location of the reporting office. Another demand is double overtime so that seafarers who complain of lack of sleep, hectic schedules leading to accidents and injuries can be avoided. Seafarers are often unaware of medical benefits available to them. “It would be desirous for companies to create more awareness amongst seafarers related to medical benefits so that they are well versed with all requirements, eligibility, benefits, etc, to avail of these benefits whenever the situation arises,” the association stated, suggesting that they be provided leaflets when joining. Speaking as the chief guest on the occasion, Sawaikar highlighted the crucial role played by seafarers and called them heroes of the seas. He assured all his help to alleviate their grievances and announced that the seafarers pension that had been stopped for a while will resume from next month with retrospective effect from January 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goan-sailors-body-pushes-for-seafarer-relation-officer/articleshow/81921373.cms||---

After a few attempts of trying to procure the anti-viral drug used for treating Covid-19 patients, she finally found it at one place but was asked to pay Rs 4,500 per vial, though it costs around Rs 1,700. “Since her request was turned down at a few places, she wasn’t sure whether it will be available elsewhere and ended up procuring it at a high price,” said her brother, Manish. At a time when several private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients ran out of stock for remdesivir, cases of patients getting overcharged were also reported in Ahmedabad as well as Vadodara. A resident of Navrangpura in Ahmedabad also faced a similar issue. “My father required remdesivir injections and when we asked the doctor, he asked to pay Rs 40,000 for some six injections which otherwise cost much less. He asked us to take a decision within five minutes and we refused to pay anything extra and decided to procure it ourselves. It took some time but we could finally manage it,” she said. Alpesh Patel, President, Federation of Gujarat State Druggist and Chemist Association (FGSCDA), said, “A stock of 5,000 vials per day was being supplied to Vadodara every day. Going by the number of patients being admitted every day, this is insufficient. There are only about half a dozen manufacturers, and the stock from a couple of them is not available for the last few days in the state.” Despite several attempts, Dr H G Koshia, commissioner, FDCA – Gujarat, could not be reached for comments on the issue. Sources said that availability of remdesivir is a concern and some players tend to overcharge, amid a significant surge in demand and limited supply. Relatives of patients have been inquiring at individual chemists asking them to check with their stockists over the availability of the anti-viral drug. Shortage of the medicine continues at several private hospitals across the state. The relative of a patient admitted in a hospital on the Productivity Road in Vadodara had been searching for the drug since morning. “The hospital said it did not have the medicine and asked the relatives to arrange if possible,” said a friend of the patient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cases-of-overcharging-for-remdesivir-surface/articleshow/81921362.cms||---

In the backdrop of explosives-laden car found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai in February, the recovery of gelatin sticks from an SUV near Amravati has put the cops and security agencies in a tizzy. Besides six boxes of explosives, the cops have seized the SUV, two mobile sets, all worth Rs10.59 lakh and arrested two persons. Commissioner of police Arti Singh said the ATC head received a tip-off that two persons were carrying explosives in a four-wheeler, which was parked on Wadgaon Mahure road. The ARC team led by PI Nilima Araj reached the spot and checked the car only to find six boxes containing 1,200 gelatin sticks. Singh said the duo in the SUV, identified as Kaansingh Ganpatsingh Ranavat (44) and Suraj Bharatsingh Bais (31), both residents of Nandgaon Peth, was placed under arrest as both could not furnish papers regarding the explosives. An offence has been registered against the two at Nandgaon Peth police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1200-gelatin-sticks-seized-from-suv-near-amravati/articleshow/81922062.cms||---

On Monday, the price of an oxygen cylinder for industrial use was doubled to Rs360. A notification on Sunday stated, “Any industrial process that is a net consumer of oxygen as a raw material is to be disallowed by default from April 10.” Any manufacturer who wishes to carry on using oxygen would need to obtain specific permission from the licensing authority. Around 1,250MT oxygen is produced in the state daily. The curbs have been imposed following an urgent need for extra oxygen at Covid care centres and hospitals, with a surge in serious cases. Indore administration also told oxygen manufacturers to supply it only for medical use. The notification stated that licensing authorities should ensure establishments stop the process by April 10 or obtain explicit permission. All industrial producers of oxygen have to reserve 80% of production for medical and pharmaceutical purposes. They need to declare customers and end-use of oxygen supplied from April 10. “Fabrication, steel… all units that require gas-cutting will be hit,” said Sandeep Parikh, vice-president, Confederation of Small Scale Industries Association. Sandeep Belsare, president, Pimpri-Chinchwad Small Scale Industries Association, said the government should freeze the price of oxygen being provided to industries and ensure against blackmarketing. Another big worry for manufacturing units is RT-PCR tests for workers every 15 days. “It is expensive... to expect us to do it for every worker is unfair,” said Parikh. Eknath Sonawane, member, Thane Small Scale Industries Association, said in Thane district two lakh workers were employed in manufacturing units and there was no infrastructure around these units to ensure RT-PCR tests every 15 days. “Reports take at least three days and are expensive,” he said. Belsare said there were three lakh workers in Pimpri-Chinchwad and 80% were aged below 45. Parikh said in the Thane-Navi Mumbai belt too, most workers were aged below 45. They said government must allow vaccination for all, on priority. Manufacturers said curfew may disrupt movement of trucks, affecting loading/unloading of goods. “Disruption of supply chain will shut industries. Shops supplying industrial material should be kept open, administrative staff sit in other offices and they must be allowed to come to work,” they warned. BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha, receiving representations from traders demanding that shops, malls, restaurants be allowed to operate, said, “If BMC acts against few violators, others will fall in line.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-industries-told-to-stop-using-oxygen-for-production-from-apr-10/articleshow/81921400.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Delhi||Delhi: Gurukul shut down after several students test positive for Covid-19||NEW DELHI: The Arya Kanya Gurukul in New Rajinder Nagar was shut down on Monday after some students returned positive results for Covid-19. Of the 130 residential students, around 16 had been tested. While a teacher said that of the nine positive cases, one was placed in quarantine on the campus and the others sent home, a member of the managing committee said there were only seven positive cases. The gurukul is a residential school managed by Pranti Arya Mahila Sabha and has girls from across the country studying there in classes IV to XII. It had reopened in December last year after the lockdown. Indra Sharma, who identified herself as an acharya, or teacher, at the gurukul, said, “The students were taken for testing to a mohalla clinic on April 3. Nine of them tested positive.” She claimed that the students were probably infected by a sadhvi who lived on the campus. “The sadhvi has been living illegally on the campus. She was the first to test positive. Later, 16 children who developed fever were sent for testing.” Usha Sarin, who identified herself as a member of the prabhandak committee of the gurukul, disclosed that only those students who showed symptoms of Covid were taken for testing. “We were initially told that the tests had proved negative. The parents came and took the children away. It was only later we got the message about seven tests being positive,” said Sarin. Sarin also alleged that the girls were infected by a teacher who had been going out frequently and not following the restricted movement orders. Asked if the managing committed had taken permission from Delhi government to reopen the residential school, Sarin argued, “We are a very old institute and we recently celebrated the golden jubilee.” While Sarin seemed to suggest that the principal of the institution had neglected institutional matters after herself testing positive for Covid, Sharma claimed, “The residential campus was opened without taking permission from the state government. We have been protesting about this for the last few days, but the administrative people sent the children home without testing all of them. This is very wrong, but they didn’t listen to us.” A student at NC Jindal Public School in Punjabi Bagh too tested positive for the infection, forcing the school to postpone the improvement exam. In a message sent to the students, the school administration said, “Due to some unforeseen circumstances, the Class XII improvement test for physics stands cancelled.” The school has asked all students who had come in contact with the infected Class XII student to get themselves tested. School principal DK Pandey did not respond to phone calls and messages from TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gurukul-shut-down-after-several-students-test-positive-for-covid-19/articleshow/81920163.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Lucknow||CM Yogi Adityanath suspends two Pratapgarh cops||LUCKNOW: Cracking whip against corruption, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered suspension of two police officers in Pratapgarh on Monday night. Action against the two officers — ASP (west) Dinesh Kumar Dwivedi and CO Kunda Jitendra Singh Parihar — was taken after district police started a crackdown on illicit liquor trade in the aftermath of seven hooch deaths last week. The CM has also ordered a probe by the anti-corruption wing into the role of the duo’s connivance with liquor mafia. During the operations, illicit liquor worth over Rs 1 crore was recovered from Kunda circle area twice while a manufacturing unit was unearthed in Babuganj area of Kunda. The recoveries were made from police station areas of Kunda and Hathgawan, both of which come under the supervision of ASP west, said a senior police officer. Hence, prima facie CO and ASP failed to discharge their supervisory duty properly and their neglect resulted in thriving illicit liquor factories. Additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi said departmental action will also be taken against the two officers. Meanwhile, SP Pratapgrah, Akash Tomar, suspended SHO Kunda, SI Ajay Singh of Babuganj Bazaar Halka, and SI Hansraj Dubey of Hathgawan Tomar has also recommended suspension and action against SHO Hathgawan Uday Tripathi along with a probe by the anti-corruption wing. Tripathi was transferred to the UP STF recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-suspends-two-pratapgarh-cops/articleshow/81921346.cms||---

---||Agra||Agra youth dies ‘in custody’, kin cry torture, cops say rabies killed him||AGRA: A dhaba owner from Agra who had been arrested on March 25 died at a Delhi hospital on Sunday night. His family said it was a case of custodial torture and death — he had been beaten up, threatened with “encounter” and his private parts doused in petrol when he didn’t run as he had been asked to. Police said he died of rabies. Dharmendra, 27, ran a dhaba at Jaitpur in Agra. “On March 25, he was picked up by police, saying there was a meeting of all dhaba owners at the police station before the panchayat election. The next day, he was sent to jail,” his elder brother Mukesh said. Police, however, said he had been arrested for dealing in spurious liquor. On April 3, his family got word that he had fallen sick and admitted to Agra’s SN Medical College. Before the family could get there, Dharmendra had been moved to Delhi’s Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Diseases Hospital on April 4 at about 2.45am with a dog bite injury to his left foot, hydrophobia and aerophobia — the last two are symptoms of rabies. His family, however, dismissed this possibility. “He had never been bitten by a dog,” Mukesh said. “At the Delhi hospital, when we saw him, he told us he had been badly beaten up, given electric shocks and threatened death by encounter. He was asked to run away from custody and when he refused, they poured petrol on his private parts.” He died on April 4 at 7pm. The family has filed a written complaint to Agra SSP Muniraj G, who has ordered an inquiry. Police refuted the custodial torture allegations. SP (east) K Venkat Ashok said, “After conducting a preliminary inquiry, things are crystal clear. There was no police torture. We conducted a medical examination before sending him to judicial custody. There was no fresh external injury on his body.” The cause of death, according to police, was rabies. “As per my investigation, he had been bitten by a dog two and a half months ago,” the SP said, citing a "conversation with a labourer who worked with Dharmendra". The form for admitting patients at the Delhi hospital said the dog bite was one and a half years old. And the form at Agra’s Medical College said the “dog bite on left lower limb (was from) two years back.” The councillor of Agra district jail wrote in a letter to the head of the department, emergency, at the Delhi hospital that the patient had himself mentioned a dog bite from two years ago “with immunisation of anti-rabies vaccination.” The form at the Delhi hospital, however, mentioned that his vaccination doses, just two, were “incomplete”. “Full treatment of five doses is compulsory in post-exposure prophylaxis,” associate professor Dr Shailendra Singh Chaudhary from SN Medical College told TOI. Symptoms of rabies can occur any time between two months and seven years. “An autopsy will be conducted on Tuesday,” SP Ashok said. “The deceased had criminal record. He had been booked thrice earlier — in 2014, 2018 and 2020 — under the Excise and NDPS Acts besides the recent arrest.” Dharmendra is survived by his wife and three children, aged five, three and one-and-a-half.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-youth-dies-in-custody-kin-cry-torture-cops-say-rabies-killed-him/articleshow/81918446.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Through the new water supply project, Godavari water will be supplied to the residents. Currently, officials are supplying Krishna water to its consumers, which is insufficent to meet the needs of all the residents. The new water supply project will be implemented based on an ‘inter-linking’ water supply system, SCB officials said. Residents of Bollarum and certain other areas in Cantonment are receiving less quantity of water. “In the new water supply plan, the pumphouses situated in north and south would be inter-linked with the infrastructure to ensure supply of both Godavari and Krishna waters to meet the demand of 3.5 lakh residents of the Cantonment,” said an SCB official. A joint inspection by HMWS&SB has already been completed to tap Godavari water and a blueprint has been prepared. “Once the water supply plan is commissioned, we will considering providing water on alternate days too,” an SCB official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-water-supply-project-for-cantt-areas/articleshow/81920188.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Civic chief to the rescue of positive patient at GMCH||Nagpur: For over half-an-hour, 69-year-old Ganesh Kumar, a Covid-19 patient, lay in the bathroom of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) after falling in the Indian-style toilet. He kept shouting for help but no one came, and he had to crawl back to his bed in the ward before a ward boy came to his help. The next day, it took the intervention of municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B through social activist Ankita Shah, before Kumar got proper attention, and access to a western style toilet that he had asked for in the beginning. Calls and messages by TOI to GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta for comment on the matter went unanswered. The incident took place on Sunday morning. “Around midnight, I was suddenly shifted to general ward from Intensive Care Unit (ICU). As I am old and a patient of slipped disc, I requested them access to western style bathroom but nobody paid heed,” says Kumar (name changed). The senior citizen breaks down while recounting the horrific ordeal to TOI. “Around 6.30am, I fell while I was trying to sit in the washroom. I was in pain and kept calling for help, but in vain. With my pants down, I tried crawling till my bed. It took me over 20 minutes to reach there,” he says. Even after reaching his bed, Kumar could not climb up. “My ankles were so weak that I kept falling down. Finally, after 10-15 minutes, a ward boy came and helped me,” adds Kumar. His son, who is also positive and was in quarantine, was forced to leave his house and come to the hospital to help Kumar. When the hospital staff refused to help them, Kumar sought help from social activist Ankita Shah. She immediately approached Radhakrishnan, who took urgent cognisnace of the issue. Directions were issued by him to GMCH authorities and Kumar was finally shifted to a better-equipped ward with a western toilet facility. “I am grateful to the commissioner for acting so urgently. Had he not been there, I fear to imagine what I would have gone through,” says Kumar. “It is unfortunate that patients are being exposed to such insensitivity, which is a result of sheer overload of work. Hospitals are witnessing deaths on a day-to-day basis and are not realizing what a common man is facing. A lot of human touch, capacity-building and orientation is needed,” says Radhakrishnan while talking to TOI. Adding that not every affected patient can approach him, the commissioner says, “Hospitals should not wait for calls from IAS officers or ministers. Every life is important. If any patient faces difficulties, they should immediately approach in-charge officials at the hospitals or NMC’s helpline number.” Stating that proper hygiene and well-trained staff should be the priority at government hospitals, Shah says, “The government should utilize the Covid funds and ensure better facilities for patients. If there is a shortage of beds, infrastructural facilities, even if temporary, should be set up.” The activist adds that instead of spending crores on travelling and political rallies, government should shell out money for fighting the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/civic-chief-to-the-rescue-of-positive-patient-at-gmch/articleshow/81920205.cms||Manka Behl

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Covid detected in Bhagwati Singh’s body hours after death||LUCKNOW: In a rare turn of events, Covid-19 was detected post-mortally in Bhagwati Singh, founder member of the Samajwadi Party, who had pledged to donate his body to medical students of King George’s Medical University. After his death on Sunday morning, the family fulfilled his promise by donating the 89-year-old leader's body to KGMU’s anatomy department. However, when the body was screened for Covid-19 as per normal protocol, it was found positive to the pandemic infection. “The donated body was tested as per protocol to save medical students from getting exposed to the such a contagious infection. When the result was found positive, the body was handed over back to the family for respectful and ritualistic funeral. We have also informed the local administration so that the testing and contact tracing exercise may be launched,” said Dr Sudhir Singh spokesperson, KGMU. The body was handed over to the family at around 11 am from where closed relatives took it to the Baikuntha Dhaam electric crematorium. Complaining of lot of inconvenience here, son Rakesh Singh said: “Four of us kept waiting for our turn for more than three-and-a-half-hour as only one of the two units at the crematorium are functional. The administration must get it repaired immediately in public interest.” Meanwhile, district health office launched testing and contact tracing exercise. Samples from ten family member, including all women, two servants and two children, were collected by a team and the report is expected by Tuesday morning. “All the women were tested, but the men, including two of my grand uncles, father, uncle, two brothers and a cousin, are yet to be tested. In fact, we requested the team to wait for their return from the funeral, but they did not. We have also requested them to revisit us when they can, but so far we have not got a positive reply,” Bhagwati Singh’s grand-daughter Pooja told TOI. However, merely testing the close family and relatives may not be able to help in checking spread from this point as going by family’s claim; several thousand paid a visit to the River Bank colony based residence. “More than 10,000 persons have paid a visit to our home in River Bank Colony on Sunday while many reached KGMU thereafter. We urge everyone to watch for symptoms and ensure that they stay safe from the virus,” requested Rakesh. Office of the CMO did not respond despite repeated efforts. The family also regretted the unfortunate turn of events and believed that the final good deed of their Samajwadi Party leader could not see light of the day. “The doctors told us that many people pledge but only a few commitments translate into actual handing over like ours. The Covid-19 virus wasted his donation,” rued Pooja. She also said that Singh showed no sign of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-detected-in-bhagwatisinghs-body-hrs-after-death/articleshow/81921371.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Kolkata||DoD Arambagh||Arambag: Two years ago, she had been braving the scorching sun in Bishnupur to campaign for her estranged husband who had defected from the Trinamool Congress to join BJP. Today, she is fighting it out for herself, on a turf unknown to her even a month back. Meet Sujata Mandal, who came in media focus after BJP MP Saumitra Khan sent a divorce notice to her. The sight of her breaking down in front of TV cameras immediately touched chords of thousands who watched Sujata and Saumitra’s emotional setback. Within months, Trinamool Congress decided to field her from Arambag in Hooghly — one of the tough areas the ruling TMC has to tackle during the 2021 state assembly elections. In 2019 Lok Sabha poll, TMC was ahead of the BJP by 4,000 votes from the Arambag assembly segment. But it had lost nearby Purshura and Goghat to BJP. In the following two years, Arambag — once a Left bastion — has been riddled with factional feuds in the TMC ranks. “These two years have moulded me into a different person and I accepted this as a challenge to prove myself again. I promised to Didi and Abhishek-da (Abhishek Banerjee) that I will not disappoint them,” Mandal said. “My entry into politics was accidental. The BJP MP from Bishnupur (Saumitra) was not able to enter following court orders and I was prepared to do what a wife could have done. I was absolutely a greenhorn, but my sincere approach made people trust what I told them,” Sujata said minutes before she was getting ready for a temple visit. After her hurricane campaign ensured a victory to Saumitra, PM Narendra Modi congratulated Sujata personally. “I was very happy with whatever was happening back then. But as time passed, I could realise that the BJP has no intention to pull the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe up from where they are now. This was the first disillusion I had about the party,” she recounted. In December last year she joined the TMC. But Mandal cannot deny the outsider barb applicable to her. Moreover, the BJP in last two years claims to have gained its support base among the scheduled caste population in the area. “We have made some inroads into the 21% minority vote as well. People prefer a son of the soil and she is absolutely new here. She doesn’t even know the sentiment of the locals,” said Madhusudan Bag, BJP candidate from Arambag. “I might not be the girl next door in Arambag, but in these years people close to me have drifted away. On the other hand, strangers have drawn closer to me. People here will not refuse me,” Mandal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dod-arambagh/articleshow/81920213.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Businessman donates ration, extends help to scores hit by Covid-19||HYDERABAD: For several families left struggling for daily essentials during the lockdown, those like Premal Parekh are a ray of hope. The 50-year-old businessman not only distributed ration among many of these households, but also provided stationery kits to school students and financial help to those in need. In fact, Parekh, who started his philanthropic work 30 years ago, has been at the forefront in extending help to families on a long-term basis. He supports about 30 families through donations, including ration kits to 75 families every month. “I realised that extending one-time support to any family gives them temporary relief. But if I support even one family for a longer period of time, it can bring about a vast change in their lives,” said Parekh, who heads a textile firm. A resident of Begumpet, Parekh has extended support to labourers and tribal people among many others. A few of them happen to be students who were on the verge of dropping out from college. “Together, I and my brother had to pay about Rs 34,000 towards tuition fee. Since my father lost his job due to the pandemic, we were unable to pay the fee on time. Then, Parekh paid our entire fee thereby saving us from dropping out,” said Dixita Vyas, a degree student. Parekh has also worked closely with several NGOs to extend help, especially in the education sector. “He has had keen interest in the education sector. Every time we have a new project wherein we need support from some philanthropist, he is among the first ones whom we approach. He has also helped us set up solar lights in tribal areas,” said Maharshi Dave, founder of Sparsh, a local NGO, adding that more than 1,500 food kits have been distributed in tribal schools and brick kilns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bizman-donates-ration-extends-help-to-scores-hit-by-covid-19/articleshow/81920184.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Only 24 of 524 colleges opt for Lucknow University’s centralised admission process||LUCKNOW: A majority of Lucknow University colleges stayed away from the centralized admission process with only 24 of the 524 associated colleges opting to admit students under the system. On March 10, LU had invited applications from its 180 colleges in the city and 344 colleges from four other districts to admit students under the university’s centralized admission process. Under the system, a candidate just needs to fill one application form for admission to LU and its associated colleges instead of filling separate forms for respective colleges. The system was introduced to save both time and resources. Only around 5%, that is 24 colleges from the city, have shown interest in being part of the system against 70 last year. No college from the four other districts—Hardoi, Sitapur, Rae Bareli, and Lakhimpur Kheri—has applied. LU had set a deadline of March 31 for colleges to apply for the process but owing to poor response, has extended the date to April 30. Meanwhile, even a month after beginning the admission process, LU has not declared the names of colleges that are part of the centralized process. This has confused candidates about the need to fill separate forms. “Many colleges have begun their admission process but it is not clear whether applying to LU is sufficient or a separate form needs to be filled. LU has not declared anything in its online admission brochure regarding colleges covered,” said Arpit Raghuvanshi, a student. Supriya Pathak said, “Other universities declare in their admission brochure the names of associated colleges in which a candidate stands a chance depending on merit. But LU has not declared any information.” According to experts, LU’s centralized admission process has failed to woo colleges, as colleges consider themselves brand names to get students. Besides, colleges have to pay Rs 1 lakh as fee to be part of the centralized process. As fee of admission forms is the only source of earning for colleges, they have chosen to opt out. Further, every college has its own selection criteria to admit candidates. LU spokesperson Prof Durgesh Srivastava said, “We have extended the date till April 30 and expect more colleges to join in. Since the system has been newly introduced, it is still to gain popularity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/only-24-of-524-colleges-opt-for-lus-centralised-admission-process/articleshow/81921404.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Chouhan warns pvt hosps from overcharging Covid patients||Bhopal: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan warned the private hospitals in the state of action if they charged Covid-19 patients money in excess to the rates fixed by the state government. Reviewing the Coronavirus situation in the state at the Mantralaya here on Monday, Chouhan said even the RTPCR test rates should be as per the norms decided by the state government.Chouhan said in the wake of growing Covid-19 infection, beds should be kept ready in hospitals at the block and tehsil levels as well. Cooperation of private hospitals should be enlisted for the purpose. Reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state, Chouhan spoke to doctors of some private medical colleges and deans of medical colleges from Gwalior, Jabalpur and Indore medical colleges. He said that public awareness is a must to tackle the pandemic but rather than creating an atmosphere of distrust, panic or fear, their cooperation must be sought to overcome this crisis and a feeling should be inculcated among them that if they don’t wear masks, they would be sinning by contributing to spread of Coronavirus. He said that the ‘Kill Corona-II’ campaign would also be undertaken to involve people in the efforts to control the Coronavirus situation in the state. Chouhan said that new targets for testing have been given to districts and they should accordingly increase testing. He said ‘home isolation’ of patients should be preferred and only when a patient is seriously infected that he should be admitted in the hospital. A definite admission protocol should be developed and implemented across the state, he said. He said alertness is a must to see how many guests are coming to a marriage ceremony and where they are coming from. This information should be sought from the host. It’s a period of crisis and such restrictions will have to be imposed, he said. It was informed in the video conferencing that Madhya Pradesh is 7th in the country in terms of Coronavirus infection. In the last seven days, Bhopal had a positivity rate of 19%, Indore 15%, Jabalpur 11%, Ujjain 9%, Gwalior 8%, Betul 13%, Khargone and Ratlam 15%, Badwani 16% and Chhindwara 7%. Indore had 788 new cases, Bhopal 549, Jabalpur 236, Gwalior 146, Ujjain 98, Ratlam 85, Khargone 75, Badwani 73, Katni 65, Chhindwara 62, Betul and Narsinghpur 61, Seoni 56 and Shajapur 51. In 23 districts of the state, the number of new cases is between 20 to 50 and in 15 districts, it’s less than 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/chouhan-warns-pvt-hosps-from-overcharging-covid-patients/articleshow/81920218.cms||---

The widow, Ranjan Jha, lodged a complaint against the tenant Nikhil Chandarana on Sunday. Jha told police that Chandarana, who claimed to be an employee of a private bank, encouraged her elder son Saket to invest through SIPs ever since he hired her apartment in September last year. Saket worked in a private company in Ahmedabad and his younger brother lived with their mother in Morbi. Initially, Chandarana managed to convince Jha to transfer Rs 45,000 to him. Later, the accused started misleading Jha that income tax department might initiate an inquiry against her if she has a large sum of money in her bank account or other saving schemes. Chandarana’s ploy worked as Jha withdrew money from her bank account and also from all her deposits in postal department and LIC and gave the money to the accused for investing. Later, Chandarana also managed to trick Jha in selling her house and also took away the Rs 30 lakh which she was supposed to receive from the sale. Jha claimed that accused didn’t give her any receipts of her investments. When asked for the same, Chandarana abused Jha and also threatened to kill her and her sons if she asked for the money or reported the matter to the police. Afraid of Chandarana’s threat, Jha approached her brother, who resides in Ahmedabad. Her brother encouraged Jha to register a police complaint against Chandarana. Jha returned to Morbi and lodged a complaint on Sunday. Police are yet to arrest Chandarana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/widow-tricked-into-sip-loses-rs-61-lakh/articleshow/81920227.cms||---

During the last wave of the pandemic, the hostel of Shivaji University’s department of technology, located in Kolhapur city, and another hostel of Sanjay Ghodawat University located at Hatkanangale were converted into CCC and served to 500 patients. Patil said, “The time has come to reactivate the centres that were operating last time. I have asked officails to install medical gear once again at these centres. Assuming that the wave this time is much stronger, we have asked authorities to be ready.” Currently, the hospitals in the district have 2,539 beds, out of which 990 are oxygen beds, 220 ICU beds and 202 are with ventilators. The total oxygen available is around 50 tonne. “We have asked the officials to activate the mobile numbers to update patients about the availability of beds. Also, officials will be appointed to monitor the bed availability. The orders for procuring adequate stock of Remdesivir have been issued,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/2-covid-care-centres-to-be-reactivated-satej-patil/articleshow/81919196.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Spurt in numbers of Covid patients who test negative||NAGPUR: Ten out of every 100 patients with Covid-19 symptoms are testing negative even in repeated RT-PCR tests in the second wave of pandemic. Doctors say this might be due to 80% sensitivity of RT-PCR test and government should conduct genome sequencing to explore if there was anything more to it. Consultant physician and intensivist Dr Nikhil Balankhe told TOI, “Such patients are termed Covid Swab Negative patients. They have all symptoms like those tested positive. They also have high score in CT scan of chest. They respond well to treatment being given to positive patients.” Dr Balankhe added Covid Swab Negative patients can transmit disease to others like any other Covid patient. “There are always chances of spread due to these patients. We are advising them to home isolate themselves if they do not need hospitalization,” he said. Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) Dr Anup Marar told TOI, “Some of swab negative patients need hospitalization and some even go to ICU and need ventilators. Hospitals have developed a special ward or separate beds for such patients. They cannot be admitted in Covid ward as their relatives will complain. They also cannot be admitted in wards of non-Covid patients either. I have seen score of 10-15 in HR-CT of chest in these patients.” Both doctors said ratio of such patients was around 1% in first wave last year. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “Ratio has increased to even upto 20% in last one week. I got RT-PCR tests thrice every three days on such patients and all results were negative. Their viral load keeps changing. It could be that viral load has declined when they got tested leading to negative results.” Microbiologist Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed said, “We are noticing the same at laboratories in second wave. RT-PCR is considered gold standard test in diagnosis of Covid-19. But its sensitivity is around 80%. There is always a chance that swab samples upto 20% might give false negative.” “Late testing of patients might also give negative results in some cases. RT-PCR test detects virus in early stage. In 5-7% cases that convert into moderate to severe infection, score in HR-CT is very less in initial stage. It increases after 5-7 days of infection. When the patients land in hospitals with infection due to delay in testing, there is chance of RT-PCR being negative,” Dr Ahmed said. Asked about possibility of mutated variant not being detected by kits being used in RT-PCR tests, he said, “There are no findings till now that mutated variants escaped four types of kits/genes being used in RT-PCR tests in India or elsewhere.” Dr Shinde said said genome sequencing of negative samples cannot be done to determine variants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/spurt-in-numbers-of-covid-patients-who-test-negative/articleshow/81920207.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra Board exam 2021: SSC, HSC exams may get postponed||NAGPUR: Due to the rise in Covid-19 cases across the state, education officials are finalizing a plan for the upcoming board exams which includes a proposal to postpone it. A highly-placed source in the education department confirmed to TOI that different scenarios are being looked at and the probability of board exams getting postponed is indeed high. State’s school education minister Varsha Gaikwad did not deny the possibility of postponement. Gaikwad said, “I can’t say anything at this moment but, yes, a final decision will be taken this week itself. I will meet with various stakeholders and see what their views are about exams. Then we will have to seek the consent from chief minister’s office (CMO) as well regarding the final proposal.” Gaikwad, who herself is a qualified teacher with a master's degree in education, said, “We have to plan for contingencies. So ‘Plan A’ is basically what has been shared with everyone already. Here we have given sops like extra time, home centres, and guidelines on second attempt.” Similarly her ‘Plan B’ and ‘Plan C’ look at the steps to take if cases continue to rise. “The rising number of Covid-19 cases is a major cause for concern. And we have to consider board exams of CBSE etc which will be held within the state’s jurisdiction. So we are finalizing Plan B and C to accommodate all these concerns. For this, views of domain experts are being taken and after that, a proposal shall be put up before the CMO,” said the minister. Academics too are supporting the plan, citing ‘high infection rates'. President of School Headmasters’ Charitable Association Zafar Khan said, “We urge the government to postpone the exams for at least a month and then take a further review based on the number of cases. I have been interacting with many parents and they all say that the risk to their child’s health will increase if exams are held.” He added that many parents will use the facility of ‘second attempt’ even if exams are not postponed. “The state government has guaranteed a second attempt in June to any student who misses the exam. So parents will claim that their ward had fever on exam day and simply fill the form for the June attempt,” said Khan. On Tuesday, Gaikwad will meet with officials to review the situation and is expected to make a formal announcement by Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ssc-hsc-exams-may-get-postponed/articleshow/81924477.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

He sought clarification from the government on the matter. Akhilesh, who was in Firozabad to offer prayers at Siyardevi temple, told mediapersons that he and his Samajwadi Party workers will take the vaccination only after the vaccine is provided free of cost to the poor. “Covid-19 cases are on the rise. Government has not been able to control the virus from spreading,” he said.

But the way BJP functions, it is hard to believe that anyone will get justice.” On the ongoing farmers’ protest, Akhilesh alleged that the BJP government has cheated farmers. His party is supporting the farmers’ protest against the three farm laws since the first day, he added. Paying tribute to 23 security personnel killed in Maoist ambush in Chhattisgarh, Akhilesh said “The government should answer who is responsible for the killing of paramilitary security personnel.

---||Ludhiana||Many states asking Punjab fliers to show Covid negative report||Ludhiana: Posing new trouble for frequent fliers of Punjab, especially businessmen, several states have made it mandatory to carry a Covid-19 negative report before entering their airports. Many passengers were caught unawares about the restrictions and as a result several of them had to face inconvenience. As of now, Bihar, Karnataka, Uttarakhand and Manipur have made it mandatory for passengers coming from Punjab to get a Covid test conducted before flying. Odisha has imposed a seven days’ home quarantine and rapid antigen testing for those arriving from Punjab. Travel agents of the city are worried over the development, as they fear losing domestic air ticketing business in the coming days.Gurpreet Singh Chawla, president of Micro and Small Travel Agents’ Association, Ludhiana, said, “The domestic air travellers are facing problems, as a number of states have put Punjab on the list of those requiring mandatory Covid-19 negative report. Bihar, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Manipur and Odisha are some of such states. What is even worse is lack of proper communication from these states and airlines. One of my customers, who had booked a flight ticket to Patna, had to cancel it after he was asked by the airlines to present his Covid-19 negative report first.”Rakesh Sharma, sales head of a local travel agency, said, “In the wake of rising coronavirus cases in Punjab, every other day a state imposes restrictions on our passengers. The worst sufferers are the frequent fliers, like businessmen and professionals. Biggest challenge right now is that if they have to travel about five times in a month, they will have to get themselves tested again and again. Addition of more states to this list will definitely put a negative impact on our business.”Pawan Kumar, a resident of Pakhowal Road, said, “I had booked air tickets from Chandigarh to Bangalore for Sunday, but to my shock when I reached the check-in counter at the airport, they refused to issue me a boarding pass, saying Karnataka has made Covid-19 negative report compulsory for people travelling from Punjab. As the test report takes time, I got my flight rescheduled by a week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/many-states-asking-punjab-fliers-to-show-covid-negative-report/articleshow/81919197.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Nagpur||Doctors prescribing plasma, Covid patients too asking for it||Nagpur: There could be differing views regarding the use of convalescent plasma therapy for Covid, but doctors are using it to treat patients and more importantly, getting good results. The almost doubled demand of RBD-Plasma in the city indicates that the therapy is being used more now than it was in the first wave. “We used to provide around 30 bags of RBD plasma every day during the September 2020 peak. In March, this number has gone up to 60 bags daily,” said Dr Harish Warbhe, medical director of Lifeline RBD Plasma bank. The State Covid Taskforce has allowed the use of RBD plasma for which the guidelines were issued on March 23. “Trials of the plasma therapy may have been stopped in country, but the RBD plasma is benefitting many. This therapy is advisable in the early phase. Good quality plasma has the potential to bring down the viral load to zero within 24 hours,” said Dr Warbhe. Plasma is in high demand in many private hospitals. Even NGOs are being approached by relatives of patients for plasma. Many NGOs go through a tough time while getting plasma donors. Doctors of leading private hospitals admitted that they are using plasma for many patients and its giving them the desired results. The plasma therapy trials conducted in India last year were about blind plasma – plasma from any patient who recovered from Covid-19. According to those who advocate plasma therapy, a certain amount of antibodies is a must in the plasma for which the RBD test is conducted. In October, when deaths due to Covid-19 increased in Bhandara district, the administration had organized a donation camp in which 100 bags of plasma was collected. The death rate in Bhandara reduced significantly after that. After 18 deaths due to Covid in the last three days, the district administration has decided to conduct another plasma donation camp this week. Plasma use for Covid-19 treatment is more in practice in some western districts in Pune circle. While the recovery rate is on the higher side, fatalities are under control, said doctors. In Vidarbha, there is a need to promote plasma donation. Doctors have appealed to all those who have recovered from Covid-19 to donate plasma after 14 days of recovery. To ensure the quality of plasma and amount of antibodies in it, one must undergo RBD testing which is a simple blood test. Those eligible can donate plasma after every 28 days. Blood shortage in peripheries Many districts in Vidarbha, especially rural parts, are witnessing an acute shortage of blood. On Sunday, Buldhana’s guardian Minister Rajendra Shingne appealed to people to voluntary take part in blood donation despite restrictions in the district. “Blood banks have enough stock but many are delivering blood bags only after getting donors. With more restrictions in place from Tuesday, voluntary blood donation is likely to take a hit. Donors must come forward during this tough time,” said Dr Warbhe||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-prescribing-plasma-covid-patients-too-asking-for-it/articleshow/81920242.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Among few persons who reached the spot after the incident was Harish Kumar Gona, a social worker who runs ‘Help Our Needy People’ organisation. “I, along with four members of our team, reached the spot around 10am. I saw that the roof had fallen on the shed and some part of it had dropped on the rear side where two autos were parked. We tried to rescue two persons, of whom we couldn’t save one and managed to save the other named Rehan. He was buried under the debris and we fed him water through a pipe and kept motivating him not to lose hope. Later, the government teams brought him out and we were happy to save his life. The collapse did cause damage to the neighbouring factory, where a foreman was working. He suffered serious injuries and is admitted to a private hospital.” Aarzo Khan, whose family lives in quarters at the rear of the factory and had a miraculous escape, said, “Since Sunday, the work for lifting of lintel was going on using jacks. In the morning, when work started after 9am, my wife, Gudiya Parveen, was washing dishes, our one-year-old daughter was sleeping in the room and I was at work. My family presumed that a water tank had blasted after which my wife ran out with my daughter. I thank Almighty for saving my family.” Khan said if the whole building had collapsed, his mother, wife and daughter would have died. Gudiya said she was washing dishes when she saw bricks falling from the building, so she rushed inside to bring out her daughter and then there was smoke too. She said her elder daughter also ran out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/he-was-under-debris-we-fed-him-water-through-pipe/articleshow/81919204.cms||---

---||Kolkata||On ‘Covid break’, kids grow up, learn life skills, help with household chores||KOLKATA: No more sports on daily routine. Physical classes suspended. Lunch-time jam sessions are a distant memory. But some of the city’s teenagers are still finding the motivation to get through. They have learnt to be responsible for others — especially the grandparents — and voluntarily staying away from parties lest they become carriers of the virus. They have also learnt something hitherto overlooked in their upbringing: housework. “We keep talking about despondent youngsters who are supposedly headed for severe mental health issues. But we as parents have rediscovered our children as more responsible humans and feel quite satisfied after living through the pandemic for one whole year,” said businessman Aditya Mundhra, father of Swara, a student of Class V in La Martiniere for Girls.  She and her cousin Mahira are now adept at most household chores. “But my favourite is gardening,” said Swara. It’s not as if the kids don’t feel lonely or stressed out. “I do miss school so much, meeting friends and going for my badminton classes and trying out the new eateries in town. But I have started enjoying cooking, dishing out stuff to make my parents and grandparents happy,” said Asaawari Sahai, Class VII student of Modern High School. “Initially, when we asked our maids to stop coming, we thought it wouldn’t be for too long. My 10-year-old son, Rup, had never participated in any housework. Slowly, he started watering the plants and folding the laundry. Later, he even started mopping the floor. With time, he has learnt to help me in the kitchen,” said Rupsha Dasgupta, Fossils manager and wife of singer-composer Rupam Islam. “Someone who had never touched a knife (except to cut birthday cakes) can now deftly chop vegetables,” laughed the mother. “The pandemic has made the kids more tech-friendly. But that’s something they could have learnt later in life. What the crisis has taught them is to be good humans, empathetic and responsible. My daughter stayed away from get-togethers fearing she would bring the virus home. I feel quite proud now,” said Aasawari’s mother, Sushma Sahai, who is the associate professor of geography, Loreto College. Leading their busy lives, most working parents never found the time to teach their wards life skills. “That way, Covid-19 has been the true teacher. Like all crises, it has taught them resilience,” said businessman Tejash Doshi, father of Harshieka and Kasshvi, students of Modern High School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-cov-break-kids-grow-up-learn-life-skills-help-with-household-chores/articleshow/81919208.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Nepalese police had reportedly resorted to indiscriminate firing on four persons who were “illegally” crossing the border. One of them, Govinda Singh, had died on the spot. UP Police had refused to file an FIR on the complaint that Nepalese police opened fire when the farmers were sowing sugarcane in their fields “near the no man’s land”. Earlier, in a meeting of the ADG (Bareilly zone) Avinash Chandra with Nepalese officials that had been held a day after the incident at Kamlapuri border outpost of SSB, it was decided between the two sides that the Indian officials along with the members of the affected families would be made integral part of the investigation and the Nepalese police officials would present satisfactory replies to the queries of the Indian side related to the firing on Indian nationals. Gurmej is survived by his wife Budh Kaur and two children. The body will be brought to the native village under police security on Monday night. Forces from all the police stations of the Puranpur circle were called to ensure law and order in the village. Earlier, Govinda’s body was cremated during the late night hours and his father Gurdev Singh had alleged that the police made him cremate the body of his son in the late hours against the religious norms. Gurdev had also submitted a written complaint at Hazara police station but an FIR was not registered. When asked the reason for no FIR in this case, Puranpur circle officer Lallan Singh told TOI, “Nepal police had claimed that the incident was reported inside the Nepal territory. They had claimed that all four were carrying out illegal activities in their territory and attempted to escape which forced them to open fire. Since it is a matter between two countries, we cannot file an FIR against Nepal police and the state can take a decision in the matter. We will send our report to the state home ministry on the incident.” When asked whether Gurmej had recorded his dying declaration statement at the hospital in Lucknow, he replied, “He was unable to speak when we took him to the hospital. We will check with the magistrate concerned in Lucknow. We have sent force in the village to ensure law and order situation.” Superintendent of police Kirit Rathore, who took charge of Pilibhit last week, said, “Nepal police had opened firing on him after suspicion of some illegal activity. One person had died and Gurmej was sent to Lucknow for treatment. His body will be brought here after autopsy and last rites will be performed here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/injured-during-firing-by-nepal-security-personnel-on-march-4-up-man-30-dies-in-lko-hosp/articleshow/81917877.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

GCCI president Manoj Caculo and vice-president Ralph De Souza met with newly-elected mayor Rohit Monserrate and his deputy Vasant Agshikar, and requested a rebate for all business establishments which remained closed during the four-phase nation-wide lockdown. “We requested the mayor to kindly put up our case before the standing committee and give appropriate relief to all establishments under CCP,” said Caculo.  The lockdown, which began on March 22 last year continued till June 1 after which a slow and phased relaxation of the restrictions started. “As a result of the lock down and the restrictions imposed on the business establishments, most business establishment have come under severe financial strain and many have been forced to close down,” said Caculo. GCCI pointed out that CCP’s standing committee had returned the payment for a 45-day period of the official lockdown to the pay-parking contractor but the same benefit was not given to commercial establishments that were closed. GCCI had met former CCP mayor Uday Madkaikar and Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate on April 30 last year .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gcci-seeks-tax-rebate-for-traders-businesses-in-panaji/articleshow/81921419.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Factory roof collapses, 4 dead, 6 injured||LUDHIANA: Four workers died and six were injured, two of them seriously, after the roof of a factory collapsed at Baba Mukand Singh Nagar on Daba Road here on Monday morning. About two other workers are still trapped and teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), municipal corporation, police and civil department are trying to rescue them. The deceased have been identified as Mustakeen, Sagar Kumar, both residents of Bihar, and Peechu and Imtiaz of Ludhiana. Police said around 9.50am, about 40 workers were working to lift the lintel with the help of a jack on the third floor of the auto parts factory, Jasmail Singh and Sons, which is about 25 years old. An eyewitness said the lintel collapsed and the main part of it fell on the factory, burying the workers, and the remaining part fell on the left side where a foreman was working at a plating unit. The foreman was injured seriously. A part of it fell on the rear side on two autorickshaws and workers’ quarters. An area resident said after the incident, members of a social group, police, MC and civil administration teams reached the spot and started the rescue operation. Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma visited the site along with Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Aggarwal. An official told the Times of India that NDRF, SDRF, police, municipal corporation, civil teams were trying to save the trapped men and 37 out of 40 persons were brought out, of which four have died and six were injured. The two seriously injured have been admitted to a private hospital. “One worker was declared brought dead at hospital, one died during treatment and two bodies were recovered from debris. Drilling is being done in small areas and hydra machines are being used in the operation,” he added. An eyewitness told authorities that construction work was going on early in the morning. The civil administration inputs suggested that lintel collapsed around 9.50am. The DC said a probe would be conducted, but their foremost priority was to save the lives of workers. He said permission for construction work was not taken from MC. Earlier while inspecting the site, the deputy commissioner and CP gave full charge of the rescue operation to the teams of NDRF, SDRF, fire brigade and local police. An NDRF official said, “It seems more than 40 workers were at the site at the time. At least six phones of them are switched off.” MC blamed Fingers are being raised at the MC after the incident. Jagbir Singh Sokhi, a former councillor, said the contractor did not have trained staff and was using a jack which was wrong. Questioning the MC for allowing such a system, he said if it had checked it, the incident wouldn’t have occurred.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/factory-roof-collapses-4-dead-6-injured/articleshow/81919225.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Temporary Covid centres are fire hazards: Experts||Mumbai: Sunday’s fire at the Dahisar jumbo facility was the third such incident at a Covid hospital in the city in the last six months. There were no fatalities, but the incident had raised a question mark on the fire safety compliances at hospitals and nursing homes. Experts pointed out that patients in jumbo Covid centres are housed in temporary hangar-like structures and are vulnerable to fire incidents. Earlier, on March 26, a major fire broke out in Bhandup’s Dreams Mall and spread to Sunrise Hospital located on the third floor. Over 70 patients were rescued and 11 bodies found. In October 2020, two patients in a blaze at Mulund’s Apex Hospital caused by a short-circuit in the generator. “The jumbo Covid centres are housed in temporary structures that were planned to last only for a few months, but have been in use for over a year. They must be audited every month, and firemen must be stationed there permanently,” suggested a former chief fire officer. Following the Bhandara fire in January which claimed the lives of 10 infants, an audit was ordered in Mumbai like the rest of the state, which many city hospitals called a knee-jerk reaction without any real intention to review the ground situation. The BMC served notices to 178 private hospitals and nursing homes for major fire safety violations out of 1,073 inspected. “The problem with such audits is that they are not done in the right spirit; they are like the annual inspections that remain on paper. Since they are carried out by third-party auditors, often they are bogus. I feel only the fire brigade should carry out fire safety audits of hospitals,” the former chief fire officer said. BJP MLA from Mulund Mihir Kotecha claimed that BMC had failed to carry out any fire audits of hospitals and nursing homes before they were allowed to admit Covid-19 patients. “...There were no real fire audits as we can see from the blazes at Apex and Sunrise Hospitals and the Dahisar jumbo Covid centre,” he said. “The fire safety compliances are done by third-party auditors and they don’t carry out real drills. In the last few months, all fires have broken out on hospital premises that have complied with the fire safety norms as certified by these agencies. This sh-ows that third-party agencies are submitting bogus reports.” Civic officials said the Sunrise fire probe report that deputy municipal commissioner (disaster management) Prabhat Rahangdale will soon submit to BMC chief Iqbal Chahal will also provide recommendations to prevent such incidents in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-temporary-covid-centres-are-fire-hazards-experts/articleshow/81921421.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Justice Nath said, “We have some difficulty in the management of the board also. Plus, there is a likelihood, subject to what the Bar and registry say, that we may have to shift again to urgent matters only because the rise of Covid is causing a lot of problems for everyone. Of course, we were moving in the direction of coming into physical mode (of hearings), but may have to revert back, subject to what the standing committee decides after getting feedback from the Bar and the registry.”The hearing on petitions pertaining to the liquor prohibition issue has been adjourned till June 21.The high court shut its campus and switched to virtual proceedings in the last week of March last year due to the lockdown. For a few months, the court restricted judicial functioning to urgent cases only. The HC also ordered the shutting of all subordinate courts, which were later allowed to function through video conferencing.The HC, on a couple of occasions, decided to re-open courtrooms in a phased manner, but the increase in Covid-19 cases forced it to postpone resumption of physical hearings. It has permitted all lower courts, except those in micro-containment zones, to function physically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-may-hear-only-urgent-matters/articleshow/81921429.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Now anyone can grow and cut sandalwood tree||Nagpur: With Maharashtra government freeing sandalwood, one of the most expensive tree species, from mandatory felling permission, anyone can now grow as well as cut it to harvest the wood, which has multiple uses. The condition of transit pass (TP), however, remains unchanged. Under the Maharashtra Felling of Trees (Regulation) Act, 1964, there are 16-17 tree species that need felling permission from tree officer, who is range forest officer (RFO). However, the state notification of March 23 exempted sandalwood from felling permission. According to forest department data, there are less than 3,000 sandalwood trees remaining in forest areas. Over 614 hectare forest area is under sandalwood in Amravati and Yavatmal circles. The tree is included in the Red List of Indian Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable category. In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in June, 2020, Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar had urged him to ease rules and direct forest department to prepare a plan for promoting sandalwood value-added enterprises by extending admissible incentives and establishing sandalwood parks and units. Javadekar had requested Thackeray to promote sandalwood by establishing sandalwood knowledge parks/industrial estates etc under central and state’s industrial and micro, small & medium enterprises (MSME) policies. Accordingly, forest department held discussions in August, 2020, with stakeholders including officials, farmers, industrialists, experts, and later sent a proposal recommending freeing sandalwood from felling permission norm though a transit pass (TP) would be mandatory. This was basically done to promote sandalwood farming which fetches a bare minimum of Rs8 lakh per tonne. PCCF (HoFF) G Saiprakash was not available for comments. His predecessor and ex-PCCF N Rambabu, who had initiated the process, said, “This is a good move. In the last few years, farmers in Latur, Beed, Nashik, Katol and other areas are growing sandalwood. The exemption from felling permission will encourage them to plant sandalwood which will give them good returns. It takes 15 years for the sandalwood tree to grow, but the returns are very high.” Rambabu added, “To curb illicit felling and theft, the condition of transit pass (TP) still continues. In future, this will be done online for which modules are being worked out.” Progressive farmer Shrikant Deshpande hailed the decision. “Sandalwood plantations can make farmers ‘atmanirbhar’. The only flip side is that forest personnel should not harass them for granting a mandatory TP. However, state wildlife board member Kishor Rithe feared the relaxation may lead to vanishing of the remaining sandalwood trees. “If at all the state wants to frame any policy, it should plant sandalwood trees first and talk about it 30 years later when these trees become ripe,” said Rithe. Supreme Court in TN Godavarman Thirumulpad case had directed state governments on February 13, 2012, to frame a policy to save sandalwood trees. The court had also directed Maharashtra government to immediately close down all unlicensed sandalwood oil factories. The apex court had also asked whether sandalwood is an endangered species and opined the tree is declared as a specified plant in Schedule VI of Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972. It said time had come to think of legislation similar to the Endangered Species Act in the USA that protects both endangered and threatened species. The court had left it to the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) for inclusion of sandalwood in Schedule VI of WPA. “Instead of easing rules, time has come to take concrete steps to preserve sandalwood trees at any cost. The relaxation will certainly lead to misuse in the bordering areas of sandalwood producing states,” Rithe added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-anyone-can-grow-and-cut-sandalwood-tree/articleshow/81920275.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The eatery operates inside the Lake complex, an eco-sensitive zone included in the National Lake Conservation Plan (NLCP). KMDA, the custodian of the 192-acre Rabindra Sarobar, has closed down the eatery late on Monday evening. Morning walkers raised an alarm as they found the palm trees being felled by those running the eatery. A senior KMDA official said, “We received a complaint about two or three palm trees felled by those who run Nirala canteen on the Lake premises.” “We found the mutilated trees lying on the ground,” said a morning walker, Sanjukta Chaudhuri, the head of the zoology department at Fakir Chand College. Sumita Banerjee, a conservationist and green activist, said, “We are appalled at the audacity of these people who chopped off the trees in broad daylight.” Environmentalist S M Ghosh called it a “crime”. “All violations of the NGT orders regarding Rabindra Sarobar were reported in the past. But felling of trees to beautify a restaurant is unprecedented,” said green activist, Prabir Kumar Bose. The morning walkers have written to KMDA to step up security inside the green zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lake-trees-chopped-for-eatery-facelift-morning-walkers-upset/articleshow/81919222.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Delhi||Delhi: At partition museum, undivided attention to past||NEW DELHI: A pre-Independence electricity meter from Lahore, a refugee card, sewing machine, hand-crocheted item given as a gift in 1942 and a land deed for property in Jhang, Punjab, from 1918.  These and many items and documents will be on display at the Dara Shikoh Library in Ambedkar University Delhi, where three museums are likely to come up before August 15. To mark the 75th year of India’s independence, a Partition museum will be the first at the Mughal-era library currently under conservation by Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach). On March 15, an MoU was signed for the Dara Shikoh Library building under the “Adopt a Heritage: Apni Dharohar, Apni Pehchaan” project. The project will be implemented by a consortium that includes the Union tourism ministry, Delhi government’s department of art, culture and language and private entities Monument Mitras, The Arts and Cultural Heritage Trust (TAACHT) and Museum & Arts Consultancy (MAC). According to Kishwar Desai, chair of TAACHT, “The museum will be call Daastaan-e-Dilli and will cover everything that has happened in Delhi at different times though the focus is on the heritage of the building as it is both a colonial and a Mughal structure.” The library, built in 1643 and named after Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Emperor Shah Jahan who eventually killed in a battle for power by his brother and later emperor Aurangzeb, is located on AUD’s Kashmere Gate campus. The structure has a dual design, with Mughal features in the interior and British features installed by British officer David Ochterlony who used it as his residence. Desai said, “The Partition museum will be a people’s museum and narrate the stories of the people and how they were affected by the 1947 division. We will have items, objects and documents collected from people as well as their oral history records. We will also have official records to show thepost-1947 changes in Delhi.” One of such items is an electricity meter from a home in Lahore donated by Priyanka Mehta. “When Mehta visited her old family house in Pakistan, the current owners had kept the metre after the house was renovated as a memento for anyone coming from across the border,” said Desai. “The device will be kept in the museum to show that despite the Partition, people on either side continue to visit their historical family homes and are met with affection.” Another interesting item is a sale deed/land purchase document that was signed by Bimla Goulati's grandfather, Lala Bishandas, when he bought land in Jhang in 1918. “The refugees brought very few things with them and we are very grateful to people gifting us these precious memories,” said Desai. The second museum will relate to Dara Shikoh, his writings, his translation of the Upanishads and, since he was a Sufi believer, something on Sufi heritage of Delhi. The third museum will focus on the antiquities and sculptures related to Delhi gifted by Delhi’s department of archaeology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-partition-museum-undivided-attention-to-past/articleshow/81921454.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

It has managed to collect Rs 691 crore as against the target of Rs 670 crore. Officials said that despite a disappointing response from big defaulters, including government and private organisations, and less than one-third collection from transfer fees due to no sale/purchase of houses during pandemic, their collection could increase due to extensive campaigning in market and residential areas. “Major portion of the total revenue has been collected from private/residential properties. Our staff also pursued residents, taking the total figure to all-time high despite facing challenges due to Covid-19,” an NDMC official said. Of the total amount, Rs 43 crore has been collected as transfer duty and Rs 648 crore as property tax. In comparison, the civic agency had received Rs 643 crore as property tax in 2017-18, in 2018-19 it was Rs 603 crore and in 2019-20 it was 522 crore. From 2016-17 to 2020-21, the municipal council has issued 3,771 notices to defaulters and managed to settle 6,611 cases, most of them past cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ndmc-claims-record-tax-mop-up/articleshow/81920338.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Local people in the constituency said that cash ranging between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 was distributed for each voter by supporters of both the parties.According to a resident of Vengamedu in Karur town, the money distribution got over about two-three days ago. Those who were left out in the initial distribution on Sunday night were covered on Monday. “Money distribution was happening right under the nose of officials and it cannot happen without their knowledge. Voters too were not complaining as money was distributed by members of both the parties and they didn’t want to lose it,” said S Parthiban of Karur town. For both the present and former transport ministers, the assembly election is a fight for their political survival. While the incumbent wants to strengthen his grip over the district unit of AIADMK, Senthil Balaji, who has already taken over charge of the district unit of DMK, wants to prove his supremacy. If DMK wins, he is expected to be made a minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rs-2k-rs-3k-distributed-to-voters-in-karur/articleshow/81921443.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The cops said that the accused had posed as an app-biker and demanded Rs 500 from the judge without realizing whom he was calling. The accused — Arnab Acharya — has been remanded to police custody till April 9 by a local court. Police had tracked the call to the app-biker after the judge lodged a complaint. “The judge kept getting calls that he took an app-bike ride and that he owed the app-bike firm Rs 500. Based on the complaint, police detained the app-biker but soon realized they had been tricked. “This app-biker himself had been promised Rs 1,200 by the accused for multi-location drops. But Acharya fled after taking the ride on the pretext of arranging some change. He then began using this biker’s number to extract money at multiple places,” explained an officer. The STF was roped in and the accused was arrested from a top hotel in Salt Lake. “He used this app to call up even his family members and extort money from them,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/conman-held-for-extortion-attempt-on-city-judge/articleshow/81919233.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kochi||Kerala logs 24% rise in new Covid-19 cases in 1 week||KOCHI: Covid caseload in Kerala is increasing along with test positivity rate (TPR) due to low testing. In the past one week, there has been a 24% increase in new Covid cases reported in state and TPR during this period increased from 3.84% to 4.85%. Between March 20 and 27, Kerala reported 13,424 new cases in a week. However, new cases jumped to 16,967 between March 27 and April 3. Though state is witnessing an increase in cases amid elections, it is much lower than the caseload increase in other states witnessing the second wave. Uttar Pradesh saw a 156% increase in new cases within a week, followed by Bihar (151%) and Telangana (136%). Karnataka saw a 73% increase in one week, while it was 64% for Tamil Nadu. Though Kerala is faring better than its neighbours now, public health experts said that the numbers are increasing at a time when the advantage we had, during the initial phase of the first wave, is missing amid the political chaos. There is no strict implementation of SMS, social distancing, masks and sanitizer use. Quarantine for those coming from outside the state is mostly on paper and most first-line treatment centres and second-line treatment centres have been closed down. “Currently, no government machinery is focussing on Covid scenario in state and no one knows the exact Covid situation in Kerala. We are in a blind spot now. Most healthcare workers are busy with vaccination. Covid testing and tracing is not happening. It is really a worrying time,” said Dr Shenoy Padmanabha, who has been analysing the Covid pattern in India. Incidentally, with Covid cases on a decline in state, there was a demand that Covid treatment facilities at government hospitals should be reduced.  But, with the surge in cases, it may not happen immediately. At present, the state has the capacity to handle 4,000 to 5,000 new cases each day. Many private hospitals have stopped Covid treatment and are focussing on other ailments and surgeries that were postponed in 2020. “Presently, we aren’t seeing a big increase in cases and it’s difficult to say if Kerala is in the initial phase of a second wave. We will know where we stand in another week or two. If Covid numbers jump, like in other states during the second wave, then we may be in trouble,” said deputy medical superintendent, Thiruvananthapuram medical college, Dr Santosh Kumar SS. “Even private hospitals have seen 10% increase in Covid patients who need ICU care. People have become complacent and we may have to pay a heavy price for it,” said Dr Jayakrishnan AV, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s committee for vaccination promotion and coordination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-logs-24-rise-in-new-cases-in-1-week/articleshow/81919230.cms||Preetu Nair

In the recent past, these birds had avoided the Sukhana dam for breeding purposes. However, the nearly full waterbody this year is believed to have encouraged these birds to choose the site for reproduction. Moreover, grey herons and black-winged stilts among other birds have also chosen the Sukhana dam as a breeding ground. Kishor Pathak, the honorary wildlife warden of Aurangabad, on Monday said the river terns have been found in large numbers at the Sukhana dam this year. “The Sukhana dam is a good wetland with shallow waters. While the dam does not have island-like structures for the river terns to lay eggs, these birds have used some of the artificial elevations — formed due to digging of wells by local residents last year — for nesting purposes. These elevations along with adequate water and food have provided safer conditions for breeding,” he said. Talking about cormorants also breeding at the Sukhana dam after a long gap, Pathak said the good rainfall last year has filled the waterbody to almost full capacity. “Ample food is available for the cormorants and other birds at the Sukhana dam this year. This has led to many feathery bipeds choosing the site for breeding,” he said. Meanwhile, the population of greater flamingos have increased at the Jayakwadi dam. The attractive birds can now be seen in large flocks, said former honorary wildlife warden Dilip Yardi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sukhana-dam-becomes-bird-breeding-spot-after-a-gap/articleshow/81919238.cms||---

---||Trichy||Over 20 test Covid-positive in Trichy IT firm||TRICHY: The quick spread of more than 20 fresh infections in the last week in ITeS offices in the city has evoked concern among employees working from their offices. The employees doubt the adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) and claim that managements are downplaying the second wave of the pandemic. An ITeS firm on Bharathiyar road has reported around 20 new cases since the last week of March. However, since the employees who took their test in Trichy government hospital provided their house address, the workplace escaped scrutiny by civic body officials. With the work environment completely air-conditioned and closed, employees claim that one positive case reported on March 26 has further infected around 19 others. “A colleague of ours tested positive the day after she visited the office. Two more colleagues whom she came in contact with also tested positive. Following testing of other employees, three more were found to have contracted the virus,” an ITeS employee from Bharathiyar road added. Additionally, two more ITeS companies in the city are said to have recorded positive cases. Some family members of the ITeS employees are also allegedly affected. Sources said the management was reluctant to allow work-from-home option, thus forcing the employees to go to office. The first positive case reported in the ITeS company had high fever but was not screened before entering the office. Since the employee works for about eight hours, wearing a facemask at all times was difficult, the employees added. A senior official with Elcot, responsible for administering Covid SOPs, said they are expecting a revised guideline following the assembly election. “Only 30% of the employees are visiting Elcot IT Park in Trichy. We will insist the IT and ITeS companies stay vigilant,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/over-20-test-ve-in-trichy-it-firm/articleshow/81921456.cms||Deepak Karthik

Once the police teams reach Punjab, senior officers will take a call on the route to be taken to bring Mukhtar back to UP. A police contingent comprising PAC jawans, an ambulance with a team of doctors, pharmacist and paramedics from Banda district hospital, a GPS-enabled VajraVahan and three police jeeps will bring Mukhtar to UP, possibly by Wednesday. Punjab’s prison minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said Ansari would not be given any special treatment and he would be handed over to the UP police like other criminals. He, however, did not say why the gangster was kept in Punjab jails for two years and the UP government had to move to the Supreme Court to get his custody even though he faces several cases there. According to reports, at least 50 policemen have been sent to Punjab though senior officials pegged the figure at 20-30. “Three different routes are being taken by police teams to reach Ropar jail. After all the teams reach there and take Mukhtar in their custody, ADG, Prayagraj zone, Prem Prakash will assess the situation and finalise the most suitable route,” a senior official said, adding that the teams were expected to reach Punjab on Tuesday. ADG, Prayagraj zone, Prem Prakash told TOI that all safety and security measures were being taken according to rules and directions issued by the Supreme Court. ADG, law and order, Prashant Kumar said, “Mukhtar Ansari hails from Ghazipur district and is a history-sheeter from Mehmoodabad police station with 52 cases in his name. Of these, 15 are pending in the court. Efforts will be made by the prosecution and the police to expedite all pending cases against him and ensure that conviction is achieved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cops-leave-for-punjab-to-take-ansari-custody/articleshow/81921457.cms||Arindam Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid+ve patient gets bed after civic chief steps in||MUMBAI: A five-hour search for a hospital bed for a septuagenarian Covid patient ended after municipal commissioner I S Chahal intervened and got her a bed in the BMC-run Seven Hills Hospital, Andheri, on Monday. Andheri resident Parveen Langrana, 76, was admitted to a Juhu hospital for bronchial infection when she tested positive for Covid-19. As the hospital was not permitted to treat Covid patients, its authorities discharged her immediately. While out on the road searching for a hospital bed, her niece posted a tweet that went viral and caught the BMC commissioner’s attention. “Been 5 hours im roaming with a patient in the car (75 yrs) and can’t find a hospital. Can someone help? Tried all BMC numbers @mybmc @AUThackeray @mybmcwardKW #covid #Mumbai,” read the tweet by Farah Pavri. She told TOI the family had been searching for a bed since Monday morning, but did not receive a response from the ward war room. “At no point did the Juhu hospital ask us to hold back the patient and tell us the BMC would take her,” she said. “Our jumbo facilities have several empty beds. I immediately asked my team to get the person’s contact details and, at 4 pm, called her up myself,” Chahal told TOI. “She should have waited for the BMC to contact her. We have a system in place and the ward war room contacts patients who are symptomatic with bed arrangement,” he added. BMC tweeted saying, “We request Mumbaikars to contact war rooms or 1916—we have enough beds and no one needs to go through this chase.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covidve-patient-gets-bed-after-civic-chief-steps-in/articleshow/81921478.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Lucknow||‘Pavva’ a deadly potion in Uttar Pradesh panchayat elections||LUCKNOW: In fiercely contested panchayat elections, ‘pavva’ (250 ml bottle of desi liquor) is used not only to allure the rural electorate, but also to eliminate rivals. Joint probe by the police and excise department shows that it has become a lethal weapon used by unscrupulous candidates to silence the voice raised against them. Talking to TOI, additional chief secretary, excise, Sanjay R Bhoosreddy said that ‘pavvas’ are now being used as a potent weapon to eliminate rivals. He said that candidates throw late night parties in villages in which friends and rivals both are invited. Though these parties are said to be organised to evolve a consensus candidate, most of the time the motive is not as simple. “If some agreement is reached at a consensus candidate then the party goes on smoothly. But if the desired results are not met then the party turns deadly. Poisonous substance is mixed in the country liquor and offered to rivals to finish them off,” he said, adding that this modus operandi was adopted in several hooch tragedy cases which were jointly investigated by police and the excise department. “The ploy was to remove rivals from the electoral arena and also escape the murder charge,” Bhoosreddy said and added that ‘a little probe in one such case revealed that genuine ‘pavvas’ were distributed at a party which was attended by around 50-100 people. However, the matter turned suspicious when only a few perished after consuming the liquor and nothing happened to others. A further probe revealed that only those had died who had refused to follow diktats of the host," Bhoosreddy said, adding that later the police came to know that poisonous substance was injected in bottles of genuine factory-made liquor and that bottles were offered to those who were not ready to toe the line. In Kataria village under Udaipur police station in Pratapgarh district on March 31, four persons died and three others took seriously ill after consuming ‘desi’ liquor at a party attended by scores of villagers. The party was attended by one Sunil Kumar Singh alias Dabbu Singh and Neeraj Singh, both vying for the pradhan’s post of the same village. Neeraj is still absconding, while Sunil has been arrested and sent to jail. Investigation by the excise department revealed that the party was organised to finalise a consensus candidate, but when both of them did not budge from their stands, poison was mixed in the ‘pavva’, which finally led to the death of four villagers. “This new way of eliminating rivals in the panchayat elections is disturbing, because they are using genuine factory-made liquor and are trying to paint it as hooch tragedies,” Bhoosreddy said. In Meerut’s Doonger village in Rohta police circle, two persons, identified as Sudhir and Jogendra, died after consuming liquor at a party thrown by one Sachin alias Udal, a candidate for the post of pradhan. It was found that hundreds had consumed the ‘desi’ liquor at the party, but there were only two deaths. It was said that the two had refused to follow the wishes of Sachin alias Udal who is now languishing in jail. Four days back, a similar incident was reported from Ayodhya district where two persons died after consuming liquor at a party thrown by Rajnath Verma, a candidate for the post of pradhan. Similarly, in Budaun, a villager died after consuming liquor at a party thrown by Bhagwan Das, a candidate for the pradhan’s post. The investigation in most cases confirms that those who perished in the liquor tragedies were opponents of the host of the party and given poison in liquor. The ACS, excise further said that with the panchayat elections coming close the possibility of illicit liquor being smuggled into the state has increased. Thus, an anti-illicit liquor campaign has been launched jointly by police and the excise departments in the state. In 2020, 50-lakh ‘petis’ (cases) were sold in the state in comparison to 35-lakh petis in 2019. The sale of ‘pauvvas’ is already skyrocketing in the state and is set to play a crucial role in the forthcoming panchayat elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pavva-a-deadly-potion-in-panchayat-elections/articleshow/81921466.cms||Subhash Mishra
---||Aurangabad||4 more ministers will resign soon: Somaiya||Aurangabad: BJP spokesperson Kirit Somaiya — claiming that alleged money collection racket of assistant inspector Sachin Waze involves nearly Rs 2,000 crore — on Monday said four other ministers of the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government will resign over the next few months. Citing the documents obtained under the RTI, the BJP functionary claimed that Waze’s file is missing from the home ministry and he could find his records only till June 2020. While raising questions over the clean chit given to Waze by outgoing home minister Anil Deshmukh, Somaiya levelled serious allegations against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state and demanded that NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and the CM should tender an apology to the people. After Bombay high court directed the CBI to probe the allegations levelled against Deshmukh, the home minister tendered his resignation on moral grounds to Thackeray on Monday. “Sanjay Rathod and Deshmukh have already resigned. They will be followed by at least four other ministers in the coming months,” Somaiya said, adding that state transport minister Anil Parab is already preparing to quit the ministry. “Waze gang’s total collection is well over Rs 2,000 crore. Through TRP and money laundering scams that exist only on paper, along with collection from bookies, transfer of policemen, this gang has collected over Rs 2,000 crore. We want to know who all are the beneficiaries,” he added. He said that with involvement of Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate, registrars of companies and NIA, the entire scam will soon come out. Somaiya was in Aurangabad as part of his scheduled visit to Covid facilities. Following his visit, the BJP leader alleged that the recent delay in fixing oxygen has caused death of at least four patients at Chikalthana-based districtcivil hospital. He also raised questions about non-lifting of biomedical waste from city-based hospitals for over three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/4-more-ministers-will-resign-soon-somaiya/articleshow/81919266.cms||Mohammed Akhef

With temperature swaying over 40 degree Celsius, passengers, especially senior citizens and women lamented the difficulty in walking with their luggage. “As mobile toilets are absent in Williams Road shelter, passengers are urinating near my shop. This menace is continuing every year,” a shopkeeper said. Drinking water facility was also missing in the temporary shelter. “A section of our officials were on election duty, the lapses shall be addressed,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/temporary-bus-shelters-irk-users/articleshow/81921460.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Trichy||Complaints mostly from rivals, not people||Trichy: While reports surface about major political parties attempting to bribe voters on the eve of polling day, election officials said that the majority of the alerts came from members of rival political parties. Although voters were aware of the cash distribution, they chose to remain mum.In Kunnam constituency in Perambalur district, Tamil Perarasu Katchi contesting in the election claimed that both AIADMK and DMK were distributing money for votes. V Gowthaman, director turned politician, contesting in the constituency for the party in his complaint to the district collector and election officer claimed that parties were also distributing liquor bottles clandestinely. “Voters were also wooed with Biriyani,” he added. In the Thanjavur constituency, voters who had received money claimed that they were given Rs 500 by a major political party. “Although I am not going to vote for the party that gave money, I did not feel like video recording the attempt. Since the cadres know my family very well, I did not want to jeopardise my safety,” a young voter from Thanjavur added. The locals said that the cadres of a major political party had casually distributed the cash with a portion of the electoral roll in their hand. Election department sources said that so far complaints on bribing voters have come only from the rival political parties, not from the locals. “We receive complaints from rival parties on each other’s attempt to circulate money to the voters,” an official in flying squad told TOI. Political parties claimed that the voters were in desperate need of money post the Covid-19 lockdown as their business and earnings were hit. As a result, the attempts to bribe voters have not been complained by the locals. “Money distribution was pretty much completed. A section of voters are only expecting the cadres to provide them money, not question why they were being bribed,” a functionary of a national party added. While posh localities were spared, the low-income group zones were focussed on by the cadres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/complaints-mostly-from-rivals-not-people/articleshow/81921459.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Delhi||Remove age restriction for taking Covid jab, Arvind Kejriwal writes to PM Narendra Modi||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking relaxed norms for opening of vaccination centres and removal of age restriction for taking the jab. Kejriwal asserted that all people in Delhi could be vaccinated against the coronavirus within three months if the requisite permission was granted. “The increase in the rate of transition of corona across the country has presented new concerns and challenges. The vaccination campaign needs to move more rapidly in this context. If rules for opening new centres are simplified and everyone is allowed to be vaccinated irrespective of age, then Delhi government can vaccinate all residents within three months. In the fight against corona, Delhi government has had the support of the Centre at every step (sic),” Kejriwal wrote, adding that Delhi was fully ready for the expansion. The CM expressed faith in the Prime Minister and hoped that he would look into his letter and respond in the affirmative. Kejriwal also hailed the development of the vaccine in record time in the country. “It is a matter of great pride that India has developed an effective vaccine in record time owing to the brilliant talent and hard work of its scientists, experts and doctors in the global war against the Covid-19 pandemic. It has earned great praise for Indian scientists, experts and doctors from all over the world,” Kejriwal stated. Expressing concern over the resurgence of Covid in the city, the CM said that the pre-conditions placed by the Centre regarding vaccination centres need to be relaxed. “For example, according to the instructions of the Central government, vaccination centres can only be set up in hospitals or dispensaries. Initially, this was done to ensure that if someone had an adverse reaction to the vaccine, they could be treated immediately in the hospital. The drive in the last three months has shown that the vaccine is safe. It is, therefore, requested that this condition be removed so that vaccination centres can be built in schools, community centres and other places on a large scale,” he said. Kejriwal added that to ensure these relaxations did not put the citizens in harm’s way, Delhi government would take all necessary precautions. “Arrangement for ambulances, etc, will be made at every centre,” he said. Stressing on the need to vaccinate everyone, Kejriwal said: “Except those who cannot get take the jab for medical reasons, we should start vaccinating everyone.” This, he said, would remove vaccine hesitancy and also help reduce the spread of the disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/remove-age-restriction-for-taking-covid-jab-kejriwal-writes-to-modi/articleshow/81920383.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Kolkata||Porn case: Five charged with gang rape, trafficking||KOLKATA: Five people, who were arrested in connection with a porn video case, have been slapped with trafficking and gang-rape charges. The move came hours after TOI reported on how an aspiring actor was duped with the promise of a key role for a project to be launched on a leading OTT platform and her video was later found on a porn website. The court slapped the charges on the accused, accepting the prayer of the police. Cops registered a separate complaint after the victim claimed to have received 18 threat calls from unknown numbers. Cops also ensured that the woman’s personal security is heightened. According to Bivas Chatterjee, a cyber expert and special prosecutor in the case, the woman is among four victims identified so far. “The woman claimed that she was sedated before the shoot and then tortured. She said that she had felt a numbing pain in her body after regaining her consciousness. Later, when the obscene video went viral, some youths from her neighbourhood came to her residence and threatened her. They demanded money or physical relations with her. They threatened that if their demands were not met, the video clippings would be shared across the neighbourhood. We have taken her complaint seriously and the Bidhannagar Police will investigate whether the youths had any link with the five accused or not,” said Chatterjee. The arrest of “producer” Subhanjan Roy led police to understand the modus operandi of the gang. Four others of the gang were also arrested. Cops said that many victims approached them ever since the accused are being rounded up for a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/porn-case-five-charged-with-gang-rape-trafficking/articleshow/81919272.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala assembly polls 2021: Integrated platform to store absent, shifted voters’ data||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Election commission (EC) will run a parallel system involving newly-developed mobile application and an integrated WhatsApp-based platform to digitally store photographs and details of absent-shifted-dead (ASD) voters in the assembly polls to be held on Tuesday. The dual system is being used as per the directions of the high court which recently directed that photographs of all ASD voters identified shall be taken in the polling booths. “We have followed the mandatory guidelines for demographically similar entries (DSE.) Besides, we also conduct verification of identity, thumb impression and get a declaration from such voters. In addition to this, we have developed a mobile app. Since we developed the app within a short timeframe, there will be a parallel WhatsApp mechanism involving presiding and returning officers. The system will be in place to ensure capturing details of ASD voters. This shall be stored and will be presented in case of any future litigation,” said an official associated with EC. Following a petition filed by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on bogus votes in the voters’ list, EC had submitted that, at times when a voter shifts his residence and goes to some other place, there are possibilities of registering twice and therefore, demographic multiple entries are made. However, instructions have been issued to the officers concerned to visit the residences of such voters and that efforts were taken to avoid multiple voting, EC told the court. The officials said that the verification process has been completed. EC was directed to finalize the verification of DSE/EPIC (Electoral photo identity card)/ASD and furnish the list to the political parties and presiding officers. While EC follows a normal procedure to eliminate double voting, the commission faces a tougher task this time with the court observing that there were discrepancies in the final voters’ list published by it. EC had stated in the court that it identified 38,586 DSE in assembly constituencies out of 3,16,671 entries. According to EC, physical verification was conducted by the booth-level officers and they will be marked in ASD and the list will be furnished to the presiding officers along with the voters’ list. Responding to reports of technical snag in the mobile app, the officials concerned said that they were not aware of any such snag and since they are running a parallel platform, the digital storage will not be affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/integrated-platform-to-store-absent-shifted-voters-data/articleshow/81919290.cms||---
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu elections: Think ‘lotus’ is ‘two-leaves’, BJP tells voters in Aravakurichi||TRICHY: Seeing an old woman washing clothes on the roadside during his campaign in Aravakurichi, BJP candidate K Annamalai stopped his vehicle. He explained to her that she doesn’t have to strain herself in this old age. If she votes for BJP, she will get a free washing machine, he said pointing to the AIADMK poll manifesto. Making his debut in electoral politics from his native Aravakurichi, the BJP state vice-president is quite popular among those in the fray. But he knows well that reaching out to the electorate in Aravakuirchi with mere BJP identity may not be enough to counter the well-established DMK. He doesn’t hesitate to project himself as an AIADMK candidate though. He was in fact asking people to vote for lotus symbol this time considering it to be two-leaves. DMK has fielded Monjanur P R Elango, a new face, but his father Ramasamy was a former MLA of Aravakurichi and was instrumental in bringing Cauvery water there. He was handpicked by DMK Karur district in-charge V Senthil Balaji who won the segment on both AIADMK and DMK tickets. The 3 cents of free land promised by Balaji to 25,000 families without houses was instrumental in his victory in the 2019 byelection. He could smartly put the blame on the ruling AIADMK for preventing him from implementing the scheme. He has been asking Aravakurichi to vote for the future ruling party DMK as only ruling party can implement the scheme. Tamil Nadu elections live updatesThe other prominent candidates are AMMK’s P S N Thangavel, MNM’s Mohammed Haneef Shahil K S and Naam Tamizhar Katchi’s Anitha Parveen M. But the fight is largely expected between BJP and DMK. In the last 10 assembly elections, both DMK and AIADMK have won five times each in Aravakurichi. It was one among the two constituencies in the last assembly election where election was deferred following rampant distribution of cash for votes. Aravakurichi is one of the backward constituencies in the state without any major industries giving employment. A majority of the people work as labourers who either go to Karur town to work in textile units or spinning mills in Dindigul besides going to Tiruppur and Erode. Annamalai has promised to set up public sector undertaking companies due to his affinity to the central leadership of the BJP. All said, lack of poll machinery for BJP in Aravakurichi may be a setback. But hundreds of BJP workers from the state and neighbouring Karnataka are camping there and educating electorate about Annamalai’s work in Karnataka. Over 29,000 electorate from Muslim-dominated Pallapatti which has been deciding the winner in the recent assembly election will be crucial this time as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/think-lotus-is-two-leaves-bjp-tells-voters-in-aravakurichi/articleshow/81921464.cms||Sampath Kumar

In fact, several groups of government doctors had come to the constituency in batches over the last few days to campaign.They alleged that gross mismanagement of Covid-19 outbreak and harassment of medical staff had forced them to plunge into campaign to ensure that the present government and its health minister did not return to the assembly. Dr V Ravichandran, a government doctor from Chennai who came all the way to Viralimalai to campaign for DMK candidate M Palaniappan, told TOI that Covid-19 outbreak was grossly mismanaged by the government. While there was no guarantee that DMK would not do the same, medical staff were put to hardship during the outbreak which even led to the death of doctors and nurses, he said. Ravichandran said the state government had announced Rs 50 lakh compensation for medical staff who die due to Covid but the government didn't keep its promise. There was no mention about the special pay for doctors and nurses for working during the outbreak. Further, doctors who staged protest seeking pay hike and other demands were asked by the health minister to call off their protest promising to fulfil the demands. But they were harassed by way of transfers, he said. “There has been gross irregularities in the procurement of Covid-19 related kits and equipment by the outgoing dispensation which should be questioned. It would not be good for the state if the same government returns to power,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/docs-campaign-in-viralimalai-against-health-minister/articleshow/81921469.cms||---

Out of 250 ventilators allotted to Surat city by the state government, 20 were being transported from Valsad in a dumper truck. “The dumper truck was sanitised properly to bring the ventilators.

Of the 250 new ventilators, 198 have already been brought to the city. “We had demanded 250 ventilators considering the rising number of Covid cases. Hence the government allotted it from the neighbouring centres where the ventilators are not in use,” said an SMC officer. The health department of SMC is getting ventilators from Valsad, Navsari, Dang and Tapi as well.

The four prominent blood banks in the city that TOI spoke to admitted that their stock of blood bags would last between 2 and 7 days. There are about 11 blood banks in Nashik city — most of them private facilities. “My centre has just around 16 blood bags that would last a couple of days. We are forced to decline blood to hospitals and nursing homes as a particular blood group is not available with us,” said Irfan Khan, the medical director of Samta blood centre. “At any given time, there should be around 2,500 units of blood available in the city. At present, I fear the total blood stock, in all the blood banks in the city, is not more than 600 units,” said Khan. According to him last year, even during lockdown, blood donations camps were organised in residential societies. “But this time around, we are unable to organise such camps as people are scared since the virus is more infectious,” he said. Additional civil surgeon of the Nashik civil hospital Kishore Shriwas said the hospital’s blood bank is also not getting donors. “However, right now, our blood bank has adequate stock and surgeries are being performed,” he added. Senior technician of the Sanjeevani Blood Bank Tushar Dusane said his blood bank has already run out of stock. “If we get a call from a hospital or a nursing home, we frantically look for donors. If we are unsuccessful, we inform the hospitals to check with other banks,” said Dusane. Chairman of the Arpan blood bank Nandkishore Tated said his blood bank’s stock would last another 8-10 days. “The response from donors in city areas is poor, although we are getting some response in the rural areas. People must donate blood to save lives and the blood banks take all safety measures,” he said. Sameer Chandrate, the state IMA secretary who hails from Nashik city, admitted that if donors do not come forward, the city could have shortage of blood that would put hospitals under stress. “Surgeries related to deliveries, victims who need to be operated on due to accidents, emergency heart bypass surgeries etc. cannot be deferred. I appeal to Nashik residents to donate blood. Even social organisations with approval from government agencies should organise small blood donation camps,” he said. When contacted the authorities of the food and drug administration (FDA), Nashik, said that they are yet to receive feedback from hospitals or blood banks on the impending shortage of blood. “But we will review the situation,” added the FDA officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/as-donors-stay-away-nashik-city-blood-banks-face-severe-shortage/articleshow/81918534.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Flight SG 7052 took off from Kolkata at 12.15am on Sunday. After flying for 33 minutes, it suddenly went incommunicado at 12.48am. Though the flight could be tracked on the radar, controllers were unable to speak to the pilots. They tried an emergency frequency and another one reserved for communication between pilots of different flights but there was no response. “We could see the plane on the monitor. But we could not pass any instruction to the pilots. The VHF system at our end was perfect because we were communicating with other planes. The pilots on the SpiceJet aircraft were either unable to hear us or not able to transmit the response,” said an official. It was at 1.40am that the ATC at Vizag informed the controllers in Kolkata that they had established contact with the plane. The DGCA probe will check how the radio link was lost and how it was re-established.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dgca-orders-probe-into-flight-radio-snag/articleshow/81919286.cms||---

A polling centre with more than five polling booths was allotted three wheelchairs while other polling centres will have two wheelchairs. “Ramps were ensured in polling booths with stairs while the respective local body mobilised volunteers to help PwD and senior citizen voters,” R Ravichandran, district differently-abled welfare officer said. The official added that Uber, a cab service provider, will provide free transportation for voters aged above 80 and PwDs to shuttle between home and polling booths.“Hand sanitiser should be provided for us as we had to use the common wheelchairs,” S Maarikannan, a PwD said. Election officials added that hand sanitisers will be made available at polling stations while sanitary workers will disinfect the polling stations. “We will sanitise wheelchairs once used,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/wheelchairs-at-all-polling-centres-in-trichy/articleshow/81921461.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Cabinet’s go ahead paves way for tenancy ordinance||Lucknow: The cabinet on Monday cleared the decision to bring in the Uttar Pradesh Regulation of Urban Premises Tenancy (second) Ordinance 2021. The provisions of the ordinance will lead to reduction in tenancy disputes and in older cases, rents can be revisited. Once the ordinance is promulgated, signing of contract will become compulsory to rent out a property. This will safeguard the interests of both the property owner and the tenant. The ordinance has made provision for a rent authority and rent tribunal to resolve disputes. These bodies will be tasked to resolve issues within 60 days. Currently, there is no clear mechanism for conflict resolution under the present law and matters have been pending in court for years. Keeping in mind the present and future demands of tenancy, the government had decided to replace the UP Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972. On January 9, 2021, the Governor had promulgated the Uttar Pradesh Regulation of Urban Premises Tenancy Ordinance 2021. This was implemented in the state on January 11, 2021, but since the assembly was adjourned indefinitely due to unavoidable circumstances, the Bill could not be passed and therefore an ordinance is being brought. The cabinet also cleared a proposal for setting up Uttar Pradesh State Institute of Forensic Sciences in place of the Uttar Pradesh Police and Forensic Science University. The decision, said an official, was made in pursuance of a Central Government advisory to states to set up institutes and affiliate them with a single university, the National Forensic Science University. “Instead of multiple universities giving different degrees, now all degrees will be issued by one university. The National Forensic Science University has two campuses, one in Delhi formed by merging the National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Sciences and National University, and the other in Gujarat,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cabinets-go-ahead-paves-way-for-tenancy-ordinance/articleshow/81921475.cms||---
---||Trichy||Farmers protest closing of central warehouses||Trichy: Condemning the Union government for closing down central warehouses in Punjab and Haryana to stop paddy procurement, a group of farmers headed by the president of All Farmers Association’s Coordination Committee, P R Pandian, staged a protest in Mannargudi in Tiruvarur district on Monday. Police blocked the protesters including around hundred farmers from taking out a march towards a central warehouse at Pamini near Mannargudi citing the model code of conduct. Protesting the police action, the farmers blocked a road.In the name of protecting farmers, the Union government has passed three farm laws, which are in favour of corporates, and enslaved the farmers to the foreign corporates, Pandian said. When the Rabi paddy procurement was in full swing in Punjab and Haryana, the Food Corporation of India had stopped procuring paddy grains from the farmers and closed all the procurement centres in the two states, he said adding that this has exposed the betrayal by the central government.“Though the Union government has been promising that the minimum support price for grains will continue, it is distancing itself from determining the minimum support price for grains by closing down the procurement centres. The farmers are in distress and they will be enslaved by the foreign corporates. The central government is trying to divert the struggle of the ryots who are fighting for the withdrawal of the farm laws,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-protest-closing-of-central-warehouses/articleshow/81921471.cms||---

The panel has environment experts Prajakta Baste, environmentalist Rajesh Pandit, Nishikant Pagare and representative from National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). It has suggested that the work of mechanical gate below Holkar bridge in the river Godavari be stopped. Moreover, they have also recommended closure of the bore-well in Ramkund after the desilting of the Godavari river. The report is soon to be discussed during the meeting of divisional commissioner-led committee on Godavari pollution. Pandit said that they had conducted survey about the smart city projects being planned in Godavari river. The survey report recommends that the mechanical gate below Holkar bridge should not be constructed as the riverbed is to be desilted. Moreover, smart city officials also could not give satisfactory replies about the various questions asked by the committee. “The committee in the reports has said that the retaining wall should not be built using cement. It should be gabion wall,” said Pandit. Prakash Thavil, CEO of Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) said they had taken these the opinion of environment experts and NEERI members while finalising the Detailed Project Report of the projects. “We had also taken the approval of the Centre before publishing the DPR of the smart city projects,” said Thavil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/panel-submits-report-on-smart-city-projects/articleshow/81919310.cms||Tushar Pawar

Her son Nirmal Singh (66) was also vaccinated along with her. After getting vaccinated, Kaur urged the residents to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest. She said she is feeling completely fine after getting vaccinated. Her son Nirmal Singh said his mother always wanted to get vaccinated. “I want to tell everyone that Covid-19 vaccination is completely safe and all people should get themselves vaccinated at the earliest,” he said. D S Chawla, president of UCPMA, meanwhile, said about 1,500 people have been vaccinated at this camp. He also said, “With the motivation of cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, we had started a special camp in UCPMA office on Gill Road on April 3 and hundreds of people visit our office to get themselves vaccinated daily. This special camp would continue till April 10 and anyone can get themselves vaccinated totally free of cost.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/99-year-old-gets-covid-19-jab-at-ucpma-camp-1500-vaccinations-done-till-date/articleshow/81921474.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||AAP targets Centre on export of vaccine||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chadha on Monday questioned the Centre’s decision to continue the export of Covid-19 vaccines and alleged that the needs of the country’s citizens were being ignored. At a press conference, Chadha said India had exported more doses than it had used to vaccinate its own citizens. He also asked why the vaccination was still restricted to certain age groups. India has so far exported 64.5 million doses of Covid vaccine to 84 countries. “India has exported the vaccine to Nigeria, Zambia, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, St Lucia, Bahrain, Morocco, Ghana, Angola, Senegal, Mali, Sudan, Uganda, Jamaica, Bolivia, Zimbabwe, Yemen, Tajikistan and many other countries. It appears that what these countries think of PM Narendra Modi is more important than what India’s own people think of him,” Chadha said. The rate at which our 135-crore population was being vaccinated, it would take 15 years to vaccinate everyone, he said, adding that some scientists had stated that if 70% of India’s population was vaccinated, Covid-19 could be brought under control. “It will be a matter of great pride should India become a vaccine superpower, but the priority ought to be our own people. Maharashtra has entered into a statewide lockdown; there are people dying in Punjab; Covid has once again reared its ugly head, and the one weapon we have this time is the vaccine, but the Centre is not focusing on inoculation, but on exporting this life-saving drug,” Chadha said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the remarks were a result of the narrow-mindedness of AAP. “The production of vaccine in the country is more than the domestic requirement. Modi government effectively fought coronavirus and checked its spread through a planned strategy. The government is working in a planned and effective manner to inoculate the citizens,” said Kapoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-targets-centre-on-export-of-vaccine/articleshow/81920403.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Wait of 2-3 days for Covid test results leaves patients anxious, raises risk||LUCKNOW: When 22-year-old Udham Singh felt influenza-like symptoms on April 1, he duly informed health authorities. A day later, a team collected his sample from home for the RT-PCR test. By April 3, he developed high fever with severe cough, acute body ache and breathlessness, but the report which showed he was Covid-19 positive came three days after sampling on Monday, April 5. “As my condition deteriorated, without waiting for the test report, I contacted a doctor and started medication on April 3 itself. I would have landed in an ICU had I waited for some more time. The element of uncertainty due to delay also caused extreme mental trauma,” said Singh. TimesViewQuick results not only help in speedy treatment, but also help in breaking the transmission chain. The three government aided labs did a wonderful job by conducting record number of tests during the first wave. Besides increasing capacities of the existing labs, the administration must also consider seeking help from government-aided scientific institutions to expand testing facilities.“The status report on the lab result portal states that my samples were received by the lab on April 3, which means samples were submitted to the lab a day after the collection,” he added. Like Singh, many in the city complained about a 48-72-hour delay in test reports of samples collected by the health department. This, officers said, is due to the pressure mounted by the surge in the second wave. While average 25,000 samples are being collected daily, the total testing capacity of the three government aided labs—KGMU, SGPGIMS and RMLIMS—is about 20,000, leading to a huge backlog. The delay also poses threat of spread of the virus by asymptomatic people as some of them move around despite home quarantine advice till the results arrive. Also, many stay put at home, but mingle within the family, posing a threat to members who might spread it outside. Ritika Chaudhary (30), who tested positive on March 31, said samples of her comorbid parents were taken after 48 hours and reports came after another 48 hours. “Thankfully, the results were negative, but the four-day wait was a nightmare. Though my parents did not move out of the house, they met other members of our family,” she said. The test results of the family members of Sanjay Shukla (50), who is in home quarantine after testing positive, came two days after sample collection on April 2. While all family members remained in home isolation, his brother continued to go to his shop. “We even had an argument when he refused to stay home saying if he will not go to work, from where will the money to run the family come,” he said. Chief development officer Manish Bansal said, “Over 20,000 samples are being collected daily now in comparison to 7-8,000 during the first wave, hence pressure on labs is high. We will provide extra manpower to increase the capacity of labs within a few days, besides ramping up rapid antigen tests.” (Names of patients names have been changed on request)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wait-of-2-3-days-for-covid-test-results-leaves-patients-anxious-raises-risk/articleshow/81921485.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Chandigarh||Hospitality industry bizmen take to social media to rap govt’s apathy towards their demands||Ludhiana: The members of hospitality industry are venting out their ire in various social media platforms after the state government failed to accept their demand to increase the capping on number of persons allowed to attend functions in hotels, marriage palaces as well as extend the closing timing of 9pm. Some businessmen even took to sarcasm to save their industry. One such post reads, “#save restaurant and hotel industry. We maintained all the required and assisted measures from sanitisation and safety as per your guidelines. Does this virus only spread during night, does this virus not spread via public transportation which is overloaded with 0% safety and social distancing. Does this virus not spread during political gathering. Till now, it has been seen that this virus spreads only through hotels and restaurants.” Amarveer Singh, president of Hotel Restaurant Association, Ludhiana, said, “All our cries for help from state government for saving hotels, restaurants and marriage palaces from losses have fallen on deaf ears. The government has still not revised the capping of 20 persons allowed for an event. Recently, marriage palace owners too expressed their displeasure over the government’s order to allow only 20 people per event despite the fact that the marriage palaces barely break even if they host function with at least 200 persons. All our requests have been ignored by the state government. Even after the ban, there has been no fall in the number of cases in the state.” According to Shiv Shankar Rai, general secretary of Punjab Tent Dealers and Welfare Association, “Hotels, restaurants, marriage palaces owners of Punjab are slowly heading towards bankruptcy due to apathy of the government. Whenever there is rise in Covid-19 cases, its our industry that bears the brunt. We have put in place highest standards of safety and hygiene required in the wake of the Covid-19. Yet, there have been huge cancellations in the past two weeks only due to the government’s unwillingness to increase capping. The early closing timing due to night curfew from 9pm has proven to be another setback for our industry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hospitality-industry-bizmen-take-to-social-media-to-rap-govts-apathy-towards-their-demands/articleshow/81921491.cms||Mohit Behl

The godowns will increase the storage capacity in the district from the current 30,200 metric tonne to 51,800 metric tonne. The godowns will be constructed at Pimpalgaon Baswant in Niphad, Nandgaon town in Nandgaon taluka, Angangaon village in Yeola, Rajurbahula in Nashik, Chandanpuri in Malegaon, said Bhujbal who is also the district guardian minister of Nashik. Administrative approval has been given for the construction of government godowns in the district. While Pimpalgaon Baswant, Nandgaon, Angangaon will each get one godown, Rajurbahula will have three godowns and Chandanpuri will have two. Bhujbal said that in order to store more foodgrain in Nashik district, the district collectorate had given a proposal for construction of godowns. The provision of funds for the godowns was underway. The storage capacity will increase by 21,600 metric tonne and this will hugely benefit the lifting of the grain from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns. Foodgrains distributed through the public distribution system (PDS) in the district are transported from the FCI to the local godowns. The grain from these godowns is further lifted by the fair price shopkeepers to be distributed to the beneficiaries through local shops. The district supply office was in need of the godowns for effective management of the distribution. The new capacity will also be useful in times of emergency, district supply officer Arvind Nariskar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-district-to-get-eight-new-grain-godowns/articleshow/81919317.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kanpur||UP’s effective lockdown reduced virus spread in critical time: Study||LUCKNOW: Strict implementation of lockdown measures last year helped in reducing the transmission of Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh, suggests a study on UP’s response to Covid-19 management released here on Monday. “Strict implementation of lockdown measures successfully reduced transmission of the virus affording the state critical time to establish clinical and public health functions,” concluded the study undertaken jointly by the state health department and department of international health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Titled ‘Preparation for and response to Covid-19 in a resource constrained setting—A case study from Uttar Pradesh’, the study noted that UP is well-prepared to guide, monitor, and control all operations needed for Covid-19 containment. “Given its historically fragile public health system and large population, concerns were raised early that Covid-19 might ravage Uttar Pradesh once lockdown measures were lifted. Many in the state were particularly vulnerable to the secondary effects of the lockdown, such as decreased economic earnings and limited access to essential health services,” the study said. Despite these challenges, Uttar Pradesh responded promptly with limited resources to address the Covid-19 epidemic, noted the researchers, which included additional chief secretary health and family welfare Amit Mohan Prasad. The findings of the study primarily evaluated the preparation and early response to the pandemic in the phase beginning on January 30, 2020, when the first confirmed case was identified in India, to May 31, when many lockdown measures were lifted in Uttar Pradesh. It also studied the management of the epidemic in the period thereafter: from June 1 when the restrictions were lifted to January 2021 when Covid-19 vaccination started in India. Lauding UP CM for showing exemplary political leadership in the time of crisis, the study said: “The overall response to Covid-19 has been led by the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. These efforts were centrally coordinated by a committee known as Team 11 comprising senior bureaucrats representing diverse departments and chaired by the chief minister—indicative of a whole-of-government-approach.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/ups-effective-lockdown-reduced-virus-spread-in-critical-time-study/articleshow/81926697.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The Covid-positive report can be given to the patient directly in case he is already admitted there. However, if the patient tests positive in a non-Covid hospital or in a Covid hospital that does not have vacant beds, the patient should not be given the report directly as it may cause panic.

---||Kochi||Waste management plans in place at polling stations||Kochi: The Covid-19 has mandated the need for disposal of biomedical waste from polling stations. Specific community health centres have been identified across the state as nodal points for delivery of biomedical waste from election booths. IMAGE officials said that once the biomedical waste reaches the specified health centres, their vehicles will collect it on their route and will be treated at the IMAGE facility in Palakkad. According to Suchitwa Mission officials, the entire operations are being coordinated through district health departments. Yellow covers with biohazard signs will be made available at each polling station. The biomedical waste will include masks worn by polling officers, police personnel, polling agents during the last hour of polling when the Covid patients come into the polling stations; and PPE kit worn by the polling staff should be removed after polling completion and should be disposed of in the yellow bags. Members of Haritha Karma Sena will transport these bags to the nearest identified health facility the same day. District medical officers have been asked to make temporary arrangements at the healthcare facility till the waste is collected by IMAGE. Both biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes will be transported to the nearest collection centres by the Haritha Karma Sena for disposal. Each Haritha Karma worker will be paid Rs 750 for the day. Officials said that they have been trained for segregation and handling of biomedical and solid waste management. “In polling stations and booths, we have tried to reduce the use of plastic and have encouraged polling officials too, emphasizing on it during training sessions,” an official said. Nodal officers of local bodies have been appointed for each constituency to ensure that booths are cleaned and ready for the polls. These nodal officers will also monitor the waste disposal and green protocol on the polling and counting day. While green protocol is slowly becoming a way of conducting elections, this year, the amount of plastic waste is minimal as plastic has been completely banned in all posters and advertisement material. If plastic has been used, even the printer will be fined and hence nobody has been printing flex or plastic posters, said Suchitwa Mission officials. “This election, green protocol is being implemented in various ways, including one model eco-friendly booth in each local body. Last time, we had a very few ones. But to promote the message of a green election, local bodies have evinced interest in decorating one booth in their area,” said Haritha Keralam officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/waste-management-plans-in-place-at-polling-stations/articleshow/81919337.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The youth wing of the party too staged protests at several places. Several rules related to Covid-19 were openly flouted by protestors. A large number of them were also spotted without masks. One of the protests was held under the leadership of Vijay Danav and Youth Akali Dal (YAD) district president Gurdeep Singh Gosha. Danav said, “Today’s protests were held against Congress and AAP for fooling people of Punjab and creating false narrative. Both the parties have cheated the people of Punjab and are working in connivance with each other to help achieve their political goals. Our leaders and workers gathered in many areas of the city and raised slogans against them so that people could be made aware of cheap politics by them.” Gosha said, “Congress has taken youngsters for a ride by making false promises of employment and even mobile phones. The Congress has betrayed youngsters, farmers and every section of the society. AAP is also making grand promises, but the party is not clear on SYL and several other issues. The purpose of both the parties is to make the people of Punjab fools and gain power. But SAD will not allow them to play with the sentiments of people.” Several members of the core committee of the YAD, including senior leader Gurpreet Singh Babbal, also staged a protest near Bharat Nagar Chowk. On this occasion, Manpreet Singh Bunty, Parladh Singh Dhal, Jung Bahadur Singh, Pritam Singh Sonu, Poonam Arora, Nek Singh Khalsa, Love Dravid, Sukhwinder Singh Bajwa, Kulwinder Singh Bajwa, Babita Mahajan, Jaspal Singh Bunty, Harman Singh Arneja, Deepu Ghai, Aman Bassi, Visha Kumar, Simran Singh Sherry, Avneet Kaur Khasa, Jaswinder Kaur, Jaseen Kaur, Seema Rani, Poonam Arora and Rani Dhaiwal were also present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-stages-protest-against-cong-aap-flouts-covid-19-rules/articleshow/81921499.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi Police’s Special Cell nabs criminal after gunfight||NEW DELHI: A notorious criminal with 24 cases, including murders and snatchings, against him was shot at during an encounter with Delhi Police’s Special Cell in central Delhi on Monday afternoon. The suspect, Raju (38), sustained gunshots in both his legs and is admitted to a hospital. He is stated to be out of danger. “Raju, who belongs to Bijnore in Uttar Pradesh, is involved in cases of murder, snatchings, attempt to murder, armed robbery, dacoity, arms smuggling, assault and criminal intimidation,” DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha said. Earlier, police had also invoked Gangster Act against him in Uttar Pradesh. The suspect was tracked down by a team based on a tip-off. An informer told the cops that Raju would pass through Geeta Colony flyover from Shantivan side on his scooter between 4 pm and 5 pm on April 5. “Inspector Shiv Kumar and his team laid a trap and the accused was flagged down after being spotted and identified by the informer,” Kushwaha said. The team members saw him taking the left turn for going towards ITO at 4.28pm. He was asked to surrender but he tried to accelerate and flee. In the melee, his scooter hit the railing and he fell off. Instead of surrendering, he allegedly whipped out his pistol and opened fire at the cops while trying to flee on foot. The policemen fired back during which he got shot and was overpowered. He was rushed to Lok Nayak Hospital for treatment. “Five semi-automatic pistols of .32 bore with four live cartridges and empty shells were recovered from the accused at the time of his apprehension,” Kushwaha added. In all, seven rounds were fired of which four were by the accused. A case under appropriate sections of law will be registered in Special Cell in this regard, said police. “Raju had gone absconding after jumping bail granted to him due to corona spread in Delhi as a general policy matter,” the DCP said. Raju was also convicted in a case of robbery in Paschim Vihar in Delhi. Investigation has revealed that he had procured the pistols from a notorious arms manufacturer-cum-supplier named Richhpal Singh of Burahanpur in Madhya Pradesh. He was to sell the pistols to criminals in Delhi and Meerut. Raju and his associate had planned to execute a contract killing of a person in Haridwar and had been offered a large amount of money for the job, cops have found. He was on his way to meet the associate when he was intercepted in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/special-cell-nabs-criminal-after-gunfight/articleshow/81921545.cms||---

The state government had recently sent Kasar on a 15-day earned leave following a non-confidence motion passed against him by the general body. The elected representatives were unhappy with Kasar’s style of functioning. Additional collector of Malegaon Dhananjay Nikam was given the additional charge as MMC commissioner. Bhujbal told TOI that he has requested the state government to make a fresh appointment for the post and appoint someone who can lead from the front — not just in dealing with the Covid situation but also in handling various development projects in the town. “I am hopeful that the state government will take a decision soon,” said Bhujbal. Deputy mayor and senior Shiv Sena corporator Nilesh Aher too said the appointment of new MMC commissioner would soon be announced by the state government. “The elected representatives, cutting across party lines, were irked with the manner in which Kasar was working as the civic chief. He was sitting over project proposals for a long time, which was having an impact on the city’s development. Malegaon civic body needs a new chief,” he added. Although Kasar has denied the allegations, he himself is not keen on continuing as Malegaon civic chief following his rift with the elected representatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-writes-to-govt-for-a-new-mmc-chief/articleshow/81919323.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

What baffles the doctors is that these patients tested negative for the virus in rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests. They were admitted for treatment of symptomatic problems, but later their other biochemical markers, x-ray and CT scan found changes, raising suspicion of the Covid infection. Confirming the new observation, AIIMS-P nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said the patients, who are medical students and nursing staff of the hospital, have been kept under observation of a team of doctors. All the necessary pathological and radiological tests were being conducted to ascertain the disease. “We suspect some Covid variant infecting them. Their samples are being sent to Bhubaneswar for strain confirmation,” said Dr Sanjeev. He said the hospital has informed the Union health ministry, state health department and the World Health Organization. All other patients being admitted there with similar symptoms are also being closely observed on different parameters. Dr Anil Kumar, head of the trauma and emergency at AIIMS-P, said the characteristic symptoms like fever, cough and throat problem were missing in all the six aged between 19 and 32. They only complained of loose motion, vomiting and nausea. “The chest x-ray didn’t show ground-glass appearance. The CT scan showed sign of inflammation in the lungs. Other biochemical markers, including Interleukin 6, C-Reactive Protein and ferritin levels are significantly raised and favour the diagnosis of Covid-19,” he said. The doctors associated with the treatment and observation of the new symptoms are Amarjit Kumar, Abhyuday Kumar, Poonam Kumari, Ajeet Kumar and Shagufta Naz, all of anaesthesiology department. In addition to the admitted patients, five such other cases under home isolation were being monitored by the AIIMS-P doctors under the community outreach programme of the hospital. Anil said while two are at Madhepura, one each is at Jehanabad, Bhagalpur and Siwan. “In all these 11 cases, we suspect some mutant form of the pandemic virus,” Dr Anil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aiims-p-docs-suspect-covid-variant-in-six-patients/articleshow/81919368.cms||---

According to police, the suspects also ransacked the pharmacy attached with the hospital and heckled the staff. All the suspects were the kin of a 67-year-old woman admitted to the hospital for treatment of Covid-19. The woman died on Saturday night following which the suspects went berserk. Assistant police inspector of Upnagar police station R K Pardeshi, who is investigating the case, said one of the hospital staff was injured in the entire incident. “The aggrieved family members blamed the hospital for her death and alleged that the treatment was not done properly. They manhandled some hospital staff and one of them sustained injuries. They also ransacked the drug store attached with the hospital,” the officer said. Later, the hospital management lodged an FIR with Upnagar police station against the suspects. “We have arrested the suspects who were involved in that incident.

---||Delhi||AAP alleges Rs 1,400cr property tax scam in north corporation||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi on Monday alleged a Rs 1,400-crore property tax scam involving the BJP-run North Delhi Municipal Corporation. In 2017, the corporation had collected the tax from 5.7 lakh properties while in 2020, only 4.2 lakh properties were taxed, she said. When the corporation has 12 lakh-plus properties assessed and ready, why isn’t it collecting tax from all of them, Atishi wondered. “The corporations’ primary source of revenue is property tax. In the last couple of years, the number of taxed properties have decreased. The question is where have the balance properties gone in three years?” the MLA asked. In 2017, she said, the north corporation had hired an agency to survey and quantify the number of properties that listed 12 lakh-plus properties required to pay property tax. “Then why has property tax been collected from roughly 1/3rd of that number?” the MLA asked. This is done when the corporations don’t even have funds to pay salaries, she added. Atishi claimed this was being done as BJP leaders wanted to make money. “When the tax dues rise, the corporations send notices to the owners demanding outstanding dues. In such a situation, the owner of the property... turns to local BJP leaders who make settlements with them and pocket the money,” she alleged. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Delhi High Court on Monday reprimanded Delhi government for not releasing funds to the corporations and Atishi’s allegations were an effort to cover up that damage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-alleges-rs-1400cr-property-tax-scam-in-north-corporation/articleshow/81920408.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: As transport services go faceless, 13 RTOs set to fade into oblivion?||NEW DELHI: Delhi's regional transport offices (RTOs), many of which are landmarks in their own right, might become relics of the past soon with most of the services provided by them going completely online, in what Delhi government’s transport department terms “faceless” transactions. The car capital of India has 13 very busy RTOs crowded by lakhs of applicants every year, but the new system will entail zero visits to the RTO for most of them. From the third week of February, the transport department has been providing 12 of its most transaction-heavy driving licences and registration certificate services completely online. By the end of March, nearly 80,000 online applications for these services were received and most cleared. The faceless service is part of a roadmap the department has prepared for the revamp of its transport-related operations. While a start has been made with 12 most sought after services, the department will gradually add most of its 70 services, excluding driving skill tests, to the system. According to sources, the department is going to carry out a ‘site and plot survey’ of the 13 RTOs and decide on their future. “Eventually, only the automated driving test tracks will remain operational and there wouldn’t be a need for an RTO building,” confided a transport official. “When all the services are accessible from the comfort of your home, why would anyone need to come to the RTO?” The transport department, however, is tight-lipped about the future use of these offices. The official added, “Instead of 13 RTOs, we will have smaller zonal offices for south, north, east, west and central zones. These are meant for those applicants who are unable to get their transactions completed online due to problems with their documents or technical glitches.” Ashish Kundra, principal secretary-cum-commissioner (transport), said that as the department follows the roadmap towards reforms, there might be some changes in the role of the RTO. No concrete plans have, however, been prepared yet. “Right now, we are going through this testing, stabilisation and rollout phase of faceless services, and I don’t think it’s fair to imagine that these offices will vanish. There will be some reorientation of roles as we proceed,” said Kundra. The idea is to have progressive people-centric reforms and like several other services that have been modernised and become more customer-friendly, the RTO will change in due course, said Kundra. “We have been able to do something disruptive in this area because we are carrying out process re-engineering side by side with technology and people re-engineering,” he said. “The entire team has been very responsive and receptive to change. Barring a few teething troubles, we are on track.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-transport-services-go-faceless-13-rtos-set-to-fade-into-oblivion/articleshow/81920426.cms||Sidharatha Roy

In the last Lok Sabha elections, only 37.3% votes were cast in Anamada booth. There are 54 men and 37 women voters consisting of tribespeople and plantation workers. The voters residing in Minnampara and Palakapandi estates have to travel 10km of damaged road to reach the polling booth, said Prasad V S, a leader of plantation workers in Nelliyampathy. There are only nine polling booths in Nelliyampathy grama panchayat, a major plantation and tourism centre of the state. Over 300 voters who had left for Tamil Nadu after lockdown had not yet returned to Nelliyampathy, Prasad said. Meanwhile, one more plantation worker had died on the way to hospital from Anamda estate on Friday as it took one-and-half hours to travel 10km because of the damaged road not being repaired since the floods two years ago. This is the third person that includes a tribesman who had died enroute to hospital for want of motorable road in the last one year. The Thekkady-Chemmanampathy Road from Pulayampara junction is the main road that goes to Parambikulam and Sethumada in Tamil Nadu. This is the only road to reach the estates of Minnampara, Karimala, Anamada, Oravampadi, Thirty acre and Thekkady. There are also hundreds of tribespeople living in these areas who have no way to send their children to schools or go to hospitals, Prasad added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/travel-on-broken-roads-to-vote-here/articleshow/81919417.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Back home, the youth, 25, a Muslim carpenter, had been booked under provisions of the state’s anti-conversion law apart from kidnapping and other sections of IPC. Police on Sunday claimed that the rescued girl, a minor, had told them that Afzal had “lured her” by saying that he was a Hindu and his name was Arman Kohli. Afzal, a resident of Sambhal, was sent to jail. He was arrested from Delhi’s Usmanpur area when he was going to a relative’s house with the girl on Sunday. The case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the girl’s father in Amroha. He alleged that the youth had “lured” his minor daughter, police said. Station house officer (SHO) of Amroha’s Hasanpur Kotwali, Sanjay Tomar, told TOI, “A complaint was registered regarding a man abducting a 16-year-old girl two days ago. An FIR was registered against the accused under IPC section 363 (punishment for kidnapping), 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc) and under state anti-conversion law 2020.” “During questioning, the minor girl told police that they were in contact for the last few months. She said that the man “lured” her by saying that his name was Arman Kohli, and he was a Hindu. She also said that Afzal tried to convert her.” According to the girl’s family, she had left home for some work two days ago but did not come back. Later locals told that she was seen with a youth after which the family filed a police complaint. Amroha’s circle officer Satish Chandra Pandey said, “The accused has been sent to jail while the girl is undergoing medical examination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-man-25-flees-to-delhi-with-girl-16-from-another-faith-booked-under-anti-conversion-law/articleshow/81917342.cms||Maria Khan

The officials will check the reason for crossing the border checkposts in the district on Tuesday,” said the collector. The high court directed the election commission to strictly implement the decision to deploy the central armed forces at the Idukki. The direction was after UDF candidates approached the high court seeking to prevent the bogus voting by those who have double votes in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Congress candidate E M Augusty (Udumbanchola), D Kumar (Devikulam) and Cyriac Thomas (Peermade) had filed the petition. The court ordered deployment of central armed forces and verification to prevent double voting.

The students alleged that in the name of coronavirus, the government was ruining their career by closing the educational institutions. Many private, police and government vehicles, boundary wall of the collectorate, parking shed, office of executive engineer (EO) of Sasaram Municipal Corporation and traffic posts in the town were damaged by a mob of students. The policemen deployed on the collectorate campus foiled their attempt to set ablaze the offices.Around a dozen officers, including EO, additional sub-divisional magistrate (ASDM), Sasaram, and the SHO of Town police station were also injured in the brickbatting. The situation was brought under control after two hours only when additional police force from neighbouring police stations reached there. Later, around a dozen of students were taken into custody.Eyewitnesses said police also fired in the air, but Rohtas SP Ashish Bharti told this newspaper that he was not aware of that. Rohtas district magistrate (DM) Dharmendra Kumar blamed the coaching institute owners for the violence. “They instigated the students when the administration tried to close the coaching institutes on Monday,” he said.The DM said police had to use force to disperse the mob. “The coaching institute owners along with the students made forcible entry into the collectorate campus and indulged in vandalism,” he said and added: “Action will be taken against them. Culprits are being identified through video footage.”Sources said the situation turned violent when EO Abhishek Anand, after receiving complaints that coaching institutes were open as usual, reached Gaurakshani locality and scolded the students of one coaching centre for attending the classes despite the government order to keep all the educational institutions closed till April 11. His attempt to close down the coaching institute irked the students, who attacked the EO and police constables. Later, the students of other coaching institutes assembled there and marched towards the head post office. Meanwhile, the DM has requested the students to follow the government guidelines for preventing further spread of Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cops-others-injured-as-sasaram-students-protest-closure-of-coaching-institutes/articleshow/81919450.cms||Alok Chamaria

The authorities have also asked its consultants to suggest as to which flyovers and bridges need the sensors fixed to constantly monitor deviations in their traffic load bearing capacity. KMDA officials said that the repair work of the 60-year-old Kalighat Setu will include repairing the cracks, retrofitting and overall strengthening. The pillars of the bridge which are on the Tolly’s Nullah have been badly corroded due to the acidic water and need proper treatment to ward off the layers of corrosion. “Grouting work is to start as the damaged portions of the bridge will be repaired through retrofitting. Work will be conducted slowly with all precautionary measures as the bridge is not in good condition,” an official said. Officials said as of now Kalighat Setu will undergo short term repairs. The bridge’s upper structure will get a thorough overhaul and eventually in the long run the bridge may be reconstructed. KMDA officials said that they had plans to install smart sensors in some of the flyovers and bridges in the city to keep track of 24 hours real-time data on their static and dynamic vehicular load taking pressure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmda-starts-60-yr-old-kalighat-bridge-repairs/articleshow/81919446.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Their grouse is that e-commerce, being tagged under the essential category, will be free to deliver even non-essential goods. Viren Shah, president of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said that they have asked their members to put up a banner outside shops opposing the government move. “We are also against the government decision to allow online players to deliver non-essential products without any restrictions which will be at the cost of lakhs of wholesale and retail traders. Huge quantities of stock will be lying unsold, but online players will have readymade business for non-essential products. We have asked our local traders to start online delivery by taking orders through WhatsApp if required,” he said Kishore Kulkarni, secretary of Chembur Merchants Association who runs a gift shop, said reopening in June post lockdown was not easy. “Cleaning up the dust settled on all the items took so much time and many other traders, especially those in the cloth business, also faced damage to stock. Ever since the surge in Covid-19 cases from February onwards, business was anyways in the downswing,” he said. Echoing him, association joint secretary, Paras Bamboli, said business usually hits a peak in April-May and just when they were hoping for a recovery, they have once again been hit hard. In Matunga, corporator Nehal Shah has written to municipal commissioner I S Chahal, seeking some arrangement to support the economy. “Non-essential shops could either be allowed to operate with minimum staff or on alternate days. Asking them to shut business completely is not the way when they have already suffered major losses all of last year,” she said. Rajesh Nisar who runs a readymade garments shop in Matunga said while their shops have been asked to stay shut, they will have to continue paying rent, electricity bills, property tax bills and also staff salaries.  “There is no subsidy being given to us. This is definitely going to cause a dent financially and also hit our staff,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-shutdown-order-unfair-say-traders-of-non-essential-goods/articleshow/81921559.cms||Richa Pinto

Moreover, to facilitate beds to patients and avoid inconvenience, the NMC has decided to decentralize the CBRS system. This system will come up at each of the six divisions of NMC. The division-wise bed allotments will be done through the divisional bed reservation system. “We have decided to decentralize the CBRS and introduce an online bed allotment system at all six divisional offices. The CBRS in the NMC headquarters will control the bed reservation system operational at each of the six divisional offices,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Khade, who is in charge of the CBRS NMC had started the CBRS for allocation of Covid beds in private and civic hospitals during the Covid outbreak last year. But after the drop in cases, the administration had closed the CBRS system. With the cases rising, the Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav has made the CBRS functional again. “We have received very good responses to the centralized bed reservation system. So far, CBRS has received 4,000 calls for beds,” said Avesh Palod, the Covid officer of NMC. Charudatta Jagtap, the divisional medical officer of NMC said municipal school teachers have been deployed for the divisional online bed reservation system at each of the six divisions. Teachers will work in three shifts and there will be four teachers working in each of three shifts for each of six divisional offices. “Teachers have been given trained for the CBRS. The online bed reservation system at the divisional level will be operational within the next three-four days,” said Jagtap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-gets-4000-bed-reservation-calls-in-2-weeks/articleshow/81918580.cms||Tushar Pawar

A huge cache of finished and unfinished weapons, along with machinery used in manufacturing, was recovered. According to police, the exact time since the illegal arms factory has been operating is yet to be ascertained. During the primary investigation, it surfaced that the weapons being made at the factory were being prepared for the upcoming Panchayat polls. Senior superintendent of Firozabad police Ajay Kumar said, “Following a tip-off, a police team was directed to conduct a raid on illegal firearm factory. Over a dozen finished and unfinished weapons, large stock of instruments and raw material used in manufacturing of arms and ammunition were recovered. Two people operating the unit have been arrested. They had received orders for the supply of illegal weapons ahead of the panchayat election.” The arrested men have been identified as Sugreev (25) and Netrapal, residents of Firozabad district. The duo already has two cases under the Arms Act registered against them. Police are searching for three other people associated with them. Explaining the modus operandi of the gang, SSP said it would cost around Rs 500 to manufacture each gun. “It is a professional gang. The arrested men had been behind the bars twice in the past under the Arms Act. They would manufacture at least four guns every day. They have been supplying weapons to their contacts for around Rs 4,000. We are trying to identify their contacts and customers. Busting the illegal firearm manufacturing factory ahead of the Panchayat elections is a major accomplishment of the police team.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/illegal-firearms-manufacturing-factory-busted-in-firozabad-two-arrested/articleshow/81918584.cms||Deepak Lavania

Speaking at a press conference, Gahlot said the AAP government is collaborating with IIIT Delhi to build a centre for excellence, for which Rs 6.1 crore has being assigned from Delhi Knowledge Development Foundation. The centre will be stationed on the premises of IIIT Delhi and a space of 2,000 square feet has been demarcated for it. “Delhi government has in the past few years been revolutionising and setting new targets in the way mobility and transport services are operating in the country. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has always dreamt of building a world-class public infrastructure,” Gahlot said. He said that the centre will integrate and analyse data and technology to expand public infrastructure. He said an example of this is contactless ticketing, which has been introduced in all buses for the first time in India in collaboration with IIIT Delhi. “Today, 70,000 tickets are being provided daily as a part of contactless service, which is beyond 6% of the total tickets,” he said. “The open transit data system will be able to provide real-time location of cluster and DTC buses. The centre will serve as a gateway to aid start-ups with a number of themes, like to spin-off technology related to smart mobility, passenger information systems, multimodal journey planners, automation tools, ticketing framework, etc,” he said. “More than seven start-ups are already conducting their research along these lines,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-ties-up-with-iiit-to-find-solutions-for-urban-transport-issues/articleshow/81920450.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||45+ Age Group Drives Vax Surge||New Delhi: The turnout for Covid vaccination continues to remain high with 76,642 people turning up till 6pm on Tuesday, a little less than 81,545 during the same period on Monday. The 24-hour vaccination started on Tuesday at 34 hospitals. The vaccination turnout was largely driven by people of the 45-59 age group and those receiving the first dose. A total of 44,076 people of the 45-59 age group and 21,353 people above 60 got the first dose on Tuesday. For the second dose, 10,099 people turned up at the centres. Only 491 frontline and 623 health workers got the shot as most of them in the capital have already been inoculated. The turnout for the vaccination after 9pm wasn’t much on Day 1, but the government has exempted people going for vaccination from the movement restrictions declared on Tuesday, provided they have an e-pass. The municipal hospitals in Delhi also continue to witness high turnout for Covid-19 vaccination. In some hospitals, the number of beneficiaries is even crossing 400 per day. At Purnima Sethi Multi-Specialty Hospital in Kalkaji, 477 people on Monday and 448 on Tuesday visited the vaccination centre. “We have arranged for wheelchairs and deployed dedicated staff to help people register themselves. We have a decent number of people coming from Noida and other NCR areas,” said an official. At Swami Dayanand Hospital in east Delhi, the number of visitors reached 431 and 496 on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. The total turnout at 20 centres under East Delhi Municipal Corporation crossed the 3,000-mark on Monday as well as Tuesday. “We are getting a great response and despite shortage of staff/space, best efforts are being made to serve people. Even small maternity centres are getting more than 100 people a day,” said EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain. At Hindu Rao Hospital in north Delhi, the number of people turning up to get the jab is hovering around 350. It, however, crossed the 5,000-mark on Monday, when the figures from 44 dispensaries, polyclinics and maternity and child welfare centres in north Delhi were combined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/45-age-group-drives-vax-surge/articleshow/81939164.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Nashik||NMC ties up with pvt lab for RT-PCR||Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has tied up with a local private lab of RT-PCR testing. Instead of labs in Pune and Mumbai, the collected swab samples are now being sent to this laboratory. The civic body decided to test the swabs locally as the Mumbai and Pune labs were taking three-four days to send the reports. The NMC claimed it is now getting the reports within 48 hours. BJP corporator Varsha Bhalerao and other public representatives had recently complained that the reports of the swabs sent by NMC to the labs in Mumbai and Pune are getting delayed. Bhalerao had said that delayed reports of suspected Covid cases were causing the infection to spread. Avesh Palod, the Covid officer of Nashik city, admitted that the reports were delayed by three to four days as there has been pressure on the labs in Mumbai and Pune. “But we have now tied up with a Nashik-based private lab for the RT-PCR tests. We have finalised the rate at Rs 475 per test with the private lab concerned. This is lower than the rate fixed by the state government,” said Palod. “We are now getting the RT-PCR test reports from the private lab within 48 hours,” he added. Palod said people are not following the protocol. If they have a cough or fever, they should get antigen tests. If they are negative, then they should also do RT-PCR tests. “But most of the people are first doing the CT scans and then they are doing the RT-PCR. The RT-PCR tests should be done earlier,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-ties-up-with-pvt-lab-for-rt-pcr/articleshow/81918583.cms||Tushar Pawar

Kadu, who is on a 3-day Akola visit, conducted a surprise inspection of the GMCH mess after some videos of poor quality food had gone viral on social media. He interacted with cooks, workers and the contractor of the mess. Finding the quality of pulses poor, he asked how much quantity of pulses is cooked daily for the entire hospital, where more than 1,500 patients are under treatment. Contractor Sahebrao Kulmethe told him that they needed 10kg pulses daily. Kadu asked the same question to kitchen in-charge staffer Sunil Morey, who said they cook not more than 6kg pulses daily. After inspection, Kadu brought both the contractor and employees together and again asked the same question. This time, Morey changed his words and said they cook 10 kg pulses everyday, which made Kadu angry. After repeatedly asking him to tell the truth, Kadu slapped Morey. Kadu, who is the minister of state for water resources and school education, told TOI there is a “scam” in GMCH Akola’s mess. “A month’s supply of grains was demanded as per the register here, but only 8 days’ worth food grains were supplied. For the last 8 months, there has been no record of food grains arriving at the district hospital for Covid patients,” said Kadu, adding that he had ordered an inquiry into the issue. “Instead of the slapping incident, one must concentrate on the gross corruption that was noticed during inspection,” the minster said. Kadu has tasked Akola sub-divisional officer Nilesh Apar with the inquiry of the case. Sources said that suspension action was proposed in the case. The person who got slapped from Kadu is a contractual employee. Political reactions started immediately after the video of Kadu slapping the mess staffer went viral. “Does the rule of law exist in the state? How can a minister beat an employee over a meal issue?” tweeted BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar. “File a case against Bachchu Kadu for assaulting a government employee,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/minister-kadu-slaps-mess-staffer-at-akola-gmch/articleshow/81936061.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

DespiteCovid protocols and skyrocketing travel expenses amid job uncertainties, they know that this  will have a major bearing on their lives as these are the first polls after the pandemic began last year. They will elect only those candidates whom they believe will take care of their needs in times of adversity and provide better living and economic conditions. During the pandemic, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana passed laws to reserve jobs for residents and Jharkhand, Rajasthan, MP, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka are following suit. DMK’s election manifesto promises 75% job-reservation for Tamils if they are voted to power. However, implementing job-quotas or announcing freebies will not resolve the issues related to interstate migration of labour in the long-run. Similarly, the dependence on home-states for rights and welfare is not viable as migrant workers are absent from their states most time of the year to avail the same. Nothing will stop people from migrating to greener pastures as societies tend to face poverty, unemployment, underemployment or employment in informal sectors. Despite being a significant voting bloc in home states, inter-state migrants need a spotlight in their destination states as politically-significant members of the society. One way is to exercise their voting rights in destination societies. Reforms in electoral system to ease the procedures of enlisting in voters’ list and awareness creation among migrants about the benefits of socio-political integration to host societies can be a step forward in this direction. Being the new hub for inter-state migration, Kerala is at the forefront in providing better conditions to its ‘guest workers’. But, they are excluded from conversations around assembly elections, though one cannot deny that these migrant workers contribute significantly to the state’s economic productivity and growth. A content analysis of the manifestos of the three major fronts illustrates the lesser visibility of this vulnerable community in the progressive, political sphere of Kerala. Since election manifestos are the blueprints for comprehensive development, featuring in it demonstrates economic and political significance of migrants in the socio-economic and political spectrums of Kerala. Though one may argue that several promises of employment in the manifestos are indirectly applicable to migrants, direct references are fewer. UDF manifesto has a one-liner under welfare scheme section stating that, “Ration and health cards will be implemented for interstate workers (Section 4),” while NDA manifesto’s one-liner is about “Making the interstate workers registration mandatory” under its employment section (Point Number 17). LDF manifesto has covered it under the section on social security (892nd promise), stating that “Welfare of guest workers will be strengthened. Ration cards, health cards, and insurance will be provided to them. Public facilities will be created in their accommodation centres with the help of local bodies.” This meagre representation is against the prominent featuring of NRKs in these manifestos (Section 10 of LDF, Section 28 of UDF and Section 18 of NDA) as separate and elaborate sections dealing with diaspora welfare and reintegration. This has to be read together with the fact that NRKs have voting rights, though those who register as voters are far less than the Keralites working abroad. Other than the peculiar hardships migrants face during emergencies, they have to deal with several challenges. Interim measures are not adequate to address their hardships, especially in the absence of a reliable database on them in Kerala. No party identified data collection, related to migration, as their political priority even after the first wave of the pandemic. This further underlines the need for migrants to politically integrate into Kerala society and enhance their visibility and bargaining power.

Many are complaining of low visibility due to smoke while some are complaining of irritation in the eyes and difficulty in breathing. “My mother is 80 years old and she recently got the Covid-19 vaccine. However, the fire and the smoke around us is becoming so toxic that she is now complaining of irritation in the eyes. The air here has become more polluted than Delhi in winters,” said Pulak Shukla, a resident of Bhimtal. He added that both the locals and the police are aware of the persons who set fires in forests but no action is being taken. Notably, in the last six months, Uttarakhand has reported over 1,200 forest fire incidents mainly in the hills. The doctors say that the situation is also affecting the ‘psychological well-being’ of the people as they are fighting a battle against Covid-19 and the deadly smoke simultaneously. Dr Manoj Sharma, chief medical officer (CMO) of Pauri, one of the worst-affected districts, said, “It is true that besides the usual side effects of pollution, the smoke cover is also leading to psychological issues.” Visibility has also dropped significantly due to the air pollution. “Our morning walk looks like evening walk as the visibility has reduced from 10,000 metres to just 200 metres here in the hills,” says 71-year-old Rajmata Devi, a resident of Pithoragarh. Confirming that the smoke is causing myriad health-related issues, Dr HC Pant, chief medical officer (CMO) of Pithoragarh, said, “There is an increase in the number of patients suffering from irritation in eyes, respiratory issues and uneasiness. The number of patients suffering from dermatology issues has also increased.” The residents of Pauri — where the wildfires have claimed more than 500 hectares of forest cover — are complaining of uneasiness as the sky remains covered with a dense cloud of smoke round the clock. “Children and elderly people in the house are persistently coughing due to the high concentration of poisonous gases in the atmosphere,” said Sangeeta Devi, a local resident in Pauri. The forest fires have also become a cause of concern for the villagers of Uttarakashi district, where losses to the tune of Rs 5.16 lakh have been recorded due to the blazes. Almost 60 hectares of forest cover has been gutted in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/forest-fires-worsen-air-pollution-elderly-finding-it-difficult-to-breathe-in-smoke-filled-hills/articleshow/81918594.cms||---

With this, it will also be able to optimise diversion of available manpower and resources for the treatment of affected patients. An order issued by the institute’s medical superintendent on Tuesday stated OPDs/speciality clinics will continue to provide requisite services only for such patients (new and follow-up) having prior appointments. The order has been sent to all the chiefs of centres and heads of all the clinical departments. It added that the respective departments may fix the limit of daily new and follow-up patients in the outpatient department (OPD) for the next four weeks, depending on the available strength of residents after contributing to Covid-19 pool. Departments in AIIMS main hospital have also been requested to inform the same to faculty-in-charge and OPD services through e-mail, so that computer facility could be intimated for modifications, the communique added. At a meeting chaired by AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, sources said, it was also decided that Rapid Antigen Test would be used to screen all the patients coming to the emergency. Lok Nayak Hospital, the largest hospital run by Delhi government, has also decided to stop new registrations for OPD consultation, a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aiims-to-halt-walk-in-opd-from-tomorrow/articleshow/81939167.cms||---

All three secured 484 out of 500 marks (96.80%). The Bihar School Examination Board chairman said as many as 101 students found a place in the top positions in the merit list, 45 of whom are from the prestigious Simultata Awasiya Vidyalaya alone. A total of 16.54 lakh students, including 8.24 lakh girl students, had taken the examinations, out of whom 12.93 lakh students passed. The total number of boys who cleared the exam is 6.76 lakh, and the number of girls passing the exam is 6.16 lakh. The pass percentage of 78.17% is lower when compared to 80.59% in 2020 and 80.73% in 2019. "Taking into consideration the Covid-19 pandemic the pass percentage is satisfactory," a source said. The number of students securing the first division is 4.13 lakh, and the number of students passing in the second division is 5.00 lakh. The overall pass percentage of boys is better than that of girls this year. For the third consecutive year, the board has achieved the distinction of announcing Class X and XII results ahead of all other boards in the country, the BSEB chairman said. It has created a record of sorts by publishing the Class X results in only 25 days after the evaluation of more than 1.01 crore answer books and an equal number of OMR sheets commenced on March 12. The examinations were held in February under full Covid-19 protocol. The analysis of this year's results indicates there was a keen competition among students to grab the top positions. While three students jointly secured the top slot, seven students secured the second position with 483 marks. As many as six students stood at the fourth position by securing 481 marks. Once again, boys and girls from schools located in rural areas and mofussil towns performed better than their urban counterparts. Not a single student from the Patna-based schools, including the premier institutions, could find a place among the top 101 students on the merit list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/in-a-first-matric-result-sees-3-joint-toppers-in-state/articleshow/81919505.cms||B K Mishra

At Achhad village in Talasari on the Maharashtra-Gujarat border, the traffic police have started checking luxury buses and heavy vehicles. Since Monday, buses carrying excess passengers have been turned away at the border. A police officer said that passengers coming in buses from Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat are being tested for the virus at the border. With restrictions imposed from Monday night, several luxury buses overcrowded with passengers have been entering the state. Drivers of heavy vehicles and buses not carrying valid documents are not being allowed to enter the state, said an official.

---||Nashik||Adequate deployment of staff at railway stations||Nashik: Divisional railway manager (Bhusawal division) of Central Railways Vivek Gupta has stated that adequate measures were being taken to ensure that only those with confirmed travel tickets travel by trains. All others would be prohibited from entering the stations. In the backdrop of the rising footfall at the railway stations over the past week, Gupta said, “Though there is increasing footfall, it is only of those who have confirmed tickets. Others are not allowed to enter the station.” The migrant labourers coming from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal to places like Nashik, Manmad, Jalgaon and Bhusawal to work in hotels, restaurants, construction sites have slowly started going back to their homes. The labourers have started moving back home due to the fears that current stricter measures were prelude to lockdown since the cases were on the rise. “We are not sure if we will continue to get job in the forthcoming days. We therefore are going home as we will at least not have to pay for home rent and food,” said Munna Yadav from Lucknow. He is among many who are travelling back to their homes by trains even without tickets. Some of these walk along the tracks to the station instead of entering from the gates and board the trains. The Railway Protection Force and the ticket checking staff have been deployed across all the stations to restrict the forceful entry of the people inside the stations from any means. Asked if some special trains would be released from various stations across the division to help the people travel back, the officer clarified that so far there was no such plan or even orders for the same. “There is no request from the state government at this time. When we will get them we will seek the permissions from our headquarters and then decide accordingly,” said the DRM. While running the ‘Shramik’ trains, the state government has requested the Railways to deploy trains so that the movement of the labourers could be managed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/adequate-deployment-of-staff-at-railway-stations/articleshow/81918597.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As many as 15 of these beds will be reserved for the pregnant women suffering from Covid,” Dr Nikhil Saindane, the incident commander, civil hospital said. It had come to light that the civil hospital had 210 ventilators deployed at various places but a significant number of these were lying idle. The health authorities for the last two days have been busy in distributing and installing the remaining ventilators. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal had expressed his annoyance at the lack of use of the ventilators. The civil hospital now has 80 ventilators up from earlier 54. “This apart, we will be giving 15 ventilators to a private medical college in Igatpuri, about 10 ventilators to another private medical college at Adgaon and 20 ventilators to Nashik Municipal Corporation,” Dr Saindane said. He added that though these ventilators were functioning and kept ready for use in hospitals in rural areas, it was decided to use them in the DCHs. “There are some ventilators that have been kept in trauma centres, the dedicated covid health centres as well as a some for the non-covid section. In all, we have 197 ventilators operational now. A few are being repaired,” said Dr Saindane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/197-ventilators-put-to-use-in-different-covid-facilities/articleshow/81918601.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||We can’t be mere spectators, says Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The HC on Monday said the allegations by Param Bir Singh “disclose commission of cognizable offences by Deshmukh” and prima facie should be been acted on, under the law. They are of “a serious nature…. prima facie, the issues are such that the very faith of citizens in the functioning of police department is at stake”. “Deshmukh is the home minister. The police department is under his control and direction. There can be no fair, impartial, unbiased and untainted probe, if the same were entrusted to the state police force. As of necessity, the probe has to be entrusted to an independent agency like the CBI,” the HC said in its order disposing of Singh’s public interest litigation and three other petitions. “Although we do not see an immediate reason to direct registration of an FIR by the CBI based on (advocate Jaishri) Patil’s complaint, interests of justice will be served if there is a CBI preliminary inquiry into the complaint of Jaishri Patil,” the court said. Patil had made a complaint on March 21 to the Malabar Hill police station citing Singh’s letter. “The officers appointed for inquiry shall receive cooperation from all parties. Once preliminary inquiry is conducted preferably within 15 days…CBI will be at liberty to decide on future course,” said the HC. “Should CBI see no reason to proceed further”, Patil must be informed, it directed. The order was passed after a lengthy hearing on the first day and no notice was issued to Deshmukh, one of the respondents. The HC said since no respondents were invited to file reply, allegations against them shall not be deemed to have been admitted by them. The HC had heard advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni’s objection to maintainability of the PIL filed by Singh in absence of an FIR. Patil had filed a petition, also seeking a CBI or independent probe. The HC noted her March 21 complaint to police had not resulted in an FIR being registered yet and was “not given the attention it deserved”. Her petition presented an “extraordinary” case, said HC, noting the AG never said her complaint does not disclose an cognizable offence but “has been fair to say…it was not processed”. Patil had cited SC’s 2013 landmark ruling that makes registration of FIR mandatory if serious offence is disclosed and for preliminary inquiry to be conducted to see if such serious offence is disclosed. ‘Simply writing letters to the CM won’t do,” the HC had said during the hearing last Tuesday, pointing out that law was set in motion with a FIR.Singh’s counsel, including Vikram Nankani along with Biren Saraf, Chetan Kapadia and Sharan Jagtiani, had contended HC is empowered to direct a CBI probe when the situation demands, and if petitioner shows “failure of public duty.” The HC agreed it was not powerless to direct a CBI inquiry in exceptional cases. It said “since law courts exist for the society, technicalities ought not to stand in the way.” “We quite agree with Nankani and Jha an unprecedented case has come before court.” “It is an issue of credibility of state machinery…,” said HC, adding, “This court cannot be a mere spectator in these circumstances.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/we-cant-be-mere-spectators-says-bombay-hc/articleshow/81920467.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Delhi||N corpn nod to setting up kiosks in large parks||New Delhi: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has approved the scheme for handing over maintenance of larger parks to private entities in lieu of allowing opening of one kiosk on a commercial basis. The matter had earlier been forwarded by LG Anil Baijal to Delhi Development Authority for clarification of norms under MPD-2021 and only those parks, which have more than 5,000 people residing in the vicinity, will qualify for the scheme. In the first phase, 38 parks are expected to be covered. Only those parks, which are spread over an area of more than 2,000sqm or 0.5 acre, will be considered for such kiosks, said north corporation officials. The cash-strapped civic body has been trying to reduce its expenses on the maintenance of parks. The idea of milk booth/kiosk operators taking over the maintenance of parks was first discussed in 2018. However, its implementation got delayed due to lack of clarity on allowing commercial activities in areas earmarked as green zones. Some residents’ welfare associations and Aam Aadmi Party had also recently opposed the idea. Civic officials, however, say that several norms will be in place to allay the concerns of those opposing the idea. “The maximum size of the booth has been restricted and it will be made with temporary eco-friendly material. Cement and mortar cannot be used. For uniformity across various parks, a standard design will be provided,” the north corporation states in the policy. These booths will be allocated for a period of five years and the cost of construction, grass cutting, pruning, machines for maintenance, etc., will be borne by booth operators. “Tenders will be called for maximising revenue generation, while reputed firms like Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, Mother Dairy, Paras, Anand, etc., will be invited on nomination basis,” the policy states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-nod-to-setting-up-kiosks-in-large-parks/articleshow/81920461.cms||Paras Singh
---||Kochi||Kerala assembly elections 2021: In Edamalakkudy, it’s a three-day poll process||IDUKKI: When the EVMs used for polling will be immediately shifted to the designated strongrooms after the voting process in each district, there will be a delay in shifting the EVMs from the three booths in Edamalakkudy panchayat in Idukki. As Edamalakkudy, a tribal panchayat, is situated inside the Munnar forest division, the polling officials will be moving from there with the polling material after completing the polling process only on Wednesday. The decision to delay the movement was taken in consideration of the threat raised by wild animals as the officials have to trek a distance of 18km from Societykudy to Pettimudy through deep forest. The 81 member officials, including 25 polling officials, left to Edamalakkudy from Munnar with the polling materials at 6.30am on Monday and reached the destination by 4.30pm. Kanan Devan Hills deputy tahsildar P Madanan told TOI that the election commission has set up four booths in the first tribal panchayat in the state. “We have set-up three main booths in Sociteykudy, Parappayarkudy and Mulakutharakkudy. In addition to these, a subsidiary booth has also been set up in Societykudy,” said Madanan. He said that due to the remoteness of the area, the polling officials would reach Munnar only on Wednesday evening. The officials are planning to start the day-long trek early in the morning on Wednesday. “The district administration has provided additional EVMs for Edamalakkudy considering the difficulty to reach the location. Idukki district collector H Dineshan told TOI that the wireless set of police will be used by the polling officials and police in Edamalakkduy to ensure effective communication from all the polling booths in the tribal panchayat. The area lacks proper communication networks. The road which connects Pettimudy to Societykudy was damaged iun the landslide and was repaired prior to the last local body elections. Edamalakkudy is part of Devikulam constituency in Idukki. As the area is situated deep inside the forests, candidates usually don’t reach out to the voters here during the campaign. This is the third assembly election in Edamalakkudy after the panchayat was created in 2010. The panchayat was created exclusively for the people of the Muthuvan tribe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/in-edamalakkudy-its-a-three-day-poll-process/articleshow/81920463.cms||---
---||Delhi||Vaccination for everyone? The jury is still out||NEW DELHI: Should everyone above the age of 18 be allowed to take the Covid-19 vaccine? The governments of Delhi, Maharashtra and a few other states seem to favour it.  Indian Medical Association has also written to the Centre seeking relaxation in the age criteria. While the proponents believe that vaccinating the young will help control the spread of the disease, some experts advise caution and insist that inoculating those aged above 45, who are at a higher risk of mortality, should remain a priority. The vaccination drive has twin objectives — to reduce serious cases needing hospitalisation and curtailing deaths. The country-wide data as of April 1 showed that 40% of all positive cases and 88% of deaths occurred in the age group of 45 years and above. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at Indian Council of Medical Research, said it made perfect sense to first cater to the vulnerable age groups. “By opening vaccination to all age groups, the threat to those at higher risk still remains. A higher number of vaccinations will not translate into rapid reduction of hospitalisations and deaths,” he added. Another argument for opening up vaccination to all was to dent the second wave. Kant said the impact of vaccination on severe cases and deaths would be visible after 8-10 weeks of administering the vaccine, as seen in Israel. So, it was unlikely to have a major influence on the ongoing second wave. “Currently, close to 90% of doses administered are of Covishield. Vaccination for all might strain the supply and also overwhelm the system,” added Kant. Dr NK Mehra, emeritus scientist and former dean of AIIMS, also opined against opening vaccination for all. “A targeted approach will be better, like beginning vaccination for all in red and orange zones,” he added. However, Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, said, “The young people have to go out and earn a living. They must be vaccinated for protection from the infection or severe symptoms caused by it. If they are immunised, the chances of them spreading the infection at home will also reduce.” Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonary medicine at Apollo Hospital, said, “The government should decrease the age limit because it is the young population that goes out and brings back home the infection. They themselves might be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but can spread infection to the elderly, which can turn very severe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vaccination-for-everyone-the-jury-is-still-out/articleshow/81939181.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Nashik||Pick the 1st bed available, said Bhujbal||Nashik: District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Monday asked the citizens to refrain from demanding choices in beds and to take the first available option if a Covid patient needs the treatment. Bhujbal was reviewing the Covid situation in the district at the collectorate in the presence of district collector Suraj Mandhare, NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav, Nashik ZP CEO Leena Bansod and others. “During the last meeting (on Thursday) I had asked the officials to ensure better arrangement of beds. The strength of the beds is likely to be increased to around 3,000 and this is a good sign. But people should stop demanding choice in beds,” he said. About 1,000 beds are being added in rural areas by acquiring beds in two of the private medical colleges while NMC is adding up to 2,000 beds. The administration can make the beds available but the problem is with the workforce required to operate the system. “Today, we are forced to take help from the retired radiologists and technicians to operate the machinery. In such trying times, people should take the first bed available,” he said. “We have 85 metric tonne oxygen per day production capacity and we are using 64 metric tonne oxygen per day. There are small problems of transportation of oxygen and hence Dura cylinders have been ordered to ensure the supply of oxygen in rural areas remains intact. We are also getting liquid oxygen carrier for the transportation of the gas ,” he said. He said “Only essential goods are allowed. This is because the government wants to save lives. In the current situation, if there is a problem of availability of beds then it means the situation is worrisome and hence the moves. If and when the cases come down, the restrictions will be eased off.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pick-the-1st-bed-available-said-bhujbal/articleshow/81918624.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Unable to have son, 23-yr-old kills self along with 2 daughters (edited 200)||Vimal BhatiaJaisamer: A 23-year-old woman in Gudamalani police station area of Barmer district jumped into a water tank along with her two daughters on Sunday evening. The bodies were taken out on Sunday evening and kept in a mortuary. The woman, identified as Kamla, had delivered a second daughter four months ago and had been depressed ever since. Barmer SP Anand Sharma said that Kamla was married to Kisna Ram Jat five years ago. On Sunday late evening she left her house with her daughters Tanuja (4 months) and Kapila (2-and-a-half years). She first threw her daughters in a water tank and later jumped in. SP Sharma told TOI that when Kamla did not return home, her family began searching for her and found the bodies floating in the tank. On getting information people gathered at the spot and the bodies were taken out by the police. The woman’s parents were informed.

The dargah managements which had seen their donation boxes dry up during the lockdown last year fear serious financial crunch now that they have been ordered to shut till April 30. “We were already drained due to the lockdown last year and our reserve funds were used up in meeting costs like staff salaries and maintenance. Our income depends entirely on collection boxes and now that no devotees will be allowed, they will dry up again,” said Sohail Khandwani, managing trustee of Mahim Dargah and trustee of Haji Ali Dargah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-haji-ali-mahim-dargahs-worried-another-closure-will-drain-finances/articleshow/81921583.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Delhi||DU student shot at over his friendship with girl||NEW DELHI: Disapproving of a teenage boy’s friendship with his sister, a man and two of his friends shot at an 18-year-old in outer Delhi’s Alipur on Sunday night. The three men have been arrested and two pistols used in the attempt to murder the youngster have been recovered. The incident took place around 10pm on Sunday when a man called the cops and reported that his son Karan Thapa,18, a resident of Nehru Enclave, had been injured by gunshots fired at him by some men. Police later identified the first-year Delhi University student’s attackers as the girl’s brother, Vikrant also known as Himanshu, 21, Vikas Pandey, 24, and Ashish, 24. “A police team that reached the crime spot found that the boy had been taken to Satyawadi Raja Harish Chandra Hospital in Narela, from where he was referred to Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital,” said a police officer. “There, police met the teen’s father, who disclosed that his son used to chat with a girl. The girl’s brother apparently objected to this and he along with his two associates attacked the boy. The father claimed the trio had approached his son on a bike and were armed with two pistols. After shooting at his son, the three men fled from the area.” Since the injured teenager was unfit to give a statement and no other eyewitness of the incident could be traced, a case of attempt to murder has been registered and efforts to trace the accused were initiated. A crime and forensics team that inspected the scene of crime seized three empty cartridges, one live and two misfired one from the spot. The officer added, “After the names of the suspects were given to police, several teams were created to arrest them. Information was developed regarding their hideouts and personnel deployed there in civil clothes. Eventually, after multiple raids and traps laid near the hideouts, Vikas Pandey was arrested with one automatic pistol from Alipur. Further inputs were developed and following raids, the other two were also apprehended near Valmiki Chowk.” On questioning, Vikrant admitted to the cops that he didn't approve of Thapa's friendships with his sister and took things into his hands. He roped in his friends and shot at Thapa, intending to kill him, police said. One country-made pistol was recovered from Pandey and one live cartridge was recovered from Vikrant. A motorcycle bearing registration number DL3SD 2098 used in the offence was also retrieved from the trio.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-student-shot-at-over-his-friendship-with-girl/articleshow/81920469.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Dhanyee Meye’ hits Tolly streets to canvass for ‘ghor-er meye’||Kolkata: A daughter of Bengal, who has been a household name across the country for generations now, took to the streets on Monday to garner support for another daughter of Bengal. Samajwadi Party leader Jaya Bachchan, sporting a red cap throughout her interaction at Trinamool Bhavan as well as during a road show in Kudghat, took off her actor’s hat and spoke from her heart, cautioning those trying to “bully” a Bengali woman “determined to make Bengal the best in the world”. “I have not come here to act. My party leader, Akhilesh Yadav, instructed me to come to Kolkata to show solidarity with Mamataji. It is an honour for me,” said Bachchan, who switched to Bengali, reiterating her roots in Bengal. “Ami prabashi Bangali, kintu Bangali (I am an expatriate Bengali, but a Bengali,” said the actress, who made her screen debut in Satyajit Ray’s ‘Mahanagar’. Thanking her, chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted: “Thanks @JayaBachchan and @yadavakhilesh ji for supporting us. And fighting against the negativity.” “A single woman is fighting all atrocities alone. She is leg-broken and head-broken but they have not been able to damage her heart or brain or her determination to move ahead to make Bengal one of the best in the world,” said the ‘Dhanyee Meye’—as she was described in her role she had played in an eponymous film in 1971—before joining in a roadshow for Tollygunge Trinamool MLA Aroop Biswas. The rally started from Sahapara ground in Kudghat. As the caravan, steered by Trinamool supporters on foot and motorcycles, wound its way through the narrow lanes of Sahapara, School Road, CG Road and Putiari Sharif, cries of “khela hobe” and “Bangla nijer meyeke chai” rent the air. Some tried to get a closer look of the star and ran along Bachchan’s vehicle, while some others stretched their hands to take her photograph on their mobiles. As the rally moved on, faces appeared on balconies and terraces, while some ran out of their shops. Mothers held up their babies for a quick pat from Bachchan even as police, civic volunteers and Trinamool workers struggled to keep the crowd at bay. “Mamataji is a very determined woman. She will not give up till she accomplishes what she has decided on. And, it is very difficult to intimidate Bengalis. Nobody has ever been successful in bullying the Bengalis,” said the actor, who played opposite Amitabh Bachchan in ‘Zanjeer’, the film that created the “angry young man” of Indian screen. The narrow and congested roads of Kudghat came to a standstill for an hour as the kilometre-long cavalcade with Bacchan and Biswas moved slowly as people from rooftops showered flower petals on the motorcade. “I don’t want anybody to hijack my religion and my democratic rights and Mamata Banerjee is fighting to preserve those rights. I am here for the next few days. I will be interacting with the people to tell them why it is important for Mamata Banerjee to win, so that our fundamental rights are safeguarded,” said Bachchan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dhanyee-meye-hits-tolly-streets-to-canvass-for-ghor-er-meye/articleshow/81919517.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Soon after the death, her family blocked road traffic and demanded action against the accused. The accused is in police custody. An FIR has already been registered against him under IPC sections 363 (abduction), 366 (abducting, inducing woman to compel her for marriage) and 328 (causing hurt by means of poison). The post-mortem examination was conducted by a panel of doctors and its report is awaited. Police said that sections of murder and sexual assault will be added if the autopsy report mentions it. Local police claimed that the girl and the youth were in a relationship. But their families were against it. “The accused is a college student. He has claimed that the girl had consumed poison because she was scolded by her parents for having a relationship with him,” said a police source. But the girl’s mother said, “My daughter was innocent and the youth took her away with him. He raped my daughter and later poisoned her. He should be punished.” Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Shahjahanpur, S Anand, told TOI, “Police had registered the FIR on Sunday night after the girl was recovered and the accused is in our custody.

The Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Bokaro, will now look into the matter. The parents, Mayan Kewat (42), a fish seller, and his wife Shanti Devi (34), who works as a daily wager, said the twins were born at a government hospital here on April 1. After their discharge on April 3, the parents, who are residents of Ketwat Tola village, some 68 km from here, donated one of the twins to a childless couple from Chandipur village of Kasmar block of the district. The other baby was handed over to a man from neighbouring Hosier village, who will give it to his childless relatives (couple) in Patna, Bihar. The matter came to light on Sunday after the parents' neighbours informed the local administration. After hearing the news, Gomia block development officer Kapil Kumar visited the couple at their home on Monday to confirm the matter. Talking to TOI, Kumar said, "The couple said they already have four children, two boys and two girls, and are struggling to feed them. They then decided to donate the babies to families who can raise them properly. However, the couple said they were expecting a boy and had planned to raise him." He further said, "I have referred the case to the Bokaro unit of the CWC to look into the legal aspects of the child donation." Kumar added that members of the CWC will visit the twin's parents on Tuesday. According to the mother, she and her husband are availing social welfare schemes provided by the state government but are not enough for their family. Shanti added, "We do not get work regularly. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to arrange two square meals a day for our four children. How can we feed our newborns in this situation? So, we decided to donate them. As a mother, it is painful, but I did it for their future.” Her husband Mayan said he was planning to raise another boy but was surprised when the twin girls were born. He said, "We live in a single 10x4 room with our four children. How will we arrange money for their marriage when we cannot even arrange two meals a day?” The couple’s eldest child is a teenage boy and their youngest son is five.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/poverty-stricken-couple-donates-newborn-twins/articleshow/81919562.cms||Divy Khare

Notably, ventilators are operated under the supervision of doctor who have specialisation in anaesthesia. As per the data provided by the district health authorities, the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) has 18 ventilators and the central hospital of Central Coalfields Limited has a lone ventilator. The sadar hospital in Ranchi has a total of 60 ventilators, but none of them has been used since the second wave of infections began in the state. Till Monday morning, Ranchi had 3,015 of 5,244 active cases in the state. When contacted, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the sadar hospital, Dr Pankaj Sinha, said: “We have a total of 60 ventilators and an anaesthetist who visits the hospital if required.” The son of a 63-year-old Covid patient from Kantatoli area told TOI: “My father was admitted at the Alam Hopital after getting infected five days ago. After his condition worsened and he was put on ventilator support, we tried to get him admitted to a government-run facility owing to financial crunch. Beds weren’t available at the Rims, so we tried to get my father admitted at the sadar hospital. But we were told that no doctor was available to run the ventilators and we had to shift him to another private hospital in Irba.” The Ranchi sadar hospital was provided with around 60 post-graduate doctors of various specialisations last year, but they had returned to their respective colleges after cases declined towards the end of 2020. when contacted, Ranchi civil surgeon Dr V B Prasad said: “We are getting 12 anaesthetists from the state health department to run ventilators at our centre soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/only-1-doc-for-60-ventilators-at-ranchi-sadar-hosp/articleshow/81919523.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||Ranchi||1000 passengers to be tested daily for Covid at Ranchi, Hatia railway stations||RANCHI: Nearly 1,000 passengers, who are arriving by trains from high-burden states to Ranchi and Hatia railway stations, will be screened for Covid-19 from Tuesday onwards. A decision in this regard was taken by top officials of the Ranchi district administration during a meeting with their counterparts of the Ranchi railway division at the latter’s headquarters at Hatia. Talking to TOI, Bundu sub-divisional officer Utkarsh Gupta said, “We decided to increase the number of daily tests at Ranchi and Hatia railway stations. We are targeting to test 500 passengers at each station daily.” At present, testing at both these stations is voluntary. However, the state health department, in a recent order, had asked the Ranchi administration to test all passengers arriving at these stations from outside the state. As of Monday, two teams of health workers were collecting samples from incoming passengers voluntarily at Ranchi and Hatia stations. But the footfall at the sample collection booths is relatively low. Meanwhile, the administration has no plans to depute more teams at the railway station immediately despite the decision to test more passengers. Gupta said health workers will primarily target passengers arriving from New Delhi, Punjab, Maharashtra, Kerala, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. Public address systems will be used at the stations to encourage passengers to get themselves tested. As per estimates, as many as 15 trains are currently passing through these two stations in Jharkhand. Ranchi rail division chief public relations officer Niraj Kumar declined to comment on the development when contacted. However, sources said it is not possible to compulsorily test every passenger who arrived at the two stations. “There will be utter chaos if one has to test 10,000 people daily. So, testing has to be done on random passengers,” a senior official of the district administration said. Testing at these stations will be done with Rapid Antigen Test kits, RT-PCR and TruNat machines, Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/1k-passengers-to-be-tested-daily-for-cov-at-ranchi-hatia-rly-stns/articleshow/81919698.cms||Dhritiman Ray

BAU official Pankaj Vatsal said, “A committee will work out the modalities for completing the counselling process.” The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by vice-chancellor Onkar Nath Singh and attended by the dean, director and other officials. Last week, BAU had shut its administrative building till Tuesday for fumigation after three of its staff members tested positive for Covid on Saturday. The university has decided to carry out sanitization of its buildings every Saturday. The UG and PG hostel students, who have already arrived at the campus, have been advised not to go out and invite outsiders. BAU has suspended its offline classes and asked the dean to make arrangements for online classes. The directors and the heads of departments have been asked to prepare a duty roster from Wednesday permitting only 25% of the total employees to come to campus on a given day. Meanwhile, Marwari College Ranchi has decided to conduct the semester I exam for its UG and PG students online in view of a sharp rise in cases. Principal U C Mehta said, “Earlier, we had decided to hold the examination offline and as a precautionary measure, we had asked the students to get themselves tested for Covid-19 before coming to campus. However, given the current Covid scenario, it is unsafe to hold offline exams. Around 5,500 students are expected to appear for it and our college has very little space to ensure social distancing for such a huge number.” Earlier, the college had to postpone its semester V offline exams after three of its staff members tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/birsa-univ-postpones-counselling-session-suspends-physical-classes/articleshow/81919686.cms||---

Currently, the home guards are paid at the rate of 500 per day for the days they are on duty and they are utilized for only about six months in a year. Protesting the paltry honorarium above their non-utilization for six months and not providing any retirement benefits, around 15,000 members of JHWA from different parts of the state have been protesting since March 8 in front of the Sai Mandir in Jagannathpur area here. Their demands included an increase in their daily honorarium to Rs 744, regular duty and payment of retirement benefits. They had announced a 'jail bharo' demonstration on Monday. The protesters said they would call off all forms of agitation only after the government issues the order. The move came after home secretary Rajeev Arun Ekka, additional home secretary A Dode and DIG (home guards) Narendra Singh and representatives of JHWA reached an agreement on Monday. After calling off their Monday’s agitation, JHWA general secretary Rajeev Tiwari said, "The government has agreed to issue an order to detail home guards for the security of all its departments on the lines of the utilization of home guards done by the Bihar government. This step will ensure regular duty for us and an increase in our payments.” He added that the government has asked for some more time to consider their other demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/home-guards-call-off-jail-bharo-stir/articleshow/81918773.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
