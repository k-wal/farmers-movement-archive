Maloo has also urged chief minister Chouhan to impose NSA (National Security Act) against those involved in the blackmarketing of oxygen cylinders, injections and other medical essentials to curb malpractice. "During Covid pandemic, many instances have been reported where the insurance companies are rejecting the claims or are making unnecessary deductions from the Insurance claims. The companies have stopped giving cashless facilities. Even if they allow, the hospital management is seeking 50 per cent or more of the bill amount as deposit. I raised this issue before Union Finance Minister Nirmala Nitharaman and instructions have been issued thereon," Maloo told TOI. The BJP leader further said, "Insurance companies are deducting huge amounts from Covid patients which are upto 50-60 per cent, in the name of consumables, high room rent charges, high consultant charges and many more. The district administration is also allowing the hospitals to charge exorbitantly. But, the insurance companies should bear this burden or negotiate with the hospitals for the same." Malu said a common man takes insurance policies to cover risk of hospitalisation and even after paying the premiums for many years, they are forced to bear the hospitalisation charges. "I request your intervention and instructions to the IRDA to rectify the same," read the letter by Malu. Taking a strong note, the Ministry of Finance and Corporate Affairs said that there were reports that some hospitals were not granting cashless facility for treatment of Covid-19 despite policyholders being entitled for the cashless treatment under their Policy. In this regard, it is clarified that where insurers have an arrangement with the hospitals for providing cashless facility, such network hospitals are obligated to provide cashless treatment for all treatments including treatment for Covid-19. "All the Network Providers (hospitals) who have signed Service Level Agreements (SLA) with general and health insurers have to mandatorily provide cashless facility for any treatment to the policyholders including Covid-19 treatment in accordance with agreed provisions of SLA and terms and conditions of policy contract. All policyholders that are entitled to cashless facility at all such network providers (hospital) with whom the Insurance company/TPA has entered into an agreement shall avail the benefit of cashless treatment. In the event of denial of cashless facility at any such enlisted network providers (hospitals) the aggrieved policyholders may send a complaint to the concerned insurance company," read the letter by the Ministry. Meanwhile, the BJP leader has also demanded action under National Security Act (NSA) against those involved in black marketing of medicines and health essentials. "The government should take strict action against profiteers on life saving drugs and equipment. Government should impose sanctions under NSA on such profiteering traders who are black marketing the machines and medicines," said Malu in a letter to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. He further said, "Oxygen concentrators and oxygen cylinders are life saving. Besides, machines worth Rs 30,000 are being sold at a price of more than one lakh and oxygen cylinders at a huge profit of 20 thousand rupees each. This should be curbed."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-leader-writes-to-fm-on-mediclaim-rejections-demands-cm-to-impose-nsa-against-black-marketeers/articleshow/82316618.cms||Rajendra Sharma

Barriers to Legal Immigration’. Pareen Mhatre, a 21-year-old, third-year biomedical engineering student at the University of Iowa, testified and explained the challenges that she faces, in her path towards US citizenship. TOI has time and again, highlighted the plight of legal (or documented) dreamers – children born outside the US (say India) who arrive with their parents (typically one or both of whom are H-1B visa holders) and know America as their only home. The hitch – when they turn 21 years old (age-out), they can no longer continue with their H-4 or dependent visa. Either they have to transit to an F-1 visa meant for international students, which has its own challenges such as higher fees and restricted work eligibility; or they have to self deport to India – a country many of whom have little or no connection with. The huge employment-based green card backlog for those from India, compounds the problem, as a large majority of children age out before the green card can be obtained. Mhatre, is also a member of ‘Improve The Dream’, a youth-led advocacy organization bringing awareness for more than two lakh children of long-term visa holders who face self-deportation, even though they have grown up in the US with a documented status. The American Dream and Promise Act, approved last month by the US House, provides a pathway to citizenship for legal dreamers. TOI was one of the first to report on this development. But this bill is not yet enacted and the challenges continue for Mhatre and many others. David J. Bier, Immigration Policy Analyst at Cato Institute, a Washington headquartered think-tank, who incidentally also testified before this sub-committee, had done a study. The employment based green card backlog (EB2 and EB3 skilled category) for those from India had reached 7.41 lakh in April 2020, with an expected wait time of 84 years. According to Bier’s study, nearly 1.36 lakh children from Indian families were caught up within this backlog and he estimated that 84,675 of them (or 62%) would age out without getting a green card. Read AlsoBill includes legal dreamers for a pathway to US citizenship, it will help over a lakh Indian childrenMUMBAI: A pleasant surprise for the Indian diaspora is contained in the 'American Dream and Promise Act’ – the reintroduction of which was announced by Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard on Wednesday. The reason – it promises a pathway to citizenship, not just for ‘dreamers’ but also for ‘legal orStepping on to American soilIn August 2000, Mhatre came to the US as a four-month-old toddler. Her mother was on a student visa and her father held a dependent visa. Subsequently, her parents completed their education and began to work for the University of Iowa. Her parent’s employers sponsored their green cards in 2012. Iowa, is home for Mhatre. Student life Like any other legal dreamer, she has had her set of worries and had to apply to colleges as an international student. She states in her testimony, “In addition to being an international student on the campus that I, very literally, grew up on, I have not been able to apply for any internships, which is an integral part of the holistic student experience…” As a STEM student, her aspiration is to design and create medical devices and equipment. Internships are one of the few ways through which students can acquire work experience – which has been denied, because she is a legal dreamer. “In July 2020, I applied for a change of status to F1 student, and my application for a change of status to B2 bridge was submitted in early April 2021. However, both applications for change of statuses are pending. I also turned 21 less than two weeks ago, so I can no longer have dependent status. I essentially aged out of the system. The processing delays for these applications have increased my anxiety,” she has stated. As immigration experts point out, an international student visa (F1) can be denied, because the student is unable to show ties to their country of birth – say India. Legal dreamers have to surmount this hurdle. Mhatre has completed 3/4th of her curriculum, being forced to self-deport will not only rip the family apart but will also kill her American Dream. She and many like her are undergoing professional counselling, they are no longer able to bear their burden – but there is a glimmer of hope that immigration reforms will help. Both the American Dream and Promise Act and the plan to eradicate the green card backlog will help legal dreamers. But how soon will that be? This is the moot question.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/an-indian-legal-dreamer-has-her-say-before-us-house-sub-committee-on-the-challenges-of-ageing-out/articleshow/82316984.cms||Lubna Kably

If the polls prove right, it would mean a major setback for the Congress and AIADMK, sizeable gains for the BJP and DMK and a mixed bag for the Left. Two polls gave the Trinamool Congress a comfortable majority in the 294-member assembly, one gave the BJP a clear win and two suggested it would be a close fight in which neither side getting a majority was a possibility. What they all agreed on was that the alliance of the Left, Congress and ISF would come a cropper in the state.

Mamata Banerjee will be CM for the third time. Despite trying every filthy trick, the BJP-EC alliance willThe Times Now CVoter poll gave the TMC between 152 and 164 seats and the BJP between 109 and 121 seats while Today’s Chanakya projected an even more impressive win for TMC with 169 to 191 seats leaving the BJP with 97-119. In sharp contrast, Jan ki Baat projected between 162 and 185 seats for the BJP and just 104-121 seats for TMC. The India Today Axis poll made it a dead heat with TMC getting 130-156 and BJP 134-160. Irrespective of which, if any, of these projections is correct, it would mean a huge gain for the BJP in a state that had hitherto been almost barren territory in assembly polls. While all the polls agreed on an NDA victory in Assam, they disagreed on the extent of it, with two projecting that it would be a relatively close fight and two others giving the ruling alliance a near repeat of the 2016 result. For Kerala, two of the four polls forecast a sweeping win for the LDF while two others suggested the governing alliance would win but with a reduced majority. Two successive terms for the same front would in itself be a rarity in the state, a second successive win with enhanced majority perhaps unprecedented. The one state on which all the polls agreed not just on the direction but also the extent of victory was Tamil Nadu. The DMK-led front seems all set to displace the AIADMK from office with even the most conservative estimates putting the M K Stalin-led alliance’s tally at 160 in the 234-member assembly. Counting of votes will be held on Sunday when we will know just how accurate the pollsters were.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/exit-polls-see-dmk-ldf-wins-in-south-divided-over-bengal/articleshow/82317203.cms||---

AAP, in a statement on Wednesday, said the April 27 notification of the amendment, right in the middle of the second Covid-19 wave, could lead to “a lot of chaos” and adversely affect Covid management in the national Capital as it battles the daily surge in cases, rising deaths and gaps in health infrastructure. The ministry clarified on Thursday, “The objective of the Amendment Act is to make it more relevant to the needs of the Capital, further define the responsibilities of the elected government and the lieutenant governor, and create a harmonious relationship between the legislature and the executive.” It added that the amendments would ensure better governance in Delhi and lead to improved implementation of schemes and programmes meant for the people of Delhi. The amendments, the ministry underlined, were consistent with legal and constitutional provisions, and were in line with the judgments of the Supreme Court dated July 4, 2018, and February 14, 2019. The statement marked a prompt rebuttal of AAP’s comments which sources in the home ministry said was motivated by partisan considerations rather than a correct reading of the statute. “They are fully empowered and, at the same time, accountable for all issues barring three — public order, land and police — which are reserved for the Centre under the statute,” a senior officer said. The GNCTD (Amendment) Act, 2021, came into force on Tuesday after being passed by Lok Sabha on March 22 and by Rajya Sabha on March 24, with presidential assent following on March 28. As per the statement of objects and reasons laid out by the government before Parliament while introducing the GNCTD (Amendment) Bill, 2021, the original Act was enacted to supplement the provisions of the Constitution relating to the Delhi legislative assembly and a council of ministers and for matters connected therewith. It added that Section 44 of the Act dealt with conduct of business and there was no structural mechanism provided in the Act for effective time-bound implementation of said section. Further, there was no clarity as to what proposal or matters were required to be submitted to the LG before issuing orders. The government had then said that in order to give effect to the interpretation made by the SC in its two judgments, the bill sought to clarify the expression “government”, which in the context of legislations to be passed by the legislative assembly of Delhi shall mean the LG of Delhi, consistent with the status of Delhi as a Union Territory, to “address the ambiguities in the interpretation of the legislative provisions”. The Act, as per a home ministry official, ensures that the LG is necessarily granted an opportunity to exercise the power entrusted to him under proviso to clause (4) of Article 239AA of the Constitution, in select category of cases and also to make rules in matters which incidentally encroach upon matters falling outside the preview of the legislative assembly. It also provides for rules made by the legislative assembly of Delhi to be consistent with the rules of the House of the People.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mha-says-delhi-govt-fully-accountable-for-health-and-education/articleshow/82317574.cms||---

The MHA order, which invoked provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, directed states and UTs to consider containment measures such as restrictions on gatherings, operations of markets, offices, schools and universities and intensified testing and tracking for immediate implementation based on their assessment of the situation until May 31. Despite the surge in Covid-positive cases and deaths in April, MHA's fresh guidelines on Covid containment steered clear of imposing lockdowns and left it to states and UTs to devise their own containment strategies based on the health ministry advisory. It said national directives for Covid-19 management, which require wearing of face masks and social distancing in public places and encouraging of work-from-home, shall continue to be strictly followed. All district magistrates are required to strictly enforce state-level directives on containment measures as well as the national guidelines. Violations, the MHA order said, would attract penal action under the Disaster Management Act. The health ministry had called for measures like night curfew, prohibiting public gatherings for political, social, religious, sports or entertainment purposes, capping attendance at marriages to 50 and at funerals to 20, closing of shopping complexes, cinema halls, gyms, spas, restaurants (dine-in), stadia and operating public transport at 50%, and a cap of 50% attendance in government and private offices. “However, these are indicative activities, and states and UTs should make a careful analysis of the local situation, areas to be covered, and probability of transmission and then take a decision,” the health ministry had advised. The restrictions were prescribed for 14 days across the containment zones, which shall be declared such after a public announcement outlining the rationale and the nature of restrictions while asking for a test-track-treat-vaccine approach and ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour. Apart from suggesting 100% vaccination of eligible age groups, the health ministry had said that details of hospital beds and vacancy status be made available online on a daily basis. It also said details on availability of oxygen, drugs, vaccines and vaccination centres, including the guidelines related to use of drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, should be widely publicised to generate public confidence.

We did not mean to disrespect anyone.” Chief Justice Banerjee said he had “never met a respectable doctor who advised me to drop the guard”.  The bench, which had told the EC this week that it would stop the May 2 counting of votes in the absence of a blueprint to maintain Covid protocol, questioned why the Centre was “acting only now in April, (when) this will help only in July”. “There can’t be ad-hocism in dealing with a pandemic, and the Centre should have acted in a planned manner with expert advice,” the judges said. “...Despite having almost a year-long lockdown, see the situation we are in.”  The bench made the observations on a suo motu public interest writ initiated to check Tamil Nadu’s preparedness to tackle the second wave.  As for May 2, which is a Sunday, a curfew has already been clamped in keeping with stipulated restrictions during vote counting. Recording the submissions, the court directed the AG to ascertain how the media, particularly television crew, would be regulated at counting centres. “Their presence is imperative, but given the number of television channels, they would be a crowd,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/what-were-you-doing-for-15-months-madras-high-court-slams-centre-on-covid-situation/articleshow/82317777.cms||Suresh Kumar

Briefing PM Narendra Modi on the various initiatives being taken by the Army at a review meeting, Gen Naravane said military medical staff is also being made available to various state governments in the battle against the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. Gen Naravane also informed the PM that the Army is helping with manpower for imported cryogenic oxygen tankers and vehicles, wherever specialised skills are required to manage them. As for the hospitals, a senior officer said, “The Army has established a dedicated Covid medical facility at the old Command Hospital Complex at Pune where substantial capacity has been created for treating civilian patients referred by the district medical officer. It has a team of Army doctors and paramedical staff to take care of Covid patients.” The Army has also provided assistance for the setting up of a 900-bed hospital at Ahmedabad in Gujarat and a 100-bed isolation facility at Barmer in Rajasthan. Similar efforts have also been made at multiple locations in Madhya Pradesh, which include a 150-bed facility at Bhopal and two 40-bed facilities at Gwalior and Saugor. “The Army is prepared to provide all possible assistance to our civilian brethren in this crisis, all the while remaining prepared to meet various operational contingencies,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-army-opens-hospitals-to-civilians-setting-up-temporary-facilities/articleshow/82318086.cms||---

According to the revised guidelines, home isolation is allowed only if oxygen saturation at room air is above 94%.  It suggests that a caregiver should be available on “24x7 basis” and a communication link between the caregiver and hospital is a prerequisite for the duration of home isolation. Patients aged more than 60 years and those with co-morbid conditions shall only be allowed home isolation after proper evaluation, the guidelines said. The revised guidelines advise against attempting to procure/ administer Remdesivir injection at home, underlining that it should be administered only in a hospital setting.  The guidelines said systemic oral steroids were not indicated in mild cases and if symptoms (fever, worsening cough etc) continued beyond seven days, the treating doctor should be consulted for treatment with low-dose oral steroids. In case of falling oxygen saturation or shortness of breath, the person should require hospital admission and seek immediate consultation with the treating physician or surveillance team. The new guidelines include inhalational Budesonide (given via inhalers with spacer at a dose of 800 mcg twice daily for five to seven days) to be given if symptoms (fever and/or cough) persist beyond five days. Patients in home isolation should be kept in rooms with cross-ventilation, the windows should be kept open and a triple-layer medical mask should be used at all times. “The mask should be discarded after eight hours or earlier if they become wet or visibly soiled. In the event of the caregiver entering the room, both caregiver and patient may use N95 mask. The masks should be discarded only after disinfecting with 1% sodium hypochlorite,” the guidelines said. Patients were also advised to take rest and drink lot of fluids and follow respiratory etiquette at all times. Patients under home isolation will stand discharged after at least 10 days from onset of symptoms (or from date of sampling for asymptomatic cases) and no fever for three days. There is no need for testing after home isolation period is over, the document said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/home-isolation-only-if-oxygen-saturation-is-above-94-government/articleshow/82318529.cms||---

The country reported 3,502 deaths, amid widespread reports of underreporting of fatalities with a gross mismatch of reported deaths and actual cremations across the country. Cases have been higher than 3 lakh for 9 days in a row now. The country’s positivity rate is at 21.2% (based on smoothed 7 day rolling average of cases and tests). This means that 21 out of 100 people who are being tested are turning positive. Such a high positivity rate means many infections are going undetected. Several experts, including Dr Devi Shetty, feel that the actual level of infections could be at least 5 times more than the cases reported. The daily case count breached the 1 lakh mark on April 6 and since then it has inched closer to the 4 lakh level. The impact of this level of cases was observed on deaths after a week and on April 13 deaths also touched their previous peak level. A bird’s eye view of past data shows a broad pattern and there seems to be a week’s lag in the reflection of the impact of increasing cases on daily deaths. Cases, for instance, touched 1.15 lakh on April 6 and the death toll crossed the thousand mark on April 13. Similarly, the case count crossed the 2 lakh mark on April 15 while deaths breached the 2000 level on April 20. Since April 21 cases have crossed the 3 lakh level while over 3,000 deaths are being reported since April 27. If this pattern is followed and cases continue to rise this steadily, then India should brace itself to see even a higher level of daily deaths in the coming days. Among states, Maharashtra reported 66,159 cases, the country’s highest, and was followed by Kerala, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka — each reporting between 30,000 to 40,000 cases. The national capital reported 24,235 cases which was the country’s fifth-highest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-daily-case-count-inching-closer-to-the-4-lakh-mark/articleshow/82318359.cms||---

So, as and when the facility of respective state governments or even private hospitals is ready, they can start vaccinating immediately. It is not necessary that all of them have to get ready at the same time. By opening registration, we have ensured that those states that are ready do not have to unnecessarily delay vaccination,” National Health Authority CEO Ram Sewak Sharma said. Sharma said along with available vaccination slots, the vaccination centres will be required to display the type of vaccine as well as price once they are ready and up on Co-Win. Registrations on Co-Win for Phase-3 of vaccinations crossed 2.28 crore in two days, as per health ministry data. Till 8 pm on Thursday, around 20 lakh doses of Covid vaccines were administered, taking the total coverage so far to 15.2 crore. The flat trend is the result of fear of infection keeping people away as well as a certain plateauing in the 45-plus group currently eligible for the shots. While vaccine eagerness was evident with a large number of people registering online after the portal was opened for all above 18 from April 28, slots for booking appointments continued to be few even on the second day and were only for the 45-plus cohort. Many private hospitals said that slots will open up with availability of vaccines, whereas there are not enough supplies at present to meet the immediate demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/scheduling-hampered-but-states-that-are-ready-can-jab-18-nha/articleshow/82318608.cms||Sushmi Dey

The price of a dose of Covaxin for private hospitals, however, remains unchanged at Rs 1,200. SII has pegged the Covishield prices for private hospitals at Rs 600 a jab. The Hyderabad-based vaccine-maker had already said that it would stick to its original pricing of Rs 150 per dose of Covaxin for the Centre. “We wish to be transparent in our approach to pricing,” Bharat Biotech said, adding Thursday’s slash followed the recognition of “enormous challenges to the public healthcare system and deep concern with the critical pandemic circumstances”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-sii-covaxin-price-cut-by-rs-200-for-state-governments/articleshow/82318823.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Hyderabad||Country likely to face vaccine shortages till July: ISB study||HYDERABAD: As the country opens up vaccinations for those aged 18 years and above, premier B-School, Indian School of Business (ISB), has pointed out that the current level of vaccine supplies will not be enough to sustain even the vaccination rate seen in the first week of April. In its presentation to Niti Aayog recently, ISB also indicated that many states will continue to experience vaccine shortages till the end of July. The presentation made by ISB’s Prof Sarang Deo, Prof Sripad Devalkar and research associates Abhishek Reddy and Syed Junaid NITI Aayog outlined in detail the challenges related to the Covid-19 vaccination rollout in India. On an average, 34.6 lakh vaccinations were performed per day in the first week of April, including both the first and second doses. “The average vaccination rate masks considerable variability across rates. Typically, the vaccination rate is lowest on Sunday and highest on Monday. In the first week of April, while the average daily vaccination rate was 34.6 lakh doses, it was only 17.3 lakh on April 4 (Sunday) and as high as 45 lakh doses on April 5 (Monday),” Devalkar said. As on April 8 (at 12.30 pm), around 11.1 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines were delivered by the Centre to the states and Union territories, of which 9.1 crore doses were consumed and 1.9 crore doses were available. As on April 29, around 15 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses have been consumed and 1.3 crore doses are available for vaccination, data from the ministry of health and family welfare revealed. Deo pointed out that there were enough stocks of the vaccines initially produced and distributed to the states because the initial uptick of vaccination was very low. But when the vaccination rate started picking up, there was only enough stock to cover for the uptick in the first week of April. At the current level of supplies, the government will find it difficult to maintain the rate of vaccination witnessed in the first week of April. As per the study, the government should also be cognisant about limitations in vaccine delivery capacity. “In most states in India, vaccination has not really penetrated far beyond urban and semi-urban areas. The lowest level in the public health system, where vaccinations are done, is primary health centre (PHC). In contrast, routine immunisations are done at anganwadis, which are below the PHC,” he explained.

The hospital denied the charge and said the patients were critical and died due to “health complications”. Kin of the patients sent a signed letter to the district magistrate (DM) on Thursday demanding a probe and action. They alleged that they were told in the morning by a staff nurse that oxygen supply was interrupted, which then led to the deaths. They also alleged that doctors had “run away from the hospital”. Dr CP Singh, director of Bright Star Hospital, New Moradabad, said, “11 patients have died in the last 24 hours at the hospital. Those who died were critical patients of Covid-19 and passed away during treatment. There is no scarcity of oxygen and our oxygen plant is fully functional.” Moradabad DM Rakesh Kumar Singh has ordered a probe. But he also said, “Patients who were put on ventilators would have also died had there been disruption in oxygen supply. But that did not happen. There is no evidence of scarcity of oxygen at the hospital so far. However, case files of the deceased are being thoroughly studied to ascertain the cause of deaths. A detailed probe has been ordered.” Meanwhile, additional director (health), Moradabad, Dr Vineet Shukla, said the patients had died due to infection. “After the complaint, a joint inspection was conducted by SDM (sadar) Prashant Tiwari and district surveillance officer DK Premi. Six patients died after 3am on Thursday. The records were checked. There is sufficient oxygen supply available at the hospital. It is clear that the patients, who were already critical, succumbed to infection during.” The distraught families were not convinced. Rajat Kumar Singh, a resident of Moradabad, said, “When I went to see my father at the hospital, there was panic all around. He was found lying unconscious. I asked everyone, but nobody told me what had happened to him. He had died.” Another patient’s brother said, “My brother was absolutely fine when I saw him last on Wednesday night. When I came to see him the next morning, he was gone.” Police in Moradabad have also launched a probe. Additional superintendent of police of Moradabad, Anil Kumar Yadav, said, “The deaths are being verified. Prima facie, there was no shortage of oxygen and the patients died as their condition was critical.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/15-patients-died-due-to-lack-of-oxygen-at-private-hospital-in-up-allege-kin/articleshow/82318893.cms||Maria Khan
---||India||Report on blocking of FB hashtag ‘mischievous’: Government||NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday termed as “misleading” and “mischievous” a report that it had directed Facebook to block posts carrying the hashtag #ResignModi – and the social media giant later restored them, saying they had been blocked “by mistake”. The Union ministry of electronics and information technology shared a statement on Koo app, India’s domestic alternative to Twitter, saying, “A story by Wall Street Journal attributing removal of a certain hashtag by Facebook to GOI’s efforts to curb public dissent is misleading on facts and mischievous in intent. Govt has not issued any direction to remove this hashtag. Facebook has also clarified that it was removed by mistake.” On Wednesday, several thousand posts carrying the hashtag were unavailable on Facebook for several hours. When users searched for the trend, they were redirected to a page that stated that the posts were “against Facebook’s community standards”. Responding to a tweet asking why the hashtag was blocked, Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said around 1.10 am, “This hashtag has been restored and we are looking into what happened.” Around 5.30 am, in response to another tweet, Stone said, “Here’s more on what happened today: We temporarily blocked this hashtag by mistake, not because the Indian government asked us to, and have since restored it.” Several other international news organisations, including Guardian and Buzzfeed, also wrote about Facebook blocking the hashtag, which was the top trend in India through the day, garnering over 302k tweets. A statement shared by Facebook with TOI echoed Stone’s tweets. Last week the government ordered social media giants to take down 100 ‘fake’ and ‘misleading’ posts and URLs around Covid-19. Pointing to increasing instances of online censorship, cyber experts said archaic laws that restrict the freedom of expression and speech needed to be overhauled. “Laws that require confidentiality of takedown notices (such as Section 69A of the IT Act) should be repealed,” Mozilla Tech policy fellow, Divij Joshi, told TOI. Social media companies should also release “meaningful information about content moderation, including what is removed and what is allowed to stay, through regular reports…They should provide reasons for removal especially to affected persons whose content is removed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/report-on-blocking-of-fb-hashtag-mischievous-government/articleshow/82318962.cms||Anam Ajmal

Mathura jail authorities said on Thursday evening that they have "received no instructions from the state government on the transfer of the inmate". Kappan was moved back to the Mathura jail on Tuesday from a local hospital, a day before the apex court had directed the UP government to take him to Delhi for treatment after his medical reports revealed that he had multiple health issues like diabetes, heart ailment, blood pressure, and bodily injury, apart from testing positive for Covid-19. SSP, Mathura district jail, Shailendra Maitrey, confirmed to TOI that Kappan had gone back to the prison "after he tested negative for Covid-19 on Tuesday". Kappan and three others were arrested on October 4 last year when they were going to Hathras in UP from Delhi to report the alleged gang-rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit girl by upper caste youths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/despite-sc-orderkappan-still-in-jail/articleshow/82319132.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Mamata Banerjee will be CM for the third time. Despite trying every filthy trick, the BJP-EC alliance will lose,” TMC Rajya Sabha MP and spokesperson Derek O’Brien said, without making any direct comment on exit polls. CM Banerjee, leaders said, was likely to meet all candidates and their election agents virtually at 3 p.m. on Friday, two days before the May 2 counting. “The protracted and controversial Bihar counting is a factor,” a party senior said. This meeting was originally slated for Saturday but was brought ahead by a day because of the Election Commission’s stringent Covid-safety protocols, Trinamool leaders said, explaining that they were “not going to leave anything to chance”. Leaders took comfort from the fact that both 2011 and 2016 exit polls had given fewer seats to the TMC than it actually won. “I believe our party will get more (than what the exit polls say) and the BJP will get less. But, irrespective of the numbers, all opinion polls nullify the 200-plus-seats lie repeated by PM Narendra Modi. He held 21 election meetings in Bengal, union home minister Amit Shah made Bengal his second home and the EC played a very partisan role,” TMC MP Saugata Roy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tmc-confident-mamata-will-go-from-wheelchair-to-the-chair/articleshow/82319161.cms||---

Recognising the importance of factual reporting in the midst of the pandemic, the group, however, advised restraint in the interest of the mental health of a large section of the population which is already faced with severe disruptions in normal life. “We are saying that hysteria and panic-inducing coverage should be avoided,” the mental health professionals said in an open letter to the media. “This (Covid-19) is already fostering a hidden mental health epidemic with people becoming depressed, lonely and anxious. Stuck at home, people turn to TV or social media even more than earlier. But when they see such disturbing and depressing visuals, they are pushed much deeper into the abyss,” the letter said. The letter has been endorsed by the president of Ethics and Medical Registration Board in National Medical Commission B N Gangadhar, professor and head of psychiatry in Nimhans (Bengaluru) Pratima Murthy, president of Indian Psychiatry Society Gautam Saha and professor of psychiatry in AIIMS Rajesh Sagar. “In such times, the media has great power to inform, educate and most importantly, infuse hope in the people. This includes sharing of authentic information and allaying fears. These are extremely important weapons in this fight against the pandemic. Therefore, we request our friends in the media to show restraint in their coverage without compromising on facts or public interest,” they stated. “You are important partners along with front-line workers both in the healing process and in providing hope, as well as support for those in grief,” said the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/images-of-tragedy-worry-mental-health-experts/articleshow/82319415.cms||---

The labour ministry said each ESIC hospital will earmark at least 20% of its beds for Covid-19 care to ESI staff, pensioners and beneficiaries. It said an insured person under ESIC, who is unable to attend to work due to Covid, can claim sickness benefit for the period of absence for up to 91 days. The statement said ESIC members who face unemployment due to retrenchment or closure of an establishment have been permitted to seek an unemployment allowance for two years under Rajiv Gandhi Shramik Kalyan Yojana. ESIC will also cover funeral expenses of Rs 15,000 in the event of a member’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/esic-offers-covid-relief-to-beneficiaries/articleshow/82319422.cms||Swati Mathur
---||Business||As Covid cases spike, nurses,paramedics in short supply||Chennai: The spike in Covid cases and increased need for home isolation and treatment has led to an acute shortage of trained nurses, paramedics and phlebotomists. Consequently, there is almost a 20% increase in pay for such job roles and some institutions are also shortening the runway to student paramedics to quickly onboard them. Bengaluru-based home healthcare startup Portea saw a 40% rise in demand for home nurses between March and April. Covid care being specialised and in demand, we pay almost a 15%-20% premium for our staff on such assignments, Vaibhav Tewari, co-founder, Portea Medical, said. In the last one month alone, Portea has handled around 3,000 clients for oxygen support, nursing and other services for Covid.Industry sources said that salaries of a fresher lab technician in diagnostic labs or a home nurse is currently almost Rs 25,000-Rs 30,000 per month. India Home Health, another home healthcare enterprise, says the second wave has led to a ‘huge jump’ in demand for staff for home ICU set ups, oxygen management, and other tasks. This is a ‘big surge’ compared to the lull we faced the same time last year when SOPs for managing Covid were not well-defined and staff hesitated to take up Covid assignments, V Thiyagarajan, founder, India Home, said. However, he says pay scales haven’t seen a huge jump and the increases are homogenous.A Lok Sabha reply in March 2020 said that the nurse to patient ratio in the country at present is around 1.7 nurses per 1000 population much lower than around 3 nurses per 1,000 population laid down by WHO. Headhunter TeamLease Services in its employment outlook for April-June 2021 reports that at 58% outlook, hiring intentions for the healthcare sector has almost doubled from the same period last year. “Phlebotomists for diagnostic labs for short-term contracts, nurses and paramedics staff for hospitals and large corporations are some of the roles high in demand,” Balasubramanian A, business head- consumer and healthcare, said. Lab technicians, ambulance drivers and other frontline staff shortages is indicating an impending HR crisis. Private ambulance network StanPlus is handling 10x more volumes in the last one month and is able to find only one trained personnel for every four open paramedic positions, and hiring paramedics staff at almost 50% pay hike. “When the country is ramping up healthcare infrastructure such as Covid care centres and home ICU set ups, we need massive numbers of nurses and paramedics to handle this too,” Prabhdeep Singh, founder and CEO, StanPlus, said. Kunaal Dudeja, co-founder and CEO of healthcare edtech startup Virohan India, says the ratio of doctors to allied healthcare professionals (such as lab technicians, medical technologists and others) in India is just around 1:4, and almost 90% of AHPs today are not trained formally. Virohan, which offers NSDC-certified diplomas for students to become lab technicians and OT technicians, is accelerating course delivery to learners to meet the massive demand. The startup is scaling up to 160 centres across 35 cities this year. With supply of trained staff drying up, organisations are shortening the runway for paramedics to mainstream. Tanker Foundation, a private initiative that treats patients with kidney ailments free is onboarding nurses without provisional certificates on completion of courses this year. Its head of administration Vasanthi Ravichander said, “With the growing need for skilled staff, we have relaxed our hiring norms and take them without certificates and pay Rs 1,000 lower salary.”And on submission of documents, their salary will be revised. Anyway, we end up training them according to our needs.” “The greatest bottleneck in expanding ICUs is the shortage of nurses. There are about 2.2 lakh nursing students who finished GNM or BSc training, just waiting for the exam. The nursing and ICU serving paramedical students should be exempted from appearing for the exam to graduate and given preference for future government jobs, provided they work in a Covid ICU for one year. Most students would love to take up this offer,” Dr Devi Shetty, founder of Narayana Health, wrote recently in TOI.(With Inputs from Mamtha Asokan)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/as-covid-cases-spike-nursesparamedics-in-short-supply/articleshow/82316356.cms||---

The Shri Guru Singh Sabha has been organising the langar for Covid patients, who are unable to arrange oxygen for themselves since past few days and till date 80 patients have availed the facility. The ‘Oxygen langar’ was opened on April 27 at Gurdwara Kirtangarh near Gumti no: 5 outside Guru Nanak Library. “The Shri Guru Singh Sabha Latouche road had organised “Oxygen Langar” on April 27 and 28 at Gurdwara Kirtangarh near Gumti no 5 outside Guru Nanak Library. But as there were certain shortcomings in operating ‘Oxygen Langar’ at Gurdwara Kirtangarh regarding Covid protocol, we shifted the langar to the new venue. From Thursday, the langar has been made functional from Gurudwara Ratanlal Nagar, which can accommodate maximum number of patients,” said president Shri Guru Singh Sabha Harvinder Singh Lord. The langar supplies oxygen to patients till the time they find a hospital bed or home isolation patients whose oxygen levels drop drastically, said Lord further. “We have arranged 10 beds for patients as of now. On Tuesday and Wednesday, we provided Oxygen cylinders to nearly 80 people free of cost, who walked into “Oxygen Langar” at both the venues,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/oxygen-langar-shifts-to-gurudwara-ratanlal-nagar/articleshow/82316267.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The board of the Ujjivan had proposed Ghosh for CEO after incumbent Ittira Davis resigned to take up a director-level position in Ujjivan Small Finance Bank. Ghosh is currently the non-executive chairman of Ujjivan Financial Services. According to the filing with the stock exchanges, the proposal received only 70% of votes in favour. Investors in the company are mostly private equity funds. Ujjivan Finance, which was in the microfinance business, had received RBI’s permission to set up a small finance bank in 2015. Following this, the lending business was moved to Ujjivan Small Finance Bank in 2017 and Ghosh moved to the bank as CEO. Since RBI norms required promoters to hold a 40% stake in the small finance bank, Ujjivan Finance changed its structure to that of a holding company and the bank as a subsidiary. In 2019, the bank appointed Nitin Chugh from HDFC Bank as its CEO and Ghosh moved to the holding company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ujjivan-fin-shareholders-vote-against-appointing-founder-as-ceo/articleshow/82316477.cms||Mayur Shetty

In wake of this unprecedented health crisis, multiple agencies including top industrial houses, voluntary agencies and the government itself have set in motion a plan to create more than 5,000 hospital beds with oxygen in the coming weeks. On Tuesday, ArcelorMittal group started a 250-bed facility at their Hazira plant near Surat, which would soon be expanded to 1,000, said state government officials. Likewise, Reliance Industries would make their 400-bed facility by Sunday, which would be expanded to 1,000, added officials. Adani Group is reliably learnt to be in discussions to set up 1,000 oxygen bed makeshift hospital locally. While the Dhanvantari Covid Hospital by DRDO is yet to be fully-functional, it would have 950 beds with plans of further expansion of 500 beds if required. The hospital has started admission from Monday. Plans are afoot to set up a 1,200-bed facility by DRDO at Helipad ground in Gandhinagar. It’s not just the big corporates – even the smaller organizations, trade bodies and NGOs are chipping in. In Ahmedabad, Vishwa Umiya Foundation started a 150-bed oxygen bed facility at DK Patel Hall in coordination with Devasya Hospital and AMC. In Surat, 500-odd beds are created in 26 community centres, whereas 255 more would soon be added. At Government Engineering College in Bharuch, a 90-bed Covid centre is underway through Vilayat GIDC Association. In Morbi, Simpolo Foundation, a CSR arm of Simpolo Vitrified Pvt Ltd on Thursday opened a post-Covid recovery centre with 65 oxygen beds. In Adipur town of Kutch, a local trust has given its land to create a 300-bed hospital. The facility, funded by two shipping bizmen Aashish Joshi and Pankaj Thakkar- is functional with 90 oxygen and 150 isolation beds. “We are adding 50 beds soon. The facility, which is functional for the past fortnight, has witnessed recovery of about 110 patients so far,” said Joshi. In an interview with TOI on April 18, CM Vijay Rupani has said the state has increased it's Covid-19 bed capacity from 41,000 on March 15 to 78,000.  He said the state is set to add 8,000 oxygen beds on war footing in 10 days. While the state has increased its capacity, Gujarat is yet to reach near that mark. "This is the first time all society stakeholders have put their collective might together to create health infrastructure on a war footing. With people's cooperation, we should be able to fight this battle and emerge winners," said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-to-get-over-5k-covid-beds-in-coming-days/articleshow/82316624.cms||---

While the earlier date for the start of wheat procurement was April 15, it was further revised to April 20 and the target was fixed at 1 lakh MT, sources said. The harvesting of wheat had become brisk from the first week of April. Incidentally, the Centre has fixed the MSP for wheat procurement at Rs 1,975 per quintal. In the open market, the purchase price for wheat is in the range from Rs 1,600-1,700 per quintal, reports said. On Thursday, the CM said fast-paced and expeditious procurement of wheat from the farmers would benefit them. He reviewed the prevailing situation at a high-level meeting attended among others by principal secretaries Deepak Kumar and Chanchal Kumar, FCPD minister Leshi Singh, department’s secretary Vinay Kumar, cooperative department secretary Vandana Preyasi and public relations department secretary Anupam Kumar through video-conferencing. Noting that wheat production in the state has been good, the CM asked the FCPD and cooperative department to be transparent and flexible during the procurement drive, and accordingly, allowed the farmers to sell their wheat either to primary agricultural credit societies or Vyapar Mandals as per their choice. He also asked the departments concerned to make publicity drive with a view to motivating the farmers to sell their wheat either to PACS or Vyapar Mandal. He asked the departments to make record wheat production as there has been bumper wheat production in the state. The CM said if the FCPD and cooperative departments needed additional money to make record procurement, it will be provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/wheat-procurement-target-increased-to-7l-mt-cm/articleshow/82315411.cms||Abhay Singh

The long queues of vehicles and ambulances on the Chaudhary High School ground also reduced from average 50-60 vehicles to just around 10 in three days. There was also a significant reduction in number of patients at Covid OPD of the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay (PDU) Hospital (Rajkot civil hospital).

The survey was based on intelligence from billions of transactions and more than 40,000 global websites and apps contained in its TransUnion’s identity proofing, risk-based authentication, and fraud analytics solution. These websites and apps have traffic coming from all countries across the globe, including India. “The pandemic and its corresponding rapid digital acceleration brought about by stay-at-home orders is a global event unrivalled in the online age,” said Shaleen Srivastava, head of fraud solutions at TransUnion in India. “It’s become clear that the war against the virus has also brought about a war against digital fraud.” In India across industries, TransUnion found that the highest percentage of suspected digital fraudulent transactions originated from Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. The highest increase was seen in logistics frauds where attempts from India rose by 224% compared to a 4.8% global increase. Other sectors were telecommunications (200%), financial services (89%) and communities such as online dating (10%). With more people shopping online during the pandemic, goods are having to be shipped and fraudsters know this. So, they aim to redirect genuine orders or, alternatively, place fraudulent orders with compromised consumer accounts to genuine customer addresses, and then redirect them once shipped. Globally, online gambling customers experienced a 9% increase in the rate of suspected fraud when comparing 2019 to 2020 among the hundreds of millions of iGaming transactions TransUnion analysed for risk indicators last year. “Despite the rising level of attempted fraud globally, consumers demand businesses both protect their transactions and still maintain convenient digital experiences. The businesses that come out on top will be those that successfully balance both,” concluded Srivastava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-frauds-from-india-against-biz-jump-28/articleshow/82316647.cms||---

The protesters were demanding immediate arrest of the culprits. The police teams from Karaiparshurai and its neighbouring police stations led by Hilsa SDPO Krishna Murari Prasad had to struggle for hours to remove the agitating people from the rail track and the road and take possession of the girl’s body. A relative of the deceased girl said she had gone outside her house in search of her father around 8.30pm on Wednesday. “When she didn’t return home, we searched for her throughout the night and recovered her naked body on the rail track early on Thursday morning. She was gang-raped before being murdered,” he alleged. Hilsa SDPO Krishna Murari Prasad too didn’t rule out possibility of rape. He said police would soon resolve the case and arrest the culprits. Sniffer dogs and a team from forensic science laboratory, Patna reached the place of occurrence to help police in its investigation.

---||Kolkata||Covid vaccination: West Bengal orders 3 crore doses for 18-plus age group||KOLKATA: The state on Thursday addressed 45+ citizens and those in the 18-44 age bracket on the anxiety about vaccination, setting aside 1 lakh doses for the former to get the second dose and writing to the Centre on the purchase of 3 crore doses for jabs to the latter. The vaccination drive gets extended to the 18-44 group next month. The state has decided to allot the 1 lakh doses to private hospitals so that the second jab can be given to those who had taken the first one there. The cost of this second shot will also be cheaper than the first. The allotment among private hospitals will be done after April 30. They will be free and hospitals can only collect a service charge of Rs 100 per jab from recipients. At present, the private vaccination centres are getting a dose for Rs 150 and charging a service fee of Rs 100, making recipients pay Rs 250. However, there is uncertainty about the first dose for all categories from May 1 at private centres. The state has requested the Centre for the 3 crore doses against payment — 2 crore shots for the government sector at Rs 300 per dose and 1 crore shots at Rs 600 per dose. These will be in addition to the ongoing supply of free vaccines to states by the Centre for vaccinate the 45-plus age group. Unlike other states, Bengal has chosen to source vaccine worth Rs 1,200 crore from the Centre. The 2 crore shots for the government CVCs will cost the state Rs 600 crore while the 1 crore shots for private CVCs will also cost Rs 600. This is the price of Covishield, manufactured by SII. Covaxin is more expensive. Last week, the Centre had asked states and private hospitals to individually place orders for the third phase of inoculation. Following that, the Bengal government told private hospitals to procure their orders from the manufacturers on their own. The next day, the state indicated it would order stocks on behalf of private centres after they pleaded it would be a logistic nightmare if small orders were individually placed. “We are thankful to the state for extending a helping hand in sourcing vaccines for phase III of the inoculation drive, especially during such trying times when all of us are finding it hard to source it directly from the manufacturers. This support will go a long way towards helping immunize this section of the population,” said Nayarana Health zonal director (east) R Venkatesh. “The fact that the government is trying to procure the doses on our behalf brings us hope that we can continue with the vaccination drive,” said CK Birla Hospitals CMRI COO Simmardeep Gill. Private hospitals are required to return unused vaccine stocks on April 30. Thereafter, it is supposed to purchase vaccines at the revised price. Meanwhile the Co-Win portal was more easily accessible on Friday, but people still couldn’t make appointments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-orders-3cr-doses-for-18-plus-age-group/articleshow/82316109.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Vax centres rely on tokens, second shot eludes sr citizens||KOLKATA: With a large number of vaccine aspirants in the 45-plus age group refusing to register on Co-Win that provides virtual appointments for the jab and instead choosing to queue up at centres from as early as 5am, senior citizens, particularly the infirm and those with mobility difficulty, are unable to take the second shot. Also, the uncontrolled number of people waiting is increasing the risk of virus contamination in the crowd. Subrata Ghosh and his wife Gouri failed to get the vaccine at the KMC clinic in Layalka on Tuesday and Wednesday as the queue had already become serpentine by the time they reached around 9am on the first day and 8am the next day. On Thursday, they arrived at 7.30pm and still found themselves behind at least 200 others. “I wish we could buy the vaccine at a pharmacy and take it. This is impossible,” he fumed. Mukti Ghosh (69), from Action Area I in New Town, has also been unable to get the second dose that was due on April 24. Though her daughter-in-law had booked a slot on Co-Win, the vaccination site did not operate that day. When she booked again at another hospital and turned up on time, she was told a physical coupon had to be collected for her turn. “To wait in a crowded place like this for hours is very difficult. It increases the risk of contracting the virus,” she said. At KMC centres in Kolkata, too, 95% of those who are turning up are not pre-registered on Co-Win. It has become a free-for-all with people queuing up before sunrise and waiting till 9.30am for tokens to be handed out. “How is it possible for a senior citizen to stand in queue for five-six hours? I had no problem registering on Co-Win, getting an appointment and the first dose,” said Chakraberia resident Promode Ghosh (76), who has arthritis and gave up yet again on the third day due to the pain in his legs. Health officials at KMC and Bidhannagar civic body said the rush for vaccine after Poila Baisakh made it impossible to maintain the integrity of the Co-Win application. The spike in demand for the vaccine was owing to multiple reasons: depleting stock causing anxiety, Covid situation triggering panic to get the protective shield, and apprehension of the vaccine price and fear of further rush when vaccination gets extended to all adults from next month. “At the civic CVCs, we were always open to spot registration because many don’t have smartphones or an understanding of how to operate the app. But it didn’t create a problem for those who came pre-registered as the number of people wanting to get vaccinated was manageable. That isn’t the case any more,” a KMC health official said. The official feared the situation would become impossible in May when those in the 18-44 age group joined the queue. Though KMC plans to set up separate fast-track vaccine centres for this segment, the existing CVCs apprehend they would get overwhelmed by the numbers post May 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-centres-rely-on-tokens-2nd-shot-eludes-sr-citizens/articleshow/82316102.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Patna||Bihar: Now, buy fresh vegetables from cooperative department’s portal||PATNA: Want to buy fresh and nutritious vegetables at your doorstep amid Covid-19 pandemic? Get it done with just click of a mouse. The state cooperative department on Thursday launched a web portal www.tarkaarimart.in to supply locally grown fresh vegetables to the residents of the state capital and East Champaran district. Launching the webportal, cooperative department secretary Vandana Preyasi said the project was preponed to discourage people visiting vegetable markets putting their lives at risk. “Our team worked hard and made it possible to get things completed at a time when people are risking their lives by paying visits to vegetable markets often found to be crowded. There are chances of getting infected there. But here we ensure supply of fresh vegetables to people's doorsteps within 24 hours of the order placed online,” she said. “Initially, the facility will be available to the residents of the state capital and Motihari, the district headquarters of East Champaran. Later it will be expanded to enitre Bihar,,” the cooperative department secretary said. The project aimed at providing fair price of their produce to the farmers and vegetables to the consumers at a reasonable rate compared to the open vegetable markets. “It will also fulfill the much ambitious project “Har thaali mein Bihari Tarkari”, (vegetable grown in Bihar in each platter in the country)" she added. Around 12,000 vegetable growers of Patna, Vaishali, Samastipur, Begusarai and Nalanda have got registered with the primary vegetable cooperative society set up at the panchayat level for collection and marketing of the produce. Speaking on the occasion, managing director Anand Sharma said that the main objective behind ‘Tarkari' Vegfed’, is to reduce the adverse impact of low rates by farmers and high rates by consumers. Responding to a query, the managing director said that the ‘Tarkaari' Vedfed’, will work on the pattern of Comfed, which regulates the supply of milk in the state and outside. “As we will ensure quality of vegetables and that too at a reasonable rate, there is no reason people will not prefer to buy from us. The vegetables grown along the Gangetic plains are more delicious, which other states lack,” he deed. Preyasi said the project will also help the state in dealing with the problem related to a large influx of migrant workers from the state in search of jobs. “These workers will be provided employment opportunities in the state,” she added. CEO of Union Patna Subhash Kumar said that vegetable growers would supply the produce to the collection centre at the panchayats from where it will be sent to other destinations. Amit Shukla, chairman of Tirhut union and Avinash Kumar of PMU, also expressed their views on the occasion. Earlier, CM Nitish Kumar reviewed the works undertaken by the cooperative department. At a virtual review meeting, Preyasi apprised the CM of the department’s new initiative about fresh vegetables procured from farmers' agricultural fields and sold to consumers through e-commerce. Food and consumer protection department minister Lesi Singh, principal secretary to CM Deepak Kumar, principal secretary Chanchal Kumar and information and public relations department secretary Anupam Kumar were also present at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-buy-fresh-vegetables-from-cooperative-departments-portal/articleshow/82315513.cms||Ramashankar

During the period, total demand for gold was 140 tonne compared to 102 tonne during the same period of 2020 (Q1 2020). According to data released by World Gold Council on Thursday, while jewellery demand during Q1 2021 rose by 39%, investment demand, which includes bars, biscuits, e-gold and ETFs, rose 34%. The quarter also witnessed a deluge of gold imports into India at 301 tonne, a jump of more than 3.5 times over Q1 2020 figure of 83.1 tonne — as jewellers were expecting the surge in demand to continue into Q2 2021. However, the recent lockdowns in several parts of the country could dampen the same for a few weeks, said Somasundaram P R, MD (India), WGC. “We are expecting strong demand for gold in the second half of the year,” he said. “Forecast of a good monsoon by the IMD (Indian Meteorological Department), the current softness in gold prices and the revival in the economy are expected to help demand for gold to rise,” he said.

The complainant told the police that Patel forced himself on her when she was with him in his SUV on April 26. The woman, who works in a shop at a mall in the city, said that she was invited to a party at a farmhouse in Sokhda village by her friend Shivam Patel on April 26. After her duty hours, she headed home for dinner and then went to the farmhouse. She told the cops that some of the persons present in the party were having liquor. At about 11.15 pm, they saw a police van near the farmhouse following which farm owner Bhumit Patel, Shivam Gandhi and Neel Patel fled from the spot. The complainant called up Gandhi who told her that he is sending his friend Prithvi Patel to pick her up from the farm. Prithvi arrived sometime later with accused Bhavesh Patel who asked the complainant to sit in his car. Patel told the girl that he will drop her at her home in Padra. She joined him in the SUV but instead of heading towards Padra, Patel took another road and stopped the vehicle at an isolated spot near a canal in Sokhda. The complainant told the cops that Patel first molested her and then raped her in the car. When the woman’s friends called up Patel and told him that her family was looking for her, the accused dropped her on Padra Road and left. Police said they are investigating the allegations made by the woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/former-councillor-accused-of-rape-in-car/articleshow/82315160.cms||---

The stock will not sustain even two days of vaccination drive,” a state official said.The daily tally of Covid shots has crossed the 5 lakh mark in Maharashtra. Public health minister Rajesh Tope has said the state can vaccinate up to 8 lakh people a day, if there are adequate doses.Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), health services said, “The government and private vaccination sites have been told to exhaust their stock to zero by April 30.” Before the fresh arrival of around 80,000 Covishield doses in Pune on Wednesday, the district had 8,000 Covishield and Covaxin doses.Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation commissioner Rajesh Patil said, “The inconsistent provision of vaccine stock has led to the inconsistent response to the drive. We had aimed around 25,000 vaccination a day, but could not make it due to supply shortage.” A PMC official echoed the same views.Two days ago, Nashik received over 74,000 doses that were distributed for Nashik city and the Malegaon corporation to the 15 talukas. Ravindra Chaudhary, vaccination nodal officer in Nashik, said, “In rural Nashik, 9,000-10,000 vaccines are administered a day if there’s stock.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-authorities-say-9-23l-stock-not-enough-for-2-days-drive/articleshow/82316939.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Business||Tatas get CCI nod for $1.2 billion Bigbasket buy||BENGALURU/MUMBAI: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) cleared Tata Digital’s acquisition of a majority stake in Bigbasket without conditions. Tata Digital’s interest in Bigbasket first became public last October. The acquisition of a 64.3% stake in Bigbasket will make Tata Digital the leading player in e-grocery, setting the scene for a big battle with Amazon, Flipkart, JioMart and SoftBank-backed Grofers. Tata Digital is a 100% arm of Tata Sons, the promoter of the $106-billion airline to automotive conglomerate. It will acquire 64.3% in Bigbasket’s online business-to-business arm Supermarket Grocery Supplies (SGS), the CCI said. Later, SGS will acquire ‘sole control’ over Innovative Retail Concepts (IRC), which is engaged in business-to-consumer sales through the Bigbasket website. The CCI nod came late Wednesday night. The acquisition, estimated to be worth $1.2 billion, bolsters the Tata conglomerate’s digital play as coronavirus-induced lockdowns and curfews propel India’s online shopping market. “When you look at trends for the future, there are clear signs. Anything that is digital, we are making a big bet on,” Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran had said at an event early this year. “The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of technology, changing the way people live, work and consume as well as how companies operate.” Tata Digital is in the final stage to acquire a majority stake in e-pharma platform 1MG which is expected to be concluded soon. It has already infused Rs 100 crore in 1MG via a convertible instrument. The debenture instrument, when converted into equity shares, will give Tata Digital a 5.7% stake in 1MG. Prior to this, Tata Digital had invested in CSC Grameen eStore, a rural e-commerce venture promoted by the government. Founded by five dotcom bust survivors in 2011, Bigbasket today operates in more than two-dozen Indian cities. Existing Bigbasket investors Alibaba and Actis, which holds around 30% and 17% in the e-grocer, will be selling their shares to Tata Digital, according to people briefed on the matter. On February 17, TOI had reported on Tata Digital seeking CCI nod to acquire Bigbasket with details of investors like Alibaba selling its shares. Tata Digital’s acquisition in Bigbasket comes after India tightened regulations for investments from Chinese entities. This has restricted Alibaba from upping its stake in the Indian e-grocer. The Tata conglomerate, through its listed entity Trent, had entered e-grocery with the launch of My247market.com in 2015. But it subsequently shut down the venture after it acquired the management team and technology infrastructure of Gurugram-based GrocerMax, now known as StarQuik, in 2017. Two years later, another listed group company, Tata Consumer Products, unveiled Tatanutrikorner.com which sells only the products it manufactures. Bigbasket will give wings to Tata conglomerate’s digital play along the lines of a super app, which will provide customers a single point of access to a range of services including Qmin (a food delivery platform), Tata CLiq (a lifestyle online shopping site) and Croma (an electronics e-store). The super app will be launched by Tata Digital in fiscal year 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-get-cci-nod-for-1-2bn-bigbasket-buy/articleshow/82316749.cms||Digbijay Mishra
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: KGMU, SGPGI get 29 tons oxygen each; step to help add more beds||LUCKNOW: KGMU and SGPGIMS received 29 tons of oxygen each on Thursday to meet not only their immediate requirement but also to allow them expand their bed capacity. Additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said the tankers had been provided by Linde, the largest oxygen supplying company in the country. “We have managed to meet the requirements of both the hospitals. If they want, they can increase their bed strength,” said Awasthi, who visited KGMU with other senior officials while the oxygen was being offloaded on Thursday. Awasthi said about 575 tons of oxygen was supplied to hospitals across the state on Thursday and it could be increased to about 650 tons per day in the coming days. The ACS said for the first time, oxygen tankers were airlifted from Lucknow on Thursday and taken to Ranchi for filling so that time can be cut down drastically in at least one direction. “The tankers which were dispatched in the evening were the same which had supplied oxygen to KGMU and SGPGI. These would return shortly with oxygen,” he added. Two empty tankers were sent to Ranchi via Special Army aircraft on Thursday night from Amausi airport. The aircrafts are likely to return to city till Friday morning expectedly. Meanwhile, a new arrangement has been made for oxygen procurement from Jamshedpur. Awasthi said the Centre had provided tankers to UP government which would be brought to the state by train. “A train carrying five oxygen tankers from Bokaro reached Lucknow at 3.30pm. These are meant for Agra and Kanpur. We need tankers for west UP and are making arrangements for it,” Awasthi said. He added that the government was also in the process of upgrading its existing fleet of tankers. All the approximately 85 tankers are being repaired and strengthened. The tankers, even if they are empty, are being provided green corridors so that they can reach their destinations at the earliest. To augment the supply of oxygen, the government has revived two refilling plants in Meerut while plants which had been shut down in Gorakhpur and Varanasi will be restarted. A new oxygen producing plant will also be set up in Meerut. “Steps are being taken for the revival of closed units to increase oxygen supply.

In a bid to curb Covid spread in the state, the government had announced on Wednesday that all shops will be closed at 4pm in place of 6pm as per an earlier order. Besides, night curfew will start from 6pm in place of 9pm. In order to ensure strict implementation of the fresh restrictions, the administration conveyed the message through loudspeakers. Police personnel were seen patrolling the market areas. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh was also seen inspecting implementation of fresh restrictions. The shop owners said since the administration was very strict this time, they downed their shutters exactly at 4pm. Basant Kumar, owner of a grocery shop at Kankarbagh, said, “People are hesitant to leave their homes and the offices also close at 4pm. This has drastically affected our sales. Most customers used to shop in the evening hours. The closing of shops at 4pm means huge loss for us.” Deepak Kumar, owner of another grocery store at Ram Nagari Colony, however, said such drastic measures were required to curb the spread of virus. “We cannot deny that curtailment of business hours or closure of the shops lead to adverse impact on us. However, it is also a fact that nothing is more important than saving human lives,” he said. Aakash kumar, who owns a garment shop at Hanuman Nagar, said the supply of products was quite less in the main market due to the absence of workers in the factories. Banker Varsha Bhardwaj said government guidelines are for the betterment of people. “We should follow these measures to keep Covid at bay,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fresh-curbs-shops-down-shutters-at-4pm/articleshow/82315390.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar Govt sets up online dashboard to display status of hosp beds||PATNA: The Bihar government has launched an online dashboard to provide up-to-date information on the availability of hospital beds for Covid patients in the state. The dashboard – https://covid19health.bihar.gov.in/DailyDashboard/BedsOccupied – is being operated by the State Health Society (SHS). People can check the total number of beds, ICU beds and the corresponding number of vacant beds. It also shows the status of availability of beds at Covid Care Centres run by the government. The dashboard shares the phone number and address of the hospitals to help people enquire about the availability of the beds before reaching the hospital. As of Thursday evening, 97 healthcare facilities in Patna, including private and government hospitals, were listed along with the status of availability of normal and ICU beds. The government hospitals listed in the dashboard, include right from Primary Health Centres (PHCs) to medical college and hospitals like the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences |(IGIMS). For instance, the dashboard showed all 128 beds full at IGIMS as updated around 6:30 pm. IGIMS is in the process of getting converted into a dedicated Covid facility. Similarly, out of a total of 300 beds at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)- Patna, two non-ICU beds were showing vacant as updated at 5.25 pm on Thursday. A similar listing of the availability of beds for Covid patients in the other 37 districts is also available on the dashboard. For instance, eight government and two private hospitals can be checked for availability of beds in Nalanda district, 15 hospitals in Gaya, 11 in Muzaffarpur, 12 in Bhagalpur and six in Gopalganj among others. As per a cursory glance at the availability of beds in different districts, it was found that the status of beds at private hospitals was comparatively more updated. Manoj Kumar, executive director of SHS, told TOI on Thursday evening that a team at Patna keeps calling the hospitals to ensure they feed their updated status in the Covid-19 portal of the SHS. "As of now, we have targeted to update the status of availability of beds in the hospitals twice a day- 10 am and 6 pm. These are the peak timing for the hospitalisation of patients. The idea behind creating the dashboard is to provide a platform to people, where they can check availability of beds and they do not run from one hospital to another, looking for beds," Manoj said. He added that efforts are on to make the status availability of beds in all hospitals across the state more dynamic. "Rigorous work will be done over the next one week to ensure that status of all hospitals is timely updated. An officer at the level of deputy collector is deputed as the nodal officer for this service along with eight staff to coordinate with the hospitals. The hospitals- private as well as government- are required to feed the updated status of beds, which is shown on the dashboard," Manoj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-sets-up-online-dashboard-to-display-status-of-hosp-beds/articleshow/82315673.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Patna||Now, cinical thermometers fly off the shelves in Patna||PATNA: Clinical thermometer, a key tool in the fight against Covid-19, has virtually disappeared from the shelves of most medicine shops in the city. Neither the ordinary mercury thermometers nor the digital ones are available in the market. “I have been trying to buy a thermometer for my family members for the last one week, but without any result,” said Maheshwari Prasad, a resident of Anandpuri locality in west Patna. He has checked almost all the medical stores of his locality for getting any type of thermometer, ordinary or digital, but to no avail. Prasad said an elevated temperature is one of the key signs of infection with the novel coronavirus, though not everyone infected will develop a fever. “Still, taking your temperature is one of the recommended steps in determining whether a person has the virus,” he added. Mukund Deo, owner of a medical shop at Anandpuri, said no thermometer is available in the market for the last one week. “All the thermometers available in my stores went off the shelves soon after the recent surge in Covid-19 pandemic. In the beginning, even one person would purchase up to three thermometers at a time, depleting the stock. I have been sending my man to procure thermometers along with medicines from the wholesale market almost daily, but he is not getting even a single thermometer in the market,” Mukund added. Nikhil Jha of Medose Pharma at Doctors’ Colony, Kanakrbagh, said not a single piece of ordinary mercury thermometer is available in his stores, neither it is available with the stockiest. “Some medicine stores do have a few pieces of digital thermometers with them, but they are selling them to only their known acquaintances,” he said. Manikant Prasad of Ausadhi at West Patel Nagar locality said the retail shops are facing scarcity of clinical thermometers for the last one fortnight. “I have been trying to get one piece for my own family, but no luck,” he said. “Fed up with the search for clinical thermometers in the local market, I tried to get the same through online shopping, but most online medicine dealers displayed ‘out of stock’ sign when an order was placed for the same. Ultimately I was compelled to purchase a contactless infrared thermometer at a much higher cost from the market,” said N K Pandey of S K Puri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-cinical-thermometers-fly-off-the-shelves-in-city/articleshow/82315612.cms||B K Mishra
---||Mumbai||No vax for 18-44 till Maharashtra has 25L doses; age-wise sub-groups likely||Mumbai/Pune: Faced with the challenge of procuring adequate vaccine stocks, the Maharashtra government will not roll out the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group until it has at least 25 lakh doses in its kitty. The state government has announced it is in no position to roll out the drive on May 1 due to unavailability of doses. To ensure there is no rush and the state can sustain the drive with limited vaccine doses, the government is likely to go in for sequential vaccination, and preference will be given to those with comorbidities in its next phase. The state government will form a core committee with senior cabinet ministers and health department officials for micro-planning of the drive. The committee will decide on the vaccination of the 18-44 age group in sub-groups such as 18-25, 25-35, 35-44, and also come out with guidelines on whether people with comorbidities in the age group can be vaccinated first. In a review meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday, it was decided the state should wait for adequate stocks to be procured before announcing a date. The meeting was attended by health minister Rajesh Tope, senior officials and even representatives of some vaccine manufacturers. “We have already approached the two vaccine manufacturers in India with a requirement of 12 crore doses to vaccinate 5.7 crore people in the 18-44 age group. So far, though, we have only received a purchase order from Covishield manufacturers for three lakh doses. That is a very small amount as per our requirement and so it has been decided to not start the drive until there are at least 20-25 lakh doses with the state for it to be consistent and uninterrupted,” said Tope. This development comes a day after the state cabinet announced that vaccinations for the 18-44 age group will be done for free in government centres and the state government has budgeted Rs 6,500 crore for the purpose. Officials said representatives of manufacturers such as Zydus Cadila and Johnson and Johnson were also present at the meeting and the state is in talks with them as well. “The CM said the state is ready to pay for procuring the vaccines in a single installment. But companies have not been able to provide the vaccines,” said Tope. The state is already talking to foreign companies but is yet to float tenders as it is trying to first get the available doses. The core-committee, which will be set up, will also frame guidelines to ensure the drive is carried out in a hassle-free and disciplined manner. Pradeep Bhargava, member of the Pune Covid platform, said, “Opening the entire lot in this age group will only lead to huge crowds at the centres, leading to a bigger Covid spread and may even create a law-and-order situation. Frankly, even the IT system may crash with such a load of registration.” Maharashtra should open only 30-45 age groups in the first tranche and look at 18-30 groups in the next lot for an orderly conduct of vaccination, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-vax-for-18-44-till-maharashtra-has-25l-doses-age-wise-sub-groups-likely/articleshow/82316255.cms||Bhavika Jain

Due to limited stock and crowding-like situation, many beneficiaries had to return home without the shots.Officials at the Sutar Hospital in Kothrud had to tell many beneficiaries to come the next day due to the crowding situtaion, while a vaccination centre in Bhusari Colony offered vaccination only to the senior citizens. The PMC-run Anandibai Gadgil hospital’s vaccination centre in Dattawadi had to turn away many beneficiaries due to the limited stock.Abhaykumar Vaidya (68), who visited the Dattawadi centre, said, “My wife and I came to the centre because we were under the impression that vaccines would be available today. We arrived at the vaccination centre at 6.30am to take the second dose. We finally received the shot at 11.30pm.”Another senior citizen, Arun Sarnaik said, “Even though the Maharashtra government has officially said that senior citizens should be given priority for the second dose, it is not the case at many vaccination centres in the PMC limits. So, we are trying our luck by arriving early at the centre.”An official from the District Hospital Aundh, the only dedicated Covaxin site in the district, said they too had to turn away many beneficiaries due to the dose unavailability. “PMC urges all Puneites to consider supply chain of vaccines and give priority to second dose beneficiaries. No walk-in allowed for first dose beneficiaries. Only second dose beneficiaries can go directly to our PMC facilities and take vaccine,” Rubal Agarwal, PMC additional commissioner, tweeted.PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil has urged citizens not to rush to vaccination centres on May 1 for the 18-44 age group drive. “We will inform citizens as and when the doses get available,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/huge-rush-at-vax-centres-pmc-says-no-walk-ins-for-1st-shot-beneficiaries/articleshow/82316944.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Kolkata||Ramzan markets make way for polling||Kolkata: In several pockets of central Kolkata, traditional Ramzan markets selling fruits, vegetables and fritters for iftar made way for polling. In many areas there was no market for the entire day on Thursday when seven out of eleven Kolkata assembly seats went to polls. In some other areas only, few shops were allowed to be set up. This has been one of the hottest Ramzans in many years where members of the Muslim community have been fasting without food and water between dawn to dusk. Zakaria Street, which has emerged as a hub of street food attracting foodies from across the city, is home to one of the most popular Ramzan markets. Due to the pandemic, only few shops are allowed to be set up in these areas and people have to follow social distancing norms. Calcutta Khilafat Committee, which organises the Ramzan market, said the decision was taken to facilitate polling since the area has almost three polling stations and people from other neighbourhoods come here to vote. “Keeping in mind the social distancing guidelines we decided that only a handful shops will be set up far away from the polling stations so that those who are fasting can purchase fruits and other edibles. The administration too had requested us to keep the carriageway for the movement of voters and poll officials,” said a member of the Khilafat Committee. Ramzan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and a time when Muslims fast during the hours of daylight. In the evening, people purchase fruits, fritters, vegetables and other delicacies like Haleem from the local Ramzan markets. By 4 pm people from across faiths head to Zakaria Street during Ramzan to savour the delicacies which are not available throughout the year. In Bow Street and Chandni too, there were hardly any shops open in the market. In Taltala, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and Alimuddin Street, some shops opened after 5.30 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ramzan-markets-make-way-for-polling/articleshow/82316953.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Justice Lisa Gill of the HC has also asked the state to file a status report on the issue by May 17. The counsel for the state assured the HC that adequate steps would be taken. The matter will now come up for hearing on May 17. The group, which claims to have perishable goods worth Rs 4 crore lying blocked at the storage facility located in Sambhu Kalan village of Rajpura area in Patiala district, has sought directions for immediate removal of farmers’ blockade and safe passage to the group to run its business activities. Farmers have been camping outside the facility under the impression that it is being purchased by a prominent corporate house they have been consistently agitating against. However, a legal battle is on between the said corporate house and Amazon. The matter reached the HC in the wake of a petition filed by Future Supply Chains Solutions, which has its registered office in Mumbai. The plea was filed through its representative, Akash Bharara, a senior manager of the company. Counsel representing the petitioner company, Sachin Rai Vaid has sought directions to remove the illegal blockade created by protesters as part of the ongoing farmers’ agitation outside the storage facility, which serves as storage facility for products (packaged food articles, grains and pulses) of the petitioner, before these are transported to various retail stores across Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/patiala-ssp-govt-get-notice-over-food-store-blockade/articleshow/82317803.cms||---

The district is likely to face shortage of 53,964 beds by May 11 if the active cases surge as projected. Of them, there will be shortage of 10,381 beds in hospitals — 8,679 with oxygen supply, 1,247 in ICU and 455 with ventilators. The remaining projected shortage of 43,583 beds in Covid care centres (CCC). In the district, less than 1% of total active patients are in CCCs and around 80% are in home isolation. The authorities have failed to convince positive patients to stay in CCCs. Patients are reportedly preferring home isolation. Therefore, the district needs to be worried only about shortage of 10,381 beds in hospitals if the active cases increase as per the projection. As per data of district administration, there are 9,835 functional beds in the district. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) started 120-bed Covid hospital at KT Nagar beginning with 25 beds a couple of days ago. On Thursday, 136-bed facility was started at Shri Ayurved College with 25 beds. Beds are likely to be increased to total capacity in phased manner in these two hospitals. Data available from NMC shows that 175 beds with oxygen supply and 16 in ICU were vacant at 5pm in the city on Thursday. Discrepancies continued in the number of active cases as per data of state’s public health department (PHD) and district civil surgeon (CS). As per PHD, district’s active cases were 80,028 while put the number at 77,627. On April 21, the government had projected active cases at 1,23,680 by May 2, which is not likely to be the case as growth in cases has stabilized in last four days and number also declined on two days (April 26 and 27) by 3,631. There are 10,587 less active cases in the latest projection as compared to the previous one. This is probably due to halt in growth of cases. The district on Thursday registered 7,496 cases. There were 7,503 new cases a day ago. The cases in last two days are slightly less as compared with record new high of cases registered between April 21 and 25. Cases were 37,828 in these five days for a daily average of 7,566. The district reported 89 patients on Thursday. Though high, the fatalities too have stabilized. As per projection, nine of remaining 10 districts of Vidarbha are likely to face severe shortage of beds. Amravati district is the only from Vidarbha and third after Mumbai and Jalgaon to have surplus beds. After Nagpur, Chandrapur district is facing severe crisis of beds. As per projection, active cases in Chandrapur are likely to rise from existing 26,613 to 40,428 by May 11. The district is likely to face shortage of 22,187 beds, of which 16,995 in CCCs, 3,989 beds with oxygen supply, 954 in ICU and 249 beds with ventilators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/from-80k-now-active-cases-of-dist-may-reach-1-13l-in-12-days/articleshow/82316945.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The theme seems to indicate that any discussion on leadership issues raised by the G-23 dissenters is pretty much settled. “Rajiv nahin, Sonia hi nahin, Bharat ka beta Rahul hai,” the theme song says as the collage moves through cities and villages, with Rahul at the heart of it. INC TV - Congress theme song for 2024 ElectionIn a flux for around two years after the defeat in the 2019 elections and Rahul’s resignation as party president, the leadership issue in the party will rear its head again as the Congress Working Committee will hold its presidential elections in June. The party has not formally announced if the Gandhi scion will contest though his aides have claimed he has dropped his reluctance to take back the party reins. However, the Covid-19 surge has raised questions over whether the party will be able to hold a convention to settle the leadership issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/video-on-congress-channel-says-rahul-is-need-of-the-country/articleshow/82319428.cms||---

It should recognise which population groups can be given shots on priority in May, June, July and so on,” Salunke said. “The 12-crore population in the state cannot be covered in a short period of time. So, a sequential or staggered approach needs to be worked out, based on certain criteria,” said Salunke, stressing that the available doses could be used for those who need vaccination the most. Salunke said that though this was an alternative, many options could be looked at to continue with the drive in the face of the current shortage of vaccines. “Senior citizens, those with comorbidities and those whose second doses are due could also be given priority. It is necessary for the state to involve all stakeholders in the drive — private doctors and clinics, paediatricians, general practitioners and private health centres — whosoever is in a position to give the vaccine. A proper monitoring mechanism must be established to tackle issues like cold chain, logistics, misuse of vaccines and wastage at taluka, village and ward levels, among others,” he said. Om Shrivastav, consultant, infectious diseases, and a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said, “The government will have to prioritise who they think are the most vulnerable and need to be vaccinated first — healthcare workers, frontline workers or senior citizens. A vision must be set in terms of groups to be given the vaccine on priority, the number of vaccine doses needed for people in these groups and the likely time to complete their inoculation.” Pune district’s vaccination data (till April 28) showed that only 14% of those above 60 years (1.37 lakh of around 10.06 lakh people in this age group) have received both vaccine doses, while 3% of the 17.48 lakh people in the 45-59 age group have received the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/prioritise-popn-groups-for-vax-covid-advisor/articleshow/82316974.cms||Neha Madaan

Patients or their families can log into the portal and apply for beds by uploading the Covid-positive report. This could bring respite to residents, who have been running from hospital to hospital or calling up the Swasthya Bhawan helpline, desperately looking for beds. “The Swasthya Bhavan helpline is inundated with calls. Many are complaining they are unable to reach the number. This new portal on beds will hopefully help people as they will be able to see the number of vacant beds and apply for admission,” said a senior health official. Senior health department officials held a meeting with all private hospitals, who were told to update their bed status, based on vacancies. Government Covid hospitals, too, were asked to engage data-entry operators who would keep updating the portal with bed availability. Called the West Bengal Integrated Covid Management System, health officials said the government initiative was aimed at facilitating better monitoring and coordination of patient admission. “In addition to data on beds, efforts are also being made to provide information on oxygen, by tracking production and distribution, stock at different hospitals and their requirements,” said the official. Anyone looking for a hospital bed will have to open https://excise.wb.gov.in/CHMS/Portal_New_Default.aspx. Once the webpage opens, users will come across an option, showing the availability of beds. A click on the button will direct users to the district, in which they are looking for treatment. Once the district is selected, a list of hospitals, both private and government, will come up, based on the availability of beds. Applicants will get an option to fill an online admission form for each hospital. They will have to register with a mobile number where an OTP will be sent for verification. Unlike the centralised Swasthya Bhaban helpline, this portal will have the individual helpline of every hospital, where patients or families can also call up. The portal will also have information on ambulance and its availability. The centralised helpline will be operational simultaneously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-launches-portal-for-real-time-info-on-cov-beds/articleshow/82316278.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The incident was reminiscent of the death of Subhasree, a 23-year-old Chennai techie in September 2019. The accident took place at Thiruvonam village when the woman was returning from a condolence meeting. S Vijayarani from Pudukottai district was returning on a relative’s bike when a condolence flex banner on the roadside crashed on her, knocking her down and causing severe head injury. She was rushed to Thanjavur medical college hospital in an ambulance. Her condition worsened on Thursday and she died in the afternoon. According to Thiruvonam police, one Ravichandran had erected a banner on the roadside for the inauguration of the portrait of his father Muthuveerappan who died a few days ago. Ravichandran was booked for erecting a flex board, which is banned by law, and subsequently arrested. Further investigation is on. The incident is the latest in a series of accidents that have claimed the lives of innocent citizens. Two years ago, a 24-year-old software engineer had come under the wheels of a water tanker near Pallikaranai in Chennai after being knocked off her bike by a flex banner erected for the marriage of the son of a political party’s functionary. Similarly, K Ragupathy, 32, lost his life in 2017 in Coimbatore when he was run over by a corporation truck after his bike slammed into an arch put up for a function. While Madras high court has banned the erection of flex banners on roadsides and other places, police say the violation has been rampant in interior villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-woman-dies-after-hoarding-crashes-on-her/articleshow/82316971.cms||---

But a delay in sanctioning these posts has delayed taking over of the newly-declared forest area by SGNP. G Mallikarjuna, SGNP director, said the posts will be sanctioned soon. In March state Dairy Development Department (DDD), the landowner, had asked state revenue and forests departments to exclude five acres and take over the 795 acres declared as forest. DDD claimed it had earmarked the five acres for a police station as Aarey Colony police station functions out of a residential complex. “Unless we have dedicated staff to patrol and protect the area we cannot take over. These are permanent posts, and government needs to either create new posts or divert these posts from other place to SGNP,” said sources. Since the beginning of this year, there have been fires at Aarey Colony. Activists pointed out that these fires occur repeatedly in certain areas. Once the area is cleared of foliage, encroachments take over.

---||Delhi||LG order clarifies how govt in Delhi will function||NEW DELHI: A day after the Centre notified the Government of NCT of Delhi (Amendment) Act, which changes the functioning of the government in the capital, the lieutenant governor issued an order on Wednesday that clarifies how the government in Delhi will function from now on. The order, signed by the principal secretary to the lieutenant governor, Bhupinder S Bhalla, in the name of the LG and in exercise of the powers conferred by the Act, specifies the matters for obtaining the LG’s opinion before taking any executive action in pursuance of a decision of the council of ministers or a minister to exercise powers of government. The order covers matters falling under any law, made by Parliament or extended to the National Capital Territory of Delhi by the central government, with respect to any subject under the State or the Concurrent list of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. It includes matters falling under any law made by the Delhi assembly that has direct or indirect effect on any of the subjects on which the lieutenant governor is to act in his discretion like those related to police, public order, land and services. The order also pertains to making of subordinate legislations i.e. rules, regulations, schemes, bylaws; establishment, constitution or re-constitution of statutory bodies such as authority, board, committee, commission; matters relating to recommendations of Delhi Finance Commission constituted under Delhi Finance Commission Act, 1994; grant of parole under Delhi Prisons Act, 2000; and matters specified under Rule 23 of Transaction of Business of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Rules, 1993. According to sources, the administrative decisions of the elected government of Delhi now may not be implemented as fast as earlier because the files will be sent to the LG for his nod and the decisions can be implemented only after his approval. The amendment also seeks to ensure that the business in the assembly is conducted in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha. This provision will put an end to any scope for criticising any leader or person who is not a member of the House. In the past, there have been several instances where names of top central government ministers were taken in the Delhi assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lg-order-clarifies-how-city-govt-will-function/articleshow/82317915.cms||---

Nitesh Jaiswal, the complainant, approached cybercrime police on Wednesday. He said that a man identified as Flower contacted him on a social media messaging site. Jaiswal said that Flower subsequently phoned him through the messenger and invited him to invest in a website, promising huge profits. Jaiswal said that Flower claimed to run a commodity trading business. Flower asked Jaiswal to create a profile on the website. Flower then gave Jaiswal an account number. Jaiswal paid various sums ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh; in all, he paid Rs 4.70 lakh. Flower then pushed Jaiswal to invest more. But Jaiswal refused to do so and asked Flower to return his money. But Flower threatened Jaiswal with dire consequences and even sent Jaiswal a photograph of himself holding a pistol. Jaiswal then lodged a complaint on April 2 and on April 9, found that Rs 4.70 lakh had been deposited to his State Bank of India account. On Wednesday, Jaiswal lodged a complaint stating that he was not given the assured profits and thus Flower had breached his trust.

Having quirky sketches and fun illustrations, couples are preferring to ditch the traditional (paper) invites and sending digital invites. Gone are the days when traditional paper invites were sent to guests to attend marriage with full details. With the changing times and the ongoing corona pandemic, city residents are preferring digital invitations with the help of illustrators to draw sketches and cool illustrations. “Earlier, families who solemnized the weddings of their sons and daughters used to have one traditional paper card, mainly for relatives, friends and colleagues. But during second wave of corona pandemic, instead of traditional wedding cards, these customised digital wedding invites are preferred by everyone. In current senario, wedding e-cards have become the only medium to invite guests in the city,” said Varun Jaiswal, graphic designer and illustrator. “We are also adding elements like holy symbols or creative illustrations on the e-cards for both families and the couples,” he added. The popularity of digital cards increased during last year and digital cards are now being illustrated on three formats. Majority of digital card seekers want to mention only names of bride and groom along with venue of marriage while some prefer to use the photograph of bride and groom. Old city resident Pankaj said, “As we have invited limited number of guest for marriage of my brother, I preferred the wedding e-card to invite my few relatives and friends from city and Lucknow.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/couples-prefer-cool-e-cards-to-invite-guests-to-wedding/articleshow/82316777.cms||---
---||Patna||No jabs for 18+ in Bihar from May 1 as state yet to get vaccines||PATNA: The much-awaited Covid-19 vaccination for the 18 to 44 age group is unlikely to start in Bihar from May 1 as the state government is yet to get the vaccines it had ordered. After facing glitches initially, several people succeeded in getting registered on the CoWin portal. However, they have not been given a slot for vaccination. Though the registrations will continue, they will not get the date and timing unless the state receives the Covishield vaccine supply from the Serum Institute of India (SII). The state health department special secretary, Manoj Kumar, said they had ordered one crore vaccine doses from SII. Like Bihar, several other states had also placed bulk orders. “Because of bulk orders from many states, they have asked us to give monthly requirements,” Manoj said. He further said a high-level meeting was held with the Centre on Thursday to discuss this issue after which the Centre decided to allocate a quota to states as per the number of beneficiaries. However, the health department special secretary made it clear that there was no indication of the vaccination drive starting from May 1 and everything depended on the availability of vaccines. Not only the arrival of vaccines but creating more session sites is also a challenge for the state health department, which is already reeling from the spike in Covid-19 cases, and many healthcare workers getting infected. Manoj said the vaccines would be given at the primary health centres and urban primary health centres, and a few private hospitals. However, he did not provide the details of the number of session sites that need to be set up for vaccinating people in the 18-45 age group. At present, vaccination is underway at 1,500 session sites in Bihar, and there is no chance of taking it down to the grass-root level. Health officials accepted that there is a manpower crunch and most healthcare workers are involved in tackling the Covid-19 cases, while several of them were themselves infected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-jabs-for-18-in-bihar-from-may-1-as-state-yet-to-get-vaccines/articleshow/82316287.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Without giving any fresh date pertaining to when the list of students, selected through lottery, would be declared by the 1,200 odd KVS spread in 25 regions of the country, the headquarter has said that the same would be done after April 30. KVS had given its green signal for online registration for admission to Class I (for the academic year 2021-22) from April 1. The registration, which opened at 10am on April 1 continued till 7pm on April 19.Likewise, registration for Class II and above was done from April 8 to April 15, subject to vacancies in the respective KVS. It was informed that the first list of provisionally admitted students would be declared by the respective schools on April 23. However, the same was not done as almost all the schools were closed owing to Covid related restrictions across the country. Later, on April 28, the Joint Commissioner (Academics) of KVS, Priya Thakur, issued a letter to deputy commissioners of all the 25 regions of KVS, informing them that the declaration of Class -1 admission should be done after April 30 (instead of April 23), depending on the situation. “As of now, the list of selected students (provisional) would be declared after April 30, the precise date has not be announced by the higher authorities as the same would be decide as per the prevailing conditions after April 30”, said principal of KV AFS Manauri, Shalini Dikshit.

For admission in class IX, the DCs have been told that admission for class IX should be done on the basis of priority category and admission test will not be conducted for the same. “The earlier instructions, regarding admission in class 1, also told us that under the present situation of Covid-19, the directions issued by competent authority (Central/State/Local) are to be followed and given the present worsening condition of the pandemic, seems like the schools will have to wait a bit and not take any decision in haste,” said the principal of KV IIIT, Jhalwa, Vijeyesh Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/class-i-admission-put-on-hold-in-kvs-due-to-rising-covid-cases/articleshow/82316759.cms||---

For four months the government has been dithering on a proposal to build a trial track for Metro III, for which a two-acre plot with 16 trees inside Aarey will be required.TOI has learnt that a letter seeking state sanction was sent by Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) in January. “Due to sensitivities surrounding Aarey green zone and MVA’s decision to shift the Metro car shed out of here, the state has been sitting on the proposal. Few meetings were held to discuss the proposal, but no one wants to take a decision as it involves cutting 16 trees,’’ Mantralaya sources said.The sources said with relocation of the car shed to Kanjurmarg unresolved, the Colaba-Seepz Metro III could face more hurdles and delays.On January 11, MMRC managing director Ranjit Singh Deol wrote to the state about conducting 10,000-km trial runs of the Metro train. Official sources said two trains consisting of eight coaches each are expected by December-end. MMRC wants to keep infrastructure for the trial run ready before the trains arrive. For this, it requires the Aarey plot as an entry/exit point for trains to get in and out of tunnels. “A temporary unloading, assembling, stabling and maintenance facility will be needed within the overall ground portion to conduct 10,000-km trial runs for the first train of Line III…,’’ said the letter. MMRC said it has permission to transplant the 16 trees.“With the government unable to decide, problems are multiplying for the project,’’ said a Mantralaya source. Although 95% of the Metro III tunneling work is complete, the controversy over the car shed threatens to delay the project.The government decision to shift the Metro III car shed depot from Aarey to Kanjurmarg is pending in court. “MMRDA applied for vacating the stay on the Kanjur depot last February. Since then, the government has only sought dates from court,’’ said a senior official.He added that keeping the depot in limbo is detrimental to the functioning of the Metro line. “This problem is not only of Aarey or Kanjurmarg. The same problem is with every Metro line. There are no depots planned or available for Metro VII, VI, IV or II. Only one temporary depot has been arranged till now at Charkop for Metro IIA & VII. But this is only a temporary fix with long-term problems,’’ he said.Early this year, a state government-appointed panel said an integrated Metro depot at Kanjurmarg will save the government Rs 1,580 crore against land and construction costs.The panel’s report said that while the Aarey plot can accommodate 30 rakes, Kanjurmarg is large enough to hold 55.The nine-member panel said the 41-hectare Kanjurmarg plot is big enough to be an integrated depot for three Metro lines: III, IV and VI. The 20-page report mentioned that “if the integrated depot is planned at Kanjurmarg, an interchange station of Line XIV and Line VI can be proposed at Kanjurmarg, facilitating better interchange between Lines III, VI and XIV.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-govt-dithers-on-plan-for-metro-iii-trial-track-at-aarey/articleshow/82317936.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Varanasi||Violence in Ghazipur village after pradhan candidate’s son shot at||Times News Network Varanasi: In violence on a day ahead of polling for panchayat election, the house and vehicles of former gram pradhan was set on fire after son of a pradhan candidate was shot at in a group clash on late Wednesday night at Gaura village in Sadat area of Ghazipur district. In another incident of violence, police vehicles were damaged in a clash between the supporters of two candidates during polling in Birno area of the district on Thursday. IG Varanasi range SK Bhagat, who camped in Ghazipur to monitor the poll process said, the youth who suffered bullet injuries was admitted to a hospital in Varanasi and his condition was now stated to be stable. Four accused had been arrested in this connection, he said. In Birno violence case, several persons of both the rival groups have also been taken under custody. Apart from these two incidents no other major disturbance was reported from any other place in Ghazipur. Further investigation and action in the violence reported in Gaura village and Birno area would be initiated by the police after completing the process of panchayat polls including deposition of ballet boxes. In Gaura village under Sadat police station, the supporters and relatives of two candidates for gram pradhan election- Nandlal and Bindu Banvasi clashed on late Wednesday night. The supporters of Banvasi allegedly raided Nandlal’s house and after thrashing his son, Mahavir, they opened fire on him and fled the scene. Angered over it, Nandlal’s supporters attacked the house of former gram Pradhan Manoj Singh, who is extending support to Banvasi. After attacking Singh’s house, the angry mob of Nandlal’s supporters set his house, tractor and a SUV on fire. Singh and his family members somehow managed to escape from the rear door of their house to save their lives. On getting information, Sadat police reached the spot and dispersed the mob. Fire fighters were pressed into service to douse the flames. Injured Mahavir was initially rushed to a local hospital from where doctors referred him to Varanasi in view of his serious injuries. ASP City Gopinath Soni said that many persons have been taken under custody for interrogation in this connection during the night long operation of the police. In another incident, violence was reported in Nasratpur village under the limits of Birno police station after a clash between supporters of two candidates of gram pradhan election. When SO Birno, along with heavy police force and PAC personnel reached the spot to calm the situation, both the groups started pelting stones on the police vehicles also. In the attack, three police vehicles were damaged while some cops also suffered injuries. Police used force to pacify situation and also took some persons from both the groups under custody. In a minor clash in Kaneri village of Sadat area, two groups came face to face on the issue of alleged fake voting. Minor disputes and altercations during the poll process were reported in other villages too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/violence-in-ghazipur-village-after-pradhan-candidates-son-shot-at/articleshow/82316676.cms||---

---||Chennai||Second surge: Madras high court faults Centre, flags ad-hoc steps, expert advice||CHENNAI: Irked over its poor preparedness to tackle the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Madras high court on Thursday questioned the Centre as to what it was doing for the past 10 to 15 months. The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said: “Why are we acting only now in April, this will help only in July. Despite having almost a year-long lockdown, see the situation we are in.” When additional solicitor-general R Shankaranarayanan representing the Centre said the government did not expect a second wave in the country, the court retorted: “Do you (the Centre) even consult an expert on such issues! We did not mean to disrespect anyone.” “I have never met a respectable doctor who advised me to drop the guard,” the Chief Justice said. There cannot be ad-hocism in dealing with a pandemic and the Centre should have acted in a planned and informed manner with expert advice, the court said. The bench made the observations on a suo motu public interest writ proceedings initiated to check the preparedness of the state to tackle the second wave and availability of oxygen, beds, drugs and ventilators to treat Covid patients. Earlier, Tamil Nadu advocate-general Vijay Narayan said the state had decided not to implement lockdown on May 1, as suggested by the court, as it is not necessary because it was already a holiday. Moreover, vaccination of people in the age group of 18-45 commences on May 1, he said, adding: “We cannot restrict movement of those who have enrolled for vaccination.” As to May 2, the counting day, it falls on Sunday which is already a curfew day, he said. However, to restrict crowding, the state has planned to close some shops, including meat shops, on May 1, he added. Recording the submissions, the court directed the AG to ascertain how media persons, particularly television media will be regulated at counting centres. “Their presence is imperative but given the number of television channels they themselves would be a crowd,” the court said. Appealing to the political parties to avoid mass gatherings and celebrations on the counting day, the court directed the AG to ascertain the availability of beds, drugs and oxygen and report the court on April 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/second-surge-hc-faults-centre-flags-ad-hoc-steps-expert-advice/articleshow/82316983.cms||Suresh Kumar
---||Kanpur||Team of doctors able to maintain SPO2 of patients with reduced oxygen flow||Jhansi: Amid sever oxygen crisis, a group of doctors in Jhansi Medical College have devised a system by which they are able to save a lot of oxygen, while also providing better treatment to Covid patients. Dr Anshul Jain, nodal officer for Covid-19 hospital at Jhansi Medical College, who is also the leader of this team of doctors, informed that the team has modified the existing Bain circuit, a device widely used for administering anaesthesia. Adding a few simple devices to it, they have renamed the device as Co Bain circuit. As a result, the doctors are able to maintain the SPO2 (oxygen level) of patients with much reduced oxygen flow. Explaining its function, Dr Anshul told TOI that he has added a non-vented BiPAP mask into the existing device which can be fixed on the head of the patient with a circuit on the forehead. As a result, the carbon dioxide exhaled by the patient goes into the atmosphere through vented APL valve. On the other hand, when the patient inhales the humidified oxygen, it remains within the circuit. Now, if a patient requires 60 litres of oxygen, the same requirement can be fulfilled by using only 12-16 litres of oxygen. This helps in creating PEEP, which is essential for the oxygen therapy of Covid patients. Owing to the wide calibre of the circuit, minimal effort is needed in breathing. “We have recently used the technique on many of our patients who were not able to maintain oxygen saturation on NRBM and HFNO. In one such recent case, a 62-year-old woman was maintaining SPO2 of 82% at oxygen flow rate of 60 litres per minute. With the use of Co Bain circuit, her SPO2 was being maintained as 94% at a flow rate of 16 litres per minute. The circuit quite economical and costs only Rs 2,000. This can prove to be very useful in saving oxygen, while also giving desired results,” added Dr Jain. The other team members include Dr Narendra Singh Senger, principal of Jhansi Medical College, Dr Zaki Siddiqui, Dr Ram Babu and Dr Brijendra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/team-of-doctors-able-to-maintain-spo2-of-patients-with-reduced-oxygen-flow/articleshow/82316283.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Rural polls final round: Turnout 75%, higher voting in west Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: The fourth and final phase of UP panchayat elections passed off peacefully with an average turnout of over 75%. There were, however, reports of chaos at polling booths at Sonbhadra and Mathura. The poll percentage was relatively moderate due to the second wave of the pandemic and the first three phases too witnessed an average 73% polling. With this, curtains were drawn on rural local bodies’ elections considered the semi-final before the high-stakes assembly elections next year. Counting will be held on May 2. All political parties, especially BJP had thrown its weight behind the panchayat polls to step up their rural outreach. As per official figures of state election commission till 5 pm, turnout was higher in the west UP region with Sambhal recording the highest turnout of over 78%. The district has 35 zila panchayat wards, 852 kshetra panchayat wards and 670 gram panchayats. Hapur, Farrukhabad, Mathura and Aligarh registered around 75%, 74%, 73% and 72%, respectively. Shahjahanpur, which is represented by senior BJP leader and cabinet minister Suresh Khanna, recorded 76% voting.In all, polling was done in 17 districts covering 738 zila panchayat wards, 18,356 kshetra panchayat wards and 14,111 gram panchayats. This phase accounted for 2.98 crore voters who were to exercise their franchise in 48,554 polling booths. Ambedkarnagar, a citadel of Mayawati-led BSP, clocked a moderate polling of over 70% while Mau, the pocket borough of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, recorded a turnout of over 71%%. Even Ghazipur, which is represented by Mukhtar’s brother Afzal Ansari in the Lok Sabha registered 72% polling. Election commission data show that east UP witnessed lesser turnout with districts like Kaushambi and Kushinagar recording around 67% and 70% polling, respectively. Basti, however, recorded 73% polling, which was relatively higher in comparison to other east UP districts. Basti has 43 zila panchayat wards, 1,077 kshetra panchayat wards and 1,185 gram panchayats. Sonbhadra in Vindhyachal region and Banda in Bundelkhand saw only 66% and 62% voting. Sitapur, which has maximum number of rural local bodies in this phase, recorded 73% polling till last reports came in. The district with a sizable percentage of OBCs and SCs, is represented by BJP’s Rajesh Verma in the Lok Sabha. Verma is also chief of UP unit of BJP OBC Morcha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rural-polls-final-round-turnout-75-higher-voting-in-west-up/articleshow/82317918.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Delhi||Ambulances break hearts with extortionist rates, Delhiites demand cap||NEW DELHI: Calamities bring out the worst in people. This is so evident in fares being charged by ambulances to ferry critical Covid patients to healthcare facilities — Rs 10,000 for a 4-km trip, Rs 42,000 for a round trip from Model Town to Radha Soami Covid centre in south Delhi and an hourly Rs 5,000 for the use of oxygen installed in the ambulance. The situation is so dire, however, that the suffering citizens have no option but to line up with open wallets. There is a demand now that Delhi government cap the per kilometre rate that ambulances can charge as is being done in states such as Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. In Rajasthan, the rate for bigger ambulances has been fixed at Rs 17.50/km. In normal times, the cost of ambulance use in Delhi is Rs 500 for first 5km and then Rs 50-60/km after that. TimesViewProfiteering of any kind during the worst health crisis faced by the city in over a century is criminal. The government must put a cap on hiring charges. Those breaking the law should be arrested.When the oxygen level of Prateek Goel’s neighbour dropped to a precarious level, the family had to arrange his shift to hospital. The drive from Model Town in north Delhi to Radha Soami Satsang Covid centre in Chhatarpur, a distance of 42km, cost Rs 20,000. Said Goel: “It was only a basic ambulance, not one with ICU facilities. And then, after spending so much, we found the Chhatarpur centre did not have the amenities required by our patient and we had to bring him home. The ambulance charged us Rs 22,000 for the return journey.” Goel said some mechanism had to be created to regulate ambulance rates and halt the fleecing. Sanjeev Chowdhary would agree. He reported how a US-based friend’s relative had not only to pay an advance of Rs 5,000 to move the patient from Mayur Vihar 12 km to ESI Hospital in Okhla but was quoted a total charge of Rs 25,000. “The driver said he would come only after Rs 5,000 was paid through an e-wallet. Then, on reaching the residence, the driver said oxygen would cost an additional Rs 5,000 an hour.” On social media, IPS officer Arun Bothra shared a receipt given by DK Ambulance Service for payment of Rs 10,000 to take a patient from Pitampura to Fortis Hospital, a 4km distance. On contacting DK Ambulance Service, a staffer nonchalantly said, “We did charge that amount, but because we had provided an attendant.” Another ambulance provider quoted a price of Rs 15,000 to take a patient from Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, to Sarita Vihar. He defended himself, saying, “You have to wait for four hours to get an ambulance. The rates have increased because our ventilator vans have been taken over by Delhi government for its 102 ambulance helpline.” Several calls to 102 by TOI elicited no response. Driving patients out of Delhi is equally daunting. Ravinder had to take her oxygen-deficient husband to a hospital in Mohali, Punjab, after failing to find a bed in Delhi. She paid Rs 35,000 for the trip. “I didn’t consider the cost since I was happy at getting an ICU ambulance with an attendant,” said the Malkaganj resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ambulances-break-hearts-with-extortionist-rates-delhiites-demand-cap/articleshow/82317941.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Chandigarh||Mohali unit supplying O2 outside dist sans requisition||Mohali: The oxygen monitoring committee has found some flaws in a unit supplying oxygen to various hospitals in Mohali and its nearby areas. The unit was found supplying oxygen out of the district without requisition from hospitals and also without having consent from the office of deputy commissioner. The team also checked the quantity of the oxygen filled in cylinders, following complaints from buyers regarding underweight cylinders. The team directed the unit owners that there should not be any diversion from the quantity of oxygen to be sent for medical purpose. It should be ensured that cylinders are filled with oxygen to the full capacity. In order to audit the stock and supply of oxygen in the district, on the directions of deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan, a team headed by ADC (D) Rajiv Gupta along with Gmada estate officer (EO) Paviter Singh, SP Harbir Atwal and Surinder Garg AETC, Mohali, inspected Hi-Tech industries from where medical oxygen is being supplied to 14 hospitals of the district. The team took a detailed review of stock of supplies of oxygen being received by the Hi-Tech Industries and corresponding distribution to different hospitals. “The district administration is working round the clock to ensure timely supply of oxygen to patients,” said the ADC. Dayalan said, “Medical oxygen has become a critical requirement for management of ‘moderate’ and ‘severe’ Covid-19 cases, so an ‘advisory for oxygen saving strategy in ICU/wards’ for optimum use of oxygen at all government and private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients has been issued.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-unit-supplying-o2-outside-dist-sans-requisition/articleshow/82317945.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC completes 330 metres’ tunnel work for coastal road||MUMBAI: BMC has completed 330 metres of tunneling work of the underwater twin tunnels, which are a crucial part of the 9.98km coastal road. The two tube tunnels start near Girgaum Chowpatty in South Mumbai, run below Chowpatty, passing below Tambe Chowk, Khilachand Garden, Malabar Hill reservoir of BMC, Hanging Garden and Hyderabad Estate at Nepean Sea Road before emerging at Priyadarshani Park. Being built using the cut-the-cover construction method, while the actual tunnel will be only 1.9km, including the entire entry and exit portions, its length will run up to 3.4km. Meanwhile, BMC said that for the first time the coastal road will be built using single pillar technology. Officials said that the road is being built on 176 single pillars using a mono-pile system wherein a single solid column is erected from bottom to top, instead of a group pile, where there are four pillars under each. The process of erection of three test columns has started on the beach near Madhav Thackeray Chowk on Abdul Ghaffar Khan Road in Worli. Erection of these columns is expected to be completed by July-end. However, construction work of the actual pillars to be erected will start after the monsoon. The machinery required to use single-column technology has been imported from Europe BMC said that if these 176 pillars were to be erected using the traditional multi-pillar method, 704 pillars would have to be erected at sea level for each pillar. Apart from this taking more time and being expensive, it would have occupied more seabed space. However, the pillars were erected using single column technology, in which there will be a single pillar from bottom to top. The diameter of each of the 176 pillars to be erected will be 2.5 metres, 3 metres and 3.5 metres each, while the size of the columns is being determined according to the needs. The total height of these columns below and above ground will be around 18 metres. In February, the civic budget had made a provision of Rs 2,000 crore for the coastal road project compared to last year’s Rs 1,600 crore. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 12,721 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-completes-330-metres-tunnel-work-for-coastal-road/articleshow/82317968.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: A month into second wave, beds become available for walk-in patients||NAGPUR: After over a month of acute bed shortage, many Covid hospitals in the city were a relieved lot in the last two days. Many of them are now able to admit walk-in patients, who were until now being turned away from the closed gates at every hospital as the crisis raged on over the past four weeks. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) data too showed availability of over 176 beds, including 16 in ICUs, on Thursday evening. Though over 50,000 cases were reported in last seven days, only some 500 needed admission. As on date, 9,248 patients are admitted against approximately same number of beds. Mildly symptomatic to moderate patients staying at home, and opening of Covid Care Centres in hotels, are largely being seen as the major reasons for vacant beds. However, ICU and ventilators continue to remain full at most places. Yet, the sudden dip has baffled doctors as the district continues to report high cases. Some also warned that it may be a short-lived breather, and hospitalization rate would go up again. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said the wait period has decreased. “From around 40, we now have 3 to 4 patients waiting in Covid casualty. We receive patients from not just the city but also neighbouring states,” he said. Kunal Hospital director Dr Shishir Shrivastava said that there is a slight dip in patient admissions. One reason could be that patients with SpO2 around 85 are being managed at home with oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators. He further added that cases seem to be plateauing. “We are able to accommodate a patient and offer him a bed comparatively easily in the last couple of days. The situation seems to have eased a bit, though ICU and ventilators still remain occupied,” he said. “Patients now rush to hospitals only when the oxygenation starts failing. For such patients, O2 support is not the only remedy, and they need to be given appropriate drugs as well. Some are going into cytokine storm at home,” he cautioned. He said that he has noticed that patients rush to hospital in panic when the patient is in critical condition. Such delay in seeking medical help can prove detrimental to recovery. He also wondered why the dip in admission queries was not reflecting in daily case numbers. Kingsway Hospital Covid unit head Dr Harshwardhan Bora said they are able to admit walk-in patients if they need a plain bed, has CT scan score between 10 to 12, high fever, and comorbidities. “A dip of 10% to 15% has been noticed in calls too,” he said. Dr Bora warned that admissions are likely to surge, since as per the prediction model cases would peak only by May-end. Seven Star Hosptial’s Dr Sadashiv Bhole said the pressure has eased but top hospitals still are under stress of critical patients. “We are getting only complicated cases. Many facilities have opened for mild to moderate patients, where 90% of them are recovering,” he said. Dr Tushar Gawad, director administration at Alexis Multispeciality Hospital, said there is marginal decrease in queries and that too for only ward beds. “In fact, demand for ICU and ventilator beds has increased. The queries going down are probably due to opening of CCCs in hotels. Patients feel this is backdoor entry to Covid hospitals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/a-month-into-2nd-wave-beds-become-available-for-walk-in-patients/articleshow/82317020.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Henceforth, we shall deal with miscreants ourselves without the police and the administration because we are not getting any help,” he said. General secretary Dr Adharsh Kankam condemned the recent attacks on the fraternity in Latur, Delhi and Aurangabad and demanded punishment for the guilty. Residents doctors displayed placards with messages like ‘Enough is Enough’, ‘No more tolerance to violence against the saviour’, ‘We are here to serve, not to suffer’ and No more Violence’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dont-take-doctors-for-granted/articleshow/82331882.cms||Ranjit Deshmukh
---||India||BJP is also sure it will form next govt in West Bengal||KOLKATA: The Bengal BJP chose not to read much into the exit poll predictions, saying huge turnouts in Bengal’s hinterland — despite Covid — indicated that people had decisively voted for a change. “Wait for two more days,” said Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu, in his initial reactions after the various exit poll results were published. “When you get to see the results, you will see BJP has won Bengal with a comfortable majority,” he added. State BJP leaders also said that various exit polls differed by over 50 when it came to the seat count; that meant that the “margin of error” was way beyond the 10%-15% mark, and unreliable to base any logical decisions on.  “BJP will win with a comfortable majority,” said Sisir Bajoria, the party spokesperson, adding, “I would not read much into the exit poll results, as between the highest seats given to BJP to the lowest, the gap is huge. It only shows the fallacy of these polls. In a state where the demography is so varied, a small sample size can never give a right prediction.” Did Covid pandemic have any impact? “This had impacted both BJP and Trinamool Congress,” he answered, adding, “The high turnout despite Covid in Bengal’s hinterland is an indication that people have decisively voted for change.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-is-also-sure-it-will-form-next-govt-in-west-bengal/articleshow/82319349.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government extends weekend curfew to 7 am on Tuesday||LUCKNOW: With the daily Covid count again climbing to 35,000 in Uttar Pradesh, the state government on Thursday announced extension of the weekend curfew by a day. The curfew will now be in place from 8 pm on Friday to 7 am on Tuesday. A government spokesperson said, the weekend curfew was successful in bringing down the daily corona tally. Chief secretary R K Tiwari also issued fresh guidelines for containment areas. Based on Centre’s guidelines, the government order stated it was necessary to implement control mechanisms in areas affected by the second pandemic wave. The state government had initially clamped a statewide night curfew, followed by a curfew on Sundays. And on April 20, the government converted it into a weekend curfew. The Allahabad High Court had directed the state government to impose a weeklong lockdown in six districts, which recorded high number of cases. The government, however, successfully challenged the order in Supreme Court, saying along with saving lives, its aim was to save livelihoods too.During the extended weekend curfew, the government will allow industrial activity, weddings, examinations and essential services. Continuous process industries and those involved in manufacturing of sanitisers, medical equipment and masks will be allowed to function. Movement of workers will be also be facilitated. The government also permitted marriages, subject to restrictions. A ceremony in the open can be attended by a maximum of 100 persons while a maximum of 50 persons will be permitted in closed spaces, on the condition that Covid-19 protocols were followed. For funeral services, the government allowed a maximum of 20 persons and state-run buses will be allowed to run with 50% capacity. Meanwhile, in containment areas, all social political, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious activities have been stopped. Shops, cinema halls, restaurants, bars, sports complex, gyms, spas, swimming pools and religious places will remain closed.

Principal secretary, medical education, Alok Kumar said following the instructions from the National Medical Commission, the apex body controlling medical education in the country, two types of oxygen support systems – liquid oxygen plants and air separation units – have been made mandatory for all medical colleges. “Work for liquid oxygen plants will also begin but it takes time. We hope to start separation units within two weeks,” he said. Kumar said more than 9,000 beds, including 6,000 isolation and over 2,700 intensive care, have been added in UP’s medical colleges. There are 24 government and 33 private medical colleges in the state. He said efforts were on to increase the number of RT-PCR tests being conducted every day. “While over one lakh RT-PCR tests were done in the last 24 hours, steps are being taken to increase this to two lakh per day.

The court said the offence was serious but there was every possibility the accused may fulfill his intention and tamper with prosecution witnesses and evidence if released on bail. The prosecution had submitted that the accused and woman were acquainted with each other, and she had rejected his pleas to start a romantic relationship. On October 26, 2020, at 9pm, the woman was on her way home when the accused allegedly tried to talk to her, but when she refused, he took out the knife and stabbed her three to four times on her stomach. The woman, who was hospitalised, suffered injuries on her hand when she tried to protect herself during the attack.

---||Patna||Patna HC fumes as state submits ‘contradictory report’ on oxygen capacity||PATNA: The Patna high court on Thursday orally observed that the state government was not befooling the court but itself after it submitted a report which was contradictory to an earlier report submitted six days ago over the daily need of oxygen in hospitals across the state for Covid-19 patients. Earlier, the state government had submitted that the Centre was not giving enough oxygen quota to the state. However, on Thursday a report was submitted that it was unable to procure the quota of 194 metric tonnes of oxygen per day due to the lack of tankers needed for transporting cryogenic oxygen. The division bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah was upset with the contradictory reports while conducting a hearing on the Covid-19 crisis in the state. The court observed that from now on, it would not wait to summon any senior government authority to clarify the situation but will pass stern adverse orders. Additional advocate general Anjani Kumar, appearing for the state, submitted that he was only reproducing the data made available to him by the advocate general’s office and he will get it reverified. The court also rapped the state government asking if it has enough cylinders to supply the oxygen to hospitals even if it is able to procure the daily quota of 194 metric tonne liquid oxygen fixed by the Centre to fulfil its need. At this point, the Centre’s additional solicitor general KN Singh submitted that the Centre is importing 1.02 lakh oxygen cylinders which would be provided to states. Though, he didn’t disclose any specific figure for Bihar. Singh also submitted that the Centre is ready with the daily quota of oxygen but it’s the state which is not able to lift it. Meanwhile, the committee of Dr Umesh Kumar Bhadani of AIIMS-Patna inspected the ESIC hospital at Bihta and apprised the high court that they need at least 10,000 litres of oxygen per day to operate the 100-bed Covid-19 facility. He compared the figure with AIIMS-Patna which needs around 30,000 litres of oxygen per day to treat around 300 Covid-19 patients. Dr Bhadani also submitted that the ESIC hospital lacks the supply of medicines from the state government and security arrangement. It also submitted that the ESIC hospital also doesn’t have its own laboratory to perform the test. After this, the high court directed the state government to look into establishing temporary laboratories there. Appearing for AIIMS-Patna along with Bhadani, counsel Binay Kumar Pandey submitted that they are ready to extend all necessary support to ESIC for starting the Covid-19 facility there as soon as the state government takes the initiative to sign an MOU with them. The court also asked the state about the status of setting up nine pressure-swing absorption plants for oxygen generation across the state on a war scale which includes two in Patna, one each at Bhagalpur, Madhepura, Pawapuri and Darbhanga. Counsels Mrigank Mauli and Sumeet Kumar Singh also appeared in the hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-fumes-as-state-submits-contradictory-report-on-oxygen-capacity/articleshow/82316291.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Questions raised over JMC-Heritage mayor’s donation drive plan||JAIPUR: The announcement by JMC-Heritage mayor Munesh Gurjar and the councillors to donate a month’s honorarium to the CM relief fund is being questioned by the opposition party as they were yet to receive six months’ honorarium. The mayor gets around Rs 22,000 per month while councillors get around Rs 3,750. However, none of them has received the amount since the board was formed in November 2020. In the first general body meeting of JMC-Heritage, a proposal to increase the honorarium of councillors was passed by the board, but it is yet to get a final nod from the state government. Ward 9 councillor Rajat Bishnoi said, “We have no objection on donating one month’s honorarium, but we must be paid the amount before we can give it. We have no idea when will it be given or how much will be given to us.” Ward 24 councillor Manak Sharma said that he was yet to know how much money he will get. “The mayor must clear our accounts first before expecting us to give donations,” he said. Reacting to these allegations, Gurjar told TOI that the money will be cleared and given to all councillors soon. On the issue of increased honorarium, she said, “The matter is to be decided by the state finance department. As of now, Rs 3,750 will be given to them.” Another issue the councillors are facing is getting their own offices, which was promised. More than half the councillors are functioning from home as there is shortage of government buildings where a councillor office can be set up where people can directly meet the councillor to solve their grievances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/questions-raised-over-jmc-heritage-mayors-donation-drive-plan/articleshow/82316351.cms||---

They will be given free of cost to the employees, their families and to contract labourers,” said a company official. Corporate houses have joined in the battle against Covid-19 by setting up temporary Covid-19 hospitals and ramping up the country’s oxygen supply and diverting industrial oxygen for medical use. Essar Ports & Essar Power, part of the infrastructure & energy vertical of Essar Group, has recently vaccinated over 600 employees at two of its assets – a port and power plant in Salaya, Jamnagar, Gujarat. The company employs 1,000 people between the bulk terminal and power project. “Since both the projects qualify under essential services category, we are implementing the entire exercise under the supervision with the district administration of the region. As you are aware, there is no age restriction in vaccinations due to essential services category,” said a senior company official. RIL has also announced its plans to vaccinate its employees and their family members above 18 years of age in May. The company recently announced setting up 1,000-bed Covid care facilities with oxygen supply in Jamnagar. All services will be provided free of cost to the citizens and the entire cost of setting up and running the facilities will be borne by Reliance. “A 400 beds Covid Care facility will be up and running at Government Dental College & Hospital in Jamnagar within a week. Thereafter, another 600 beds Covid Care facility will be made operational at another location in Jamnagar within the next two weeks’ time,” the company said in a statement. AM/NS India recently joined hands with the state government to set up a 1,000-bed hospital at Hazira, closer to its steel manufacturing facility from where it would supply oxygen. Tata Group has also planned to set up a Covid hospital in Gandhinagar. State-run Gujarat State Petroleum Corp and Torrent Group have vaccinated a large number of their employees above the age group of 45 so far.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cops bust 3 fake call centres, nab 10||MUMBAI: Busting three fake call centres that had recruited youths to dupe American nationals over phone, the police arrested 10 persons from the Malad-Goregaon belt. The arrested accused posed as pharma company representatives selling lifestyle drugs at a cheap rate or pretended to be techies providing internet services to boost online ventures of the victims. Each of these bogus call centres functioned separately. Forty-five computer hard discs were seized, besides 28 cellphones, routers and other equipment. Around midnight on Wednesday, the Malad police raided a setup at Ram Baug Lane where a group of youths had been recruited and given laptops. The accused had sourced phone numbers of US nationals from the dark web. The employees would make calls using voice over internet protocol (VOIP). They would pretend to be working with a pharma company and offered to sell medication for erectile dysfunction, such as Viagra, at very cheap rates. If the target agreed to buy, he was required to make payment via credit card. “We suspect the accused have an associate based in the US who accepted payments from targets in USD. We will probe how the money was sent to India,” said an officer. At the second enterprise, located on Malad Link Road, recruits called up Americans by posing as employees of a tech company specialising in internet services. They offered their services to their target so that his/her business portal would get more prominence when searched on an online search engine. Payments were to be made over the internet. At the third enterprise, employees again posed as pharma executives and offered to sell drugs for treating erectile dysfunction to the Americans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-bust-3-fake-call-centres-nab-10/articleshow/82318031.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Include pregnant, lactating women in vaccination drive: Experts||NAGPUR: Despite being recommended as safe and effective for all pregnant women by official bodies like the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Societies in India (FOGSI), Covid-19 vaccine is still not officially permitted for pregnant women in India. As vaccination for 18+ population starts from May 1, many women in 18-44 age group, who could be pregnant, are eager to know whether they should go for vaccination or not. “International professional bodies have taken a uniformly positive stand on the Covid vaccine in pregnancy and lactation. In fact, there are many benefits. But, in India, our government is yet to allow pregnant women to take the vaccines,” said veteran gynaecologist Dr Laxmi Shrikhande, who had been senior vice president of FOGSI and is now vice chairperson, Indian College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists (ICOG). The government of India has said pregnant women are excluded from taking the vaccine as Indian vaccine trials had no involvement of pregnant women. As a result, at present, there is no data on immunization of pregnant and lactating women with Covishield or Covaxin. But, worldwide, pregnant women were included in the trials and the outcomes were very positive and fine. A study in USA showed that Covid vaccination generates a robust immune response in pregnant and lactating women, which is equivalent to that in general population. “It may happen that a woman gets first dose of vaccine and later comes to know about her pregnancy. In such case, we don’t suggest termination of pregnancy at all,” added Dr Laxmi Shrikhande. Dr Alka Mukherjee, president of Nagpur Obstetrics and Gynaecologists Society (NOGS) told TOI that lactating women should also be considered as Covid vaccine candidates as there are no known adverse effects on the breastfeeding newborm. “In fact, there is passage of protective antibodies to the child, which may be a beneficial effect,” she said. “Women are eager to get vaccinated as it provides protection from the virus. They should be counselled to make their own decision to accept or refuse the vaccine,” she added. In its position statement released on the issue, FOGSI has recommended that obstetricians and gynaecologists and women’s health care providers should be allowed to administer the Covid vaccines to pregnant and breastfeeding women with preparations to manage adverse events. The federation has also suggested that there will be no serious side-effects of vaccine on pregnant and lactating women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/include-pregnant-lactating-women-in-vaccination-drive-experts/articleshow/82317054.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||India||IIT-B shows a way to produce oxygen from nitrogen generators||MUMBAI: The Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, has stepped in to offer a quick and simple solution to the oxygen crisis. The institute, in collaboration with Tata Consulting Engineers (TCE) Ltd, has successfully carried out a pilot project to convert nitrogen generator plants into oxygen generators, simply by replacing the molecular filters.  Conversion of existing nitrogen plants will take only around three to four days, unlike setting up a new oxygen plant for medical use that could take at least 45 days. And, these pressure swing adsorption nitrogen plants are available in abundance in industrial units across the country. Conversion of a decent-sized nitrogen plant will cost around 10-15% of the total cost of setting up a new oxygen plant. While the institute has validated the proof of the concept, the technology needs to be scaled up at multiple locations to help the country tide over the current emergency. An MoU was signed between IIT, TCE and Spantech Engineers (which deals with PSA nitrogen and oxygen plants) to finalise a standard operating procedure (SOP) to scale up the technology. The technology is proven and has been in use since the 1970s, said Amit Sharma, managing director, TCE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iit-b-shows-a-way-to-produce-oxygen-from-nitrogen-generators/articleshow/82319449.cms||Yogita Rao

The staffer is seen demanding money for releasing a body in the videograb and reasoning that the money is being demanded as per the ‘going rate’ for releasing bodies as the amount has to be shared among others. The video was shot by a patient’s relative on Wednesday with the aim of ‘exposing the inhuman face of the hospital staff’. “We can’t do it (lower the cost). We are not taking more from anyone, everyone has to give it. It’s not like we are demanding Rs 4,000- Rs 5,000. We are taking as per our rate and we are not taking alone, we have to share it with everyone,” says the hospital staffer in the video. Gandhi Hospital, meanwhile, is the nodal Covid hospital in the state and is the only accessible tertiary care centre for poor patients who come from all over the state for free treatment. “The incident came to my notice this evening (on Thursday) and immediately the person was identified. He has been removed from duty. An inquiry has been initiated and after proper inquiry, stringent action will be taken against any other persons involved as well,” said Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent, Gandhi Hospital. The staffer who is seen in the videograb had the task of packing the bodies as per Covid protocol, before they were released. “It damages the image of our institute and harms the people who are already in pain of losing their family members. This inhuman and unfortunate incident is very bothersome,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gandhi-hospital-staffer-took-bribe-to-release-bodies/articleshow/82317116.cms||Amrita Didyala

Taramani Devi, 43, a native of Sikar, Rajasthan, was donated a kidney by her husband in May. Her transplant took place at IKDRC on the Civil Hospital campus. In pre-transplant evaluation, she tested positive with no symptoms. The transplant took place 28days after both donor and recipient tested negative on RT-PCR. She was detected Covid-19 positive again on the second post-operative day after she complained of a cough. “She was admitted to a dedicated Covid unit as her inflammatory markers were raised. She never progressed to severe stages of the illness and was discharged after 5 days of remdesivir therapy,” said Dr Vivek Kute, professor of nephrology at the institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/transplant-patient-with-covid-relapse-treated/articleshow/82316423.cms||---

Given the obvious demand for medical consultation on Covid, the government should be using such senior doctors for a centralised helpline, point out several doctors in public facilities. “There are eight medical colleges in Delhi. There are at least 50 senior doctors, if not more, in each medical college, in the highest salary slab, who are currently not being able to help in the Covid effort. They could be roped in to run such a helpline by organising a centralised roster system with shifts. With minimal training on protocols and on teleconsultation for these doctors, the government could ensure that people do not get irrational and substandard advice from poorly trained general practitioners,” suggested a doctor in a central government hospital in Delhi. The central government increased the retirement age of doctors to 65 years in 2017 but those above 60 are generally not being put on active duty during the pandemic. Hence, there are a lot of senior doctors not on Covid duty but with a wealth of experience. A professor in one of the medical colleges said that he would be happy to do teleconsultations if the government would organise such a helpline. “It can be easily done from home and it could provide relief to hundreds of patients,” said the professor adding that more than half the senior faculty was managing departments remotely or mostly doing administrative duty as most departments were seeing a fraction of the patients they usually handled. AIIMS Delhi is already running a 24x7 national teleconsultation centre service called CONTec, but it is mainly for doctors and health workers from across the country on treatment protocols and treatment options for Covid. Volunteers who have been helping Covid patients have repeatedly called for a centralised helpline not only for bed allocation but also for medical management of patients at home. “Why can’t the Delhi government ensure a 24x7 helpline for medical consultation? The poor have no access to medical support, especially as they have lost their space in public hospitals. That way, their primary care will get taken care of,” said Jeevika Shiv, a lawyer and social worker volunteering to help Covid patients. She added that such primary consultations could be very important so that people didn’t come to the health system only when their oxygen level is dropping. “There are a lot of irrational prescriptions and unnecessary investigations being asked for by all kinds of doctors,” said another volunteer. However, a doctor in a Covid hospital cautioned that roughly 40% of Covid cases can be managed at home with teleconsultation. “About 10% will need ICU. The remaining 50% are in the grey area. If you ask them to stay at home and try to monitor remotely and if they deteriorate, they will blame the doctor, especially in the present condition when there are no beds to shift them to. So, it is a bit tricky,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/age-a-bar-but-senior-doctors-can-do-their-bit/articleshow/82317135.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19: Jignesh Mevani in Gujarat high court, seeks facilities in Vadgam||AHMEDABAD: Complaining that he feels “helpless and vulnerable” as the Covid-19 crisis worsens though he is an elected representative, Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani on Thursday approached the Gujarat high court seeking directions to the government to allow him to spend from his allocated MLA funds to create facilities for Covid treatment in his constituency. Saying that his constituency does not have any Covid facility, Mevani urged the HC to direct the government to permit him to set up an oxygen plant, a Covid testing facility at a strategic location, to provide ventilators and ensure necessary medical logistics including supply of remdesivir and tocilizumab injections. For this, the money may be spent from his annual MLA funds of Rs 1.5 crore.  As the district hospital at Palanpur cannot take more load in this recent Covid surge, he wants primary health centres and a community health centre in his constituency to provide Covid care. Through advocate Anand Yagnik, Mevani filed an application requesting the HC to allow him to join the litigation on Covid-19. He stated in his application that he has requested the chief secretary to spend Rs 30 lakh and directions are required to the authorities for quick relief to people in his constituency. He also urged the court to direct the Banaskantha district administration to buy oxygen concentrators and for PHCs and CHCs in his constituency from his MLA funds. Mevani stated that he “feels helpless and vulnerable even though he is an elected representative and he is unable to provide medical assistance to the people suffering from corona…”. He further stated, “If the funds meant for the applicant as an MLA are utilized towards setting up an oxygen plant with the help of competent and suitable agency, and if primary and community health centres are equipped with ventilators and other necessary medical logistics and equipment, besides oxygen, the constituency of the applicant will have an effective corona hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mevani-in-hc-seeks-facilities-in-vadgam/articleshow/82316363.cms||---
---||India||Max sum assured under EDLI scheme hiked to Rs 7 lakh||NEW DELHI: The labour ministry on Thursday notified the new Employees’ Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme, 2021 under which it has been decided to hike the maximum sum assured from the existing Rs 6 lakh to Rs 7 lakh, and for minimum sum assured to continue at Rs 2.5 lakh to member beneficiaries. The decision to this effect was taken in September 2020 during a meeting of the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) of the retirement fund body, where it was also decided to continue payment of minimum sum assured of Rs 2.5 lakh under the scheme beyond February 14, 2020. With the issuance of the gazette notification on Thursday, a senior labour ministry official said the hike in the maximum sum assured will be enforced immediately, while the provision of minimum sum assured of Rs 2.5 lakh will be applicable retrospectively from February 15, 2020. The ministry of labour and employment had on February 15, 2018 through a notification increased the minimum assurance benefit ceiling to Rs 2.5 lakh under the EDLI scheme for a period of two years, which had expired on February 15, 2020. To continue the benefits, the CBT had in September 2020 accorded approval to amendment of portions of the Employees’ Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI), 1976 to enhance the maximum assurance benefit to Rs 7 lakh from Rs 6 lakh. This amendment was aimed at providing additional assistance to families and dependents of members of the scheme in the event of their death while in service. In the meeting of the CBT in March 2020, EPFO trustees had recommended an extension of the provision of minimum assurance benefit of Rs 2.5 lakh to family members of deceased employees who died while in service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/max-sum-assured-under-edli-scheme-hiked-to-rs-7-lakh/articleshow/82319441.cms||Swati Mathur

Hospital authorities said they have reached their capacity. Dr Niyati Lakhani, medical superintendent of Gandhinagar Civil Hospital, said the decision to not admit new Covid patients was to ensure that existing patients don’t face any issues. “We stock for the patients admitted. We will admit new patients as we can sustain them on oxygen,” she said. Sources privy to the development said the hospital has 400 beds for Covid-19 patients of which 320 are for patients with high requirements of oxygen, and all the beds are full. Rumours were rife that Sola Civil Hospital had also stopped admitting patients for lack of oxygen. Dr Pina Soni, medical superintendent, said there was no lack of oxygen at the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/o2-shortage-gandhinagar-civil-halts-admissions/articleshow/82316373.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Oxygen shortage slows down Sodala flyover project work||JAIPUR: Work on Jaipur Development Authority’s (JDA) Sodala elevated road project again encountered a serious setback due to shortage of oxygen. Construction sites utilise hundreds of oxygen cylinders per day for building-related reinforcement work. However, as supply has been hit, the work continues to suffer. A senior JDA engineer said, “ In such a time, it will be inhumane to even think about oxygen utilised for construction. We are praying and hoping the situation improves and every needy gets oxygen.” Welding, gas cutting and fabrication work which require oxygen has been completely stopped. Though JDA is carrying out other work, after a point, work cannot proceed. An official said following a nod from North Western Railway (NWR), work to construct the Sodala elevated road portion over the Jaipur-Delhi railway crossing was going on. A senior official informed the JDA will launch three spans having a height of 36 feet over the railway crossing. Similarly, eight spans will be launched between Ram Mandir and railway crossing end. On Wednesday, the JDA launched two spans. The civic body had planned to complete the long-pending project by October-end. However, after the second wave hit the city, sources said the project would be operational in March 2022. Source said trained gas cutters and welders are migrating from the city. “Many labourers who were involved in welding related work are migrating in absence of work. It would take long to gather the momentum and restore the resources,” said a source. It was informed at the sites specialised labour is required as steel comes in the shape of squares. Cutting them and bridging them together is a very important activity in construction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/oxy-shortage-slows-down-sodala-flyover-project-work/articleshow/82316366.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court moved over Dhanvantari Hospital admission procedure||AHMEDABAD: This appears to a scene straight from Bollywood blockbuster Munnabhai MBBS, in which the protagonist objects to the mandatory filling of a form before treatment, while a patient is in critical condition. Looking at the commotion by attendants of Covid-19 patients for admission to the new 900-bed Dhanvantari Hospital at the GMDC ground on Thursday, the Gujarat high court was moved by a laywer and he reqeusted that the admissions procedure should be immediately done away with and all patients be treated upon arrival. Petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal took exception to the practice prescribed for admission to the hospital by which a form is required to be filled in the morning and token needs to be obtained for a Covid-19 patient. Once they receive a call, the patient is to be brought to the hospital for admission. The lawyer urged the court to hear the issue along with the suo motu PIL that it hears on the subject of the recent surge in Covid-19 cases. The petitioner cited observations made against the authorities’ reservations against admitting Covid patients, who reach corporation-run hospitals in private vehicles and not by 108 EMRI ambulances. AHMEDABADHe sought directions to the authorities to ensure that Covid-19 patients are not restrained by the government, corporation, designated or private hospitals from being immediately treated on reaching hospitals, if beds are available and to admit them on considering the condition of the patient. The petitioner urged the HC to direct the authorities to ensure that no patient remains unattended for treatment on the pretext of filling up forms and for want of a token. He sought immediate remedial action from the bureaucrats who manage the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-moved-over-dhanvantari-admission-procedure/articleshow/82316400.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Families opt for isolation as hospitals packed across Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Even though people bulk at the thought of wearing masks at homes, Niti Aayog’s advice has come as a shocking revelation for many people who hesitatingly took small risks of exposing themselves or their children to the outside environment. The fact that hospitals have run out of both beds and oxygen, the suggestion of wearing mask has not lost on people. In the past few days, many have made changes to their daily routine to reduce the risks. Some have given their maids fortnight paid leaves as an immediate precautionary arrangement, while others have stopped their children even to move inside the compound of their building. Relatives and friends coming home had been put on hold. Ramandeep Kaur, mother of two, said she has stopped sending her 9-year-old daughter to the park in front of their house. “I somehow manage to keep her inside the house throughout the day. But in the evenings, she insists on going out. It’s not a pleasant situation when she is denied,” said Kaur. She said unlike last time, Raja Park has been hard hit as there are more than 50-60 cases daily. “It’s not that the doctors or the government saying the virus is very infectious this time, but we are witnessing it in and around us,” added Kaur who is a non-practicing pharmacist. Before Niti Aayog member V K Paul made the comment, The Lancet journal carried a study two weeks ago attributing the current spread of the virus to the failure of the governments to treat it as predominantly airborne. Ashwani Gupta, 76, patriarch of a joint family in Malviya Nagar, said that the assessment of the Lancet journal does seem to have logic if one looks at the ferocity at which the virus is spreading. “That’s why I have stopped all my grandchildren (seven of them between 7-21-years of age) to go out. They were allowed to go for cycling on the road we live couple of months before the second wave started. We have also had mutual understanding among relatives and friends to postpone visits for sometimes,” said Gupta. People said it’s hard to know asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals who can also spread it unknowingly. Even a symptomatic domestic helps can also become a reason for infections. Hiral Jagad, a home maker in Mansarovar, said, “We have given paid leave to our maid for 15 days. If the situation does not improve, we will tell her to wait. Asymptomatic people pose a bigger risk.” She said it’s a scary situation out there and she cannot afford to lose guard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/families-opt-for-isolation-as-hospitals-packed-across-raj/articleshow/82316374.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The move comes due to the increasing movement of ambulances and other emergency vehicles, including oxygen tankers, amid spiralling Covid-19 cases in the city. As per the lockdown norms, only vehicles of the exempted category of people and goods and service providers can ply on the road. So, there could be long queues at pickets during checking by local police. These queues can waste precious time for emergency vehicles carrying patients or life-saving goods. A source said that police commissioner S N Shrivastava made the suggestion for a dedicated lane at pickets for such emergency vehicles. It will create a green corridor for the vehicles to reach their destination without wasting time in jams or queues. The step was implemented on Thursday, with barricades being put up in 15 police districts across Delhi, a police officer said. The officer said that staff at picket will allow only emergency vehicles to go through the lane. “Delhi Police stations were directed to dedicate a lane on the extreme left of road for ambulance and emergency vehicles, including oxygen tankers and cylinders,” commissioner Shrivastava tweeted. “This is done to facilitate such vehicles, while lockdown violators are prosecuted on regular lanes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dedicated-lanes-at-checkpoints-for-o2-tankers-ambulances/articleshow/82318057.cms||---

The hospital denied the charge and said the patients were critical and died due to "health complications". Kin of the patients sent a signed letter to the district magistrate (DM) on Thursday demanding a probe and action. They alleged that they were told in the morning by a staff nurse that oxygen supply was interrupted, which then led to the deaths. They also alleged that doctors had "run away from the hospital".Dr CP Singh, director of Bright Star Hospital, New Moradabad, said, “11 patients have died in the last 24 hours at the hospital. Those who died were critical patients of Covid-19 and passed away during treatment. There is no scarcity of oxygen and our oxygen plant is fully functional.”Moradabad district magistrate Rakesh Kumar Singh has ordered a probe. But he also said, “Patients who were put on ventilators would have also died had there been disruption in oxygen supply. But that did not happen. There is no evidence of scarcity of oxygen at the hospital so far. However, case files of the deceased are being thoroughly studied to ascertain the cause of deaths. A detailed probe has been ordered.”Meanwhile, additional director (health), Moradabad, Dr Vineet Shukla, said the patients had died due to infection. “After the complaint, a joint inspection was conducted by SDM (sadar) Prashant Tiwari and district surveillance officer DK Premi. Six patients died after 3am on Thursday. The records were checked. There is sufficient oxygen supply available at the hospital. It is clear that the patients, who were already critical, succumbed to infection during.”The distraught families were not convinced. Rajat Kumar Singh, a resident of Moradabad, said, “When I went to see my father at the hospital, there was panic all around. He was found lying unconscious. I asked everyone, but nobody told me what had happened to him. He had died.”Another patient’s brother said, “My brother was absolutely fine when I saw him last on Wednesday night. When I came to see him the next morning, he was gone.”Police in Moradabad have also launched a probe. Additional superintendent of police of Moradabad, Anil Kumar Yadav, said, “The deaths are being verified. Prima facie, there was no shortage of oxygen and the patients died as their condition was critical.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kin-at-pvt-hosp-in-up-say-15-patients-died-due-to-lack-of-oxygen/articleshow/82315667.cms||Maria Khan

Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani flagged off the ambulances from Gandhinagar in presence of senior health department officials. Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health & family welfare), said that the ambulances will be allocated to various districts and cities based on the caseload and existing fleet size. “The ambulances have been procured in a matter of one week at the cost of Rs 26 crore. Given the current scenario, all the ambulances will be equipped with oxygen supply and life-saving drugs. With the addition, the EMRI fleet would be 800,” said an official close to the development. EMRI officials said that at its peak, the service is handling 55,000 daily calls, or about one every two seconds. The call volume from centres like Ahmedabad increased manifold amid hospital diktat that they would only admit patients if they were brought by the EMRI 108 ambulances – a rule which was struck down after judicial intervention recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/150-ambulances-added-to-emri-108-fleet/articleshow/82316415.cms||---

While police said they will lodge an FIR after getting more concrete evidence, the hospital has initiated an internal inquiry through a committee to investigate the allegations. Police said there were five more patients in the ward where the woman had been admitted. The woman was admitted at around 4:30am on the fourth floor of the hospital on Wednesday after she complained of breathlessness. Though she had tested negative in the civil hospital, the woman was being treated for post-Covid complications. At around 5:30am when the family members called her, the woman told them that she was raped twice in the night. “She told me that a person approached her and inquired about her health. He then switched off the light, gagged and raped her. Thereafter, he remained seated in front of her till morning,” her relative claimed while talking to reporters outside the hospital on Thursday. When contacted, Dr. Radheshyam Trivedi, medical superintendent of the civil hospital said, “After speaking to the woman’s family, I have appointed an inquiry committee to probe the allegation. The committee consists of forensic and gynaec experts. We also informed the police and they are investigating separately.” Assistant commissioner of police (west) PK Diyora told TOI: “We will file an FIR once we get something concrete in our preliminary investigation. A woman cop has recorded her statement and we are also checking CCTV footage of the floor.

---||Rajkot||To stop hoarding, oxygencylinders to have barcodes||Rajkot: Inundated with complaints regarding shortage of oxygen, the Surendranagar district administration has now decided to barcode the oxygen cylinders. The decision has been taken with an aim to crack down on hoarding of oxygen cylinders. Officials suspect that around 1,000 cylinders are being hoarded by black marketeers at present. “The agency will paste a barcode on the cylinder before handing over it to the relatives of a Covid patient. This will generate an ID of the person in full details including name, contact number and residential address. A health department team will then visit the patients. On scanning the barcode the team will know when the cylinder was delivered and how much oxygen was used. This process will also help in studying the consumption pattern of oxygen,” K Rajesh district collector of Surendrangar said. The district administration has designated an agency to provide one jumbo or five mini oxygen cylinders to the Covid patients who are being treated at home. There are nearly 1,000 patients taking treatment in home isolation out of which around 320 are on oxygen. The district administration is providing nearly 275 to 300 oxygen cylinders per day to these patients. There are some NGOs and trusts that are also providing oxygen cylinders to the patients and administration will also keep a watch on that supply. Also, people don’t give back the empty cylinders after their requirement is over which results in shortage of empty cylinders. Officials claimed that this issue too can be addressed with the barcode system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/to-stop-hoarding-oxygencylinders-to-have-barcodes/articleshow/82315335.cms||---
---||Kolkata||+ve candidates reflect corona fear in 8th phase||Kolkata: The pandemic cast a shadow on the last day of the eight-phase poll in north Kolkata on Thursday. The deserted roads, people rushing back home for safety after casting votes, political parties facing trouble to put an agent at polling booths, complete absence of voters’ assistance booths put up by political parties beyond 100 meters of the polling stations — these were some telltale signs of how the fear of the pandemic stole the excitement and joy of the festival of democracy.  A poll veteran Sadhan Pandey and a political greenhorn Kalyan Chaubey did not leave the poll turf till the end, though Covid protocols left them cautious. Maniktala assembly constituency in north Kolkata saw septuagenarian Pandey of Trinamool Congress, an eight time MLA and former footballer Kalyan Chaubey of BJP trying to generate some excitement in an otherwise placid election, where everything else was “peaceful.” “Chaubey assaulted a lady councillor Sunanda Guha and held her by neck. He tried to influence voters when everything went on peacefully,” said Pandey. Kalyan Chaubey, on the other hand, alleged that his rival Pandey had engineered terror tactics to discourage voters from casting their votes. When he went to the booth after a BJP worker was assaulted, he was allegedly slapped and kicked. At Kashipur-Belgachhia constituency, Trinamool candidate Atin Ghosh ran from one booth to another and warned his poll managers against being adventurous. “I cannot let anyone fall sick to make me a winner. It is a year of survival,” said Ghosh. At Belgachhia slums, party campaigners were seen running around with lists, trying to convince their volunteers of staying together to bring out the voters and take them to the booth. “Many volunteers cited family issues. We had to mobilize locals throughout the day in shifts — something that we did for the first in these parts of the city,” said Srikanta Chowdhury, a TMC poll manager at Muraripukur. Others found it difficult to convince apartment residents of casting votes, despite having arranged vehicles to take them to the polling stations. Some senior leaders like Shashi Panja and Santanu Sen decided to lead by example as both wore Covid-safety gear and voted after 5.30pm at their respective booths at Shyampukur and Belgachhia. BJP's Shyampukur candidate Sandipan Biswas, who is in his eighth day of Covid, however, was found moving from one booth to another. “I have a Covid negative report with me.

Usually, fees collected from over four lakh students towards examination and revaluation are the biggest earners for NU administration, which utilises it for various welfare measures, besides for organizing exams.Since last three years, it was earning over Rs1 crore from revaluation, but in 2020-21 it collected only Rs2.03 lakh due to online examinations, which were forced on students due to pandemic induced lockdown in entire country.As per RTI reply provided to activist Abhay Kolarkar, in summer 2018 about 38,996 students applied for revaluation and 45,149 in winter the same year. In 2019, 45,500 applied for summer and 63,275 in winter exams. However, these numbers fell to just 1,245 in summer last year, since except first phase a majority of papers were conducted online.NU had collected Rs1.15 crore in 2017-18 through revaluation fees, which increased to Rs1.66 crore in 2018-19. In 2019-20, it had garnered Rs1.45 crore, but in 2020-21 the earnings dropped significantly to just Rs2.03 lakh. The information was released by NU assistant registrars BA Shukla (revaluation) and Manoj Joshi (accounts) to Kolarkar’s queries.Confirming the drop in revenue, vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari clarified that revenue of 2020-21 was from students who appeared in 2019 winter exams and had applied for revaluation. “This exam was conducted in traditional pen and paper format. Therefore, the students applied for revaluation. In 2020, the summer exam was itself held in October-November due to the pandemic, except for the first phase. Moreover, it was held in the online pattern with multiple-choice questions. So, no question of revaluation arises in such exams,” he told TOI.The VC added that even the winter exam was being held online and last phase was yet to be conducted. However, some papers of third phase of exams scheduled in April end were also deferred due to fresh lockdown imposed by the Maharashtra government in view of unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases in state.REVALUATION REVENUEYear ----------------------- Revenue (Rs)2017-18 ----------------- 1,15,53,6572018-19 ----------------- 1,66,92,7372019-20 ----------------- 1,45,59, 7002020-21 ----------------- 2,03,995REVALUATION APPLICATIONSExams-------------------- ApplicationsSummer 2018 -------- 38,996Winter 2018 --------- 45,149Summer 2019 -------- 45,500Winter 2019 --------- 63,275Summer 2020 –——— 1,245||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-loses-out-on-revaluation-revenue-due-to-covid-19-rti-query/articleshow/82330247.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The shortage is being faced at all the three centres in the district. During a reality check, it was found that doctors sent back those standing in queues at Covid vaccination centre in Sector 12 dispensary due to vaccine shortage with the health department.Most of the beneficiaries in the queue were senior citizens, who had come after receiving a message. “If there was a shortage of doses, the health department officials should have informed us in advance,” said an elderly man. An elderly woman said, “We understand the vaccine scarcity. But the officials could have informed us as they have our numbers and other details.”“We have come out of our houses only to get vaccinated, but are leaving without it. We did not expect such a poor arrangement,” said a 52-year-old beneficiary.“At present, there are three vaccination centres in the district. The administration is planning 22 centres from May 1, but all depends on the vaccine supply,” said the health department officials.“We are ready for the May 1 drive, but shortage of vaccine has to be addressed,” they added. For the vaccination of those above 18 years, the health department will receive the stock from the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/beneficiaries-return-without-a-shot-due-to-vax-shortage/articleshow/82316392.cms||Arvind Bishnoi
---||Nagpur||Travel bans can lead to spike in cases: Study||NAGPUR: Domestic travel bans amidst the deadly Covid-19 pandemic can increase cases, finds the latest study by the University of Chicago. Based on data from India, specifically Mumbai, and five other nations, the study highlights that domestic travel restrictions can lead to more, rather than fewer, infections overall, especially when there is a large urban-rural migrant population. Released on Thursday, the research paper suggests that imposing travel bans can counter-intuitively increase the total spread of the disease, creating a lose-lose situation. “This outcome occurs when a country has a large migrant population that is prevented from leaving an urban hotspot and returning to rural areas. If the net effect of a travel ban is to delay the movement of these people, rather than prevent it entirely, the policy can lead to more cases overall,” it states. The paper uses detailed data on rural-urban migration, travel ban policies, and Covid-19 cases to show that this lose-lose outcome occurred in India during the first wave, due to travel bans imposed on migrants wishing to leave Mumbai. While the hardships faced by migrant workers prevented from returning to their villages was seen as a necessary sacrifice to reduce the spread of disease to rural India, experts have come up with contrasting findings. “During the first wave, the national lockdown trapped millions of migrants inside big cities like Mumbai, which were fast-growing coronavirus hotspots. Eventually, people were able to leave, but variations in government policies meant that the length of time they were detained depended on where they wanted to go. In the case of rural districts, where people could return quicker, using mediums like Shramik Special trains, cases rose modestly at the destination,” said Anant Sudarshan, South Asia director of The Energy Policy Institute at the university of Chicago and one of the study authors. He added, “But for areas where bans were in effect longer, there was an intensive increase in the spread of virus, likely because the returning population was more likely to be infected, having been trapped in the hotspot longer.” Apart from Mumbai, the paper analyses data from five other countries where migration is prevalent – China, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, and Kenya. “Although exceptionally long bans may work to reduce total cases, moderate durations are associated with significant increases in disease spread,” the study adds. Fiona Burlig, assistant professor at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago and one of the co-authors of the study, said, “The evidence indicates that if the duration of a travel ban is not long enough, we may end up imposing hardship on people while perversely seeing more spread of infection. There may be merit in letting people go home early.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/travel-bans-can-lead-to-spike-in-cases-study/articleshow/82317153.cms||Manka Behl

On Thursday, Shamim was seen visiting from door to door and requesting his neighbours to wear masks and carry sanitizers before they set out for the polling booth in the neighbourhood. Belgachhia slum — the largest slum in north Kolkata —happened to be the epicentre of the spread of Covid-19 in several adjacent neighbourhoods. However, a continuous awareness drive by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Kolkata Police and some NGOs helped bringing the situation under control there. Shamim was among the volunteers picked up by the civic body to spread Covid awareness. He said it was an uphill task to keep the slum with around 50,000 population safe when the virus struck a few hundred residents before threatening to spread in other adjacent neighbourhoods. On Thursday, some KMC health department workers, who were on duty at the slum to check whether Covid-19 protocols were being flouted, were satisfied at the end of the polling. “Our workers noticed that the majority of the voters from the slum followed the precautions for safety. Our team offered masks to some people who didn’t wear it and we also supplied sanitizers through NGOs,” said a KMC health department official. Parvin Bibi, a slum resident, who sells vegetables at a local market, said, “The situation was bad last year when hundreds of our slum dwellers were infected. We had even lost some of our neighbours. This time it could be worse. Keeping in mind the safety of myself and my husband, we decided to wear two layers of masks before entering the polling booth. We were also carrying sanitizers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/first-wave-cov-zone-plays-by-the-rules/articleshow/82316402.cms||Saikat Ray

Mukesh Patel, deputy commissioner of police, SOG, said that based on a tip-off, a team raided a printing shop in Bapunagar and nabbed three men with 24 vials of remdesivir, worth Rs 21,576. The arrested persons were identified as Milan Savsaviya (21), Deval Kaswala (23) and Hardik Vasani (26), all residents of Ahmedabad. Milan works as a plant operator at Zydus Biotech Park. The three were produced in court and were remanded in police custody for five days. Patel said Savsaviya confessed to having siphoned off 24 vials from the plant and sold them to Deval Kaswala for Rs 3,000 each. Kaswala later sold the vials to Vasani, who would sell them for Rs 6,000 apiece or more depending on how badly the customer needed it,” he said. Patel said the three had so far siphoned off 80-odd vials in the last 25 days. “Savsaviya, who has passed out from the Industrial Training Institute, is a resident of Amreli and has been working at the Zydus Biotech Park at Changodar for the last 30 months. Milan was paid Rs 17,000 and after deductions got about Rs 10,000 per month.” Patel said Savsaviya’s job was to supervise the final stage of remdesivir production at the facility. He was responsible for rejections and would reject injections citing an error in printing on the box even though they were in perfect condition and could have been sold. These injections he would give to Kaswala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/plant-operator-among-3-held-for-black-marketing/articleshow/82317160.cms||---

They arrested two people involved in the scam while a third member is on the run.. The gang set up the racket about 10 days ago and had already sold 350 spurious injections in Vadodara and Ahmedabad. They would buy Terrific SB, an antibiotic used to treat urinary and respiratory infection, for Rs 150 a bottle, repackaged it and sold it for anywhere between Rs 16,000 to Rs 25,000 per bottle. The police arrested Vivek Maheshwar and Naeem Vohra, while Nitish Joshi is on the run. While Vivek runs a medical store in Anand, Vohra works at a medical store in the same town. “They would remove stickers from the bottles and paste stickers of Covifor and Jubi-R on them. The duo sold the antibiotics as remdesivir,” said the police.The cops raided a farm in Radhavpura village where the accused had stored over Rs 3.23 lakh worth of duplicate remdesivir. “They were selling antibiotics in the name of remdesivir. They were playing with lives of Covid patients so we have booked the accused for culpable homicide not amounting to murder,” said Vadodara police commissioner Shamsher Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-bust-fake-remdesivir-racket-in-vadodara-2-held/articleshow/82317158.cms||---

The night curfew is ending on Friday. The court was also critical towards the government saying that its health bulletins were indicating a lesser number of Covid-19 tests despite a grim situation. Reminding advocate general BS Prasad that the night curfew would end on April 30, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy asked him as to what would be the government’s next course of action, including imposing more restrictions on the free movement of people. Seeking to know from the government as to which way it was proceeding, the judges asked: “Towards a lockdown or a curfew?” At this, the AG sought time to get instructions from the government and assured the court that he would get back on Friday. The Union home secretary had recently asked states in a letter to take decision in tune with the ground realities in their respective regions. “Impose restrictions locally where the Covid spread is more,” was the essence of the letter. It was in this backdrop, the judges asked the government’s stand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-lockdown-or-curfew-extension/articleshow/82317169.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Parida admits shortage of ICU beds, ventilators||Chandigarh: With coronavirus cases increasing in the city and the UT administration failing to contain the spread, UT adviser Manoj Parida said on Thursday that the city had sufficient medical infrastructure for its population, but the second surge and load of critical patients from other states had burdened the health infrastructure. While talking to the TOI, Parida admitted availability of ICU beds for critical patients was a major concern for the administration. Q: What are the challenges before the UT administration during the second wave? And how is it different from the first one? A: There are different challenges quantitatively and qualitatively in the second wave in comparison with the first one. The second surge is almost three times the first. There were 200 average daily cases last year, which are now over 600. The containment zones have also increased from around 50 last year to 250. Superfast spreading, young people getting infected and a huge jump in cases are major problems in the second wave. It has become challenging for the UT administration to contain the spread of coronavirus. Q: There is no availability of ICU beds and shortage of life-saving medicines and oxygen. How are you dealing with it? A: Certainly, we have a shortage of ICU beds in the city. Nobody had anticipated a sudden increase in cases. In comparison with the last year, we have enhanced our infrastructure by around 20-25%. Last year, there were no oxygen plants, but this time there are three in the city. We are the only UT in the country to have completed these oxygen plants in record time. There is no oxygen crisis. We have sufficient supply of oxygen for government and private hospitals in the city. Q: But what about ICU beds? There is almost zero availability in hospitals.A: Yes, there is a shortage of ICU beds and even ventilators. At present, 70% to 80% cases in the city are mild and moderate, which do not require such support. For such patients we have Sood Dharamshala, Dhanwantary College, among others. But critical patients are a challenge. Were we asked to handle critical cases of only Chandigarh, we could have managed easily. But critical patients of neighbouring and far-off states are also coming to Chandigarh, and ICUs and ventilators are going to them. Q: Is there any plan to increase the number of ICUs and ventilators? A: We have tied up with the Army for setting up a 100-bed hospital at a Panjab University hostel. We have asked the Centre for ventilators and also floated tenders. Local MP Kirron Kher has also allocated Rs 1 crore from MPLADS fund for ventilators for PGI. But getting ventilators is not enough. We have a shortage of manpower to operate these. We are trying to recruit retired health professionals. Enhancement up to 25% has already happened and it is a continuous process. Q: People are running from pillar to post for life-saving medicines like Remdesivir. Why UT failed to keep a check? A: We have sufficient stock of these medicines and the Centre also recently allocated quota to UT. There was a high demand in the market, which led to panic, but for patients admitted in government and private hospitals in Chandigarh, there is no such shortage.Q: Why is there no centralised helpline for addressing queries of city residents for Covid management?A: Though there are helpline numbers of GMCH-32 and GMH-16, the UT health department will also set up a 24x7 control room for addressing public queries. Q: Last year you were active on Twitter, but this year you are missing from there. Any specific reason.A: Last time many policy decisions were being made for the first time, like how many people can go in a car, or whether vendors can come inside sectors or not. There was a complete lockdown and vendors were not even distributing newspapers. So there was only one platform, social media, to inform the public. Now, guidelines are clear, UT is also holding regular war room meetings, newspapers are being distributed, so I am not active on Twitter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parida-admits-shortage-of-icu-beds-ventilators/articleshow/82316406.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Delhi||N corpn’s 100-bedded facility at Timarpur to be ready soon||New Delhi: North Delhi Municipal Corporation will make its third Covid-19 facility operational at Balak Ram Hospital, Timarpur by this Sunday. The facility will have 100 beds and the corporation has arranged oxygen cylinders as the hospital doesn’t have a storage facility for supplying piped oxygen gas to beds. The decision to create the facility was taken in a meeting of mayor Jai Prakash, commissioner Sanjay Goel and representatives of the deliberative wing. Prakash said that the hospital has been made operational within a fortnight. “Initially, the plan was to set up only an isolation ward, where patients who don’t have space for home quarantine can stay. We were going to provide facilities like food, medicines and treatment. But after we arranged for enough oxygen cylinders, we decided to open it as a dedicated Covid facility,” said the mayor. Officials have been directed to arrange for separate waiting rooms, help desks, water coolers and kadha for attendants of patients. “We just need oxygen flow meters. The staff should procure these in a day or two, after which the hospital will be made open for the general public, most probably by Sunday evening,” said the mayor. North corporation, at present, has two Covid 19 facilities — 250-bedded Hindu Rao and 60-bedded Rajan Babu Hospital. The civic body is planning to increase the capacity of Rajan Babu and start a 200-bed isolation ward without oxygen. In the meeting, officials were also directed to increase more platforms at the crematoriums, pay attention for sanitation at all Covid and non-Covid facilities and provide treatment to all needy people. Prakash said north corporation was trying its best with its limited resources and no funds, for example, an NGO was willing to provide meals three times a day. “We would appreciate it if the Delhi government can support our efforts but release our quarterly share of funds soon,” said Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpns-100-bedded-facility-at-timarpur-to-be-ready-soon/articleshow/82317164.cms||Vibha Sharma

Also, the no-confidence motion filed by the Sawant-backed panel against Khan from the Congress-backed panel failed as the former lost the motion by 6-7 votes. The election had become a prestigious issue between the BJP-panel headed by the Sakhali MLA and the opposition group belonging to Saglani of the Congress who is believed to be a strong rival of the chief minister. For Thursday’s election to the chairperson’s post, Parsekar and Sawal had submitted their papers on behalf of the Saglani group, while Madkar, Desai and Boryekar had filed their nominations on behalf of BJP. At the eleventh hour, Sawal, Desai and Boryekar withdrew their nominations, leaving Parsekar and Madkar in the fray. Sharadchandra Nipanikar was the presiding officer for the election process. He was assisted by chief officer Deepak Vaingankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-candidate-wins-sakhali-municipal-chairpersons-post/articleshow/82317175.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A 58-year-old account holder, working as a security supervisor at the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT), responded to the advertisement,filled in his account details and lost Rs 3 lakh. The money was transferred to one of the many digital accounts of the accused. The youth told the police that he had used his share of money—Rs 1 lakh and more— for his mother’s treatment while the rest was transferred to his absconding associate’s account. The victim approached the police, stating that he was checking a Facebook page when the fake advertisement popped up on his screen, offering new debit cards for account holders of Abhyuddha Bank. The victim opened the ad and filled up a form that required the full name of account holder, account details, Aadhaar card, mobile number and other details. After the victim submitted the form, he got a call from a man who said he was calling from the bank. The caller told him to share a United Payment Interface (UPI) code from his mobile and the victim did as he was told, said a police officer. Within minutes, Rs three lakh were transferred from the victim’s bank account to another account. Subsequently, an FIR was registered. A team led by police inspector Ashok Ugale of the cyber police station first traced the mobile number which was used by the accused. The police collected call data records (CDR) of the number and tracked it to Jamtara. “We sent a team to Jamtara and arrested the accused, Arjun Das, a BA student, from his residence. During interrogation, he admitted to the fake ad. He told us that they try to cheat five to six people a month. Now they are using digital bank accounts to transfer the money,” said a police source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2i-yr-old-dupes-man-of-3l-with-fake-debit-card-offer-held/articleshow/82318123.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Ahmedabad||‘80k students roped in for Covid duty’||Ahmedabad: The state government stated before the Supreme Court on Thursday that it has made efforts to rope in approximately 80,000 students of medical and paramedical courses for Covid-19 duty. The government said that the state is facing a human resources crunch in dealing with the aggravated situation. The government also said that 35,000 doctors, 40,000 nurses, 70,000 paramedical staff, 45,000 ASHA workers, and 1.45 lakh other staff are working in various healthcare facilities across the state. The apex court had ordered all the state governments to inform it about the availability and distribution of resources including oxygen, remdesivir, and human resources. The court also wanted to know about the availability of infrastructure to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. Gujarat chief secretary Anil Mukim filed the affidavit and stated that the government has been trying to secure the services of medical professional on 11-month contracts. “Similar efforts were also done to engage approximately 80,000 students from all medical and paramedical courses,” he said. The state government has said that it has already issued orders for 1,241 bonded doctors to join Covid duty immediately under the Epidemic Diseases Act. There are 649 doctors who passed out from government medical colleges, and 593 candidates from GMERS colleges. In its affidavit submitted to the SC, the government has stated that it has initiated multiple measures to address the shortage of medical practitioners. However, during a hearing before the Gujarat high court on Tuesday, the state government had lamented that it was finding it extremely difficult to get trained human resources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/80k-students-roped-in-for-covid-duty/articleshow/82317180.cms||---

The District Legal Services Authority held a decoy operation at four cremation grounds in Udaipur on Thursday and found that at two of the places, rates for the funeral were unreasonably high. There were no authorised staff at these grounds and middlemen were charging money to their desire. Kuldeep Sootrakar, ADJ and secretary DLSA, inspected the cremation grounds at Ashok Nagar, Savina, Sector 3 and13 and found anomalies. At Sector 3, the guard was not present and an unauthorised person, who was holding the cremation of the bodies, said that Rs 15,000 would be charged for Covid bodies. The judicial team which did not reveal its identity and bargained for some concession was treated rudely by the person. He also said that Rs 15,000 was only the fees for carrying the body from the ambulance to the pyre while setting up woods and arrangements were to be done by the family. The expenses for woods and other materials for the rituals too had to be borne separately, he said. Santosh Menaria of the judicial team said that at Sector 13, a person wearing an ID card of an oil company was supervising the task. He was an unauthorised person and mediator who demanded Rs 2,100 without making proper entry of the deceased before the last rites.

The accused Balwant Yadav (57), wanted in a Rs 4 crore bank loan fraud case, had been absconding for the last 12 years. Recently, when the police landed up at his Ambernath home, they knew they had got the man they were looking for. Cornered, Yadav refused to open the door. After much knocking and banging on the door, he warned the cops waiting outside that he was suffering from Covid symptoms. “Obviously, we knew he was faking it,” said a police official, adding that they refused to let him slip away this time. The cops refused to budge. Yadav realised that his game was up. There was no escape from the cops waiting at his doorstep. He stepped out and was escorted to the designated court. And here’s where the cops encountered a twist in the tale. A Covid test was run on Yadav and, like he had warned the cops, he turned out to be positive, leaving the cops a little foxed and a lot nervous. Yadav was quickly taken to the state-run GT Hospital near Crawford Market. “We did several rounds of hospitals, spoke to doctors and even the dean of a hospital and finally managed to get Yadav admitted,” said an official of Economic Offences Wings of the Mumbai police. Yadav, whose oxygen level was low, got lucky, in a sense. “The police request to the hospital worked. Our wanted man got a bed in the ICU Yadav had first been arrested in 2008, said police inspector Kishor Parab. He had allegedly duped a bank of Rs 3.81 crore. Six months after his arrest, he got bail and since then he stopped attending court, said assistant inspector Arundhati Yelve. Over the last 12 years, he dodged the police by changing his identity and also his location.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wanted-man-nabbed-after-12-yrs-cops-send-him-to-icu/articleshow/82318118.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Finding out what is true and what is not can cause a lot of unnecessary frustration and worry among citizens, who are already stressed enough with the pandemic. The Times of India has launched an initiative called Times Verified, to clear all confusion and give readers clarity on any such news that they might suspect to be dubious. To find out the truth behind news that you are doubtful about, all you have to do is save the WhatsApp number, +91 83908 22220, on your phone as ‘Times Verified’ and forward to it any suspicious reports, messages, videos and articles. An expert panel of journalists will verify the credibility of the message at the earliest and stamp the message as genuine or fake. All fake news will be flagged and exposed in the newspaper. Don’t let fake news cloud your judgement, shade your opinion or corrupt your knowledge about various social, civic as well as political issues. Next time you get a message with a link to an article you have reasonable doubts about, or perhaps even a video which is intended to create confusion, instead of being fooled and forwarding the content to everyone in your circle, let Times Verified check it out for you.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stop-the-spread-of-fake-news/articleshow/82317182.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||No vax, can’t jab 18-44 age group, says Telangana health minister||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government on Thursday said it is not possible for them to roll out Covid vaccination for 18-44 age group from May 1 due to an acute shortage of vaccines, and blamed the Centre for this situation. “We can’t say when the vaccination will begin for them. There are 1.75 crore people (in 18-44 age group) in Telangana and we need two doses for these many people. The vaccination can begin only when we have adequate doses,” health minister Eatala Rajender said while addressing a press conference. “The Centre should have planned this better or allowed us to import vaccines from other countries,” Rajender added. He said if Telangana had got the required doses, vaccination of the entire 3.3 crore beneficiaries in the state could have been completed within three months. “We are now in discussions with Bharat Biotech and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories for vaccine supplies,” he said. Rajender also blamed the Centre for keeping complete control on supplies of Remdesivir and oxygen, and underscored how they failed to supply adequate quantities to the states. “People are dying because of lack of these supplies, it’s a complete failure of the Centre. These are in control of the Centre and they are only giving guidelines to states on how to use these without supplying the required quantities. They should stop blaming states for their own failures,” the minister said. Adding that the state had sought 650 metric tonnes of oxygen supplies anticipating a further increase in cases as the second wave was likely to peak in May, Rajender said that they received only 360 metric tonnes. Unhappy over the pricing of Remdesivir injection, he said it should have been much lower. “Its manufacturing cost will hardly be Rs 200 to Rs 300, but the MRP is around Rs 3,000. Now the Centre is talking about subsidy and selling the drug at Rs 1,500- 2,000. With many pharma companies around, it is possible to increase production and supply it at nominal cost,” said the minister. The prices of Remdesivir varies from Rs 899 to Rs 3,419, officials clarified. Talking about patients in home isolation, Rajender asked them to get basic blood tests done every three days and urged them to utilize 19 Telangana diagnostic centres opening in the next 3-4 days. He also reiterated that there were no plans for a lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-vax-cant-jab-18-44-age-group-says-eatala/articleshow/82318128.cms||Amrita Didyala

A mobile app and an online auction system for Chilla were developed in association with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). According to officials the app-based online trial version was started two weeks ago and it was a big success. Marayur range officer M G Vinod Kumar said, “Product details are available on the app. In the trial version, the facilitator adds the amount of the produce which the auctioneer quotes. A big screen in front of the auction centre at Marayur displays it in the meantime. If another auctioneer quotes a higher price the facilitator will include it too. When the final amount quoted is displayed for three minutes on the screen, the deal is fixed.” “If the price quoted is not remunerative, the farmer can withdraw his/her produce,” said the official. “Soon the Chilla market will be made fully online and anyone can participate in the auction. In future, we will start Chilla retail market so that people can buy forest produce online. We will deliver the product through KSRTC courier. The payment can also be done online,” said the official. Officials said the online upgrade by Chilla was done with a cost of Rs 4 lakh. The online platform will be more helpful in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, said officials. Chilla, an exclusive tribal market under the Marayur forest division, opens on Thursdays to sell tribal produce. The initiative was started in 2014 and in seven years, Chillahas clocked a turnover of over Rs 3 crore. Tribespeople cultivate vegetables inside the forest by adopting organic methods. However, they find it difficult to sell the produce in the open market and face huge exploitation. Chilla helps tribal farmers get a proper market and fair price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tribal-produce-in-idukki-get-an-online-launch-pad/articleshow/82310553.cms||---

"Optimum utilization of available oxygen must be made, and there is an extreme need of assessing the actual requirement against the demand made by the government medical colleges and hospitals," reads the letter dated April 28. "Thus, it's requested that an audit of total demand, actual need and available oxygen for its optimum utilisation be performed by a technical expert group at government medical colleges PMCH, NMCH and IGIMS so that available limited resources can be used in the best possible way," the letter adds. In the letter written to health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit, the DM stated that the PMCH, NMCH and IGIMS are continuously pressing for 3,000 jumbo oxygen cylinders per day. Against their demand, PMCH and NMCH are provided with 1,000 oxygen cylinders each while IGIMS gets 600 cylinders per day. According to the letter, the oxygen supply capacity in the Patna district is 7,000 cylinders per day while the current demand is much higher. At these three government hospitals, around 800 beds are reserved for treatment of Covid-19 patients while there are around 2,000 beds in 90 private hospitals in Patna where Covid-19 patients are undergoing treatment. The DM stated in his letter that these private hospitals are demanding around 4,000 oxygen cylinders per day. He has further written that if the demand of district, sub-divisional and dedicated Covid-19 health centres are added to the demand by non-Covid hospitals then the oxygen availability becomes much less compared to the requirement. As per the DM, a request is pending with the industries department to ensure the availability of 1,770 additional oxygen cylinders per day to hospitals in Patna and installation of liquid oxygen storage tanks at the government medical colleges and hospitals. Incidentally, the letter came in the public domain within 24 hours of the IGIMS director submitting before the Patna high court on Wednesday that they need at least 400 to 600 additional oxygen cylinders daily for Covid-19 patients. The HC had termed the state government’s oxygen supply action plan as a ‘farce’ during Wednesday’s hearing. The director was among the first few people to write to the high court's special email address rgphccovidcomplain@gmail.com created for the masses to report the shortage of oxygen supply. Earlier, the NMCH superintendent (in-charge) Dr Binod Kumar Singh had written to the health secretary on April 17 to relieve him of his duties as there is a shortage of oxygen supply due to its diversion to other hospitals by the district administration. Even the ESIC hospital at Bihta and some other private hospitals have complained to the high court’s email id highlighting oxygen shortage. As per an assessment mentioned by the Patna DM during a high-level meeting on April 15, there was a demand for at least 10,000 oxygen cylinders per day by hospitals. It was the same meeting at which the decision was taken to divert oxygen from industries to hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oxygen-crisis-in-patna-hospitals-says-dm/articleshow/82316262.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Ahmedabad||‘Panic buying, case spike causing favipiravir shortage’||Ahmedabad: Fear of lacking vital resources when needed most to withstand Covid has led people to panic and take to hoarding medicines, causing short-supply of Covid-related medicines, particularly favipiravir say chemists. Estimates by Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists’ Association(FGSCDA) suggest that the demand is five times higher than the supply. “The number of cases are rising and that has already added to the demand in Ahmedabad. The rise in cases has caused a lot of panic among people due to which even those who don’t have Covid are procuring these medicines. Since the past five days, each stockist has been receiving an average of 500 strips whereas the demand is extremely high,” said Jashvant Patel, chairman, FGSCDA. Stockists say they’re not getting stocks on a daily basis due to which the stock of these medicines is falling short while the demand is high. Other Covid medicines such as azithromycin, ivermectin, certain injectables and in some cases even paracetamol is falling short in terms of stock. B ut since there are many manufacturers, the supply is somehow being managed. Sources said that the situation is worsening in smaller towns and rural districts, where the medicine shortage is more acute. “I have turned away at least ten customers for favipiravir because I have not received stock for the day. We are trying to procure and supply it to our customers but the demand has gone up significantly,” said a chemist based in Anand. With Covid-19 refusing to slow down in the city and the number of active cases on the rise, the demand for anti-viral drugs has increased significantly. Remdesivir shortage is well-known, but now the supply of the oral drug Favipiravir is also erratic. Same situation in Vadodara Vadodara: Favipiravir was earlier available readily at medicine shops in Vadodara. At times one had to check a few stores before finding it. But now there are days when it is not available in the market in most stores. The stores ask relatives or patients to come again as the drug is in short supply, if not unavailable. Sources in the drug market in the city said that the tablets were being manufactured by multiple companies. “Earlier, the stock of one or the other company used to arrive in the city on a given day and there was never a crisis. Now, there are days when the stock gets exhausted and customers have to wai till new stock arrives on the next day,” said a dealer. President of the Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists Association, Alpesh Patel, said that while the market is not totally dry, one has to wait for stocks to arrive and supplies are erratic. “The issue is expected to get sorted in a couple of days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/panic-buying-case-spike-causing-favipiravir-shortage/articleshow/82316461.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi hospitals take things by the hour as crisis persists||NEW DELHI: The hospital oxygen crisis refuses to be resolved 11 days since it first flared up. From 8-10 hours of waiting time at refilling stations to not knowing when new stocks will arrive, hospitals continue to battle the scarcity hour by hour. On Friday at 4.15pm, Sehgal Neo Hospital on Outer Ring Road had oxygen enough for an hour more. It had faced problems even on Thursday after its supplier was changed. Many hospitals in a similar predicament are only admitting patients who don’t need oxygen. At Sehgal Neo, Thursday’s struggle flowed over into Friday. Speaking to TOI, Dr Narin Sehgal, owner, said, “The demand for oxygen has gone up at least twofold, not just for our institution but also for other hospitals. Although I got the order rectified on Friday, the struggle to ensure the supply reaches you goes on in an hourly basis. We are in constant anxiety about being able to get our supply on time. Throughout the night and day, we keep calling up the vendors to ask them when the supply will reach the hospital.” When TOI spoke to Dr Sehgal around 6pm for Friday, he had oxygen supply only to last just over an hour. The hospital was desperately awaiting its supply, which had not reached yet even after two hours of the scheduled time. The replenishment was meant to keep the hospital running till 8am on Saturday. Vimhans Hospital was in a similar ferment on Friday. At around 7.30pm, the hospital was left with just around two hours of oxygen. “We have informed the authorities and even written to them about our position,” a doctor said. “Only if the supplies consistently reach us in a timely manner can the constant fear of the running out of gas dissipate.” Tanush Gupta of Vivek Vihar’s Gupta Multi-Specialty Hospital admitted to be doing better than earlier, but said the situation still remained critical. “We got our original vendor to supply us oxygen and we manged to get 15-16 cylinders today. Constantly following up with the suppliers and getting hospital vehicles to take cylinders for refills is an everyday task,” said Gupta. Most hospitals TOI spoke to said there is panic whenever the new stocks are delayed. “If the supply has to reach say by 2pm, we wait expectantly,” pointed out one doctor. “If the supply doesn’t reach us even by 4pm, then we are certain to go into hysteria. after 15-18 hours of waiting at the refill station, we get one cylinder.” He curtly said the authorities should come down on unscrupulous people who are selling cylinders illegally at Rs 60,000 and more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-hosps-take-things-by-the-hr-as-crisis-persists/articleshow/82334933.cms||---

They got married last November and had booked a Rs 2-lakh package for Maldives from April 25 to 30. While they were there, on April 27, the archipelago changed entry rules for Indian travellers that led to a drop in travellers and desi carriers started cancelling or clubbing flights. The Mumbai-based couple, both in their late twenties, found their morning Male-Mumbai flight on Friday (April 30) had been cancelled. They managed to book another ticket on an evening flight the same day but had to shell out an extra Rs 45,000 for fresh tickets and another RT-PCR tests. “We are not sure how much refund we will get on the ticket we had originally bought,” Varun, an MBA (finance), said.As per rules, they tried to do web check-in 48 hours before departure for India for the return flight. “It was then we got to know that the carrier had cancelled that flight and did not bother to inform us. When we somehow reached out to them, they offered us a flight on May 1 which is also tentative ,” Manali, a CA by training, told TOI from Maldives on Thursday.The resort told them it was fully booked and could not extend their stay. Going to a relatively less expensive city hotel is now not an option as from April 27 Indian travellers can’t stay in inhabited islands but only in resorts on standalone islands in Maldives. Their hotel package included RT-PCR tests for them as people heading back to India from Male need to get this done 72 hours before departure. “Our original flight was at 10.40 am and the tests were done as per that time. We managed to get another (Indian LCC) flight that will leave Male at 5 pm. We paid Rs 20,000 for the new tickets and a hefty Rs 25,000 for the RT-PCR tests that was linked to resort category,” Manali said. Officials of Indian carriers say the changed rules for Maldives has seen a drop in demand for leisure trip there. “The entry rules for Indians are changing fast during the ongoing pandemic,” said an airline official.So what is Manali’s advice for travellers headed abroad at this moment? “Stay home, stay safe. When things improve, venture out then,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maldives-travel-curbs-take-fun-out-of-newlyweds-trip/articleshow/82318150.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The farmers’ collective also claimed that forest department has been looking at forestry extension under the cover of the project. The India High Range Mountain Landscape Project is a partnership between the environment ministry, state government and United Nations Development Programme aimed at developing an effective multiple use management framework for conserving biodiversity in the mountain landscape of the Western Ghats. “Before implementing the projects, they must discuss about them in the grama sabhas. But the officials did not do so,” said Fr Sebastian Kochupurakal, general convenor of HRSS. “We received information that the forest department has been implementing some works under the project. In 2010, when the project was first mooted, they had classified several areas as forest land, but after we raised protests, they revised the project. If they implement projects without proper discussion we will oppose them,” said Kochupurakkal. The agreement for the project was signed in 2014, but in 2015 former Idukki MP Joice George filed a complaint before the UNDP Office of Audit and Investigations. In 2018, the government gave its approval for a revised Rs 32-crore project. It will be implemented in 11 panchayats in Idukki, as well in parts of Ernakulam and Thrissur. At panchayat level, Haritha Keralam Mission is implementing the project and inside forest areas, it is being executed by the forest department. The project is expected to be completed in 2022. Dr T N Seema, former executive vice-chairperson, Haritha Keralam Mission rubbished the allegation of forestry extension. “We will address their concerns,” she said. UNDP sources too said there are no projects under the mission to increase the forest cover in the district. “The projects under UNDP are comprehensive waste management, conservation of water resources, sustainable agriculture and livelihood management. The projects implemented through the forest department are to protect the biodiversity inside the forest land only. We are ready to discuss the concerns raised by all groups,” said a source. Haritha Kerala Mission Idukki district coordinator GS Madhu said Haritha Keralam Mission implements all UNDP projects only after proper discussions with local bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/row-over-undp-aided-project-in-idukki/articleshow/82310605.cms||Sandeep Thomas

A senior EDMC official said that they had sent a reminder to the drug control department of Delhi government and marked a copy to the zonal and central headquarters for issuing of licence. “We had sent the letter for approval for the first time in August last year. However, we didn’t get the approval. Considering we have machines and other facilities in places, we have requested the department to give us a licence for running the facility,” said the official. The civic body has a machine for separating platelets from blood and storing it properly. He added that they have already started collecting data of EDMC employees who recovered from Covid-19 and requesting them to donate plasma for helping other infected employees. The mayor of north corporation said that they were planning to set up the bank at Hindu Rao Hospital. “We already have a blood bank there and operation of a plasma bank will make the task easier for us.

He defeated Mangaldas Ghadi by 9-6 votes. Earlier, Pramod Naik, who had also filed his nomination for the post, withdrew from the fray, leaving Sawant, a former chairperson, pitted against Ghadi, a first-time councillor. Sawant owes allegiance to power minister and Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral. The election for chairperson was necessitated after ex-chairperson Balkrishna Hodarkar was ousted from office through a no-confidence motion moved against him on April 16 after the earlier two attempts fizzled out. Earlier this week, Rhucha Vasta was elected vice chairperson of the civic body. Vasta had earlier this month resigned from the post of deputy chairperson after the controversial no-confidence motion was moved against then chairperson Balkrishna Hodarkar minutes after he was declared elected to the post on April 1. The CCMC had witnessed several twists and turns following the civic polls over the election of the chairperson. Minutes after Hodarkar was declared elected as chairperson on April 1, nine councillors owing allegiance to Cabral had moved a no-confidence motion against him which was, however, rejected by the director of municipal administration (DMA) on technical grounds. Subsequently, they had moved another no-confidence motion against Hodarkar, which was also rejected by the DMA on April 9, also on procedural grounds. The very same day, they moved yet another no-confidence motion, this time, however, signed by six councillors, which, ultimately, resulted in Hodarkar’s ouster on April 16.

Baja SAE competitions challenge engineering students to design, build and race an off-road vehicle that will survive rough terrain. Due to the Covid-19 restrictions this year, the entire competition was held online with simulation software used to test the systems made by each college. Team captain Aniruddha Joshi, a fourth-year mechanical engineering student, said, “For the first time, this year, we had to build a four-wheel drive vehicle. In November, we had the preliminary round where we appeared for a quiz and then a presentation. We were adjudged first in this round too. The organisers had given a car-maker software on which we were supposed to model our vehicle and run it in simulation. We were marked for our design as well as the overall time needed to finish the track, acceleration, endurance, traction and other factors.” Ankit Kulkarni, team manager, and a fourth-year mechanical engineering student said they worked in an organised manner with dedicated sub-teams. Sachin Deshmukh and Shrihari Bondar were the faculty advisors. “We have a primary department which is divided into steering, suspension, transmission and brakes, and the secondary department which has computer-aided designing, computer-aided engineering, manufacturing and aesthetics departments in it. It is the collective effort of each of these teams that helped us win,” Kulkarni said. The team grabbed eight trophies in different categories, said Ganesh Kakandikar, associate head of school of mechanical engineering, in MITWPU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mit-team-builds-4-wheeler-wins-big-in-online-national-engg-meet/articleshow/82316478.cms||Ardhra Nair

The HC lawyers’ association had earlier requested the high court’s chief justice to allow it to create a Covid care facility in the auditorium and judicial academy buildings on HC campus at Sola. GHAA cited difficulty in procuring health facilities for its members in Covid hospitals and expressed desire to create a facility of its own. The chief justice permitted the association to set up a Covid care centre in few rooms in the auditorium and asked it to manage the affairs. The court said that besides lawyers, the court staff should also be treated in this facility. GHAA office bearers strove hard for a week to make arrangement for an uninterrupted oxygen supply and ventilators. However, looking at the present scarcity of resources, the association dropped the idea of creating a Covid care centre of its own and settled with limited beds at a new Covid facility that has come up in Naranpura area. GHAA has placed certain criteria for admitting a patient including that he should not be diabetic. It said that owing to limited resources and acute shortage of oxygen supply, the Covid care centre is constrained to accommodate only those patients who fulfil these criteria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ghaa-drops-idea-of-corona-care-facility-of-its-own/articleshow/82317191.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana stops vax supply to private hospitals||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government on Thursday took full control of the available stocks of Covid-19 vaccines and told officials not to releases any doses to private hospitals until further orders. The decision came on a day when state health minister Eatala Rajender accused the Centre of botching up vaccine supply for 18-44 age group by centralising the distribution and not providing enough stocks. Sources told TOI that the supply has been stopped so that the state can can administer the second dose to as many people as possible. In fact, the quota for private hospitals had been reduced for the past few days. Now, it is expected to come to a halt for a few days. Interestingly, on Thursday, the state received three lakh doses of Covishield from Pune but officials say these will not be enough to manage the rush for the next two days when the third phase of vaccination starts on May 1. This is because Telangana has been vaccinating between 1.5 lakh and two lakh people daily. Given that the number of cases have spiked in the second wave, the state is worried about second dose of the vaccine. There is also an increasing demand for indigenously made Covaxin but not enough doses have been made available. About 46 lakh people have been vaccinated in the state so far and only five lakh people have received second dose. “In some areas we are telling the people coming for first dose to wait,” a top official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-stops-vax-supply-to-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/82318179.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Delhi||Is obesity adding to Covid-19 complication risk in young?||NEW DELHI: Unlike the first wave of Covid-19 when most people requiring hospitalisation were the elderly and people with comorbidities, this time younger people — those younger than 40 years old — are developing severe symptoms that necessitate hospital stay. While one explanation for this is the increased virulence of the coronavirus in circulation, doctors say obesity might also be playing a big role in this. According to Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak Hospital, most of the younger Covid-positive people requiring admission in his hospital were either overweight or obese. “Two patients aged 40 and 41 years died in our hospital on Thursday. One of them weighed 120 kg, the other around 90 kg,” Kumar revealed, while explaining that obese people have high insulin resistance and their lung function and respiratory reserve are also compromised, thus predisposing them to disease-related complications. Read AlsoMaharashtra, Delhi among 10 states that account for 73.71 per cent of new Covid cases: GovernmentWith a record daily rise of 4,01,003 Covid-19 cases, India's total tally climbed to 1,91,64,969 on Saturday, according to ministry data. Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar are also among the 10 states that reported 73.71 per cent of the new cases.  Dr Sumit Ray, critical care expert, added that overweight people had a dysregulated immune response. “Also, the mechanical function of breathing is affected in obese people,” Ray said. Read AlsoCovid-19: India records highest-ever 4,01,993 new cases, 3,523 deathsCoronavirus cases in India hit a record daily high with over 4 lakh new infections being reported in the last 24 hours, while the active cases crossed the 32-lakh mark, as per health ministry data on Saturday. The infection tally rose to 1,91,64,969 with 4,01,993 new cases, while the death tollA study recently published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology Journal, based on more than 6.9 million people living in England and including data from more than 20,000 Covid patients who were hospitalised or died last year, also established that the risk of worse outcomes from the disease start increasing in people with a BMI over 23kg/m2, which is considered to be in the healthy range. According to the study, the risk of hospitalisation was 5% higher for each one-unit increase in BMI and the risk of ICU admission was 10% higher for each unit increase. “Underweight people (BMI less than 18.5) also experienced poor outcomes from Covid,” the authors noted.   Besides modest excess weight being associated with greater risks of severe complications, the study showed excess weight leading to severe risks was greatest in the 20-39 age group and decreased after age 60. Lead author Dr Carmen Piernas of University of Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences said, “We also found that the risks associated with excess weight are greatest in people aged under 40 years, while weight has little to no effect on your chances of developing severe Covid-19 after age 80. These findings suggest that vaccination policies should prioritise people with obesity, especially now the vaccine is being rolled out to younger age-groups.” Read AlsoChennai: People hire agents to stand in queue for RemdesivirAs queues get longer at Remdesivir counters at Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital, people are paying agents and locals about ₹500- ₹1,500 a day to stand in for them to get the drug.Dr S K Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, said the hospital had conducted a similar study last year and found that obesity-induced fatty liver increased the risk of complications in Covid patients. “Such patients have high inflammatory markers, a longer cytokine storm and a potentially delayed clearance of the virus leading to increased severity and prolonged illness,” said Sarin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/is-obesity-adding-to-covid-19-complication-risk-in-young/articleshow/82335004.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Delhi government can’t increase oxygen beds for Covid-19 patients due to shortage of oxygen, he wrote. The deputy chief minister said Delhi was in the middle of an unprecedented Covid surge, which had stretched its health infrastructure to the maximum level. “Delhi does not have any oxygen plant and is dependent on plants located elsewhere in the country.” From the initial allocation of 378MT per day, Sisodia wrote, the Centre has increased it to 480MT on April 18 and then to 490MT. “Medical oxygen is being allocated to various Covid hospitals as per the formula prescribed by Government of India. At present, there are 16,272 non-ICU oxygen and 4,866 ICU beds. With the additional beds coming into operation over the next one week, the total estimated requirement of medical oxygen per day is 976MT,” he wrote. On average, Delhi is recording 25,000 new cases every day and about 10% of them require hospitalisation, including oxygen support, Sisodia said. “Delhi government is creating an additional 15,000 non-ICU and 1,200 ICU beds within one week to 10 days.” It has arranged 5,000 beds at Radha Soami Satsang Beas at Chhatarpur in collaboration with ITBP but just 300 beds are functional due to shortage of oxygen, he said. Similarly, 1,000 beds with Sant Nirankari Mission and 1,500 beds with Sawan Kripal Ruhani Mission in Burari could not also be made functional, he added. The minister also said the additional allocation had been made from the plants located more than 1,500km from Delhi. Even after about 10 days of the allocation, Delhi has not received the full quota even once, he said, adding “most of our officers and ministers are in the process of rationing the supply of medical oxygen to various Covid hospitals 24x7”. The government and Delhiites will be extremely grateful to the Centre if it can increase the allocation, preferably from nearby oxygen plants, Sisodia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-writes-to-goyal-raise-o2-allocation/articleshow/82317198.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The judges took “serious note” of the Mumbra fire and noted this was not a “solitary incident”. They referred to fires at hospitals in Bhandup and Virar, where 11 and 10 patients each, died and even the “fateful incident” of oxygen leak at a Nashik hospital where 22 patients died. “We don’t want hospitals to be potential jatugrihas,’’ said the CJ, referring to Mahabharata, on how houses of lac were built so that the Pandavas burn to death. The judges wondered how such hospitals are granted permission to function. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, for BMC, said because of the pandemic nursing licences were issued. “Hospitals were permitted to admit Covid and non-Covid patients because of the need of the hour,’’ he added. Justice Kulkarni said patient safety was important. “We don’t want any fires now.” The judges, in their order, noted that all recent fires took place at private hospitals. They directed that failure of any management of a private hospital to put in place adequate fire safety measures must be viewed seriously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/conduct-fire-safety-audit-of-pvt-hosps-bombay-hc/articleshow/82318231.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The Congress leader also gave a memorandum to divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, so that it could be sent to the government using the official chain of command. Deshmukh said smaller states seem to be more effective in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. In his letter, Deshmukh wrote, “Smaller states appear to be working effectively inthis regard. Vaccination is very important so that the infection does not spread.Because of the small size of the small states, immunizations and otherassistance can save lives. Due to the large size of the state of Maharashtra, thereare difficulties in this regard”.He added that “after Independence, Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar was in favour of a separate State of Vidarbha. The first State Reorganizing Commission (Fazal Ali Commission) headed by Justice Fazal Ali had also recommended a separate Vidarbha state. The State Reorganizing Commission had very clearly stated and recommended that Vidarbha and Telangana should be separate states.Telangana state has been formed but Vidarbha is still neglected. This demandwas consistently ignored for political reasons and Vidarbha was exploited bythe authorities. Although this region is rich in natural resources, it has remainedalways backward.”Deshmukh said “The neighboring state of Chhattisgarh was more backward than Vidarbha. In just fifteen years, Chhattisgarh has made tremendous progress compared to Vidarbha. In Jharkhand and Uttarakhand too, the winds of progress are blowing fast. Social development takes place through industrial development,educational development. However, Vidarbha region has not developed asall the sources are with the rulers of Mumbai and Western Maharashtra, whohave no sympathy for Vidarbha.”Deshmukh urged Shah to take ‘immediate’ steps for the creation of Vidarbha state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-mla-ashish-deshmukh-writes-to-shah-for-separate-vidarbha/articleshow/82331337.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Justice N Anand Venkatesh said he was trying to break his own preconceived notions. “I want to give myself some more time to churn. Ultimately in this case, the words must come from my heart and not from my head, and the same will not be possible if I am not fully ‘woke’ on this aspect,” the judge said. On Thursday, when the plea came up for hearing, the judge said a suggestion had been made by counsel for the petitioner for setting out guidelines in cases of this nature. “I honestly feel that such a session with a professional will help me understand same-sex relationships better and will pave way for my evolution,” the judge added. The issue pertains to a plea moved by a lesbian couple who faced harassment by police and their parents. On March 30, coming to the aid of couples, the court ordered counselling to them and opposing parents by a specialist who has experience in working with LGBT individuals. When the plea came up for hearing on Thursday, counsellor Vidhya Dinakaran filed a report submitting that both the petitioners perfectly understand the relationship they have entered into and there is no confusion in their minds. As far as the parents are concerned, the counsellor submitted that they are more concerned about the stigma attached to the relationship in the society and the consequences it may ensue on their family. They also apprehend that they will be looked down upon by the society and their own community. The parents are also concerned about the safety and security of their daughters, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/judge-seeks-counselling-before-ruling-on-case/articleshow/82319676.cms||---

They have no option, but obey your command,” a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said on Thursday. In the Battle of Balaclava, a Black Sea port in present day Ukraine, during the Crimean War, soldiers of the British light cavalry had rushed towards the valley of death on the orders of their commander, Lord Cardigan. Over 100 British soldiers perished in the military engagement with Russians. The valour of the light brigade became an inspiration for English poet Alfred Tennyson’s moving tribute ‘Charge of the Light Brigade’. The bench made no effort to hide its disappointment with the SEC. “At a time when the second wave of Covid-19 is sweeping the state, you released the poll schedule for municipal polls in seven municipal bodies. And, most of these poll-bound areas are now witnessing a high number of positive cases,” the bench said, addressing SEC’s secretary Ashok Kumar, who was present before the virtual court. Attempting to answer a volley of queries shot by the bench, the secretary said they had asked for remarks from the state government as late as April 19. However, the state said it wants to go ahead, he said. The bench told him that SEC, an independent authority, has to assess the situation and take a calibrated decision. “You should have taken the impending danger to the lives of lakhs of voters and thousands of poll staff and police into consideration before announcing the poll schedule,” the bench said. Ashok Kumar said that they had banned victory rallies. The bench felt that SEC should have deferred the polls till the abatement of the current Covid-19 second wave. Expressing concern for the 7,695 poll staff and 2,557 policemen, who were now heading for dangerous duty in the midst of the second wave, the bench read out some lines from Tennyson’s poem, praising the valor of the British soldiers who laid down their lives in the Crimean War.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-rips-sec-for-holding-civic-polls/articleshow/82318232.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad Covid crisis: Desperation rams into barricade||AHMEDABAD: In what could be described as a desperate measure to get one elusive Covid bed, a driver rammed his autorickshaw into the police barricade at Dhanvantari Covid Hospital at Gujarat University Convention Centre on Thursday morning. The unidentified man was asked to go back by police after which he tried to enter the premises in a last-ditch attempt. The video of the incident went viral on Thursday even as the man could not get his 70-year-old relative admitted to the hospital, said sources on the spot. “The family was pleading with the staff as the woman’s oxygen level was alarmingly dipping. They wanted to get in, but the police personnel on duty said that they would require a token to get in,” said an eyewitness. “After minutes of arguments, the man rammed his auto into the barricade as seven police personnel were trying to stop the vehicle.” But the efforts were in vain as the police personnel reportedly got hold of the driver and sent him back. He, however, was not alone. Despite the administration’s instructions that only those with tokens will be given entry, hundreds turned up at the facility throughout the day. Jayesh Rathod, a resident of Rakhial, was among those who visited the centre on Thursday evening, hours after the incident. “We were told to come back on Friday morning from 8am to 9am with reports. The doctors will assess a patient’s condition and then decide on admission,” he said. “Is there any guarantee that a patient will turn critical only the next morning?” Rathod went on to say: “Isn’t the HC order of any meaning…that a critical patient must get treatment? We’ll try our luck elsewhere as almost all hospitals are full.” Sources associated with the hospital said that one must treat the hospital as a makeshift arrangement which has been made operational in a short time given the pandemic. “We are pooling in all possible resources and increasing the bed capacity in a phase-wise manner,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/desperation-rams-into-barricade/articleshow/82316524.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||After Serum, BB cuts Covaxin dose price to Rs 400 for states||HYDERABAD: A day after Serum Institute of India (SII) announced a Rs 100 per dose cut in Covishield price for state governments, Bharat Biotech followed suit with a price reduction of Rs 200 per dose for Covaxin. On Thursday, Bharat Biotech announced that it was cutting Covaxin price from Rs 600 per dose to Rs 400 per dose for state governments. With this reduction, the price gap between Covaxin and Covishield for state governments is down to just Rs 100 per dose. Bharat Biotech - COVAXIN® Announcement - April 29, 2021 https://t.co/RgnROIfUCe— BharatBiotech (@BharatBiotech) 1619698339000The price for private hospitals, however, remains unchanged at Rs 1,200 per dose. The Hyderabad-based vaccine-maker had already said that it would stick to its original pricing of Rs 150 per dose for the Centre. “Bharat Biotech is deeply concerned with the critical pandemic circumstances that India is facing at this time. Recognising the enormous challenges to the public health care system, we have made Covaxin available to state governments at a price of Rs 400 per dose,” the company said in its announcement. “We wish to be transparent in our approach to pricing which was determined by internally funded product development, several operational-intensive BSL-3 manufacturing facilities (the first of its kind in the country) and clinical trials. We wish to champion ‘Innovation in India’ and our commitment to public health is absolute!” it added. In its tweet on the price reduction, the company said: “With the greater part of the organisation’s facilities and resources being diverted to Covid-19 vaccines, we continue to work towards offering superior Covid-19 vaccines and sincerely wish that this gesture enables our country towards a faster recovery.” While announcing the pricing of Covaxin for state governments and private hospitals on April 24, 2021, Bharat Biotech had said that Covaxin being an inactivated and highly purified vaccine, its manufacturing was expensive due to very low process yields. “Recovering costs is essential in the journey of innovation towards other vaccines such as intranasal Covid-19, chikunguniya, Zika, cholera and others. Our core mission for the last 25 years has been to provide affordable, yet world-class healthcare solutions for the globe,” it had said. On Wednesday, SII’s Adar Poonawalla had tweeted about the Covishield price reduction and termed it as a philanthropic gesture after a huge public outcry over vaccine makers profiteering at a time when the pandemic is ravaging the country. “As a philanthropic gesture, I hereby reduce the price to the states from Rs 400 to Rs 300 per dose, effective immediately; this will save thousands of crores of state funds going forward. This will enable more vaccinations and save countless lives,” Poonawalla had tweeted. SII has pegged the Covishield prices for private hospitals at Rs 600 per dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-serum-bb-cuts-covaxin-dose-price-to-rs-400-for-states/articleshow/82318245.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Chandigarh||Oxygen supply: UT ropes in two more private vendors||Chandigarh: For the smooth supply of medical grade oxygen, the UT administration has roped in two more private vendors for refilling of cylinders to be used by health institutions of the city.Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for managing oxygen supply in UT, said, “The ministry of health and family welfare has fixed the daily quota of 20MT of medical oxygen for UT from Inox, Barotiwala. This medical oxygen is being utilised for GMH-16, GMCH-32 and the Covid hospital in Sector 48. Recently, three oxygen generation plants were commissioned at these three hospitals.”However, there is an additional requirement for refilling of oxygen in cylinders in these three government hospitals. The private healthcare institutions also require medical oxygen and PGIMER’s requirement is met from a separate quota. After meeting the daily requirements of GMCH-32, GMH-16 and Sector 48 Covid hospital, the remaining oxygen, out of 20MT quota of the UT, will be provided to the private refilling vendors to cater to the needs of the other government hospitals and private healthcare institutions in the city.At present, Anaesthetic Gases Pvt Ltd (AGPL), Sector 22-A, is the approved private refilling vendor for GMCH-32, GMH-16 and Sector 48 Covid hospital. AGPL is also refilling cylinders for private institutions.To avoid rush at a single vendor and ensure smooth supply, two more vendors—Chandigarh Gases, Industrial Area, Phase I, and Super Gases, Derabassi—will also provide oxygen, out of the 20MT quota of UT, for refilling cylinders for both government and private institutes. Garg said GMH-16 medical officer Dr Manjit Singh would coordinate with Inox and ensure that the daily 20MT quota medical oxygen was rationally distributed among GMCH-32, GMH-16 and Sector 48 Covid hospital. The quantity of medical oxygen provided to the private refilling vendors and supplied by them to healthcare institutions would be regularly monitored by Dr Manjit Singh. The re-filling will be done on the rates approved for the GMCH-32.“Any of the private refilling vendors, who have been provided medical oxygen out of the UT quota, will not charge higher than the approved rate,” said Garg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/oxygen-supply-ut-ropes-in-two-more-private-vendors/articleshow/82316515.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Hyderabad||Despite GO, schools conduct exams as per previous schedule||HYDERABAD: To bypass the orders issued by the state government, schools are just changing the name of final examinations to assignments, projects, among others and are still conducting them as per the previous schedule. Although summer holidays were announced from April 27, some schools announced that they will remain open until the second week of May. “My son’s school sent out a message saying that students have to appear for assignments for each subject,” said a parent. Another parent said that his children were sent a set of questions every day and they were asked to write their answers.  “My sons were asked to mail all answers for all subjects on May 1,” said a parent, whose sons are in class 4 and class 7. Parents said that instead of cancelling the examinations as per the state government orders, schools are coming up with different ideas to conduct exams and online classes. On April 25, the Telangana government had announced that all students of class 1 to class 9 will be promoted to the next class without exams. The decision was taken due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. The government has also announced summer vacation for all schools and junior colleges from April 27 to May 31. “Many schools are still continuing with the exams in one form or the other. When the government has officially announced the closure of schools for the academic year 2020-21, why are the schools continuing with any activities—exams, assignments, projects, or classes, among others. Why can’t they simply follow the orders,” questioned VV Sharma of the Indian Parents Association. He said that when it comes to CBSE class 10 students, schools are in fact informing parents that they would submit their ward’s internal marks only if they clear fee dues. The education department officials, meanwhile, said that action would be initiated against schools violating government orders by conducting exams or online classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/despite-go-schools-conduct-exams-as-per-previous-schedule/articleshow/82316516.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Will resume drive at day’s notice if we get stock, says BMC||Mumbai: Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that the BMC was forced to take the decision to halt Covid-19 vaccinations for three days looking at the hardship people have been going through. On Wednesday night, Mumbai had received 76,000 doses. “After the day’s vaccination, we would have been left with merely 20,000 doses. For that much, it made little sense to keep so many centres open. Many would have stood in queues, hopeful of getting doses,” he said.Kakani added if BMC receives stocks in between, the drive would be started again with a day’s notice. In Mumbai, a little over 61% of the estimated 40 lakh eligible for vaccination have taken the first dose, while merely 12% have taken both the doses.Earlier in the day, Pednekar, who dropped in to the Nesco vaccination centre in Goregaon, urged citizens to leave their homes only after getting themselves registered on CoWin. A few citizens, who had queued up at Nesco for hours, complained to the mayor about the lack of planning. “If so many people crowd at vaccination centres, chances of getting infected by Covid cannot be ruled out,” she told the gathering.AMC Bhide, too, tried to allay the fears of people through a series of tweets reiterating that Mumbai will not start mass vaccination for the 18-plus category from May 1 and there would be adequate scope for those 45 and above to get vaccinated. Requesting senior citizens to not crowd or stand in long queues, she said vaccine was in short supply for now. She added those who have taken their first dose are reasonably protected. “Even if there is a slight delay in getting their 2nd dose, that should not be a major problem. Senior citizens should not get scared because of that,” she tweeted.“Even when new drive for 18-44 starts, the centres available now will continue to remain active for 45+ years citizens. BMC will add at least 500 more public and private centres for new drive,” she wrote in a tweet. She also urged people to double-mask while coming to vaccination centres. The vaccine crisis was evident at the state level too, where vaccination on Wednesday had dropped to 2,37,700 from 3,88,247 on Tuesday and the record-breaking 5,34,372 vaccinations on Monday. The Centre, for the second day in a row, downplayed the vaccine shortage in Maharashtra by saying that it has given 1.63 crore doses, of which 1.56 crore have been consumed. There was a balance of 7.49 lakh vaccine doses still available with the state. State officials maintained that most of the stocks were with district and vaccination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-will-resume-drive-at-days-notice-if-we-get-stock-says-bmc/articleshow/82317284.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Shopkeepers who heard the gunshots tried to stop the offenders but the accused hurled stones at them and threatened them with their gun. “My cousin called me up and informed me that my uncle Mirza Subhan Ali Baig was shot at near HDFC ATM in Kukatpally. I rushed to the hospital where he was admitted and came to know that he succumbed to injuries. Then I came to the crime scene to figure out how such an incident would have happened during broad daylight,” said Baig’s nephew Mirza Ashraf Ali Baig. 74-year-old Subhan Ali Baig’s family lives at Borabanda and for over a decade he had been working as an armed security guard. Subhan Ali Baig is survived by his wife and nine children. “My uncle always wanted to work. He never wanted to sit at home. He wanted to do his job sincerely and while trying to prevent the robbery he lost his life,” Ashraf said. A local businessman, Narsimha Reddy, who runs a fast food centre opposite to the ATM centre, had also tried to stop the robbers. “I heard two shots and went towards the ATM to see what happened. The security guard was lying on the floor with his gun next to him and another man was sitting next to him with injury to his leg. I saw a cash bundle on the floor and two people trying to escape with it. One of them was carrying a fire arm. Me and another person tried to stop them and they hurled stones at us, threatened us with gun and fled on the bike,” Reddy said. A police officer who was investigating the case said that the two offenders wore helmets and a younger security guard might have possibly thwarted the robbery. “By looking at the CCTV footage, it appears more like a panic firing. The offenders were in their twenties,” said an investigator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shopkeepers-tried-to-stop-atm-robbers/articleshow/82316513.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The north Delhi police has also arrested four persons. The police are going to suggest to court possible use of the seized machines. The cops are trying to work around some legal hurdles regarding use of seized case properties. The gang was busted after a person complained about the racket on Twitter. The victim tweeted that oxygen concentrators were being sold for Rs 95,000 at Mittal’s Store in Shastri Nagar and also provided a mobile phone number. “Keeping in view the gravity of allegations and sensitivity of the matter, an enquiry was conducted and teams of North district police were directed to conduct a discreet probe,” DCP (north) Anto Alphonse said. A technical investigation of the given mobile number revealed that it was registered in the name of a woman who stayed in Shastri Nagar. At the given address, a shop, named Narang Sons, Roby Hosiery, was found on the ground floor of a residential complex. A team comprising ACP Umashankar, sub-inspector Rajpal and others conducted a recce and deployed informers. The alleged number was constantly found in various locations and the owner was avoiding any contact. The team raided many places and finally caught one Pawan Mittal after two days’ efforts. Two oxygen concentrators along with adapters were seized. Mittal admitted that to make most of the Covid crisis, he had started selling oxygen concentrators for Rs 90,000 to Rs 1.10 lakh, more than double the cost price. He had bought the machines from one Himanshu Khurana, who runs a shop, Dhingra Bags, at Sadar Bazar. Following his leads, co-accused Khurana was apprehended who said he had bought machines from Himanshu and Ayush Handa, who were distributors indulging in blackmarketing. Immediately, inspector Sunil and his team were involved and a raid was conducted. Both suspects, who are brothers and live in Model Town, were arrested and 168 oxygen concentrators and adapters were seized from an under-construction building. An Audi car owned by Handa Telecom and a Mercedes car owned by Ayush were also seized. An FIR under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and Epidemic Diseases Act has been registered. The accused are being questioned to determine the number of oxygen concentrators they had sold. “Strict action is being taken against blackmarketers who are trying to make quick money by hoarding live-saving drugs/equipment and selling them at high prices. Regular checks and raids are being conducted on every complaint,” the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/170-oxygen-concentrators-seized-4-held/articleshow/82317286.cms||---

The UFERWAS will share data with the state government on the daily Covid-19 cases, district-wise status of cases, vaccination drive and available beds in hospitals and other information to help people in need. Major G Shiva Kiran (Retd), an UFERWAS executive committee member, came up with the idea of developing the GIS mapping system based on the state government’s data. “The UFERWAS is willing to join hands with the Telangana medical and health department to share GIS maps of people who got the first dose of vaccine in each GHMC ward,” UFERWAS member Shiva Kiran told TOI. “In UFERWAS, we have highly-qualified retired government officials, who are also members of private MNCs who will assist in preparing the GIS maps on a daily basis, if the state government give its nod,” said Shiva Kiran, and added that the government can incorporate the data in its daily Covid-19 bulletin. Sharing GIS data, Shiva Kiran said that cases in Nizamabad, Kamareddy, Medak, Mulugu, Bhadradri and Khammam were reducing. An increase in cases has been witnessed in other districts including Sangareddy, Vikarabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri, Nalgonda and Suryapet.

In the elections held recently, the BJP-supported panel managed to win only nine seats in the 20-member council. An equal number of opposition-backed candidates emerged victorious, along with two independents. “Around 68% of Mapusa’s citizens voted against BJP, and people came out aggressively on election day to vote them out for not undertaking any development in the town for the last 25 years,” said president of North Goa Congress committee Vijay Bhike. Bhike said that BJP used its government machinery to manipulate the ward reservations in Mapusa to make place for their councillors, but failed after Congress along with the opposition fought the battle in Supreme Court and won the case. He alleged that BJP is using its money and muscle power to break councillors from the opposition and are even threatening to file cases against the councillors and transfer their family members who are working as govoernment employees. Even job offers are being made to them and their close aides, Bhike alleged. “This is not new to us. This buying and threatening representatives and going against the people’s mandate is in their ideology,” Bhike added. The BJP-backed panel was confident of winning at least 16 seats under local MLA Joshua D’Souza, former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar and former chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s aide Rupesh Kamat. Chief minister Pramod Sawant and state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade had also campaigned in Mapusa. Sources said that factionalism in BJP was one reason for the panel winning only nine seats.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Hotel, retail bodies seek relief to dodge 2nd wave||MUMBAI: Hoteliers in the state have written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a bailout package for the lockdown period to save the industry from its long-term impact. Similarly, retailers have also written to the finance minister for relaxation in various fees to avoid an NPA (non-performing assets) situation. The hospitality industry has suffered a major setback during the previous lockdown. “We had just started rebuilding our businesses gradually despite a lack of assistance from both the central and state governments. But the prevailing situation is leading to reverse migration of the workforce all over again. This may result in a massive job loss not only in the hospitality trade but also across ancillary services,” a letter by AHAR president Shivanand Shetty said. “We seek immediate bailout package that includes collateral free loans at normal interest rate with moratorium of one year on existing loans, onetime tax rebate equivalent to 50% of wages payable for the period of lockdown, contributions to Employees Provident Fund and Employees Insurance Schemes for the next six months, and deferment of direct and indirect tax liabilities by six months to one year,” Shetty said in his appeal. Similarly, Retailers Association of India (RAI) has sought immediate intervention of the finance minister to prevent the sector from slipping into a position of irretrievable financial damage. Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, RAI, said, “As of now, almost 80% of the retail stores are closed due to various restrictions. The cash inflow of the industry has come to a standstill, while the fixed operating costs remain intact.” RAI’s recommendations include extending benefits of funds under emergency credit line guarantee scheme, a moratorium on principal and interest for six months, and ad-hoc working capital loans of 30% more than current limits so that critical payments like salaries and wages can be made, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hotel-retail-bodies-write-to-pm-seek-relief-package-to-dodge-second-wave/articleshow/82318252.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The 1MW plant will come up over the clear water tank and the Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology (CREST) will run it through a selected private player.The project will come up under Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) mode, under which the private company will install solar energy plants on the property and in return charge from the building owner a much lower tariff than the normal electricity rate for about 15 or 25 years or whatever period is agreed in the tender. In the MC’s project, the agreement will be for 25 years. With this mode, the MC will be able to save around Rs 26 lakh annually by giving less power tariff of the water works. “In RESCO mode, we will have to pay Rs 3.33 per unit to the company as power tariff, and currently we are paying Rs 5.2 per unit. Therefore, it will give us a benefit of around Rs 26 lakh annually,” an MC officer said.Sources in the MC said the Sector 39 water works has over six big tanks and all were under renovation to enhance their water storage capacity. If this project remains successful, all the tanks will have solar plants. “Deliberations for the project were going on for the past few months and senior engineering officers had also held meetings with the CREST officials. This is the first project to be matured,” sources said.Target of 69MWThe Central government had given the Chandigarh administration a target to install 69MW solar plants in the entire city by 2022. The CREST has managed to install plants of 39.426MW so far, covering both government as well as private buildings. But to meet the target, the CREST has to install more solar plants, for which different schemes are being offered to people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-to-soon-have-first-solar-plant-at-sec-39-water-works/articleshow/82316517.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Hyderabad||Chicken prices drop to Rs 160/kg owing to curfew in Maharashtra, Karnataka||HYDERABAD: Early closure of hotels and restaurants due to night curfew in addition to reduced import to neighbouring states owing to lockdown has resulted in massive drop in skinless chicken prices from Rs 280 per kg few weeks ago to Rs 160 per kg in the retail market on Thursday. Earlier this month, broiler chicken had become costlier by 30 per cent due to rising demand and lower production. While the production has come back to normal, reduced demand from the hospitality industry due to night curfew in Telangana for the last one week has led to massive reduction in demand. “The hospitality industry accounts for almost 30 per cent of the total revenue of the poultry industry. Since hotels, restaurants and pubs are closing down by 8 pm, the consumption at these places has reduced drastically over the last one week,” said Ranjit Reddy, president, Telangana Poultry Breeders Association. Telangana produces close to four crore kilograms of chicken every month. What’s made matters worse is lockdown declared in neighbouring states by the state governments. “Lockdown imposed by neighbouring states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka has severely affected the inflow and outflow of chicken in these states. Due to the lockdown in neighbouring states, birds from those states are also coming to Telangana, resulting in an imbalance in supply and demand thereby impacting the chicken prices,” said Vinay Samudrala, owner of a hatchery in Warangal. Chicken shop owners have attributed the dip in chicken prices to drop in marriages, celebrations and functions across the city. “Usually during summers, the prices of chicken are on the higher side due to rising temperatures and increase in bird feed prices. However, this year, even though the prices of chicken have dropped, not many people are coming forward to buy chicken,” said Ashok, owner of a chicken shop in Begumpet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chicken-prices-drop-to-rs-160/kg-owing-to-curfew-in-maharashtra-karnataka/articleshow/82316530.cms||Preeti Biswas

Summer heat and closure of markets by 8 pm has impacted sales of several small-scale businesses drastically. “During summer, many people step out mostly during evening to escape the heat. Now, owing to the night curfew, we are unable to sell our products much as the customer base for walk-ins has dropped almost by 60%,” said the manager of a bakery that has outlets across the city. He added that the sales are largely for pre-orders. Even Ramzaan and Ugadi could not help vendors as the sales in markets across the city remain nominal. “During Ramzaan, our sales are high as people step out for shopping, especially during evening. However, this year, due to the curfew, we have to shut shop by 8 pm due to which we are barely making any profit,” said Majid Khan, a shopkeeper in Old City.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bakeries-struggle-to-do-business/articleshow/82316525.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Robbers shoot ATM cash van guard in city, scoot with Rs 5 lakh||HYDERABAD: A former CRPF jawan working as a security guard of a cash van was killed and his colleague injured when armed robbers opened fire at an HDFC Bank’s ATM kiosk in Hyderabad’s busy Kukatpally area in broad daylight on Thursday. The two assailants escaped with Rs 5 lakh cash. Police said the offenders followed the cash van from Begumpet to Kukatpally, covering a distance of 12 km, before opening fire on 74-year-old security guard Mirza Subhan Ali Baig. Police launched a manhunt to nab the duo. Ali Baig, who was employed with ATM cash replenishment company Writer Safeguard Private Limited for the past four years, suffered a bullet injury just below his chest and fell down. He succumbed at a hospital later. ATM officer Ch Srinivas (33) also suffered an injury when a bullet hit him below his knee. At 1.50 pm, the two offenders riding a black Pulsar bike without a registration number, stopped at the ATM centre at Patel Kunta in Kukatpally. They rushed to the kiosk where Ali Baig, Srinivas and his assistant Naveen were about to load Rs 12 lakh in the ATM machine. The unidentified duo tried to snatch a cash bundle from the Writer Safeguard staffers, who resisted the robbery bid. “One of the robbers, who was carrying a short firearm, opened fire. One round hit Ali Baig near his chest. Another bullet hit Srinivas right below his knee. The accused managed to snatch a Rs 5 lakh bundle and fled from the spot on their bike towards Allwyn Colony, Jagadgirigutta,” Madhapur deputy commissioner of police M Venkateshwarulu said. During a preliminary probe, cops found out that the assailants trailed the cash van after it set out from HDFC Bank’s Begumpet branch with Rs 2.07 crore cash. “The van first stopped at Vivekananda Nagar and loaded Rs 10 lakh in an ATM kiosk there. It was in their second stop, the Writer Safeguard staff were attacked,” the DCP said. The staffers were entrusted with replenishing cash at HDFC Bank ATM centres when the attack took place. The armed robbers fired three rounds and two of them hit the victims. Ali Baig had no time to react and take out the double-barrel gun he was carrying, police said. “The third round pierced the ATM centre’s glass door. Along with two live rounds, the magazine also fell at the spot. We suspect that the duo used a country-made firearm,” said a Clues Team official. HDFC Bank said they will fully cooperate with police during the investigation. “We deeply regret the incident that happened outside one of our ATMs in which one of the employees of a CIT agency lost his life. Our hearts go out to the bereaved as we keep them in our thoughts and prayers,” a spokesman said. Based on a complaint lodged by Writer Safeguard firm, Kukatpally police registered a case. Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar visited the spot where the firing took place. Five special teams comprising law and order and Special Operations Team sleuths were formed to catch the offenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/robbers-shoot-atm-cash-van-guard-in-city-scoot-with-rs-5l/articleshow/82318253.cms||Mahesh Buddi

---||Mumbai||Give vaccine in 2 shifts, one just for elderly and 45+: Maharashtra task force||Mumbai: With long queues being reported outside vaccination centres and senior citizens having to wait in the sun, the state’s Covid task force has suggested that vaccinations be done in two shifts. While the morning shift can be for senior citizens and those above 45, the evening shift can be for those who are between ages 18 and 45 once vaccination for the category begins. It has also asked the stategovernment to increase the number of vaccination centres and the timings, reports Chaitanya Marpakwar. Dr Sanjay Oak, head of the task force, said, “The centres can operate in two shifts. Morning shift for 45 and above and senior citizens. In this slot, there can be space for differently-abled persons between 18-45. The others in the age group of 18-45 should be vaccinated in the evening shift.” He said the task force had also advised the government to rope in volunteers from NSS and NCC to manage registration and queues at vaccination centres. The number of daily Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in Maharashtra hit a record high of five lakh on Monday. However, immunisation centres in Mumbai have been seeing chaotic scenes as thousands have been lining up outside facilities from 6 am onwards. Senior citizens have been forced to wait in the sun for four to five hours in serpentine queues. Social media has been abuzz with complaints of CoWin not yielding appointments or cancelling them, forcing many to walk into centres and wait with those who were unregistered. An acute shortage of doses was experienced at nearly all private centres over the past week, prompting many of the centres to stop inoculation. So far, over 7.5 lakh senior citizens have taken the first dose in Mumbai, while 1.44 lakh have taken both doses. Similarly, fewer than 50,000 from the age group of 45-59 have taken the second dose, while over 7.48 lakh have taken the first one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/give-vaccine-in-2-shifts-one-just-for-elderly-and-45-maharashtra-task-force/articleshow/82318254.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Mumbai||70k serious patients in Maharashtra, but only 800 tocilizumab doses||Mumbai: The Centre’s allocation of only 800 doses of tocilizumab for Maharashtra that has nearly 70,000 serious Covid patients put officials in a quandary over distribution. The Centre on Tuesday allocated Maharashtra the biggest share of 3,245 doses it imported from Roche that markets the drug in India through Cipla. After keeping aside 200 doses for state hospitals and 40 for BMC, FDA was left with 560 to be distributed in the state. A committee was formed with FDA commissioner Parimal Singh, medical education head Dr T P Lahane and few other members to distribute it evenly. Pune district was allocated 87, followed by Nagpur (63) and Thane (60). Only 57 doses were allocated to Mumbai’s private hospitals. Districts like Sindhudurg and Hingoli received one dose each, while Gadchiroli and Washim got 3 and 2 doses respectively. An FDA official said distribution became an issue as they could not decide which hospitals should be given how much as doses were limited. “In Mumbai, neither the Collector’s office, nor BMC, wants to take responsibility to distribute Remdesivir and tocilizumab,” said an FDA official. Many private hospitals said the drugs landed here on Wednesday and officials didn’t distribute it till late on Thursday. “Even if there is one dose, they should have promptly distributed it, so that that one patient can be saved. In most cases, only one dose may be needed but it has to be given on time,” a hospital owner said. By late on Thursday, calls from senior political leaders were made to hurry up distribution.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Fire extinguishers sold as O2 cylinders, 2 held in Dwarka||NEW DELHI: In a wicked act, two men were allegedly selling fire extinguishers in the name of oxygen cylinders to those in need. They were charging Rs 10,000 for each unit. They have been arrested and identified as 19-year-old Ashutosh and his friend Ayush (22), both residents of Vikas Puri. Five fire extinguishers were recovered from the duo who targeted people in Dwarka. The forgery came to light when police received a complaint from Geeta Arora, a resident of Bindapur. One of her relatives was suffering from Covid-19 and having a breathing issue. “Arora said that she first tried to find a bed in a hospital for her relative but in vain. Since her relative’s saturation levels were low, she decided to arrange for an oxygen cylinder herself. She said the two men promised to deliver her one oxygen cylinder. But after she made the payment, they delivered a fire extinguisher,” said deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena. When the complainant later tried to contact the two men, they did not receive her call. “She then reported the matter to police and we registered a case of cheating at Uttam Nagar police station. Multiple teams were set up to track the suspects. On Thursday, information was received about the whereabouts of the two accused. Following an early morning raid, both of them were arrested,” Meena said. During interrogation, both Ashutosh and Ayush confessed to have sold fire extinguishers to people who were in dire need of oxygen cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fire-extinguishers-sold-as-o2-cylinders/articleshow/82317304.cms||---
---||Goa||Growing in seasonal nallah, wild flower turns out to be rare species||KERI: The Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary is home to a rich variety of wild flowers. Recently, wildlifers spotted the flower Barleria courtallica, endemic to peninsular India, inside the sanctuary. While the variants of the species are cultivated in private gardens, mainly in villages, the flowers are commonly seen to bloom in winter. Barleria courtallica, locally known as gotala, is its wild variety. The cultivated flowers are strung into garlands for women to wear in their hair and are normally of the genus Barleria cristata, and the flowers are of the Philippine violet and white colours type. Wildlifers were therefore thrilled to chance upon the wild variety of Barleria courtallica in a seasonal nallah that originates in the sacred grove of Madiyat of Gulle in Sattari. “I saw the Barleria courtallica in the blooming stage,” said wildlifer Gajanan Shetye. Vedant Kerkar of Keri said, “When we were trekking through the forests, we found the yellow throated flower and were happy to see it in its natural glory.” The Western Ghats area of Goa showcases an excellent diversity of the Barleria, which is one of the largest genera of the family acanthaceae. The genus comprises about 254 species and eight varieties. Barleria are known for its large attractive flowers, which are found in the colours purple, pink, white and yellow. Four species have been identified as endemic and seven as rare by researchers thus far. Yellow throated Barleria is a prickly shrub with blue flowers. Its yellow throat is borne in glandular hairy tawny spikes. It is also known to have ethnobotanical value as a decoction of the root is prescribed in the treatment of rheumatism and pneumonia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/growing-in-seasonal-nallah-wild-flower-turns-out-to-be-rare-species/articleshow/82317300.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The announcement came a day after the Uttarakhand high court (HC) reprimanded the state government for holding the Kumbh Mela despite the pandemic and becoming a ‘laughing stock’. The yatra was scheduled to begin next month. The division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma had also made the oral observation that the prospect of conducting the Char Dham Yatra in the midst of a raging pandemic is “a frightening one”. The announcement regarding the yatra being suspended was made by chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat who also added that the shrines will open as per their announced dates although no pilgrims will be allowed in the temples. “Only priests will be allowed to conduct puja and other rituals,” the CM added. The Badrinath shrine is slated to open on May 18, Kedarnath on May 17 while the portals of Gangotri and Yamunotri will open on May 15. According to senior officials of Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board (UTDB), the decision to suspend the yatra was taken after the officials in the respective districts, Uttarkashi, Chamoli and Rudraprayag expressed helplessness in managing the yatra amid surge in cases of Covid-19 in the hills. Ravinath Raman, CEO of the Devasthanam board which administers the shrines, said that the idea of the yatra taking place symbolically was also discussed and eventually, it was decided to suspend the yatra until the situation became better. Notably, last year, too, the then Trivendra Rawat government had suspended the yatra in the initial months although local residents and those from within the state were allowed to go to the shrines. The yatra was subsequently started in July. Talking to TOI, tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said that unlike last year when the yatra was suspended, this time, not even locals will be allowed to visit the shrines. “The priests will also have to undergo an RT-PCR test before participating in rituals,” he said, adding that even if the yatra were to start later in the year, people will have to bring their RT-PCR- negative report or documents certifying two doses of vaccination. On comparisons between Char Dham Yatra and Kumbh, Maharaj said that “we cannot compare Kumbh with Char Dham Yatra as lakhs of people do not gather at just one place for the yatra and we manage things as per the carrying capacity of the shrines.” Meanwhile, opposition leaders welcomed the move with veteran Congress leader and ex-CM Harish Rawat saying that “the decision was the need of the hour.” Congress president Pritam Singh said that “since the beginning, we were saying that there should be no Kumbh or Char Dham Yatra but this government only listens when the HC slams them; still it’s better late than never.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-suspends-char-dham-yatra-for-pilgrims-shrines-to-open-as-per-schedule/articleshow/82315817.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Hyderabad||Country to face vaccine shortages till July: Indian School of Business study||HYDERABAD: As the country opens up vaccinations for 18-44-year-olds, Indian School of Business (ISB), has pointed out that the current level of vaccine supplies will not be enough to sustain even the vaccination rate seen in the first week of April. In its presentation to NITI Aayog recently, ISB also indicated that many states will continue to experience vaccine shortages till the end of July this year. The presentation made by ISB’s Professor Sarang Deo, Professor Sripad Devalkar and research associates Abhishek Reddy and Syed Junaid outlined in detail the challenges related to the vaccination roll-out in India. Deo pointed out that the existing supply of vaccines is not adequate to achieve the same vaccination rates as the first week of April. On an average, 34.6 lakh vaccinations were performed per day in the first week of April, including both first and second doses. “The average vaccination rate masks considerable variability across rates. Typically, the vaccination rate is lowest on Sunday and highest on Monday. In the first week of April, while average daily vaccination rate was 34.6 lakh doses, it was only 17.3 lakh on April 4 (Sunday) and as high as 45 lakh doses on April 5 (Monday),” Devalkar said. As on April 8 (at 12.30 pm), around 11.13 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines were delivered by Centre to states and Union territories, of which 9.16 crore doses were consumed and 1.97 crore doses were available. As on April 29, around 15 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses have been consumed and 1.27 crore doses are available for vaccination, data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare revealed. Deo pointed out there were enough stocks of vaccines initially produced and distributed to the states because the initial uptick of vaccination was very low. But when the vaccination rate started picking up, there was only enough stock to cover for the uptick in first week of April. As per the study, the government should also be cognisant about limitations in vaccine delivery capacity. “In most states, vaccination has not really penetrated far beyond urban and semi-urban areas. The lowest level in the public health system, where vaccinations are done, is primary health centre (PHC). In contrast, routine immunisations are done at anganwadis, which are below the PHC,” Deo explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/country-to-face-vaccine-shortages-till-july-isb-study/articleshow/82316976.cms||Swati Rathor

The fraud was discovered by a special team formed to issue e-passes, who found that someone was repeatedly applying for e-passes from the same IP address. “We identified the person as Dhanaji Gaganmale (21),” additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale told TOI, adding, “We monitored his movements for two days and found that he was helping his customers obtain e-passes to travel out of Pune.” A police team led by inspector Shilpa Chavan took Gaganmale into custody after he issued fake e-passes to two decoy customers. “He had tampered with three original passes. He retained the Maharashtra police name and logo, and changed the name and other details,” Morale said. The police recovered 11 e-passes from Gaganmale. He was produced before a magisterial court in Pune cantonment and remanded in police custody till May 4. Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Shrinivas Ghadge said Gaganmale posted an advertisement on a social networking site, asking people to contact him for e-passes. “He received 11 requests and charged Rs1,000 per person. The suspect made the necessary changes on a copy of the original pass and gave them to customers,” Ghadge said. Police said Gaganmale, a mechanical engineering graduate, would assist his uncle in his tours and travels business. “He also rents his car to customers. We have recovered two mobile phones and a laptop from his residence. We are questioning him to find out how many fake e-passes he issued since the facility was launched on April 23,” senior inspector Hemant Patil from the crime branch (unit V) said.

But that hardly seems to be the case. While hospitalisation of Covid-19 patients is headed northwards, Remdesivir availability is going in the opposite direction. From around 2,740 vials in the middle of this month, the city has been receiving around just 1,100 vials since the last few days. This went down to as low as 950 on Wednesday. Data shared on April 5, when the distributors and retailers were selling the injection, reveals that 5,432 injections were supplied on that day. The administration has devised a system wherein a Covid hospital needing Remdesivir has to send its requisition in a prescribed format on an email that is accessed by the district collectorate. Injections are then allocated to hospitals and these have to be collected from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) office by a representative of the hospital. Despite government taking over the Remdesivir distribution, relatives of many patients are seen running around to get t vial. Hospitals complain that they are not getting enough stock. At times, the patients insist on the doctor handing over the prescription to them so that they can procure the injection. An official in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) said that despite clear guidelines, it has been found that hospitals are giving prescriptions to patients. Gujarat State Chemist and Druggist Association president Alpesh Patel said that the fall in supply despite the rise in availability was because the demand had gone up drastically. “Covid was at peak in just four five states earlier this month, now it has gripped over several states. The increase in demand is far higher than the increase in supply,” he said. Patel warned that those procuring the drug from the market should be extra careful. “The injection in the black market could be spurious. There is no supply in the trade channels. People should look for an injection with a proper bill if someone is offering them one,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/availability-demand-go-opposite-ways/articleshow/82315178.cms||Sachin Sharma

It has also registered the highest official deaths in a day so far, with 89 people succumbing to the virus taking the toll to 2,480. The new cases recorded on Thursday are out of 97,972 samples tested in 24 hours, taking the positivity rate to 13.35% in Bihar. The number of samples tested in 24 hours till Wednesday was less than Wednesday's when 1,03,895 samples were tested. Of the total, 28,592 samples tested through RT-PCR and 2,653 through TrueNat. Health department special secretary Manoj Kumar said there was a drop in the number of samples tested through RT-PCR as they were not doing pool testing because of the high positivity rate. He further said the department will install 100 TrueNat machines in various districts that can test 7,000 samples daily. Most deaths on Thursday were in Patna where 26 people died after being infected with the virus, followed by 12 deaths in Bhagalpur, 10 in West Champaran. Deaths reported from some other districts are Nalanda (7), Muzaffarpur (5), Darbhanga (4) and Siwan (4). The NMCH reported 12 deaths with 11 of them from the Patna district. The youngest deceased was a 19-year-old woman from Malsalami. While 32 patients got admitted, 29 discharged on Thursday, there are 366 patients in the hospital. NMCH further claimed that there were 134 vacant beds, though attendants cited problems in getting a bed in the hospital. AIIMS-Patna reported six deaths, of which three were Patna residents. While 43 patients are under treatment, 37 got discharged, and as of Thursday, there were 309 patients in the hospital. Of the total 13,098 new cases, Patna registered the maximum with 2,186 people testing positive, taking the caseload to 15,540. Among the other districts, Gaya recorded 1,128 cases, Begusarai (666) West Champaran (590), Muzaffarpur (509), Samastipur (499) and Purnia (483).

---||Hyderabad||Telangana has received lowest supply of doses among southern states||HYDERABAD: While there is a shortage of supply of Covid-19 vaccines ahead of the launch of vaccination drive for 18-44-year-olds, data on supply of vaccine doses show that Telangana has received the lowest number of doses among southern states. While the state has performed better than several states in terms of vaccine wastage, it had received only around 46 lakh doses till April 28. Maharashtra leads the charts for vaccines supplied to states with 1.63 crore vaccine doses received, followed by Uttar Pradesh with 1.37 crore doses. Apart from Maharashtra and UP, Rajasthan (1.36 crore); Gujarat (1.29 crore); and West Bengal (1.13 crore) are the only states to have received over one crore doses so far. Karnataka is close with 98.47 lakh doses received so far. Andhra Pradesh has received over 65 lakh doses while Tamil Nadu too has received a similar amount. Telangana is far behind compared to its southern counterparts. Delhi — one of the epicentres for Covid-19 — has only received 38 lakh doses so far, has a vaccine wastage of around 3.5 per cent. Except 10 states, of which one is Telangana, other states are not likely to receive supplies in coming days. Currently, UP has the highest number of doses in stock with 11 lakh, followed by Bihar with eight lakh doses and Maharashtra with seven lakh doses. Barring these states, none of them have stocks over 1.5 lakh doses. Going by current stock figures, it is unlikely that states will be able to complete their free vaccination drives for persons over 45 in next one month.

---||Meerut||UP: For families of home-bound Covid patients, hope hinges on one oxygen cylinder||MEERUT: Each time the main gate of the oxygen refill agency in Meerut’s Rithani area opens, hope swells among the waiting crowd. It closes soon after letting an ambulance pass, dashing their hopes. The wait for a refill is endless, says Amit Verma, 35, from Muradnagar in Ghaziabad. He has been standing outside the oxygen refill agency here for hours in the scorching heat. Speaking with local mediapersons, he breaks down. “I have a prescription from a doctor which says the patient’s oxygen level is only 10%. I have been running from pillar to post for an oxygen cylinder but to no avail,” he adds. State government had earlier in an order said that barring exceptional circumstances, oxygen cylinders will not be given to individuals and will be meant only for institutional supply to hospitals and medical colleges. This has aggravated the ordeal of family members trying to arrange oxygen support for a loved one recuperating at home after being refused a bed at hospitals due to the acute crunch. Two days ago, Umam Khanam, a law graduate from the city, shared her ordeal on Twitter. “We have to run daily from one point to another to get oxygen refilled, in this scorching heat, while fasting (for Ramzan), with no surety of oxygen. My parents are on oxygen support, and I am crying for help from so many days,” she had tweeted. Her father is in a critical condition. For oxygen hopefuls, the wait in the queue is longer than they expected. “We got a token on Wednesday evening. It has been over 12 hours now but we are yet to get any clear communication on when we can possibly get the refilling done,” said Sandeep Tomar, standing outside an oxygen gas agency. People making frantic calls to the district magistrate and other senior administrative officials for help said their calls went unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/for-families-of-home-bound-covid-patients-hope-hinges-on-one-o2-cylinder/articleshow/82315842.cms||---
---||Pune||Menstruating women can take vaccine, says FOGSI||Pune: The Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists Societies of India (FOGSI) has issued a statement to scotch rumours urging women not to take Covid-19 vaccine before or after the menstrual cycle. There is no drop in immunity at any time in a woman’s menstrual cycle, thus making it absolutely safe to take the vaccine when it is available, FOGSI has stated. The rumour was circulated widely on social media after the Union government opened vaccination for those in the 18-44 age group. “Such claims are unscientific and baseless. There is no psychological or immunological basis affecting vaccination based on menstrual cycle. Women should be able to take the vaccine safely, regardless of where they are in their menstrual cycle,” said Girija Wagh, vice president of FOGSI. “I have been getting 60-70 calls a day, enquiring whether the claims of the social media posts are true. The claims are false and absolutely baseless. Every individual, who has access to the vaccine, should take it. There is more than enough evidence globally to prove that vaccines are not only safe and protect the individual but will also help control the pandemic in a big way,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/menstruating-women-can-take-vaccine-says-fogsi/articleshow/82316570.cms||---

The meeting was attended by the members and officials of the public health division. During the meeting, members of the committee discussed various important agenda items and decided that a policy be drafted to make the system for getting new water supply connections easily, especially in villages and colonies. The committee members also decided that all the properties under the water supply department of the municipal corporation, Chandigarh, shall be covered with boundary walls for safety and security purposes. Since many such buildings have no proper security and these have costly materials and machinery, it came out as a major reason of concern for the committee members. The committee members also accorded approval to rough estimate for providing leak-proof arrangements for overhead tank for avoiding wastage of potable water and providing drainage system beneath the over-head storage reservoir at Sector 4, Chandigarh. The project cost has been estimated at Rs 24.52 lakh. The tender process will be initiated to select the competent company so that this work can be started as soon as possible. The committee also approved a rough cost for repair and renovation of tubewell chamber and construction of boundary wall at the tubewell part 13, situated at Kaimbwala village of the city. The estimate cost of this project is around Rs 10.87 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-panel-plans-policy-for-new-water-connections/articleshow/82316569.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Thorat to donate yr’s pay, all Cong MLAs a mth’s to CM fund||Mumbai: In the wake of unprecedented resource crunch caused by Covid, revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat has decided to donate his one year’s honorarium to the Chief Minister Relief Fund (CMRF). All Congress legislators too will donate their one month’s salary, while the Pradesh Congress Committee will donate Rs 5 lakh to the CMRF. Thorat is the first cabinet member to donate his year's salary to the CM fund. “We will donate nearly Rs 2 crore to the CM relief fund, it’s a small amount, but we have made the beginning. In keeping with the AICC, we are determined to provide free vaccination to the entire population of the state. Owing to acute shortage of vaccines, there might be some delay, but certainly we will complete it in a time-bound period,” Thorat said. Thorat said when the NDA government announced vaccination plan for the population in the age group of 18 to 45, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government had decided to provide free vaccination to all. “We discussed the proposal in the weekly cabinet meeting and it was unanimously decided to provide free vaccination. We are aware of the fact that it will result in a huge burden on the state exchequer, but it is our commitment to the people of Maharashtra, we will provide them free vaccination,” Thorat said. Stating that the covid crisis has taken a serious turn, Thorat said the best preventive measure is to ensure that all citizens are vaccinated in a time-bound period, without considering the financial impact. “Unfortunately, the Narendra Modi government is running away from its responsibility. More shocking is the fact that it has passed the responsibility of vaccinations on to the state governments. Several state governments are facing unprecedented resource crunch. Despite such a situation, MVA government will provide free vaccinations to all,” Thorat said. According to a finance department official, while the cost of vaccine is yet to be decided, the government’s decision to bear the cost, will cost the state exchequer nearly Rs 9,000 crore. “We have no option but to impose a cut on the budget outlay for mobilizing Rs 9,000 crore for the purpose,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-thorat-to-donate-yrs-pay-all-cong-mlas-a-mths-to-cm-fund/articleshow/82318259.cms||---

Each worker has been provided Rs1,500 through direct benefit transfer in the last four days. It has been paid following an assurance by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that the state would help workers in the unorganised sector with financial aid to tide over strict restrictions owing to the second wave of Covid-19 in the state. There are 13 lakh construction workers registered with Maharashtra Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Corporation. The money was paid by the corporation, which collects a cess from developers for construction workers’ welfare.During lockdown last year, it paid Rs5,000 to each worker registered with it.

As the video went viral, the district magistrate's (DM) office took cognizance of the outrage and suspended the nursing staff on duty. He also ordered a probe. The patient at a Covid ward in Sarurpur region of Baghpat district, who made the video, alleged negligence by staff who he said "refused to listen to their complaints and no one was there to help". He can be heard saying: "Here patients in a semi-naked state are convulsing on the floor for want of oxygen. Despite asking them to take note of the situation, none of the staff members came inside. A woman is dead for over two hours, but there is no one to even cover her with a sheet. Have filed a complaint on the DM portal as well." Chief medical officer RK Tandon later said: "There was only one staff member at the Covid ward who was out to seek help as she was unable to manage the patients alone. The video was made when no one was in the ward. It is unfortunate that a woman passed away. The body was immediately taken out. There is also no shortage of oxygen in Sarurpur facility." Raj Kamal Yadav, the district magistrate, said, "Prima facie the nursing staff on duty was found to be negligent. The suspension order has been sent to the CMO. Besides, permission is being sought from the health and family welfare department for action against the medical officer in-charge of the Covid facility."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dead-woman-left-on-hosp-floor-for-hours-in-baghpat/articleshow/82315846.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Goa||Cabral: SC panel’s options for power lines not practical||MARGAO: Power minister Nilesh Cabral has not taken kindly to the recommendations made by the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee (CEC) that the 440 KV high tension lines be drawn over the existing 220 kv alignment instead of opening new forest cover for the new power transmission lines. “This is practically and technically not feasible,” Cabral told TOI, adding that the constraints and “impracticality” of the suggested option were explained to the CEC during a meeting of the panel with the power secretary and top officials of the power department. The CEC has recommended that instead of clearing virgin forest cover canopy along 10.5 km long corridor within Goa, the proposed 400 Kv line should be drawn along the existing 220 Kv corridor line after establishing 400 Kv corridor connectivity between Mapusa and Sangod and 220 Kv line between Sangod and Xeldem. “Power is supplied to entire South Goa through the 220 Kv line. We have the 440 Kv line coming from Colvale power grid. And it is in North Goa that we have major power problems, as when one line fails, the other line cannot withstand the load. Now the CEC is saying you shut down this live 220 Kv line supplying power to South Goa and then establish 400 Kv corridor connectivity between Mapusa and Sangod to draw the 400 kv line. From where will we draw the power until then?” Cabral questioned. He, however, said that during the course of the discussion with the CEC, the power department had agreed to draw a 440 kv line along the existing another 100 Kv line (defunct) lying parallel to the live 220 Kv line, which however, Cabral said, failed to find favour with the CEC. “The alignment of the second 400 Kv line to Goa, even if it is taken along the new corridor as proposed, on its commissioning the existing 110 Kv (defunct) and 220 Kv lines drawn between Karnataka and Goa will require to be dismantled as the 100 MW power can be carried through the new 400 Kv line having 1,200 MW capacity. Taking into account the total available power supply lines and the peak power demand of Goa state (presently 670 MW) in the forseable future, there will be no justification to continue with 110 Kv and 220 Kv lines between Karnataka and Goa,” the CEC report states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabral-sc-panels-options-for-power-lines-not-practical/articleshow/82317356.cms||---

We have allocated space available in our premises to accommodate and operate a vaccine centre for all Goemkars,” he said.

---||Delhi||Only Delhi not getting oxygen as needed: AAP||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party’s Raghav Chadha alleged on Thursday that Delhi was the only state to which the Centre hadn’t allocated oxygen as per its demand. Urging the Centre to make the allocation, the AAP national spokesperson said, “The demand of oxygen put forward by each state was catered to and, in fact, more oxygen was allocated in some cases. The only exception to this is Delhi, which did not get even 50% of what it demanded.” He claimed that as per the Centre’s own formula, the appropriate amount of oxygen for Delhi’s hospitals is 976 metric tonne per day. “Delhi has been allocated only 490 metric tonne oxygen, and the actual quantity received is even less at 400 metric tonne,” he added. The allocation was increased from 376MT to 490MT only after Delhi government had made an urgent appeal to the Centre, Chadha said. On the Centre-constituted committee that looks into the allocation to the states, the Rajendra Nagar MLA said, “The demand for oxygen has increased manifold, and states have requested for more oxygen. Each state placed its increased demand before the committee, which then allocated the same amount, and in some cases, more. The only state that was left out was Delhi, which did not get even half of its demand.” Chadha said that earlier Delhi’s daily demand was 700 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, but the Centre had allocated just 390MT and only after fervent appeals, this amount was increased to 480MT and then to 490MT. The MLA then read out what different states had demanded and what was allocated. “For instance, Punjab got 136MT oxygen as against its demand of 126MT, Tamil Nadu received 136MT as against 126MT, and Chhattisgarh 227MT as against 215MT,” he claimed. “I’d like to state that we’re not doing any politics here, and I humbly request the Centre to be largehearted towards Delhi and help us in our time of need,” Chadha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/only-delhi-not-getting-oxygen-as-needed-aap/articleshow/82317466.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The BJP has now urged the BMC to reinstate the five IAS officers, who are replaced by only municipal auditors. There are around 35 major private Covid hospitals in Mumbai. BJP MLA Ameet Satam told municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal in a letter that the civic auditors alone were not enough to enforce the rules on private hospitals. “I’m told that the BMC has now removed five nodal IAS officers The current auditors are junior level officers and can’t enforce the capping rates and reservation at big private hospitals,” Satam said in his letter. However, Chahal said that he infomred the government that the nodal officers were no longer required. “There is not a single complaint of overcharging from private hospitals and now our municipal auditors are checking every single bill before it is issued to patients,” Chahal said. “Now there is a very robust system for verifying bills, updating the bed position on the dashboard, and ensuring that the discharge policy is followed,” Chahal said. However, Satam said that in the wake of the second wave, the officers must re-appointed. “I request you to not let the common man suffer at the hands of the private hospitals and implement the directives of the state government in letter and spirit, and not buckle under the pressure of private hospitals,” Satam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-seeks-to-reinstate-5-ias-officers-to-keep-pvt-hosps-in-check/articleshow/82318272.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

In its order on April 28, the Delhi HC had told Irdai to issue immediate instructions to insurance companies to ensure that they communicate their approvals to hospitals within 30 to 60 minutes, in order to ensure that patient discharge is not delayed. Coronavirus: Live updates“Decision on authorisation for cashless treatment for Covid-19 claims shall be communicated to the network provider (hospital) within a period of 60 minutes from the time of receipt of authorisation request along with all necessary requirements from the hospital,” Irdai said in its latest circular on Thursday. It further advised insurers to process such requests promptly so that both the authorisation for cashless treatment and discharge of the patient is speeded up. “Decision on final discharge of patients covered in Covid-19 claims shall be communicated to the network provider within a period of one hour from the time of receipt of the final bill along with all necessary requirements from the hospital,” it said. Earlier, a turnaround time (TAT) of two hours for granting both cashless pre-authorization and final discharge of the insured patient was specified by the regulator. The fast-tracking of Covid-19 health claims process comes in the wake of multiple reports of Covid-19 patients being denied cashless services by hospitals despite having proper insurance covers. While Irdai has issued guidelines directing policyholders to inform their insurance companies promptly about such anomalies, it has said that insurers can lodge complaints about errant hospitals with the respective state governments.

Mumbai reported 82 deaths, the highest in a day so far this year. The daily case fatality rate in the state and city has also been on the rise. The daily CFR of the state on Thursday was 1.1%, while the city had a CFR of 1.9%. With the addition on Thursday, the state’s total death toll rose to 67,985 and the city’s to 13,036. Commenting on the deaths, Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said in absolute numbers, the deaths were undoubtedly high, but the death rate must be considered too. “During the first peak in September, we had 12,024 deaths with less than 6 lakh cases. This month, we have just crossed 12,000 deaths, but we have over 17 lakh cases, which is three times the September caseload,” he said. In terms of CFR, it was 3% and above during the first wave, which has dropped to 0.5% to 0.65% in the second wave. The state on Thursday added 66,159 fresh cases, taking its total cases to 45.3 lakh. The state has been consistently adding new cases between 63,000-66,000 for the last five days. Mumbai has added fewer than 5,000 cases for four days. It reported 4,174 cases on Thursday, taking its total cases to 6.4 lakh. The state has reported 17.2 lakh cases in the month of April and over 13,000 deaths. The monthly CFR has been 0.7%.  Awate said certain districts like Amravati, Yavatmal, Akola, Dhule and Jalgaon have started seeing a marginal decline in cases. “But it will be another 2-3 weeks before we start seeing a major drop in active cases and hospitalisations,” he said. People with comorbidities and elderly continue to account for more than 70% of deaths in the state. Former KEM dean Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the death audit committee, said Mumbai’s death rate is around 1.2% now, up from 0.88% till last week. “Cases may have started to see a decline, but it may take a while for deaths to drop,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-tally-dips-citys-daily-toll-of-82-highest-this-year/articleshow/82319740.cms||Bhavika Jain

Commenting on the deaths, Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said in absolute numbers, the deaths were undoubtedly high, but the death rate must be considered too. “During the first peak in September, we had 12,024 deaths with less than 6 lakh cases. This month, we have just crossed 12,000 deaths, but we have over 17 lakh cases, which is three times the September caseload,” he said. In terms of CFR, it was 3% and above during the first wave, which has dropped to 0.5% to 0.65% in the second wave. The state on Thursday added 66,159 fresh cases, taking its total cases to 45.3 lakh. The state has been consistently adding new cases between 63,000-66,000 for the last five days. Mumbai has added fewer than 5,000 cases for four days. It reported 4,174 cases on Thursday, taking its total cases to 6.4 lakh. The state has reported 17.2 lakh cases in the month of April and over 13,000 deaths. The monthly CFR has been 0.7%.  Awate said certain districts like Amravati, Yavatmal, Akola, Dhule and Jalgaon have started seeing a marginal decline in cases. “But it will be another 2-3 weeks before we start seeing a major drop in active cases and hospitalisations,” he said. People with comorbidities and elderly continue to account for more than 70% of deaths in the state. Former KEM dean Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the death audit committee, said Mumbai’s death rate is around 1.2% now, up from 0.88% till last week. “Cases may have started to see a decline, but it may take a while for deaths to drop,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-tally-dips-citys-daily-toll-of-82-highest-this-year/articleshow/82319739.cms||Bhavika Jain

Its limitations are visible due to the pandemic. Even in an increasingly transactional world, India cannot be living in a moral vacuum. During the current crisis, we have received reciprocal offers of help from all around the world. We should be working towards the common good of all,” he said.Shringla further said that the union government was focusing on the neighbourhood first policy and extending lines of credit to South Asian and Indian Ocean allies as it had done during the pandemic last year. He also added that India was continuing its engagement with the new US President Joe Biden, with progress in the recently held Quad framework meetings.He also added that despite disruptions to air bubble agreements with various countries due to the resurgence of Covid-19 in India, the cargo routes would remain open for supplies. The foreign secretary said the Ministry of External Affairs has deployed officials to coordinate the inward movement of supplies and raw materials needed for PPE, medicines, and vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/india-cant-remain-in-moral-vacuum-foreign-secretary/articleshow/82316575.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Panic-buying eases, but anxiety grips migrant camps ahead of lockdown||MARGAO: The initial anxiety that had gripped people on Wednesday following the announcement of a lockdown appeared to have largely eased on Thursday after it was clear that the lockdown wouldn’t affect most of the commercial activities in the state. While people had resorted to panic buying at many locations on Wednesday with a large number of customers seen at retail outlets and market places, on Thursday the scene was a little different — relatively less crowds in the markets and less traffic on the roads implied that people preferred to stay indoors ahead of the four-day lockdown that began from Thursday night. Merchant establishments TOI spoke to said sthat they had enough stocks of essential goods and that there was no need for people to panic. However, a sense of anxiety has gripped the construction industry with migrant labourers preparing to leave for their hometowns in anticipation of an extended lockdown. Labour contractors TOI spoke to said they were having a hard time convincing their labourers to stay put until the situation normalises. “Already there is a slowdown in construction activities in the state owing to the Covid-19 situation. People aren’t engaging migrant labourers at construction sites owing to obvious reasons. Also many migrant workers had already left for their home towns anxious over the wellbeing of their kin back there after the second wave had hit their states. Unavailability of sand and laterite stones has added to the slowdown, with people deferring their plans of building new homes or repairing old ones,” a labour contractor said. Meanwhile, voluntary groups and organisations have geared themselves up in various cities to provide their services to people in need of assistance during the lockdown period. The proposed services include providing essentials at their doorsteps, arranging for cooked meals for the needy, and also arranging for car-pooling for those wanting to travel for work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panic-buying-eases-but-anxiety-grips-migrant-camps-ahead-of-lockdown/articleshow/82317394.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

This has led to considerable panic among teachers who have been selected for vote-counting duty on May 2. According to teachers’ unions in UP, 577 teachers have died due to Covid after doing duty in the four phases panchayat polls. The figure, according to teachers' union Uttar Pradesh Prathamik Shikshak Sangh, had gone up to 702 on Thursday. Coming out in support of teachers, MLC (Bareilly region) Dr Hari Singh Dhillon, has written a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath to postpone election results until the Covid situation improves. He has also demanded monetary compensation for the families of the dead teachers. Sudhir Kumar, district president of Uttar Pradesh Primary Teachers Association, said, “Panchayat polls have played a key role in the dramatic rise in Covid-19 cases in the state. Government employees got infected while discharging poll duties." Teachers have demanded compensation of Rs 50 lakh for the kin of each bereaved family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/4-more-teachers-die-of-covid-after-panchayat-poll-duty-in-up/articleshow/82315847.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Goa||One in every two test positive in Goa, state sees over 3k new cases, 36 deaths||PANAJI: The Covid-19 crisis in Goa moved up a gear on Thursday as the state’s positivity rate soared to 51% — one in every two tests returns a positive result. The state also recorded 36 Covid deaths, and over 3,000 new infections, taking the total active casecount past the 20,000-mark. “The load of patients is overwhelming,,” said a doctor at the South Goa district hospital. “The hospital added a ward to accommodate more patients, but the number of admissions is so huge that some are initially accommodated on mattresses on the floor and given beds once someone is discharged.” Thirteen of Goa’s 36 deaths on Thursday were patients under 60, with the youngest a 19-year-old woman from Aquem who developed severe bilateral Covid pneumonia. She reportedly complained of symptoms a week earlier, but didn’t test for Covid till Wednesday. While the directorate of health services (DHS) said she had no comorbidities, a doctor said she had diabetic ketoacidosis. Over the past four days, the state has witnessed over 100 deaths, taking its recovery rate below the 75% mark. On Thursday, 240 persons were hospitalised and 2,030 applied for home isolation. Asked about the rising deaths, a doctor working in a Covid ward said that infectivity is multiplying, and that patients are presenting late, many with comorbidities. Another doctor said that the government needs to invoke the Disaster Management Act, which would bring in private, army and navy doctors on board, and give the government control over everything from oxygen to staff. “We are in a crisis with people dying at home, and we need to treat it like we are at war. We cannot be complacent and get desensitised each time we hear 30 people die every day. Deaths are happening at an extremely frightening scale,” a citizen said, adding that testing needs to be done 24x7 to avoid delays and long queues. Since the system is overwhelmed and positivity high, a senior health official said the government needs to conduct more rapid antigen tests instead of RC-PTR tests for symptomatic people. “We have to change our testing strategy,” he said. “Rapid antigen testing should be made available round the clock for the symptomatic. This will reduce the load on RT-PCR testing, and rapid antigen kits cost around Rs 100 while RTPCR testing costs over Rs 1,000.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/one-in-every-two-test-positive-in-goa-state-sees-over-3k-new-cases-36-deaths/articleshow/82317408.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Congress questions move behind BAC meeting on May 3||PANAJI: Goa legislature secretariat’s move to convene a meeting of the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) on May 3 has irked Congress. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat questioned the need for a BAC meeting when the next session of the house is more than two months away. Kamat said that the notice for the BAC meeting does not specify any agenda and has demanded that Speaker Rajesh Patnekar must specify the intention behind the meeting. On behalf of the opposition, Kamat has demanded that the legislature secretariat must specify the agenda in advance so that all the opposition MLAs can discuss and take a clear stand before the meeting. “The only business the BJP government under chief minister Pramod Sawant needs to take up now is of providing free and timely healthcare to the patients. All other business can be taken up later,” said Kamat. Patnekar has summoned Kamat along with MLAs Churchill Alemao, Ramkrishna Dhavalikar, Vijai Sardesai and Mauvin Godinho at 4pm at the assembly conference hall for the “most immediate assembly matter”, but has not specified what the agenda is. The budget session of the assembly was abruptly adjourned in March due to the rise in Covid cases and is set to resume on July 19. “The government needs to inform all the MLAs what is the intention behind calling for a Business Advisory Committee meeting now, when the legislative assembly Session will resume almost after two and half months,” said Kamat. The Congress MLA said that the state government has never listened to the “valuable and constructive suggestions” of the opposition MLAs and has even backtracked from the assurances given during the BAC meetings. “Attempts were made to make us the party to the decisions which we had either opposed or given conditional approvals,” said Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-questions-move-behind-bac-meeting-on-may-3/articleshow/82317412.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Ex-MLA Ashish Deshmukh writes to Shah for separate Vidarbha||Nagpur: Former Katol-MLA Ashish Deshmukh has written to Union home minister Amit Shah saying now, more than ever, there is a greater need for a separate state of Vidarbha. The Congress leader also gave a memorandum to divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, so that it could be sent to the government using the official chain of command. Deshmukh said smaller states seem to be more effective in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. In his letter, Deshmukh wrote, “Smaller states appear to be working effectively inthis regard. Vaccination is very important so that the infection does not spread.Because of the small size of the small states, immunizations and otherassistance can save lives. Due to the large size of the state of Maharashtra, thereare difficulties in this regard”.He added that “after Independence, Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar was in favour of a separate State of Vidarbha. The first State Reorganizing Commission (Fazal Ali Commission) headed by Justice Fazal Ali had also recommended a separate Vidarbha state. The State Reorganizing Commission had very clearly stated and recommended that Vidarbha and Telangana should be separate states.Telangana state has been formed but Vidarbha is still neglected. This demandwas consistently ignored for political reasons and Vidarbha was exploited bythe authorities. Although this region is rich in natural resources, it has remainedalways backward.”Deshmukh said “The neighboring state of Chhattisgarh was more backward than Vidarbha. In just fifteen years, Chhattisgarh has made tremendous progress compared to Vidarbha. In Jharkhand and Uttarakhand too, the winds of progress are blowing fast. Social development takes place through industrial development,educational development. However, Vidarbha region has not developed asall the sources are with the rulers of Mumbai and Western Maharashtra, whohave no sympathy for Vidarbha.”Deshmukh urged Shah to take ‘immediate’ steps for the creation of Vidarbha state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-mla-ashish-deshmukh-writes-to-shah-for-separate-vidarbha/articleshow/82331534.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Hyderabad||Heart checks must for those recovered||HYDERABAD: Serious cardiovascular complications and blood clots in the arteries of the lung can lead to deaths of Covid-19 patients in Telangana in growing numbers even after showing signs of full recovery, said concerned doctors. Coronavirus experts say around 8%-12% of positive cases have been known to have evidence of acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attacks, triggered by irregular heartbeats and other complications. “Covid-19 is leading to clots as well as inflammation of heart. Apart from this, it is also causing pulmonary embolism, where blood vessels to lungs are blocked. Arrhythmias or irregular heartbeat is another condition impacting Covid patients,” Dr G Ramesh, an interventional cardiologist of Yashoda hospitals, said. In one case study, a 34-year-old patient recovered from Covid and tested negative in an RT-PCR test. But after one week, she walked into the casualty section of a hospital and collapsed with chest pain. Angiogram revealed blocks and surgery was done on her. She has survived. “I have done around 40 angioplasties recently on Covid positive cases. While half of them already have underlying cardiovascular risks, the other half did not have any risk and they developed cardiac problems only after the Covid-19 infection,” said Dr Ramesh. To avoid such cases, Covid patients are increasingly being put on anticoagulants in moderate to severe cases. “Tests like D-Dimer indicate coagulation. In addition to routine tests for Covid-19, tests like ECG, Echo, Troponin, NT Pro BNP are being done more to help identify cardiovascular problems,” he added. Doctors say while first 14 days are crucial after infection, patients must follow up for a few months after surviving Covid to check heart and lung-related complications through regular testing. Dr K Subba Reddy, chief intensivist of Apollo hospitals said these are all impacts of Long Covid diseases, a term used to describe the effects of Covid-19 for weeks or months beyond initial illness. “One in five patients can have this. It can also lead to increased risk of blood clots which can cause heart attacks and strokes,” he added. Dr Reddy explained that the virus binds to the ACE2 receptors, which allows the virus to infect the cell and later lead to multi-organ failure. Nearly one-fourth of the hospitalised Covid-19 patients have cardiac complications and many survivors experience heart damage even if they don’t have underlying heart diseases, worrying healthcare experts. European Society of Cardiology revealed that people infected with Covid-19 have a higher risk of dying after a cardiac arrest and women are nine times vulnerable than men.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/heart-checks-must-for-those-recovered/articleshow/82317423.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

About 3,120 of the remdesivir vials had been distributed to Covid-19 hospitals across 17 districts on Wednesday night. “We withdrew the distributed vials belonging to a particular batch as a precautionary measure after three hospitals in Pune reported rigour in their patients.

---||Pune||Panel to look into sequential vaccination: Rajesh Tope||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday recommended formation of a core committee comprising ministers and health professionals to chalk out a detailed plan on if sequential vaccination should be introduced to ensure smooth inoculation of those in the 18 to 44 years age group. “The core committee under the chief minister and comprising ministers from all the parties in the Maha Vikas Aghadi would soon hold a meeting to decide on the way ahead. My department has sought for the meeting soon to chart the roadmap for this phase of vaccination to ensure that the process remains smooth,” he said. Senior health officials said sequential vaccination might even consider giving preference to citizens with comorbidities in the age group of 18-44 years. They stated that the entire issue of sequencing was to ensure that there was no mismanagement. “The committee will decide on the vaccination of the 18-44 age group in sub-groups such as 18-25, 25-35 and 35-44, and come out with guidelines on whether comorbid people in the sub-groups can be vaccinated first,” said a health official. The modalities would be decided by the core committee under the chief minister and the guidelines would be issued after the meeting, expected shortly, said the health official. The state health minister said they had only got a purchase order of Rs3 lakh from Serum Institute of India when the state required much more. The state needs 12 crore doses to vaccinate 5.71 crore citizens in this age group. The state is already talking to foreign vaccine manufacturers but is yet to float tenders. It is trying to get the available doses first. Pradeep Bhargava, member of the Pune Covid platform, said, “Opening vaccination for the entire lot in this age group will only lead to huge crowds at centres, leading to more Covid spread, and even law and order situation. Frankly, even the IT system may crash with such loads of registration.” He said, “Maharashtra should open only 30-45 age group in the first tranche and look at the 18-29 group in the next lot for an orderly conduct of vaccination. It is still grappling with the vaccination of 3 crore in the 45-plus age group.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/panel-to-look-into-sequential-vaccination-tope/articleshow/82316579.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Navi-mumbai||A Supermoon ‘miracle’: Tidal water flows into Panje wetland||NAVI MUMBAI: The Supermoon phenomenon that occurred early this week has performed a small ‘miracle’ at the parched Panje wetland, which the environmentalists were quite literally begging the government to do. Due to the strong tidal effects of the Supermoon, the seawater at Panje breached the man-made bunds that were blocking the water movement and now several migratory birds have returned to the wetland. A Supermoon occurs when the moon’s orbit is closest (perigee) to Earth at the same time it is full. Bird-watchers were delighted to find several tagged greater sandplover birds, after nearly three years. The greater sandplover is a small, yet hardy, migratory bird which flies hundreds of kilometers from the central desert areas near Turkey. The Supermoon effect has further encouraged environmentalists to continue their fight to permanently save the wetland. “Panje had been reduced to a dry land with the blocking of five tidal water inlets by vested interests despite an order from the National Green Tribunal (NTG) to clear them. Some tidal water, however, flowed over the man-made bunds into parts of the wetland, thanks to the recent supermoon event,” said activist B N Kumar of NGO NatConnect Foundation. Local birder Parag Gharat, who ventured out with his camera after seeing the waterflow, spotted many tagged birds in the last two days. After cross-checking with Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), the tagged birds were identified as greater sandplover ( Charadrius leschenaultii). “The presence of migratory birds teach us the importance of maintaining our wetlands as they are urban sponges that absorb flood waters. Wetlands are home to several microbes which are essential for our biodiversity as we are taught in our schools,” Kumar said. Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, regretted that most of the Panje wetland remained dry as water flow continued to be blocked by vested interests. “We just cannot understand how the officials can keep flouting the NGT order to clear the man-made blocks at the five water inlets,” Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/supermoon-achieves-what-govt-had-failed-to/articleshow/82319678.cms||Vijay Singh

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: No doses, no clarity, yet private hospitals ready for mass vaccine drive||MUMBAI: Private hospitals in the city were left clueless about continuation of the vaccination drive against Covid as they ran out of vials and also no guidelines being issued for the next phase starting May 1. TOI spoke with a couple of big hospitals where the administrators said they were getting a lot of queries from several groups and class of citizens for tie-up to carry out drives. However, they said, they are unable to answer any query as cost and modalities are yet to be notified. Seven Star hospital's Dr Sadasiv Bhole said that there is no clarity on “how much we are going to get”. “And beneficiaries, especially those wanting their second shots, have started rushing to hospitals. The message they are getting is that there is adequate stock,” he said. The hospital plans to convert the entire ground floor into a vaccination centre “provided we get adequate stock”. “It is important to vaccinate the whole population. Lockdown has not worked and what has is vaccination,” added Dr Bhole. Seven Star will not be admitting any patient in their OPD for 15 days. “We can do a massive drive. We have trained staff and cold chains,” said Dr Bhole. Dr Tushar Gawad, director of administration at Alexis Multi speciality Hospital, said so far there is no clarity with regard to purchase of vaccines. “We have written to manufacturers. They responded that they have obligations to the central as well as state governments and can’t meet the needs of private establishments right now. So we will have to buy from the state government. As far as state government is concerned, as of now it doesn’t have enough stock for its own CVCs hence can't give vaccines to private CVCs,” he said. Alexis hasn’t run the vaccination programme since two days. “We ran out of stock. We have written to the concerned authorities requesting for supply of vaccines,” said Dr Gawad, adding that they would continue with their current target of around 200 jabs per day. Dr Shantanu Sengupta, director of Sengupta Hospital, said they are eagerly waiting for the standard operating procedure on the next phase of vaccination. “Whatever the government says, we would be willing to help. We were the first private hospital to start Covid vaccination in the city on March 3. We are not only happy to vaccinate but also wish to educate whoever is interested in how to give a vaccine. For example, if citizens wish to volunteer in the drive, we will seek their support,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-doses-no-clarity-yet-pvt-hosps-ready-for-mass-vaccine-drive/articleshow/82316596.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

He said that vaccination for the 18-45 age group would begin once the state receives the 5 lakh doses it has already ordered. “Our state received over 4.3 lakh doses of vaccine for three phases,” he said. “We have vaccinated over 2.5 lakh people with the first dose, and over 68,000 with the second. We have over 1.1 lakh doses available with us.” Sawant said that now it’s time for the fourth phase, and that the Centre has liberalised this phase for procurement and implementation, due to the demand of several CMs over the past three months for liberty to choose vaccines and plan the drives. He said that it is now the duty of the state to procure the vaccine and plan the vaccination drive. “Vaccine-manufacturing companies are in the process of expanding their capacities,” he said. “A third vaccine is also getting introduced. Goa has placed an order of 5 lakh doses with the Serum Institute of India (SII). Vaccination for the 18-45 age group will progress as and when we receive the doses.” “We have initiated three phases of vaccination till today. One for healthcare workers, one for frontline workers and one for the 45+ population,” he said. He said that efforts to scale up to fulfill the demand for hospital beds, oxygen and medical equipment are on. He also said that it is the responsibility of the government and the larger population to make the fourth phase of vaccination successful. “We will plan the vaccination programme in detail and announce it in due time, so that slots are available and people get vaccinated in a smooth and disciplined manner,” he said. The chief minister said vaccines and vaccination drives are an important part of the solution to the Covid crisis. India was fortunate enough to have two homemade vaccines due to the efforts of the scientific community and pharmaceutical industry, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/have-1-1l-vax-doses-in-stock-for-45-cm/articleshow/82317434.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Workation plans go awry as Covid hits many away from home||PANAJI: For marketing professional Diksha Sharma (name changed), working from Goa amid the Covid-19 pandemic was akin to having the best of both worlds. Her work desk was a balcony overlooking a garden and in the evening, the watering holes of Assagao and Anjuna offered the perfect place to let her hair down and meet fellow ‘workationers’. Lured by the attraction of working remotely from Goa during the pandemic, hundreds of professionals made a beeline to the sunny state, setting up their remote workstations in hostels, villas and Airbnb rentals. Wealthy professionals from Delhi, Mumbai and other parts of the country could not get enough of the prawns, beer and beaches between their webinars and conference calls. That was until the second wave of Covid-19 reared its ugly head. Even as most of their home states went into a lockdown, more and more ‘workationers’ contracted Covid-19, leaving them without a support system. Over the past week, many like Sharma have resorted to making frantic calls to local contacts and through social media asking for help regarding testing facilities, tele-consultation, treatment options and even ways to return home despite being Covid-positive. “I know of at least seven people who had to be hospitalised after their health deteriorated. I took three of them to the hospital myself,” said entrepreneur Shruti Chaturvedi who has started an online portal to help Covid-19 patients. In one instance, a woman with Covid-19 fainted at a private villa and her family members reached out via social media to seek help. “A lot of travellers don’t understand that they are better off at home and that they are populating another state which is already burdened,” said Chaturvedi. Some individuals also told TOI that with Goa’s healthcare bursting at its seams, desperate tourists and those remotely working in Goa are trying to leave the state via flights or road even if they have tested positive for Covid-19. “Since many of these individuals from Delhi and Mumbai are living in guest houses, hotels and private villas, they are unable to register for home isolation. They have no idea how to get home isolation kits or where to seek medical treatment,” said a government bureaucrat who has been approached by relatives in the metros to help their kin in Goa. Many guesthouses and resorts in Goa have offered workation packages offering WiFi, power-backup and discounts if booked for a month. Many who took up the offer rue that the downside is the lack of family support in the midst of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/workation-plans-go-awry-as-covid-hits-many-away-from-home/articleshow/82317418.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Goa||Goa: After violence, resident docs threaten to withdraw||PANAJI: After two instances of violence by patients’ relatives at government hospitals within a week, the 300-strong Goa association of resident doctors (GARD) on Thursday threatened to withdraw their services if attacks continue. On Wednesday night, the relatives of a 70-year-old patient at Goa Medical College’s Covid ward 145 abused doctors and damaged a ventilator after the patient died. On Thursday, Agasaim police filed an FIR against his 20-year-old son. PSI Subhash Gaonkar said that the FIR was registered under Section 3 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property (PDPP) Act. Earlier, on April 18, doctors and medical staff were abused by relatives after a patient died. The GARD has asked for security for them to be able to carry out their work without fear, and said that they have been putting their heart and soul into their work to tackle the pandemic. “It saddens us immensely that even after giving our best efforts, while being ripped by lack of adequate facilities, oxygen supply, beds, manpower, etc, we have been on the receiving end of multiple threats and violent incidents in the past,” the association stated. “It is always doctors who are at the receiving end of abuses for lack of beds and other facilities. The people of Goa need to understand that we have joined GMC as postgraduate students and are providing medical services as a part of learning… And if the coronavirus wasn’t enough, we now have to face backlash from the very people we are trying to serve,” they added. “If the administration cannot provide security to the doctors or if the people of Goa fail to understand the situation and the plight of healthcare workers, we won’t be responsible for any further untoward incidents happening as a result of the withdrawal of our services,” the association added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-violence-resident-docs-threaten-to-withdraw/articleshow/82317437.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa-Hyderabad buses run full capacity as state tightens curbs||PANAJI: After the Kadamba Transport Corporation Ltd (KTC) temporarily suspended its interstate operations, tourists in Goa were left with no choice but to board private buses and even pay a higher fare to exit the state on Thursday. Hours before the three-day period of tightened curbs came into force, people from other states left Goa with the Goa-Hyderabad buses running full capacity, while buses to Mumbai ran at 50% capacity. “Tourists are going back home and even some Goans are leaving from here. The bus to Hyderabad was scheduled at 4.30pm and ran full capacity. Buses to Mumbai were scheduled at 5.30pm, 6.30pm, 8.30pm and 9.30pm so it was easy to distribute passengers accordingly,” sources from the booking counter of a bus operator said. There have been people coming to Goa as well, but these are very few. “Compared to the number of people leaving the state, there are just a few returning,” sources said. No sooner did Karnataka announce a 14-day statewide closedown to tackle the spread of the coronavirus than KTC suspended 27 of its buses that ply between the two states. These buses travel to Belagavi, Bijapur, Hospet, Bengaluru and Karwar, among other areas. “Soon after, KTC also suspended interstate buses to Maharashtra. As a result, there is no rush at the KTC interstate platform.” an official of the corporation said. Paulo Travels operated private buses between Goa and other states on Thursday and said its services would continue despite the three-day period of restrictions in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-hyderabad-buses-run-full-capacity-as-state-tightens-curbs/articleshow/82317438.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Belying earlier projections, Maharashtra may see active cases drop to 9.36 lakh by May 11||MUMBAI: The city may not cross the frighteningly high mark of one lakh active cases by May 2, as was predicted a few weeks ago. According to the state’s latest fortnightly projections for May 11, Mumbai may be the only district to see a drop in active cases and have adequate beds, including ventilators and ICU beds, by then. Previously, the state had estimated that active cases in Mumbai could cross 1.5 lakh by May 2, leading to a shortfall of 6,433 oxygen beds, 1,477 ICU beds and 121 ventilators. However, as per the revised projections based on slower growth and hospitalisation rate, Mumbai could have less than 65,000 active cases by May 11, down from the present count of 67,255. The BMC data also shows that the city’s weekly case growth rate dropped from 1.5% in the beginning of April to 0.9% at present. Even for Maharashtra, the predictions are less gloomy compared to the previous ones made by the state itself and the Centre, which had said active cases would hit 11-12 lakh by April 30. In its most recent prediction, the state was estimated to have 10.9 lakh active cases by May 2, which has now been revised to 9.4 lakh for May 11. However, that still translates into a 40% jump in active cases from the present day. State says many districts may face shortage of beds by May 11Though case projections for the state are not as bad as they were earlier, other than Mumbai, Amravati, Jalgaon, Solapur and Dhule, every other district is in the red as far as availability of medical infrastructure is concerned. Ratnagiri, predicted to see a growth in active cases from 7,048 currently to 12,413 by May 11, is likely to fall short of 3,527 isolation beds, 1,065 oxygen beds, 248 ICU beds and 11 ventilators. The state had predicted that the district would have 4,092 cases by May 2, which it has crossed by a big margin already. In districts like Palghar, Raigad, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur, a big rise in active cases in the range of 20% to 40% has been predicted. Districts like Nashik and Chandrapur are showing chances of near-doubling of active cases by May 11. Chandrapur, for instance, could have over 40,000 cases by May 11, in which case it will fall short of nearly 17,000 isolation beds, 4,000 oxygen beds, 954 ICU beds and 249 ventilators. An official from Sangli said cases are going up in rural areas of the district, and with low awareness of protocols, one patient is infecting several—family members and people from the village. “There are many villages with multiple cases. People showing symptoms didn’t isolate in time,” said the official. “District-level predictions have been fairly accurate so far as we only do fortnightly projections. A key here is growth rate and average duration of hospitalisation, which is 12 days in the state,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, the state’s chief surveillance officer. On forecast for Mumbai, Suresh Kakani, AMC, said cases have plateaued, but looking at the momentary crisis for beds that was felt, BMC would continue to augment beds. Dr Avinash Supe, executive director of Hinduja Hospital, Khar, said the city still has demand for ICU and ventilator beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-says-many-districts-may-face-shortage-of-beds-by-may-11/articleshow/82317455.cms||Sumitra Debroy

And, most of these areas are now witnessing a high number of positive cases,” the bench said. It asked the SEC and the government to shut liquor shops till May 3. “This is the least you can do, your wrong commands have already driven the staff towards a perilous era. They have no option, but obey your command.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/telangana-high-court-chides-sec-for-civic-poll-plan/articleshow/82319679.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The high court has acquitted her for murder, poisoning and theft in the dual murder, and quashed and set aside the 2017 order of the South Goa sessions court convicting her. The division bench of the high court comprising Justices M S Jawalkar and Dama Seshadri Naidu directed that she be released immediately if not required in any other offence. Naik was represented by counsel C A Ferreira and Prithvi Bandekar, advocate under Legal Aid Scheme. The South Goa sessions court in 2017 sentenced her to life imprisonment on charges of killing her mother-in-law and sister-in-law after administering them with stupefying drugs. Prosecution at the time stated that she was the prime suspect and was assisted by her brother-in-law who later turned approver in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/high-court-acquits-womanin-vasco-double-murder-case/articleshow/82317445.cms||---
---||Goa||Lockdown order vague, issue strict one, says Goa science and technology minister||PANAJI: Pointing out that the lockdown order issued by the state government on Wednesday lacks clarity, science and technology minister Michael Lobo on Thursday demanded that the order be redrafted and issued so that it stresses on breaking the Covid chain by following a strict lockdown. “If you read the order, it is not a lockdown, and there is a need to bring in changes to the order,” he said, adding that restaurants should stop and only takeaways allowed. Lobo said that he spoke to chief minister Pramod Sawant, the district collector and BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade to demand a stringent lockdown. He criticised the fact that most shops are allowed to remain open. “What does that mean. Glass shops will remain open,” he said. “People will come out of their houses and gather in large numbers in shops. What’s the problem if shops are closed for four days?” Lobo also said that except supermarkets, all other shops should be closed. “The time will come when people won’t even get place to sit in a hospital. Today, Covid patients have to sit on wheelchairs or stretchers,” he said. He said that Sawant should take measures like those taken in Candolim and Calangute. “We are not saying it is a lockdown,” he said. “We call these preventive measures. People have voluntarily closed their shops. We have requested them to follow preventive measures to break the Covid chain.” Lobo said that restaurants would be closed in Calangute and Candolim, except for takeaways. He also said that PM Narendra Modi and other world leaders also endorse people staying indoors to break the chain. Although chief minister Pramod Sawant had on Wednesday afternoon announced a four-day “lockdown” from April 29 to May 3, in the evening, the two district collectors issued a ‘lockdown’ order which was contradictory to Sawant’s announcement that other than essential services, life in Goa would come to a standstill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lockdown-order-vague-issue-strict-one-lobo/articleshow/82317453.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat crosses 7,000 Covid deaths, last 2,000 recorded in 16 days||AHMEDABAD: On Thursday, Gujarat crossed 7,000 cumulative deaths of Covid-19 patients, the 10th highest in India. The state also recorded its daily highest death toll of 180, giving the daily mortality rate of 1.25%. Analysis of the mortality revealed that the last 2,000 deaths were recorded in just 16 days and the last 1,000 in six days – the fastest so far. To put the figure in perspective, it had taken the state 227 days to reach from 3,000 deaths to 5,000 deaths. Analysis of both these periods also reveal that compared to the last surge in 2020, this time more districts are recording deaths. Compared to 85% share of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot districts in 2,000 deaths between 3,000 and 5,000, this time, it’s just 57% — indicating a much higher mortality in other districts with lesser populations. In fact, the four districts don’t feature in top five districts with highest mortality rate for the period – Morbi with 6% mortality rate tops the list (meaning death of six patients for every 100 patients recorded between April 14 and 29), followed by Dang (4.7%) and Devbhoomi Dwarka (4.4%). In absolute numbers, Surat recorded the highest mortality at 386, followed by Ahmedabad (381) and Vadodara (196). “The phenomenon could be seen both ways – in absolute terms, the mortality has gone down for the most populous districts – Ahmedabad’s share in previous 2,000 deaths was 802 or 40% of the state's share, which is now down to 19% with 381 or half of the previous mortality. But on the other side, smaller districts are recording higher mortality due to a smaller number of cases,” said a city-based epidemiologist. “Cities like Ahmedabad recorded more cases per deaths this time, reducing its mortality rate.” City-based experts pointed at multiple factors for the sudden shoot up in the mortality of Covid patients. “This time, the lung involvement is much more compared to the last wave. Second, due to the delay in admission, when the patient arrives in the medical setting, he or she is already in need of oxygen support. If they have any pre-existing conditions, survival becomes difficult after they go on ventilator,” said a city-based critical care specialist. “This time, we have also witnessed deaths of younger patients compared to the last wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-crosses-7k-covid-deaths-last-2000-recorded-in-16-days/articleshow/82316601.cms||Parth Shastri

He said the candidate will be recruited through direct interview and offered to get the post for his son Ajithrajan with the help of some employees in the department. He demanded Rs 5 lakh. Chandrasekar gave him Rs 4.5 lakh,” a police officer said.When Manikandan failed to get the job, Chandrasekar approached a judicial magistrate court to register an FIR against him. Based on a court order, Selvapuram police registered an FIR against Manikandan under Section 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code on December 19, 2020 and arrested him on Wednesday. He was remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/goldsmith-arrested-for-cheating/articleshow/82316627.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Cyber cell extends footprint to combat traditional crimes||JAIPUR: The arrest of the prime suspect on Sunday in the killing of two constables in Bhilwara would have taken more time had the police not got inputs from the cyber cell in Jaipur. The expertise in solving cyber-crime has gone way far from cases related to online fraud/post to solving traditional cases of murder, dacoity, rape and others. The prime suspect, Sunil Dudi, who shot two constables on April 10 in Bhilwara, was using a virtual number of Canada to make WhatsApp calls using the internet which is called ‘Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP). His virtual number was traced via the phone number of his aide. It further helped in tracing his IP address which helped in accessing the exact geolocation of Dudi in Fara village of Phalodi. The entire surveillance took three days, including accessing coordinates from the mobile operator. Several aides of Lawrence Bishnoi have been nabbed by police by tracking calls made using virtual numbers. Almost every extortion call in the state is being made through virtual numbers leaving equal space for cyber-crime experts to intervene. The culprits use virtual foreign numbers to register themselves on WhatsApp. “I investigated the case of a 7-year-old boy who was kidnapped and murdered in Jodhpur on March 17. The accused Kishan Soni made ransom messages through WhatsApp using virtual numbers from Canada. A server-based in the US was approached with the virtual number. They responded with an IP address that was used by 46 Airtel users. Thereafter police analysed the numbers and arrested the suspect,” said Mukesh Choudhary, founder of Cyber Ops Infosec, a private company assisting Jaipur police commissionerate in cyber-crime cases. Technical expertise has become a sure shot therapy in solving ‘missing’ complaints, especially of youths. “The first rule investigating these cases is monitoring social media profile of the missing persons. In the majority of the cases these persons were traced by accessing the geo-coordinates from their social media handles,” said Choudhary. Tracking illegal firearms using the ‘Open-Source Intelligence’ (OSINT) is being done by police with the help of cyber cell experts. Jaipur police registered 11 cases against those flashing firearms pictures on social media platforms. Highlighting the importance of cyber cell, Ajay Pal Lamba, additional commissioner of police, Jaipur, said that in almost every case cyber cell is involved these days. “Corroborating evidence from laptops and mobile phones to trace the location via social media accounts, cyber expertise is required,” said Lamba. He added that every police station or cyber units are equipped to handle routine cases using technical/cyber expertise. “Jaipur commissionerate has hired private cyber-crime experts to handle those 5-10% of complex cases which require a high degree of expertise,” Lamba added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cyber-cell-extends-footprint-to-combat-traditional-crimes/articleshow/82316629.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Neeri torch-bearer in dry swab method, tests over 50,000, produces quick results||NAGPUR: After conducting over 50,000 RT-PCR tests successfully using the dry swab technology, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute’s (Neeri) laboratory — the only ICMR-approved one using this method — says this can become a game-changer in the country in fighting the deadly Covid-19 peak. On Wednesday, TOI had reported that the state will be switching over to dry swab method for RT-PCR testing which has got approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). While other laboratories are likely to soon adopt the method, the one at Neeri has carried out more than 50,000 tests in less than a year. When Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) developed this technology last year, the scientists in Nagpur got into action. “After going through the research paper published by CCMB, we decided to take an initiative to bring it to the laboratory level. Then, the divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar constituted a special committee, as a part of which we got permission to start multicentre validation of the technology,” said Krishna Khairnar, scientist and head of environmental virology cell at Neeri. In the due course, CCMB was successful in obtaining ICMR’s approval for using this technique in testing labs. Unlike the conventional RT-PCR testing which is being carried out across the country, the dry swab method eliminates the need of viral transport medium – a liquid which has specific ingredients to keep the virus viable and safe. “Usage of this liquid, an old-school method used for viral culturing, was not only resulting in dilution factor but also unwanted consumption of time and resources,” said Khairnar. In dry swab method, it’s a zero liquid condition, he said. “For detecting the viral genetic material, we don’t mandatorily need the virus to be viable as RNA, the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 is targeted in RT-PCR,” added Khairnar, who is also the coordinator of Department of Biotechnology’s Covid-19 testing regional hub. Sans the liquid, the testing time reduces by more than half. While the wait for RT-PCR tests has gone up to 15-24 hours, Neeri has been able to finish testing of around 200-300 samples daily in a record-time of less than three hours. “Dry swab testing is highly reliable as there is no dilution factor and one gets the true picture of the viral load. It also obliterates the need of costly RNA extraction kits and manual RNA extraction system,” said Khairnar. S Chandrashekhar, who has recently taken additional charge as Neeri director, is hopeful that the technique will prove to be a big game-changer in fighting the pandemic. “Not using the liquid also ensures safety of frontline workers, making the handling and transportation of samples easy by avoiding spillage. The technique is highly effective and we are hoping now more laboratories will be adopting it to ensure early detection,” he said. On importance of fast results, Khairnar said, “Whether the report is positive or negative, early detection is a must to start treatment. In many cases, people suffering from other ailments are not getting treatment unless they produce a negative Covid report. This method is completely in the interest of patients.” Interestingly, at the Nagpur laboratory, most of the workers at the laboratory are young research scholars, out of which almost 70% are women. “We have been working day and night to produce fast results,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neeri-torch-bearer-in-dry-swab-method-tests-over-50k-produces-quick-results/articleshow/82316623.cms||Manka Behl

Tests conducted after his death confirmed he had Covid, a family member said. He was cremated as per Covid guidelines in his village on Thursday, barely hundreds of metres from a choultry that was to host his marriage. Prutviraj DM, from Devarakodige in Koppa taluk of Chikkamagaluru district, returned home from Bengaluru two weeks ago after the government decided to impose night curfew in eight big cities to stem the rising tide of Covid cases. The bridegroom used to work as a sales executive in Bengaluru. He is the eldest son of Manjunath, a farmer from Devarakodige. Early this year, his marriage was fixed for April 29. Though his health condition wasn’t good as he suffered from stomach ailment and breathlessness after his return from Bengaluru, families of the groom and the bride decided to go ahead with the wedding plan as he tested negative for Covid-19 twice. According to Manjunath, the groom complained of stomachache after he returned from Bengaluru. Groom twice tested -ve for CovidAfter Prutviraj was treated at a local hospital, he became fit and plunged into marriage preparations. Within 48 hours, he complained of breathlessness. His family rushed him to a private hospital in Koppa and shifted him to Thirthahalli in Shivamogga district on Monday for better care. In both hospitals, he was swabbed for Covid and the results turned negative. However, his condition continued to turn for the worse by the day, and the family shifted him to Shivamogga’s McGann Hospital, the designated Covid hospital. Factoring in his recent medical history, the hospital admitted him to the Covid ward. He was on ventilator before breathing his last on Wednesday. Medical superintendent Dr Sridhar said Prutviraj was brought to the hospital at a critical stage. “He responded to treatment initially, but we could not save him,” he said. Manjunath said the system failed him as the authorities confirmed only after his death that he was Covid positive. “They sent the Covid report to a family member’s mobile after his death,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/groom-dies-of-covid-on-eve-of-marriage/articleshow/82319630.cms||---

While it was initially not known whether the child had tested positive for Covid-19 or not, Ramanjeet Singh, the said techie got the child tested with the help of an NGO, Feed the Needy, and his report came back negative. “Initially, we kept the child at a guest house in our community and my wife Sandeep Kaur took care of him. On Thursday morning, we received his report and he tested negative. So, my wife brought him home and he is staying with my wife and children,” said Singh, who has been actively lending a helping hand for Covid-19 victims during the pandemic. He said that as he too tested positive for Covid-19, his wife came forward to take care of the child. “Now, the child is happily playing with my children — who are 10-year-old and 5-year-old,” added the techie. Singh said that the affected family hails from West Bengal and are residents of Secunderabad. He said that they have no relatives in the city to take care of the child. The 42-year-old techie, who is part of the Feed the Needy team, said that they have come across several cases where children were waiting for days at the hospital reception with no one to take care of them and added that the NGO is planning to provide accommodation and food to other children, whose caregivers have tested positive. “Many parents, despite having symptoms, are not getting tested as they are worried about the safety and well-being of their children. We are planning to tie up with existing daycares and take them on lease to take care of these children,” said Sai Teja from Feed the Needy, adding that they even helped in getting the affected child’s parents admitted to a hospital. The NGO, which has been helping people with medicines, beds, oxygen cylinders and offering last rites services, said that they are also going to send 500 medicine kits for the benefit of people staying in remote areas across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/techie-with-heart-of-gold-takes-up-care-of-child-from-covid-hit-family/articleshow/82317477.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Coimbatore||Liquor sales go up ahead of dry days||Coimbatore: Liquor sales at the outlets run by the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited (Tasmac) shot up on Thursday after the state government announced its decision to close them for two days on Saturday and Sunday. Tasmac officials expect at least 25% more sales till they down the shutters on Friday night. There was a long queue outside the elite Tasmac shop on Bharatiyar Road near Lakshmi Mills on the day. A salesman at the shop said both the number of customers and the bottles they purchase had increased over the past couple of days.“It is mainly because of the government’s announcement to close the shops on Saturday (May 1 - International Worker’s Day) and Sunday (vote counting day). Also rumours about the complete lockdown in the city has been doing rounds on social media. Hence, there is a rise in liquor sales,” he said.According to him, the shop had recorded sales of Rs 34 lakh on Tuesday and Rs 29 lakh on Wednesday, against the usual sales of Rs 7 lakh to Rs 9 lakh a day. “It is higher than the sales that we record on Saturdays and festival days when we average a sale of Rs 19 lakh.”Of the seven elite Tasmac shops in the district, six are functioning in the city. The district also has another 293 ordinary Tasmac outlets. Another salesman at the Gandhipuram outlet concurred that the sale has increased after the government’s two-day closure announcement. “We have seen 10% to 15% increase in sales in the past couple of days. It is mainly because people are afraid that the government would impose lockdown. It seems they don’t want to have a long dry run like in the previous year.”A customer, who usually buys an 180ml bottle, has started buying two to five bottles, the maximum number of bottles provided at the outlet per person. “Demand for 750ml bottles has also gone up, as customers have started stocking up.”A senior Tasmac official said the liquor sales graph was filled with ups and downs. “As the government has imposed complete lockdown on Sundays, the sale on Saturdays has increased. It returns to normalcy on Mondays. This week, the sales are likely to soar by 25% on Thursday and Friday, as the outlets will remain shut on Saturday and Sunday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/liquor-sales-go-up-ahead-of-dry-days/articleshow/82316662.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Cases pile up in districts due to absence of experts||JAIPUR: The absence of experts solving cybercrimes in the state is leading to the piling up of such cases in several districts. The state has two cyber police stations. One is Jaipur Police Commissionerate and the other is under the Special Operations Group (SOG). Figures say that less than one-third of cybercrimes registered on the home ministry’s web portal cybercrime.gov.in converted into police complaint in August 2019. The official figures have yet not available but sources said that in 2020 and 2021 very cases have been converted into FIRs. The cases under cybercrimes can be filed on the website by the complaint and it is forwarded to respective states. The report says around 3.17 cases have been reported on the web portal including 16,000-18,000 from the state, since inception. “Less than 3,000 cases have been taken up by the police stations across the state,” said a senior police official. Commenting on the poor conversion rate, Ajay Pal Lamba, additional commissioner of police, Jaipur police Commissionerate said that in many cases those who register cases doesn’t cooperate after it landed into the concerned police stations. “By the time, the case is registered the complainant problem is resolved. The other reason is a mismatch of the jurisdiction of the police station. Also, the absence of expertise is also contributing to piling up of cases,” said Lamba. Rajasthan has two Commissionerate—Jaipur and Jodhpur and seven police range—Jaipur, Ajmer, Jodhpur, Kota, Bikaner, Udaipur and Bharatpur. Jaipur has four cyber units one each in its four districts—Jaipur East, West, North and South. The state has made a special sanction to hire a private cybercrime consultant since 2019 assisting them in solving complex cases. The other districts are not as lucky as Jaipur police as they do not have separate sanction amount for the same. The SP officers in their capacity building the capacity of their personnel to solve these pending and new cases. Deepak Bhargava, SP Chittorgarh has identified constables among the newly recruited ones with interest in crimes related to cyber. “The training programs would eventually help them in learning the art of taking on cyber-crimes,” said Bhargava. Some districts have already started the training programs for their staff. Sudhir Joshi, SP Dungarpur, says that they have started cyber-crime training police station wise. “The rise in cybercrimes originating locally has given us a thought of building a capacity to deal with these cases locally,” said Joshi||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cases-pile-up-in-districts-due-to-absence-of-experts/articleshow/82316686.cms||---

At 9.41pm on Thursday, Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital in Tahirpur became the first Delhi government Covid facility to send an SOS through Twitter stating that the pressure in its oxygen supply setup cannot be sustained beyond midnight due to the depletion in the cylinder stock. “Urgent help required,” the hospital tweeted on its official handle. TOI tried to contact the hospital authorities, but there was no response. The 350-bed hospital has already reduced the number of its Covid beds. Sir Ganga Ram Hospital may face the same problem around 4am on Friday if its vendor doesn’t bring an additional supply by midnight. Sources at the hospital said its liquid oxygen stock as on 8pm on Thursday was 1,200 cubic metre. “The hospital consumes around 10,000 cubic metre per day and the required minimum supply is 11,000. Our vendor sent us four tonnes of oxygen around 9.30pm, but it will go on only till 4am on Friday. The vendor has promised to send more supply by midnight,” said a source. Other smaller hospitals, such as Aastha Hospital near Vikaspuri, which were facing a severe oxygen crunch on Wednesday, continued to struggle even on Thursday. The hospital managed to survive the day only because many patients were carrying a backup. Rainbow Hospital, which is a Covid facility for children and mothers, almost ran out of oxygen on Thursday morning and had supply left only for an hour. It took to Twitter and was later helped by the authorities. At Sehgal Neo Hospital, too, only an hour’s supply was left around 4pm. The hospital was facing the shortage as its vendor had been changed and the new vendor was not supplying liquid oxygen. Dr Narin Sehgal, owner of the hospital, told TOI, “I don’t know how our vendor has changed. The new one says he supplies only cylinders and doesn’t have the supply we need. We are calling our old vendor who is saying he cannot supply. We have 120 Covid patients, out of which 74 need oxygen support and 13 are in the ICU.” Tanush Gupta of Gupta Multispecialty Hospital in Vivek Vihar said, “We have been running around to refill our cylinders. We cannot admit any patient and are somehow managing. Our men are waiting in queues for hours and hours only to be told that the supply is over. Our vendor is not supplying.” Vimhans Hospital also had an oxygen crisis and ran out of liquid oxygen. The hospital later started using oxygen cylinders. The Covid facility had 203 patients. Saroj Hospital in Rohini, another Covid facility, is catering to 138 patients, 80% of whom need constant oxygen supply, and faced the same crunch on Thursday too. At Orchid Hospital in Janakpuri, which is a non-Covid facility, oxygen was running out and the hospital had to ask relatives of the patients to look for another place as it was unable to refill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-hospitals-o2-meters-continue-to-run-very-low/articleshow/82317489.cms||---

She died two hours later. Videos of the youth in a PPE kit, down on his knees and crying as he pleads with the cops to give him back the cylinder or "his mother will die" is being shared widely on social media platforms, drawing widespread criticism. The youth, Ansh Goyal, later told TOI that policemen took away the oxygen cylinder despite his frantic pleas. His family alleged that the oxygen was given to a "VIP". Ordering the probe, ADG Krishna said, “Strict action will be taken against guilty policemen." Earlier, local police had denied the charges and said that the cylinder was empty. Superintendent of police (SP) Botre Rohan Pramod said, “The man was requesting police to provide him with an oxygen cylinder for treatment of his relative. No one was taking away any cylinder. The video is misleading.” He also added that the cylinders were empty. He didn't explain why policemen would take away empty cylinders. Anmol added, “I tried to stop the men from taking away the cylinder. When I asked the ward boys why they were taking away our oxygen cylinder, they told me that it was required for a VIP.” In the video clip, Ansh asks, “From where will I arrange the cylinder. I had come (to the hospital) after promising my family that I will bring back my mother alive." Ansh later told TOI, “My mother was not able to breathe. We gave her CPR multiple times, but could not save her. She died two hours after the policemen took the (oxygen) cylinder,” According to sources, Usha was a niece of senior Jan Sangh leader, late Lala Roshanlal -- a close associate of Champat Rai, vice-president of the Vishva Hindu Parishad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/cops-snatch-o2-cylinder-from-youth-mother-dies-2-hours-later/articleshow/82315919.cms||Deepak Lavania

The doctor told us that one Madhina had befriended him on Facebook. When he visited her in her apartment in January, two men, Karthik and Shyam, reached there and tried to blackmail him. They said they had pictures and videos of him being in a compromising position with the woman and demanded money. He gave them Rs 3,000 and his mobile phone. He did not register a complaint fearing embarrassment,” a police officer said.After receiving a complaint from the doctor, the Saravanampatti police registered a case under Section 387 (extortion) and started investigation. “We have secured Madhina and Shyam. Karthik is already in Coimbatore Central Prison in connection with another case,” the officer said. “Preliminary inquiry revealed that the trio are habitual offenders and extorted money from several people.

Nearly six years after the SC ruled that RBI had to reveal information about functioning of banks under the Act, major banks, including SBI and HDFC, had urged the SC to recall its order, saying they can’t reveal confidential information of account holders. A batch of senior advocates, including SG Tushar Mehta, Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the banks, told the court that the banking industry could be adversely affected and the SC’s order might be misused for corporate rivalry. But a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran turned down their plea. “No effort was made by any of the applicants to get themselves impleaded... The applications styled as recall are essentially applications for review,” the bench said adding that the plea of the banks was not maintainable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-dismisses-banks-plea-for-exemption-from-rti-law/articleshow/82319425.cms||---

According to the Palladam police, the woman is battling for her life at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH).An investigation officer identified the deceased as P Brindha and her younger sister Prasantha, daughters of P Tamilselvi-Prabhu couple of Devakottai in Sivaganga district.The officer said the 28-year-old woman had separated from her 35-year-old husband, who was a daily wage labourer, nine months ago. “She, along with her daughters, was residing with her parents and brothers at Kuppusamy Naidu Puram near Palladam since then.” According to the officer, Tamilselvi’s parents and brothers had asked her to reunite with her husband, stating only then she could lead a good life. “However, she was in no mood to pay heed to their demands. It affected her ties with the family members, as a verbal spat ensued among them. Frustrated, she fed her children water mixed with rat poison on Tuesday night and she also consumed the same. However, nothing happened to them as the quantity of poison that they had taken was less.”Tamilselvi, the officer said, fed her children rat poison on Wednesday as well. She also consumed the same. “The woman became unconscious and the three were rushed to the Palladam government hospital, where doctors gave them first aid and referred them to the Tirupur government hospital.”Tamilselvi and Prasantha were later shifted to the CMCH. While Brindha died at the Tirupur government hospital on Thursday morning, Prasantha breathed her last at the CMCH. “Tamilselvi’s condition is critical,” the officer said. The Palladam police have registered a case against Tamilselvi under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/woman-poisons-daughters-to-death/articleshow/82316698.cms||---
---||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay pilot uses nitrogen plants to generate oxygen||MUMBAI: IIT-Bombay has stepped in to offer a quick and simple solution to the oxygen crisis unfolding nationally. The institute, in collaboration with Tata Consulting Engineers (TCE), has successfully carried out a pilot project to convert nitrogen generator plants into oxygen generators, simply by replacing the molecular filters. Conversion of existing plants will take only 3-4 days, unlike setting up a new oxygen plant that could take at least 45 days. And, these pressure swing adsorption (PSA) nitrogen plants are in abundance in industrial units across India. N2 to O2, 85% cheaper plant conversion is the solution to go toConversion of a decent-sized nitrogen plant may cost around 10-15% of the total cost of setting up a new oxygen plant. While the institute has validated the proof of the concept, the technology needs to be scaled up at multiple locations to help the country tide over the current emergency. IIT-Bombay professor Milind Atrey, who specialises in cryogenic engineering, said such nitrogen plants reject oxygen from the atmosphere, filter the nitrogen and then liquefy it for laboratory or industrial use. “If the molecular carbon sieves (filters) in these plants are replaced with zeolite (another mineral) and the settings are modified a bit, we can do the reverse. Instead of rejecting oxygen from the atmosphere, this conversion process will help in its production,” said Atrey. Nitrogen plants are used in oil refineries, food and several other industries. Bringing all these plants under one regulatory body and procuring zeolite from available vendors can help in the mass production of oxygen to save lives, he added. An MoU was signed between IIT, TCE and Spantech Engineers (which deals with PSA nitrogen and oxygen plants) to finalise a standard operating procedure (SOP) to scale up the technology. Spantech helped install the components of the plant at IIT-B’s refrigeration and cryogenics lab. Oxygen production could be achieved at 3.5 atmospheric pressure with a purity level of 93-96%, which can be used in Covid hospitals. The technology is proven and has been in use since the 1970s, said Amit Sharma, managing director, TCE. “The centre has directed setting up over 500 PSA oxygen plants. But, till then, this approach of conversion may be used under emergency needs. Post conversion of an existing nitrogen plant, the oxygen produced is approximately one third of the capacity of the original nitrogen plant output,” said Sharma. The production will vary depending on the capacity of the nitrogen plants. He added, “Procuring zeolite could be a challenge. But both private and government entities have been procuring such zeolite material for the new oxygen plants and for industrial use and hence the same material could be used for this conversion.” Medical grade zeolite is produced by global firms from Europe and the United States primarily, he said. The converted plant must be tested for quality and safety. Approval is needed from Central Pollution Control Board and local administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/iit-bombay-pilot-uses-nitrogen-plants-to-generate-o2/articleshow/82318420.cms||Yogita Rao

With this, the district’s Covid tally has zoomed past another milestone of 77,000-mark to 77,280. While 1,019 patients were discharged, that didn’t make much difference to the number of active cases, which stood at 6,922 on the day.The Covid-19 toll increased by one to 720, as a 38-year-old man, who was admitted to a private hospital on April 14 and tested positive for the virus on April 23, died of pneumonia on Wednesday. He didn’t have any comorbidities.The recovery rate has, meanwhile, plunged to an all-time low of 88.8%. It is to be noted that 68,638 of the 77,280 Covid infected have recovered in the district so far. The positivity rate was, meanwhile, maintained at 10%, with the district testing more than 10,000 samples for the presence of virus.Officials said the caseload from the city limits had increased to 62.35% on Thursday. However, at 6.86%, Thudiyalur saw a dip in the caseload. In a press statement, the city corporation said 830 of the new cases were reported from its limits, with east zone alone accounting for 203 cases. The number of containment zones in the district has also increased to 159.Private Covid care centres are comping up in the district to ensure beds for the people testing positive for the virus. There are seven such centres with a combined bed strength of 251. Among the private Covid care centres are hotel Aloft (run by Atlas Pain Care), Hotel ESS Grande (run by SPT Hospital) and hotel Annamalai (run by Sowmiya Hospital).While 1,515 beds were available for Covid patients in hospitals in the district as on Thursday, only 604 of them had oxygen facilities.The day also saw the number of people getting vaccinated dip to 1,645. This is despite the district having 5,090 doses of vaccine.Anticipating the growing rush for the jab from the people aged between 18 years and 45 years from May 1, the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital authorities have established a vaccination centre at the Government Arts College to prevent the hospital from getting overcrowded. However, with vaccines yet to arrive and CoWin app not showing prior registrations, officials have confined the preparations to creating an entrance and rooms for people to wait, get vaccinated and keep them in observation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/recovery-rate-plunges-to-88-8/articleshow/82316695.cms||---

Both the municipal corporations have warned the firm that its contract will be terminated, however, they have failed to make any alternative arrangements. There have been many warning letters issued to the private company who is responsible for the garbage collection, but they have all been in vain and the situation of garbage disposal is worsening. Vimal Kumar, councillor of ward 22 in JMC-Heritage said that in the interior areas of his ward’s vehicles are not coming. “I get complaints on a daily basis from citizens on the delayed vehicles who usually do not come on time and there is a gap of three – five days. In many places where garbage depots were removed have come back,” said Kumar. Komal Saini, a resident of Malviya Nagar says that after continuous complaints of one week, vehicle arrived at her locality. In Vidhyadhar Nagar complaints were rising on the piles of garbage collected on every road corner when residents paid a private tractor owner to pick up garbage from their area before this situation become worse. Somya Gurjar, mayor of JMC-Greater, started a process of garbage collection in Ward 84 and 85 in which JMC picks up garbage using their own resources. But after months of its implementation, they are not able to expand it further. Shutting down the entire system will be detrimental to the sanitation condition of the city. Deputy mayor of JMC-Greater Puneet Karnawat has recently written a note sheet to the commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh saying that verification of the bills of company should be done within 15 days. “Since March 2017, the company has been doing door-to-door garbage operations in Jaipur, but the conditions that were there are not being met. Even after this, Rs 171 crore were given as advance payment without proper verification of the company’s bills. Due to the careless work of the company 480 notices have been given. The company should be made to work under the contract and it should be ensured that all bills are checked within15 days before clearing their bills,” said Karnawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-fails-to-make-plan-b-for-collection-of-garbage/articleshow/82316709.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Melanistic Little Egret sighted in Jaisalmer district||JAISALMER: A single Melanistic Little Egret, a species of egrets and herons group of birds, having scientific name egretta garzetta, has been sighted after many years in India at the Oran (sacred forest) of Shree Degrai Temple, near Rasla of Fatehgarh tehsil in Jaisalmer district. This rare bird was sighted and photographed by amateur bird watcher Sumer Singh Bhati of Sanwta village during his routine monitoring of birds in the forest. Dr Sumit Dookia of Guru Govind Singh Indraprasth University confirmed that many rare birds are sighted these days. Melanistic little egret has also been recorded after a long time in India. Dookia said melanism is generally defined as an increase of dark pigment in the plumage, resulting in a blackish appearance. Also, many different mutations in many different genes promote melanism in birds. He said, “There are records of sighting of melanistic cattle egret, another species from the egret & heron group. In 1995, a grey coloured cattle egret was recorded in Goa, in 2013 a melanistic cattle egret was sighted in Jharkhand, in 2017 a bluish cattle egret was recorded in Guwahati and in 2020 a black cattle egret was sighted in Odisha.” Bird expert Parth Jagani said this is one of the rarest and first records of a melanistic little egret in India. Finding such rare birds in Degrai Oran is a good sign. Senior birder Sudhir Vyas said it’s a small heron, the size of little egret. The only all-dark heron of this size is black heron, egretta ardesiaca, of sub-Saharan Africa. A vagrant can be ruled out, as black heron has a bushy crest and dark eyes and has a very distinctive style of hunting. This bird has yellow iris and a thin crest plume, just one feather visible. He said, “Dark phase reef is ruled out, as this bird is too dark with no white on its throat and slim, all black bill. Reef would have slate grey plumage, white throat and with some yellow on a thicker bill.” He said, “The little reef hybrid option is also ruled out. Usually paler grey, with white patches on face and wings. There was a fine example at Bhindawas a few years ago. A dark phase reef also appeared in that area around that time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/melanistic-little-egret-sighted-in-jaisalmer-dist/articleshow/82316719.cms||---

The institute is also planning to develop a prototype of an oxygen generator. After recovering from Covid-19, IIT-D director V Ramgopal Rao announced on twitter that the institution has “handed over many cylinders to the local administration for oxygen use. Will be giving more.” Rao told TOI that “on an emergency basis, we have given a few 50-litre cylinders to the authorities. Now, we have around 200 of them in our laboratories. We are taking stock of the situation. IIT also has 4,000 people and we plan to keep some for emergency purposes.” He explained that these cylinders do not have oxygen, but can be easily converted into oxygen cylinders. “Efforts are also on for building an oxygen generator prototype,” the director tweeted. He further stated that “there was a tweet by a professor from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune stating that they used common chemicals like Hydrogen Peroxide, which is used in dry cleaning centres, to produce oxygen. I have asked our chemical engineering department to look into it. The idea is to create oxygen in a week’s time. However, it is too early to say anything. We need to see whether the gas thus produced is fit for human consumption.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iit-d-to-provide-more-cylinders-build-prototype-of-o2-generator/articleshow/82317508.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

While hearing a bunch of PILs, including a suo motu based on TOI report on bed shortage for Covid-19 patients, amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar assisted by Nidhi Dayani and Indian Medical Association (IMA) counsel Bhanudas Kulkarni pointed out how Jalna received the essential drug in such a large number directly from two manufacturers, while other cities were facing an acute shortage. Calculating the number of vials needed at Jalna in proportion to patients, the duo contended that total entitlement should be 5,980 for 10 days, but it received 30,000. “The official record shows that there were 7,603 active cases in Jalna on April 20 and 78,484 in Nagpur,” they argued. Requesting the HC to grant time to verify lawyers’ accusations, FDA assistant commissioner Ballal pointed out that Jalna received about 20,000 vials as per the WhatsApp message, but he can’t make any official statement without confirming the facts. “If the lawyers’ information is correct, it would constitute a precise and extremely good reason for nodal officer to immediately make district-wise allocation. It would help in making the pharmaceutical companies accountable. Those can be taken to task for sending excess vials to a particular district while not providing a single dose to others,” the judges said. Earlier, they asked Rokde whether he had passed any order on the formula for making Remdesivir's district-wise allocation. They also asked him about the backlog created after the centre's April 24 order regarding increasing supply to Maharashtra to 4.35 lakh vials. “On the last date, the government had informed that the pharmaceutical companies were not following the mandate of this order. They weren’t sending an adequate number of vials in accordance with the quota fixed by the apex level central committee,” the judges said before adjourning the hearing till 2.30pm on Friday. Crack down on Rem blackmarketing, CP told While taking suo motu cognizance of a media report regarding Remdesivir’s blackmarketing for which 32 persons, including a doctor, have been arrested so far, the HC directed police commissioner Amitesh Kumar to take stern action against the accused and expedite their court trials. The CP assured that all steps as per the law would be taken and in some cases charge-sheets would be filed by May 3. While appointing Shreerang Bhandarkar as amicus to draft the application, the judges said the time consumed for investigation of offences and disposal of the criminal trials aren’t dissuading the accused from indulging in such activities. “In such an unprecedented crisis, it’s necessary to take certain measures to deter unscrupulous elements from indulging in black marketing of lifesaving drugs. The HC can’t be mute spectator and turn Nelson’s eye to such incidents,” the judges said before adjourning the hearing till May 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/on-30k-remdesivir-vials-for-jalna-hc-asks-govt-to-remove-disparity/articleshow/82316724.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC: No jail inmate to be denied vax for want of Aadhaar card||Mumbai: Bombay high court on Thursday, observing that vaccination is the “cheapest and most effective way to contain the Covid-19 pandemic”, asked if an Aadhaar card was mandatory for prisoners to get the shots. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni asked the Centre and state to ponder over it, saying, “This is a matter of policy”. The HC also asked how many doctors were there in prisons and pointed how one had just three ayurveda doctors.No inmates can be denied the vaccine because they did not have an Aadhaar card, said the bench while hearing a suo motu PIL on tackling recent Covid case surge in prisons across Maharashtra. The state advocate general (AG) Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said jail authorities have written on the ID card issue to the central government.The bench later told additional solicitor general Anil Singh who appears for the central government that it was an “important policy issue” and would have a “pan- India ramification”. It pointed out to possible use of biometrics. The AG said the 47 prisons also house foreigners who do not have Aadhaar cards. He also agreed to a suggestion from senior counsel Mihir Desai who had intervened on behalf of People’s Union for Civil Liberties that vaccination camps can be held inside prison compounds for inmates as a safety and logistical aspect.Desai said there were three main issues pertaining to prisons—decongesting them, health of inmates and their communication with family and lawyers, during the pandemic and lockdown.He said the high-power committee set up by the state pursuant to the Supreme Court order last year to grant emergency parole or bail to inmates had met last May and a drive was conducted but it should be a “regular feature, not one time”. Vijay Raghavan, a criminology expert from Tata Institute of Social Sciences also said another apex court-appointed panel—Under Trial Review committee set up to identify categories among under trial prisoners who could be given emergency bail to decongest prisons does meet but their recommendations ought to be enforced by trial courts which finally have to pass bail orders.The state said it would get more clarity on certain data sought by the HC and the matter will now be heard next on Tuesday, May 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-no-jail-inmate-to-be-denied-vax-for-want-of-aadhaar-card/articleshow/82318470.cms||---

---||Mumbai||A Supermoon ‘miracle’: Tidal water flows into Panje wetland in Maharashtra||Navi Mumbai: The Supermoon phenomenon that occurred early this week has performed a small ‘miracle’ at the parched Panje wetland, which the environmentalists were quite literally begging the government to do. Due to the strong tidal effects of the Supermoon, the seawater at Panje breached the man-made bunds that were blocking the water movement and now several migratory birds have returned to the wetland. A Supermoon occurs when the moon’s orbit is closest (perigee) to Earth at the same time it is full. Bird-watchers were delighted to find several tagged greater sandplover birds, after nearly three years. The greater sandplover is a small, yet hardy, migratory bird which flies hundreds of kilometers from the central desert areas near Turkey.The Supermoon effect has further encouraged environmentalists to continue their fight to permanently save the wetland. “Panje had been reduced to a dry land with the blocking of five tidal water inlets by vested interests despite an order from the National Green Tribunal (NTG) to clear them. Some tidal water, however, flowed over the man-made bunds into parts of the wetland, thanks to the recent supermoon event,” said activist B N Kumar of NGO NatConnect Foundation. Local birder Parag Gharat, who ventured out with his camera after seeing the waterflow, spotted many tagged birds in the last two days. After cross-checking with Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), the tagged birds were identified as greater sandplover (Charadrius leschenaultii).“The presence of migratory birds teach us the importance of maintaining our wetlands as they are urban sponges that absorb flood waters. Wetlands are home to several microbes which are essential for our biodiversity as we are taught in our schools,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/a-supermoon-miracle-tidal-water-flows-into-panje-wetland-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82318570.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Chandigarh||Police restrict entry to Covid ward during CM’s visit||Jind: Two Covid-19 patients had to wait outside the gate of the Jind civil hospital on Thursday during the visit of Haryana chief minister ML Khattar led to strict security provisions by the police. The patients and their attendants were forced to wait for 40 minutes outside the dedicated ward for patients of Covid-19. Khattar, who on Thursday inspected hospitals in Haryana, including Jind, Ambala, and Karnal, reached the Jind civil hospital at around 12.30 pm and the police immediately restricted entry to the hospital. One of the Covid-19 patients, who belonged to Khatkar village, was in a wheelchair and his worried family started getting restless and said that his oxygen saturation level had dropped to around 70. Worried about the deteriorating condition of the patients waiting outside, people started knocking on the door closed by the police. After persistent knocking by an elderly person accompanying a Covid 19 patient, a cop opened the door to let the patients into the Covid-19 ward. The patients’ attendants complained the CM’s visit had disrupted the ward instead of giving any relief. Some family members also raised the issue with the chief minister who instructed the civil surgeon not to repeat any such incident in the name of the protocol. As soon as Khattar left the hospital, the attendants of the patients rushed toward Covid-19 ward to get updates about their relatives. Civil surgeon Manjeet Singh said that entry was restricted for about five minutes during the visit of the chief minister and denied any patient faced a problem during the CM’s visit. “I have inquired into the matter and no problem occurred due to the visit in the hospital,” he said. The low-key and surprise visit by the chief minister also thwarted any protest by farmers against him. On getting to know about the CM’s visit, they rushed to the PWD rest house but the CM's helicopter had taken off by then. The angry farmers alleged that Jind DC and SP had deliberately declared an area where Khattar was scheduled to reach as a containment zone for a day. The farmers then protested outside local BJP MLA Krishan Midda's residence for over two hours. They alleged Midda had tried to intimidate farmers and called a sarv khap mahapanchayat on May 3 at Khatkar toll plaza to take stringent action against BJP-JJP coalition leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/police-restrict-entry-to-covid-ward-during-cms-visit/articleshow/82317514.cms||---
---||Nagpur||63 Tocilizumab injections arrive, no Remdesivir for second day||Nagpur: The speculations over availability of Tocilizumab injection, considered to be highly effective against cytokine storm in severe Covid patients, were put to rest after Nagpur received 63 out of 800 sent to the state by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and Department of Pharmaceuticals. After Pune which got 87 injections, Nagpur’s quota was second in the state with the percentage of active patient being 11%, while Mumbai got 57. The government institutions across the state got around 200 injections. Though Tocilizumab’s arrival brought a ray of hope for some, Nagpur received no stock of Remdesivir for second day in a row even as the High court had made it clear that the quota for the city needs to be increased. Among other districts in Vidarbha, Chandrapur got 21 injections of Tocilizumab while Gondia and Amravati got six each. Bhandara and Yavatmal got 10 each while Wardha five, Akola four and Gadchiroli too got three injections. As per the allotment order, the district collectors were asked to distribute the stock among to Covid hospitals with the divisional commissioner supervising the local share. Nagpur district collector Ravindra Thakare said like Remdesivir and oxygen, Tocilizumab injections would be allotted by his office. “Though it’s a small quantity, we will issue an allocation order soon,” said Thakare adding the distribution would be fair and balanced without any pressure. In the meantime, doctors are perturbed due to continued shortage of Remdesivir. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of the Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA), said that administering Remdesivir on and off is nothing but “mockery of the laid down treatment protocols and guidelines”. “The viral load clearance would remain incomplete if the Remdesivir doses are not given as per the medical norms (2+1+1+1+1),” said Marar and added, “The disease can relapse anytime after temporary recovery.” Dr Sanjay Jain, director of Shanti Mohan hospital, said that at least nine critical patients in his hospital are waiting for two days. “We are not getting Remdesivir from the collector’s office but we hear it’s available in the black market,” he said. It's learnt, around 12,000 Remdesivir vials were sent to government hospitals Nagpur division, which included 4,000 for Akola, as per the rate contract with the private stockists of the pharmaceutical company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/63-tocilizumab-injections-arrive-no-remdesivir-for-second-day/articleshow/82316754.cms||Soumitra Bose

A man hanging out in the underpass had lit the fire. The Sayajigunj police arrested Kalu Bariya, a resident of Akota, after CCTV footage showed him sitting near the underpass. “Some garbage was lying near the end of the underpass. Bariya thought of cleaning it up so he lit the fire in the garbage and left for tea. The flames though reached the advertising boards installed on the walls and soon the fire spread on both ends of the underpass,” said V B Aal, Sayajigunj police inspector. Bariya was seen walking by casually after smoke began billowing out of the underpass. “His act wasn’t intentional. But we have arrested Baria who is a casual labourer,” Aal added. Both sides of the underpass that connect Sayajigunj with R C Dutt Road were severely damaged due to the fire. On Wednesday, the railway had to stop traffic for about 20 minutes as the rail tracks pass right above the underpass. No person was, however, injured in the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/underpass-fire-sparked-by-labourer/articleshow/82315203.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC halts vaccination drive for 3 days as stocks run low||MUMBAI: The BMC on Thursday halted Covid-19 vaccination in the city for three days, from Friday to Sunday, due to unavailability of doses. The decision came on a day both mayor Kishori Pednekar and additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide appealed to people to not throng centres without appointments as overcrowding could help spread the virus. Vaccination centres have seen chaotic scenes throughout the week as people have been standing in serpentine queues, particularly senior citizens who are due for their second doses but have been grappling with cancellations on Co-Win and stockout notices. From an all-time high of 72,606 vaccinations on Tuesday, the city’s numbers dropped to 28,782 on Thursday. The BMC reiterated that registered people and those coming for the second dose will be given preference whenever doses arrive. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said they were forced to take the decision looking at the hardship people have been going through. On Wednesday night, Mumbai had received 76,000 doses. “After the day’s vaccination, we would have been left with merely 20,000 doses. For that much, it made little sense to keep so many centres open. Many would have stood in queues, hopeful of getting doses,” he said.Kakani added that if the BMC receives stocks in between, the drive would be started again with a day’s notice. In Mumbai, a little over 61% of the estimated 40 lakh eligible for vaccination have taken the first dose, while merely 12% have taken both the doses. Earlier in the day, Pednekar, who dropped in to the Nesco vaccination centre in Goregaon, urged citizens to leave their homes only after getting themselves registered on Co-Win. A few citizens, who had queued up at Nesco for hours, complained to the mayor about the lack of planning. “If so many people crowd at vaccination centres, chances of getting infected by Covid cannot be ruled out,” she told the gathering. AMC Bhide, too, tried to allay the fears of people through a series of tweets reiterating that Mumbai will not start mass vaccination for the 18-plus category from May 1 and there would be adequate scope for those 45 and above to get vaccinated. Requesting senior citizens to not crowd or stand in long queues, she said vaccine was in short supply for now. She added those who have taken their first dose are reasonably protected. “Even if there is a slight delay in getting their 2nd dose, that should not be a major problem. Senior citizens should not get scared because of that,” she tweeted. “Even when new drive for 18-44 starts, the centres available now will continue to remain active for 45+ years citizens. BMC will add at least 500 more public and private centres for new drive,” she wrote in a tweet. She also urged people to double-mask while coming to vaccination centres. The vaccine crisis was evident at the state level too, where vaccination on Wednesday had dropped to 2,37,700 from 3,88,247 on Tuesday and the record-breaking 5,34,372 vaccinations on Monday. The Centre, for the second day in a row, downplayed the vaccinate shortage in Maharashtra by saying that it has given 1.63 crore doses, of which 1.56 crore have been consumed. There was a balance of 7.49 lakh vaccine doses still available with the state. State officials maintained that most of the stocks were with district and vaccination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-halts-vaccination-drive-for-3-days-as-stocks-run-low/articleshow/82318567.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The deceased, Ajaysinh Jadeja, was a resident of Sainik society in Gondal town. His sister Hinaba Jadeja lodged a complaint with Gondal town police against unidentified persons while naming Sachin Dhaduk as one of the suspects. Ajaysinh and his sister used to run a spa centre at Nirmala Convent Road in Rajkot city, while their mother lived in Gondal. Last Sunday, he got a call from Dhaduk, asking to meet him. After the call, Ajaysinh left from home telling his mother that he would be back in a few minutes. But he didn’t return till next day and the family started searching for him. On Wednesday, his body was found from a farm well on the Rajkot-Junagadh highway. The body which had multiple stab wounds was tied to a big stone. “We are probing this murder case from various angles. His sister named Dhaduk as one of the suspects. Dhaduk has been missing ever since he called up Ajaysinh. A few weeks ago, around five persons were arrested from Sainik Society of Gondal for pelting stones on a public transport bus. Those arrested suspected that Ajaysinh had given their names to police and were allegedly threatening him. We are probing on all angles,” a police official informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mans-body-tied-to-stone-found-in-well/articleshow/82315359.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Covid cases turn serious as wait for test reports delays treatment||Kolkata: The prolonged delay in RT-PCR reports that physicians and hospitals demand before they start treating Covid patients is compromising their condition, leading to late hospitalisation, extended treatment and exacerbating the bed crisis, say doctors. While patients were reporting to hospitals within four-five days of Covid symptoms that allowed early intervention and prevented the worsening of condition in the first wave, they are doing so after 10-14 days now, when their condition is so compromised that they are in respiratory distress. This is primarily happening due to delay in Covid testing. RT-PCR test is currently mandatory for hospitalization of Covid and non-Covid patients. Responding to the situation, the health department issued a circular on Thursday evening, asking hospitals to admit emergency patients to dedicated beds for patients with serious acute respiratory infection (SARI) and then undertake a rapid antigen test to check if the patient has Covid. “No patient can be referred without stabilizing and arranging bed in the hospital referred,” the circular stated. While private diagnostic laboratories said they were stretched beyond capacity, government laboratories like NICED have spare capacity that lies unused. “We can run tests on 4,000 samples in a day. But currently, we are testing less than the capacity,” said NICED director Shanta Dutta. The high throughput COBAS 6800 is testing about 1,200 samples daily on an average, or under a third of the capacity. Capacities at other government labs are also not being optimally used. SSKM, RG Kar and School of Tropical Medicine are capable of testing around 2,000 samples each but are currently running 1,000 to 1,400 tests daily. Private labs like Dr LalPath Lab and Suraksha Diagnostics, on the other hand, are pushing their capacity to the limit. While the former is doing 3,000-4,500 tests daily, the latter is testing 1,500-2,000 samples daily. Sodepur resident Vipul Kumar Singh, who could get a booking for swab collection at a private diagnostic centre on Sunday after trying since Friday, was yet to get a report on Thursday, nine days after the onset of fever and almost a week after he was advised to undergo a Covid test. With no let up in his fever, he is desperate for treatment but hospitals refused to admit him without a Covid confirmation report. There have been instances of deaths of patients waiting for Covid report. “The delay in testing and getting the report is turning mild cases serious and serious cases severe. This is leading to hospitalisation of many patients who could have been treated at home with early intervention. Also, by the time they are landing in hospital, they require critical care and are taking longer to recuperate. This is accentuating the bed crisis,” said a doctor attached with a government Covid facility. Internal medicine specialist Arindam Biswas said there was no point waiting for the RT-PCR report if the symptoms indicated Covid and doctors needed to start medications to prevent the condition from deteriorating. “Another way is a CT scan as this imaging can find suggestive signs of the infection. Waiting for a Covid report with strong symptoms can be suicidal,” said Biswas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-cases-turn-serious-as-wait-for-test-reports-delays-treatment/articleshow/82316006.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Anaesthetists chipping in for Covid & non-Covid surgeries||NAGPUR: Anesthetists have taken centrestage in the Covid-19 crisis like never before. They are not only providing the necessary care to patients in wards, but also conducting surgeries in both Covid and non-Covid operation theaters. Braving all the odds, anesthesiologists managed to conduct nearly 400 surgeries on Covid positive patients in GMCH alone, 310 of them were caesareans of Covid mothers. Young residents of this department are working in Covid wards too. “Most of us work alternatively in Covid and non-Covid operating rooms. Working in OPDs with PPE kits is not as simple as it looks,” said Dr Mukul Deshpande, a resident of the anesthesia department. Lack of visibility due to PPE is leading to difficulty in intubation. “Like all the other doctors, we are also at risk of contracting Covid. But our risk is more because an anesthesiologist is required for all types of surgeries,” said another doctor. According to the figures, 50 doctors from their department have tested positive for Covid in the last one year. Being specialists of airway management, anesthesiologists have been working with general physicians, chest physicians and intensivists since the outbreak of the pandemic. Experts in emergent airway management, acute and intensive care, they know the exact time of intubation and ventilation. This expertise helps in opening up collapsed lungs, improves oxygenation, decreases the strain and helps the lungs to heal. “These young anesthesiologists are working knowing full well that there are maximum chances of getting infected while intubating these patients. They are working selflessly and tirelessly. They are making us proud to be anesthesiologists,” said senior anesthesiologist Dr Sunil Dixit, who has developed India’s epidural syringe. The Indian Society of Anaesthesiologists (ISA) had issued an advisory in 2020 stating that there could be a sudden patient surge coupled with healthcare demands. “Resources in hospitals can get exhausted quickly and medical personnel can be under tremendous work stress, both clinical and psychological. In the coming days, a large number of patients may suddenly require oxygen therapy, tracheal intubation and ventilatory support,” reads the advisory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/anaesthetists-chipping-in-for-covid-non-covid-surgeries/articleshow/82316787.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Organisations such as Feed the Needy, Surge Impact, Rubaroo, Cyber Jagruthi, Camp Diaries are part of these efforts. “The alliance’s objective is to ensure that the patients or their relatives are served in a quick, efficient and a personalised manner instead of them having to navigate through a vast number of unverified, standalone sources,” said Raj Janagam, spokesperson for the alliance. The web app gives users data on real-time hospital bed availability, plasma sources, suppliers of critical medicines, non-hospital isolation and care centres, food providers and a host of other ancillary services. “Our biggest challenge is the availability of quality real-time information. The alliance is actively tying up with hospitals, healthcare centres and other ecosystem partners that can be part of resource support groups specifically set up to help in rapid fulfilment of emergency requests”, said Karan S Kumar, who developed the app. The helpline number (040-67419503), which will be active from April 30, provides an alternate way to register a request. Once the request is registered, it will be allocated and managed by a group of dedicated and trained volunteers. In the context of an overwhelmed medical system, this service aims to streamline the demand and supply of critical care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/support-groups-come-together-to-streamline-aid-operations/articleshow/82317549.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Dehradun||Battled Covid-19 for three weeks, now helping patients||ALMORA: Over the last one-and-a-half years, Rakesh Joshi, the district disaster management officer of Almora, has become the go-to person for anyone in need of help in the district related to Covid-19. The official had himself contracted the virus sometime ago and had to be admitted in ICU for almost three weeks after his confition deteriorated. Fully recovered now, he is putting in long hours at work. “The first case of Covid-19 surfaced in the district on April 5, 2020. For the next five months after that, I couldn’t pay a visit to my family. My control room team, consisting of 12 employees, and I were working round the clock to reach out to those in need,” says Joshi, who remains available in the office from 6 in the morning till 11 in the night. In August last year, Joshi contracted Covid-19 himself. Initially, he was admitted to the Almora Base Hospital but when his condition deteriorated, he was taken to Dr Susheela Tiwari Medical College and Hospital in Haldwani. For about three weeks, he was kept in the ICU ward of the facility. “It was a difficult time for me and my family but we came out of it stronger. After recuperating, I spent some time with my family and then came back to Almora to resume work,” recalls Joshi. A native of the Dhaula Devi block of Almora, Joshi’s family consists of his wife who works at the Nainital District Co-operative Bank, and lives in Haldwani along with the couple’s nine-year-old daughter and seven-month-old boy. Recently, Joshi has also taken up the task of helping the migrant workers coming to the hill town from various states. His team makes sure that anyone who is found Covid-19 positive is administered proper treatment and those in home isolation are provided with medicine kits and other necessary supplies. When asked what keeps him going, Joshi said, “There are days when I miss my family a lot. I couldn’t even be with my wife and daughter on their birthdays. Nonetheless, I have been showered with blessings by thousands of people in the last year. They are my family now. Their love and support keep me on my toes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/battled-covid-19-for-three-weeks-now-helping-patients/articleshow/82316009.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Lockdown-like curbs till May 15; prepare for third wave, says CM||MUMBAI: Even as the state government on Thursday extended the lockdown-like restrictions till 7am on May 15, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed district administrations to prepare for the third wave of the pandemic. The CM instructed officials to set up oxygen plants without delay and to ensure adequate stock of essential medicines. He also asked officials to keep a record of labourers coming from other states. Thackeray, during a marathon meeting with all divisional commissioners and district collectors, said new Covid cases have stabilised to some extent due to strict implementation of the lockdown-like restrictions, but they should plan to tackle the third wave. He said permissions should be given to set up oxygen plants, wherever necessary, and district administrations should take care of adequate supply of oxygen in future. “In the wake of the third wave, stock up on the essential medicines and take help from local doctors in rural areas,” he added. Taking cognisance of MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s demand, the CM asked all districts to maintain records of migrant labourers who are expected to return to Maharashtra after the number of cases start reducing. “The record should be collected from industries and contractors and precautionary measures, like testing and isolating infected labourers, should be taken.” The state has decided to give free vaccination for the 18-44 age group and for this, focus should be on proper implementation, instructed the CM. Taking note of the recent fire incidents in Covid hospitals, chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte directed all authorities to complete the fire safety audits and submit the reports immediately. Kunte, in the order extending the lockdown-like curbs, said that due to the threat of rising Covid cases, the state was imperative to continue the emergency measures to contain the spread of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-lockdown-like-curbs-till-may-15-prepare-for-third-wave-says-cm/articleshow/82317617.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Kolkata||In Covid times, Bow Barracks comes out to join poll festival||Kolkata: Eddie Mooney’s 1989 classic “Love in your eyes” captures the image of youths donning fashionable tees, masks and goggles giggling their way to the poll booths and a group of elderlies — dressed in their smart attires — sipping on tea and lemon juice in paper cups waiting for a solitary auto-rickshaw that has been shuttling between the cluster of red-brick buildings and the poll booth at Elias Meyer School on CR Avenue barely 150 metres away. At a time when a large number of voters in Kolkata didn’t step out to vote in the shadow of Covid fears, a 300-strong Anglo Indian community at Bow Barracks in north Kolkata voted in a festive mood on Thursday. The residents — young and old — said they wouldn’t miss their votes come what may. “There has not been a single occasion in my life when I have missed voting. Voting infuses in me a certain appeal that helps me grow a stronger bond with this country and this city which has been my home since birth. How can I miss it?” said 67-year-old Janice Rozario, adjusting her mask tightly around her face while speaking. Bow Barracks — one of the original addresses of the Anglo-Indian community of Kolkata — is now a conglomeration of Chinese, South Indian and Muslims along with the Anglo Indian communities and home to 144 families with 300-odd valid voters. At a time when voter turnout in entire north Kolkata was only 57.85% with Chowringhee contributing only 51.98%, at Bow Barracks situated in the same constituency 280 voters out of a total of 300 cast their votes, as per an estimate by community party workers. “Almost everyone voted here. There were only a few elderly residents who were either too sick or immobile and were refrained from going to cast their votes,” said Dionne Alexander, a resident who was also overseeing that every senior citizen was transported to the venue and didn’t have to walk under the sun. Prior to the elections, restoration of the crumbling buildings was the primary sore point of the residents living here. But in January this year, the stand-off between the residents and the KIT — who had flagged the buildings as dilapidated and unsafe for human use in 1980 and had stopped repairs — had ended and KMDA began fresh restoration of the buildings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-covid-times-bow-barracks-comes-out-to-join-poll-festival/articleshow/82316841.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The authorities on Thursday held an online meeting with several such associations NGOs to discuss the plan. A proposal has been placed to all associations if they can pool unused or half-used oxygen cylinders to make an inventory. “We are requesting all welfare associations not to hold back oxygen stock so that others are not deprived. If someone has oxygen, please declare to NKDA so that an inventory could be prepared so that at least affected persons can utilize them,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen. Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town-based NGO New Town Forum and News, said they were appealing to the housing societies to declare if they have any oxygen stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nkda-plans-oxygen-pooling/articleshow/82316016.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Aam Aadmi Party’s Chamba spokesperson Muhammad Saleem said the contractor had brought 20 labourers to Pangi for building the bus station and, of them, five had tested positive. But instead of putting them in a quarantined house, he put them in a public toilet frequented by passengers, and thus he also exposed them to the risk of infection. "It is highly shameful of the Himachal Pradesh government," Saleem said. Confronted, Chamba chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Kapil Sharma said he had sent the block medical officer of Pangi to the site and found the labourers isolated in a proper accommodation. He claimed: "They might have gone to Sulabh Shaulaya, where someone clicked their photograph." Chamba deputy commissioner D C Rana also denied that the labourers had been isolated in a toilet. He said: "They were using ‘sulabh shauchlaya’, which a few people objected to, so the directions were issued to isolate them in a proper accommodation with toilet facility. All of them were isolated in a separate block at the bus stand."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/5-labourers-isolated-in-chamba-bus-stand-toilet/articleshow/82317540.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Kolkata||Second Cov wave sweeps police force, claims one||Kolkata: The city police lost its first personnel — 53-year-old Debajyoti Konar, a senior inspector — to the second Covid wave on Wednesday. The death came hours before the final phase of elections that saw almost 6,000 personnel being mobilized on a violence-ridden day. A total of 220 personnel — including OCs of key police stations in areas that went to polls on Thursday — are currently down with Covid-19. “Konar fell ill on April 20 at the Kidderpore KP Reserve Force barracks and suffered from shortness of breath. He was admitted to a Behala hospital where he was put on oxygen for a couple of days. When he recovered, he was taken to his native place in Burdwan by his family members. But his problem relapsed and he was admitted to a hospital at Durgapur on Tuesday. He was declared dead on Wednesday. He is survived by his wife and daughter,” said an officer from the welfare cell. Konar had earlier served as an additional OC of Regent Park traffic guard and later as additional OC, Writers’ Buildings. Lalbazar did not confirm if he had taken two shots of vaccine. The death, though, is bound to affect the morale of several officers in key police stations and traffic guards in Kolkata Police who are down with the virus. This has led to worries about post-poll and result day deployment. The biggest challenge though will be May 2 when the force has to stop spontaneous celebrations on the streets by party workers following the EC and Calcutta High Court orders. From three cases at the starting of the month to 220 cases on the eve of the final polling day in Kolkata, there are concerns about more acceleration in positive cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/second-cov-wave-sweeps-police-force-claims-one/articleshow/82316020.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Dehradun||New curfew timings in Dehradun lead to less traffic||DEHRADUN: City streets wore a deserted look after 2 pm as the directive changing curfew timings in Dehradun came into effect on Thursday. A day ago, district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava had issued an order mandating the shops selling essential goods to close at 2 pm instead of the earlier 4 pm. Manoj Dhiman, a grocery shop owner at the EC Road locality, said, “I received several calls from the residents who live close to my shop asking if I will open the store a little early as they wished to avoid the heavy rush. The new timings have increased the pressure on us but I think it’s for the larger good.” District administration officials said that the previous timings were allowing people to venture out for longer durations which was defeating the purpose of the curfew. Shilpa Negi, who came out to buy vegetables at 6 Number Pulia, said, “Reducing the curfew timings to 2 pm might help in curbing traffic movement of people but it will increase the rush in the market. The smaller the time window, the more the chances of people coming to buy stuff all at the same time. We will now have to be very careful while purchasing groceries.” Meanwhile, a cop deployed at the check post near Nehru colony said, “People give us the most bizarre reasons when we ask them the reason for their moving out. We hope this will stop now. We must all take this pandemic with the seriousness it deserves and should venture out of our houses only in unavoidable circumstances.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/new-curfew-timings-in-doon-lead-to-less-traffic/articleshow/82316027.cms||Abhijeet Singh

She died two hours later. Videos of the youth in a PPE kit, down on his knees and crying as he pleads with the cops to give him back the cylinder or "his mother will die" is being shared widely on social media platforms, drawing widespread criticism. The youth, Ansh Goyal, later told TOI that policemen took away the oxygen cylinder despite his frantic pleas. His family alleged that the oxygen was given to a "VIP". Ordering the probe, ADG Krishna said, “Strict action will be taken against guilty policemen." Earlier, local police had denied the charges and said that the cylinder was empty. Superintendent of police (SP) Botre Rohan Pramod said, “The man was requesting police to provide him with an oxygen cylinder for treatment of his relative. No one was taking away any cylinder. The video is misleading.” He also added that the cylinders were empty. He didn’t explain why policemen would take away empty cylinders. Anmol added, “I tried to stop the men from taking away the cylinder. When I asked the ward boys why they were taking away our oxygen cylinder, they told me that it was required for a VIP.” In the video clip, Ansh asks, “From where will I arrange the cylinder. I had come (to the hospital) after promising my family that I will bring back my mother alive." Ansh later told TOI, “My mother was not able to breathe. We gave her CPR multiple times, but could not save her. She died two hours after the policemen took the (oxygen) cylinder,” According to sources, Ansh's mother Usha was a niece of senior Jan Sangh leader, late Lala Roshanlal -- a close associate of Champat Rai, vice-president of the Vishva Hindu Parishad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-cops-snatch-oxygen-cylinder-from-man-mom-dies-after-2-hours/articleshow/82319681.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Kolkata||Tolly celebs step forward, use social media to share resource details for those in distress||Kolkata: Actor Sonu Sood had become a messiah of sorts since the pandemic broke out last year. Helping thousands of migrants or helping to airlift people in distress and provide essentials was a “million times more satisfying than being a part of any 100cr film”, the actor had tweeted. And that philanthropic trait has rubbed off on Tollywood celebrities, who are using their social media accounts to share verified information regarding hospital beds, oxygen supply and life-saving medicines. The most prominent name on the list of philanthropists is director Srijit Mukherji. On Wednesday, a netizen posted on his social media wall: “Anyone in Kolkata looking for urgent help regarding beds, oxygen, blood, supply of food, etc, do follow Srijit Mukherji’s timeline. It is probably the biggest single-point source of verified authentic information at this moment, being continuously updated.” For the last six days, Mukherji’s social media handles have not had any update on his films or awards, nor have there been personal photos. He has been sharing and amplifying updates on availability of oxygen, beds, plasma and free meals instead. Not just Kolkata, Mukherji is also reaching out to those outside the state. On Wednesday afternoon, he shared a post asking for help to admit Padmabhushan Pt Debu Choudhury in Delhi. “Many are doing the same. That includes Parambrata Chatterjee, Swastika Mukherjee, Birsa Dasgupta, Abir Chatterjee, Rwitobrata Mukherjee, Rupa Bhattacharjee and Madhurima Basak from the industry. Apart from them, there are others, including Tanumoy Naskar, Gargi Bhattacharya, Abhirup Sen, Shreyashi Dastidar, Palash Haq and Subham Dutta. This is the least we can do for our fellow citizens,” Mukherji said. He has appealed to those who have millions of followers to come forward and share so that the “time- and scarcity-based information can reach those in need before becoming outdated”. Director Kamaleswar Mukherjee said, “Srijit is making a lot of effort to do this work. My number is provided on the FB profile and calls are coming in. I will be taking to the streets from Thursday to distribute masks and measure oxygen saturation.” Gulshanara KhatunActor Gulshanara Khatun, whose posts on verified Covid resources have been shared by Mukherji, believes the director is setting an example by using his social media reach to help people. “Many others, including director Shieladitya Moulik, actor Saheb Chattopadhyay and script writer Aditi Majumdar, are also sharing information this way. But I have noticed that Srijit’s timeline now has nothing apart from information related to Covid resources. This is commendable. So many people are benefiting from this,” she said. Gulshanara, a Covid survivor, is part of a WhatsApp group called Jadavpur Covid Resource. “My cousin’s family was infected. It was an ordeal to arrange for oxygen. On April 24, my cousin passed away, but we couldn’t even say the final goodbye. Soon after, my aunt died. All that hit me hard and I decided to use my social media to amplify whatever verified information I could get to help those in distress,” she said. In between shooting for the serial ‘Felna’, she is sharing authentic information that is verified by another member in the Jadavpur Covid Resource group formed by JU students. Ranajoy BhattacharjeeMusic director Ranajoy Bhattacharjee, who shot to fame for his ‘Preme pora baron’ song, is also sharing information. “Too many people have died around me. Four days ago, I started sharing this information and with each passing day, more and more people from our industry are sharing such information on their timelines,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tolly-celebs-step-forward-use-social-media-to-share-resource-details-for-those-in-distress/articleshow/82316031.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Forest officers after primary investigations ruled out foul play or poaching angle in the case, and termed it as an accidental death due to trauma and hunger. RFO, Chandrapur range, Rahul Karekar claimed that all the nails and other body parts are safe. Karekar said that the local forest guard went to check the farm well in a fallow farmland after few locals complained of foul smell. He was shocked after seeing carcasses of four bears floating in the well. The RFO said that the animals included an adult male, female and two six months old cubs. “One of the cubs was female, while the sex of other could not be ascertained due to petrified condition,” he said. He claimed that veterinary doctors have failed to ascertain the cause of death as the carcasses were in petrified condition. A team from Chandrapur range office and senior officials rushed to the spot. Karekare claimed that the carcasses were around four days old. In-charge of transit treatment centre, Dr Kundan Podchalwar and livestock development officer, Dr PD Kadukar performed post-mortem at the spot. “We found bear scat along the route close to the well. The area was well frequented by the bears. It appears that one or both cubs accidently fell into the well having no parapet wall. Their parents would have went down to rescue the cubs but failed in the attempt,” said Karekar. The carcasses were later incinerated before the witnesses including DFO Sarita Jagtap, ACF Shriniwas Lakhmawad, local NGOs and foresters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/4-bears-including-2-cubs-found-dead-in-a-farm-well/articleshow/82316845.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Avoid Remdesivir-like mess with new Covid-19 drug, says MRPA chief||NAGPUR: Drug Controller General of India (DGGI) has given restricted, emergency use approval to ‘Virafin’ injection from Zydus Cadila. The company has claimed the drug is very effective on Covid-19 and brings down viral load significantly in seven days, with guaranteed negative RT-PCR after that. It is claimed to be a game-changer. It will be taking place of Remdesivir in next few days. However, the present mess of distribution of Remdesivir has created havoc for patients as well as for doctors. If the same faulty distribution system is followed, it will encourage black-marketing of this new medicine too, warned Kailas Tandale, president of the Maharashtra Registered Pharmacists Association (MRPA). He suggested distribution of this drug should be done the traditional way through pharmacists. Q: Is Virafin really effective on Covid-19? A: Zydus Cadila has provided data that show it is. It is the first drug in India specially formulated for Covid-19 treatment. It has the same approval like Remdesivir. So, we can consider this as a good, specialized and effective medicine. Q: Do you think there will be a surge in its demand like Remdesivir? A: Of course. I think the Remdesivir mess was avoidable. The drug was available in good quantity but faulty distribution system added to the trouble after the demand increased. MRPA has proposed the traditional strong drug distribution system should be used at least while distributing ‘Virafin’ so that the mess is not repeated. Q: What is the traditional distribution system? A: Remedivir falls under Schedule H. Virafin will also be included in Schedule H. A pharmaceutical company first gives their products to Clearance and Forwarding (C&F) agent. It is then dispensed to wholesalers at district-level. From them, it goes to wholesaler and to retailers. C&F supplies drugs only to licensed wholesalers. It is controlled by the FDA. This is the traditional way. Q: What went wrong in case of Remdesivir? A: Remdesivir used to be distributed through the traditional channel earlier. As demand increased, the distribution was shifted to district collector to prevent its alleged black-marketing. Office of collector lacks manpower. It is difficult for them to manage distribution. They hand over injection to private hospitals but no one ensures it is given to the needy patient and not sold elsewhere. Today, neither doctor nor pharmacist, but government officers are deciding whether your patient needs Remdesivir or not. This should not happen in case of the new drug. Q: What according to you, will be the ideal distribution system? A: There are 9 lakh medical stores in the country; 80,000 drugstores are in Maharashtra; 700-800 medical stores in every district and 100 medical stores in a tehsil place. The government can appoint any 20-25 medical stores at tehsil-level for distribution of such drugs. They will further distribute the drug. They have to account for each vial to the FDA. Q: Will this stop black marketing? A: Open sale is the best way to stop black marketing. Doctors will prescribe the injection and it will be available in select 20-25 distributors who will keep account of sale. Instead of passing the load to revenue department (collector) government should fill up 50% vacant places of drug inspectors to keep check on drug distribution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/avoid-remdesivir-like-mess-with-new-covid-19-drug-mrpa-chief/articleshow/82316861.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Uttarakhand Ayush minister Harak Singh Rawat said, “Ayurvedic and homeopathy doctors of the Ayush department will be deployed to support the health department in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.” These doctors will be deployed at the special Ayush Help Desk and provide consultation and counselling to the callers. The state government has already cancelled the leaves of all the Ayurveda and homeopathy doctors. The Uttarakhand government also intends to hire more Ayurveda and homeopathy doctors on a contract basis and establish more ICUs at Ayurveda hospitals. An amount of Rs 5.88 crore has also been released by the state government for ramping up Ayush-related facilities in the state. In yet another significant decision, the state government has decided to provide immunity-boosting Ayush kits to the people for free. The senior officials of the Ayush department have said that some herbs work as a home remedy and help keep the virus at bay and thus, these Ayush kits would be distributed among people. The kits will be given on a priority basis to the people who approach the department and to those who complain of Covid-like symptoms. Meanwhile, Harrawala-based Ayurvedic University — which has a state-run Ayurveda Medical College — will add 60 more beds, including 20 with oxygen support, for the Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-govt-to-deploy-ayurveda-and-homeopathy-doctors-in-district-control-rooms-to-ramp-up-staff-strength-leaves-cancelled/articleshow/82316053.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Accused knew Jhanvi was dead, says mom’s plea||Mumbai: A sessions court on Thursday allowed the plea of Jhanvi Kukreja’s mother to intervene and oppose the bail plea of Diya Padalkar, an accused in the murder of the teenager in the early hours of January 1. Nidhi Kukreja in her plea had cited contents of the chargesheet and said Padalkar (18), the victim’s childhood friend, did not react on seeing the 19-year-old’s body lying in a pool of blood and instead went to the hospital to treat a lip injury. Citing witness statements, the plea said Padalkar had claimed she was unaware how she had suffered the injuries and was scared and crying. The plea alleged she suffered the injury when she and co-accused, Shree Jogdhankar (22), had attacked Kukreja. “At this point of time, the applicant (Padalkar) was aware Jhanvi was dead and lying in a pool of blood as she had committed a murder and was therefore scared. This is also established by her non or cold reaction to seeing the deceased in a pool of blood and heading straight to the hospital to treat herself, without running to her friend,” the plea said. The plea said the evidence in the chargesheet establishes that the murder took place between 1.45 am and 2.15 am on January 1. It also said the murder was premeditated. The mother’s plea said if granted bail, Padalkar would influence witnesses, 15 of whom are teens who attended the party, as she knew them. Jogdhankar and Padalkar, both close friends of Kukreja, are accused of assaulting her and murdering her. The final post-mortem report stated there were no signs of sexual assault on Kukreja, but she had suffered 48 injuries, many of them grave. The bail plea will come up for hearing on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-accused-knew-jhanvi-was-dead-says-moms-plea/articleshow/82318589.cms||Rebecca Samervel

CMO Dr Singh said Radhakishan hospital was inspected on Wednesday by a committee constituted on the direction of Kurukshetra deputy commissioner Sharandeep Kaur Brar. The committee included Kurukshetra deputy civil surgeon Dr R K Sahai, LNJP Hospital physician Dr Arvind Chahal, Kurukshetra drug control officer Dr Ritu Mehla and Shahabad block development and panchayat officer (BDPO) Sumit Bakshi. “During the inspection by this committee, it was found that the hospital’s doctor Lokender Goyal is treating Covid-19 patients while his own report for the virus came out positive. This doctor has disregarded the protocol rules by not isolating himself being Covid-19 positive and treating the hospitalised patients openly,” Dr Singh. He said according to the Haryana government’s notification, it is mandatory for the private hospital to give details of Covid-19 patients admitted in their hospital to the district civil surgeon office. “But no information was given by Radhakishan hospital to the civil surgeon’s office, which is against the Haryana Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 Regulation Act. Therefore, this has been instructed to stop admitting Covid-19 patients and Dr Goyal to isolate himself for 17 days,” Dr Singh said. He said if the instructions are disregarded, action will be taken against the hospital according to rules under Haryana Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 Regulation Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kurukshetra-cmo-bans-private-hospital-from-admitting-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82317632.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Fill posts or we will disband TSPSC: HC||Hyderabad: The high court on Thursday warned the state government that if it does not fill the posts of chairman and members of the Telangana State Public Service Commission (TSPSC) and keep it in a defunct state, then it would order winding up the institution. The institution, constituted to conduct recruitment to various categories of jobs, is, ironically, waiting for its staff to be recruited first, the judges said. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a PIL filed by J Sankar, an unemployed youth from Jagtial, challenging the inaction of the state in this regard. “The commission must comprise a chairman and nine members. Only one member is there now and he too will retire in August this year,” senior counsel S Satyam Reddy said. Arguing the case on behalf of Sankar, Satyam Reddy said said scores of unemployed youth were looking forward for job notifications to be issued by TSPSC. But unfortunately, TSPSC too joined the list of unemployed and was looking forward for its jobs to be filled first so that it remains functional. Directing the state to complete the process of filling the posts immediately, the bench said: “We are appalled at the gross inaction. The commission was virtually made redundant due to this. Now fill all the posts within four weeks”. Meanwhile, the bench, while hearing a PIL filed by Congress MP Revanth Reddy questioning the inaction of the state and Centre in controlling drug mafia, questioned the state as to why the state excise department was not sharing its information with the central agencies like the Enforcement Directorate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fill-posts-or-we-will-disband-tspsc-hc/articleshow/82316867.cms||---

A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that on perusal of the photographs, it is seen the traders are presently selling vegetables at road margins. It should not be permitted during the present Covid-19 crisis.The judges observed that the additional government pleader submitted that works such as toilets, drinking water facilities and entrance and paver block road are yet to be completed. The judges questioned what is taking the town panchayat authorities to provide toilet and drinking water facilities at the market.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Little faith in assurances, migrants head for home||NEW DELHI: As the number of Covid cases continues to soar, migrant workers continue to forsake the city, showing their distrust in government assurances of assistance. As Santosh Rani, 52, said, “So many of our friends and family members have succumbed to the coronavirus and we don’t even have proper healthcare. The rich can still arrange a bed for themselves, we can’t. Last year we had a very tough time and we do not want to go through it all over again this year. But the chances of that happening are higher this time given the astounding number of cases.” Despite chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's appeal to the migrant workers not to leave Delhi over what he said was a “short lockdown”, the distressed labourers at the bus stations grumbled that the CM should have given them some time before announcing the lockdown. Ravi, 11, said his father lost his labourer’s job in last year’s lockdown and had only found a new one recently. “We don’t want to go through the tough times again. So, we have decided to return to our village,” the boy said. “Last year, we starved for days. We don’t want to go hungry this year. That is why my mother and I are leaving for Bihar.” Suresh Kumar, who paints walls and does carpentry at construction sites in east Delhi, said he had finally got a new job after losing one last year. “When Covid cases began to rise, my new employer asked me to stop coming to work,” he said, downcast. “The government very conveniently said it will take care of us. Last year too, we were assured in the same manner but nothing was done for us.” Anand Kundan, who hails from Gonda, UP, asserted, “All of us know that the lockdown will be extended. This year, we are not going to wait in Delhi to die. We don't trust any of the governments anymore.” Another migrant worker, Kusum, said that she was not afraid of Covid, only of her children dying of starvation if she continued living in Delhi. “Everything is so mismanaged and unorganised here that there is no point in living in this city now,” Kusum said with a tone of finality. “We came here with hopes of making a good living, but regret that decision. We are going back, never to return.” Shantu, 42, a ragpicker, said that the colony where he worked had banned his entry because the people there feared he would spread the infection. “I have hardly earned anything since the pandemic began last year, but I still returned to Delhi in February thinking that the worst was over and I could make a new beginning,” Shantu said. “But with another lockdown, there are no hopes left. And in a situation like this, I think it better to die surrounded by family back home, not alone here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/little-faith-in-assurances-migrants-head-for-home/articleshow/82317648.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Log on to state-run web portal for all Covid-related info||JAIPUR: A person needing any kind of Covid-related information can visit the state government-run portal at covidinfo.rajasthan.gov.in. The portal has information related to availability of general beds, oxygen beds and ICU beds without/with ventilators in the districts and all the hospitals in the state. The portal also has hospital helpline numbers and district control room numbers. District secretary in-charge of Jaipur and additional chief secretary (ACS) PHED Sudhansh Pant on Thursday instructed the district officials to ensure proper arrangement of distribution of oxygen and Remdesivir injections in the hospitals for Covid patients. He said that all the nodal officers appointed for private hospitals should be instructed to closely monitor the distribution system and share its reports daily. He also took feedback from the officials about the functioning of helpline number meant for treatment, tests and admission of Covid patients. “Apart from online information available for patients about oxygen beds and ventilator beds, calls to the helpline number should be responded in a sensitive manner and all possible information and help should be provided to the people through this medium,” he said during a Covid management review meeting in the district. Divisional Commissioner Dinesh Kumar Yadav on Thursday directed the nodal officers appointed for Covid hospitals to keep a “round-the-clock” check on the status of admission, oxygen supply and status of other essential services in those hospitals. “On receiving information about any kind of emergency situation, one should visit the spot and only after verification of the ground situation, one should share it with the higher authorities and find a quick solution to the problem,” said district collector Antar Singh Nehra, adding that bigger hospitals should be identified for Covid care centre where, as per availability of oxygen, a large number of beds can be arranged. Jaipur Development Commissioner Gaurav Goyal instructed all the nodal Officers to paste the prescribed rates of medical services at the reception or helpline room in Covid care hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/for-all-covid-related-info-visit-state-run-portal/articleshow/82316864.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Where’s the lifesaver? Patients gasp & kin caught in red tape||LUCKNOW: Distress calls for a bed in a Covid hospital and oxygen for patients in home isolation continued to pour in Thursday. Some also desperately searched for life saving drugs. While many people were not aware of the online link to “Lucknow Covid Hospitals Bed Dashboard” to check the occupancy status of the Covid facilities, those who knew found that only 38 out of 72 hospitals had uploaded their data by 9pm, and in most hospitals critical care beds were almost full. “My mother is critically ill, but I do not know where to go. The top hospitals which I know have Covid facilities are full,” said Raja Shukla, a Chowk resident, who shared his ordeal on social media. Prabhar Singh (65), whose wife is down with Covid with blood oxygen level fluctuating between 85-90%, desperately searched for a bed in the hospitals whose details were available on the dashboard “I had read in newspapers that there are 72 Covid facilities, but the dashboard had details of only about 50% of them. Still, I managed to find a few hospitals with some vacancies, but when I called for allotment of a bed, the staff told me that the beds meant to be filled directly are full and for a bed from district administration quota (10% in private hospitals and 70% in government hospitals), they will have to get a referral from chief medical officer (CMO),” he said. Similarly, Harjot Singh (61), a businessman, when asked to get a CMO referral, called the Integrated Covid Command Control Centre helplines. “After several calls, I got connected to the centre. The staff took all the details — RT-PCR report, phone numbers, address Aadhaar card — and then asked me to wait so that they Could find where a bed was vacant and get a CMO referral made for it. The CMO referral after allotment came four hours later,” said Singh, whose 35-year-old diabetic son was gasping for breath at home. Many among those who could not get a bed, made an oxygen support system in their homes for the patients, but for that they had to run from pillar to post: first to get a doctor’s prescription for an oxygen cylinder and then to buy one before standing in long queues outside oxygen manufacturing plants for refill. Rajnish Lal (84), a resident of Vrindavan Yojana, made a distress call to an administrative officer for oxygen support when he could not get a bed in any hospital. “His blood oxygen level was dropping. After trying all day, finally, a friend in bureaucracy helped us in getting a cylinder,” his son Aditya said. Sanjeev Gupta, admitted to a private hospital due to Covid pneumonia, contacted several chemists and friends to get antiviral drug Remdesivir, but could not get one till Thursday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wheres-the-lifesaver-patients-gasp-kin-caught-in-red-tape/articleshow/82317639.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Consider imposing 15-day lockdown like last year, says Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Consider imposing for at least 15 days a “lockdown like last year” to curb the spread of Covid-19, the Bombay high court told the state government on Thursday. “We are not issuing a mandamus (direction). Do you think that the (present) restrictions are working? That only people with urgent business are on the road? At least for 15 days, if people stay indoors, we may expect better results,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni. They asked advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni to “please advise” the government. The court heard three public interest litigation on shortages of Remdesivir, beds and oxygen for Covid-19 patients. Citing the death of music composer Shravan Rathod due to Covid-19, advocate Rajesh Inamdar said there must be detailed tracing of those returning from the Kumbh Mela in Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The judges said those entering Maharashtra from other states must have negative Covid test reports. Inamdar said it is not strictly followed.  The CJ said all the judges who recently went to Goa for a conclave got themselves tested at Dabolim airport. “It is up to an individual as to what extent he cares for his fellowmen.. Show kindness to your fellow men,” the CJ said. “Is it not the duty of a person to get himself tested. If we are careless, we’ll face it. We are careless people.” The judges said people are blaming the authorities, but they are failing in their duty. “You can start oxygen manufacturing plants and production of Remdesivir can be increased, but can you get overnight more doctors and nursing staff? They are also limited,” said Justice Kulkarni. The judges said people don’t take care and then hunt for medicines, beds and oxygen. “You are waiting for a third wave to come?” said Justice Kulkarni, adding that people wanted Kumbh Mela and marriages to take place. Referring to the viral video where the West Tripura district magistrate stopped a wedding celebration, the CJ said, “The DM was too harsh, but the marriage was continuing even after curfew set in.” The judges then suggested that a lockdown like last year be imposed “unless it is absolutely crucial for a person to move out”. The judges also referred to the death of an octogenarian from Nagpur who gave up his hospital bed for a younger Covid-19 patient. They said on social media people are saluting his sacrifice. “But what about your (state’s) healthcare system? Had we woken up earlier, we could save this gentleman also,” the bench said. The judges said many directions were passed in June 2020 in a PIL regarding Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra. “Caution was sounded long ago. Had we been more vigilant we would have avoided this situation. Our collective failure has brought us here,” said the CJ. Referring to long queues at vaccination centres, the judges said time slots should be given so that all the people do not flock at the same time to take the vaccine. Advocate Arshil Shah said since four days he has been unable to get his mother vaccinated. “Till July, no slots are available,” he added. The judges also batted for giving elderly Parsis priority in vaccination. AG Kumbhakoni said Serum Institute of India’s CEO Adar Poonawala has said he will keep aside some quota for his community. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, for BMC, said, “Parsis have said they will wait for their turn. “We don’t want special quota for us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/consider-imposing-15-day-lockdown-like-last-yr-says-bombay-hc/articleshow/82317658.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Madurai||Why relucant to make Madurai airport int’l: HC||Madurai: Madras high court on Thursday asked the Centre as to why no positive steps were taken to declare Madurai airport as an international airport though different sections of the people and private airline operators have been making requests in this regard. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by N Jegatheesan, president of Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TNCCI), based in Madurai. A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that assistant solicitor general L Victoria Gowri, appearing for the Centre, had in an earlier case submitted that Union Cabinet approval is required for the process of declaring the airport as international airport. The court observed that if Madurai airport has larger air traffic and is larger than Trichy and Tuticorin airports, the question is why there is reluctance in declaring it as an international airport. Though various private airlines had expressed their desire to operate flights to UAE and other Gulf countries in 2012 and 2014, their representations were not considered by the central government till date. The petitioner’s association has also been pursuing the matter since 2013. Hence the judges directed the central government to file a counter affidavit in this regard.The petitioner had filed two other public interest litigations - seeking to expand the runway of Madurai airport and to take necessary steps for setting up adequate infrastructure for a permanent plant quarantine facility and cold storage to enhance cargo operations from the airport. The judges sought response from the central government in this regard and adjourned the cases to July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/why-relucant-to-make-madurai-airport-intl-hc/articleshow/82317679.cms||---
---||Madurai||Duo escape criminal case as DRI fails to save CCTV footage||Madurai: The failure of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) unit at Trichy airport to save CCTV footages has helped two persons caught with 200gm each of gold and electronic goods worth several lakhs, to escape all criminal liabilities. DRI told the court that CCTV footages recorded in 2019 had got erased automatically.Rapping the DRI for first having failed to save the footage and then to serve it to the duo accused of indulging in smuggling, so that they could mount a defence, Justice G R Swaminathan said the accused could have established their defence only by producing the CCTV footage. “They have been denied access to this vital piece of evidence. The best evidence was very much available and it was allowed to vanish. The airport authority is a limb of the State. DRI cannot wash away its hands by taking the plea that they have not installed the CCTV and that it is not in their control."The footage became germane to the case because while DRI said the two -- Mohammed Haroon and Shaik Mohammed – had smuggled the gold, the two said they were actually going towards Customs counter to declare the baggage and pay customs duty. Even before they could declare, they were intercepted by officials and accused of smuggling, they said. They filed the present petition for permission to re-export the gold and electronic goods seized from them at Trichy airport in 2019.Justice Swaminathan observed that since the fundamental right of the petitioners to fair adjudication had been violated, adjudication proceedings could not be allowed to continue for the purpose of determining their guilt. Holding that their rights had been prejudiced by the non-production of CCTV footage, the judge said the customs case could be allowed only to determine whether the seized goods could be allowed to be re-exported or cleared on payment of applicable duties. An order to this effect should be passed by customs officials within four weeks, the court said.Clarifying that the court is not giving a clean chit to the petitioners, Justice Swaminathan pointed out that though the two accused persons are from Chennai, they landed in Trichy. Suspecting that there is every possibility that they could be 'Kuruvis', the judge said: “Suspicion is one thing while proof is another. It is the prosecution that has to cover the distance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/duo-escape-criminal-case-as-dri-fails-to-save-cctv-footage/articleshow/82317684.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Kolkata||Trading zones take heat, violence in stride||Kolkata: Central Kolkata constituencies like Jorasanko and Chowringhee, often referred to as mini-India for the diverse nature of their voters, witnessed different vignettes of voting on Thursday. While members of the business community voted in Burrabazar and Posta, Anglo-Indian families in Bow Barracks headed to polling stations early in the morning. Muslim voters, most of whom were fasting, voted despite the heat, Indian Chinese in Tiretta Market too exercised their franchise. In the wholesale belt of Posta and Burrabazar, voting picked up a little late by 11 am. Local political leaders said news of crude bombs being hurled in two places on CR Avenue and Harrison Road forced people to defer their voting plans. Several polling stations in the area wore a deserted look till 11 am. “This is the tradition here. We assess the law and order situation before stepping out with our families to vote. Taking unnecessary risk does not make any sense,” said Vijay Bagaria, a resident of Kali Krishna Tagore Street who came to vote in Digambar Jain Vidyalaya. “When we heard of bombings we decided to wait till situation was brought under control. When some party workers called us up and assured that the situation was peaceful we decided to go to the polling station.” Central Kolkata boasts of a diverse culture with people of different regions residing here and earning their livelihoods. In the early 19th century, Kolkata, second most important city of the British Empire, was divided between the British “White Town” and the native “Black Town”. Anybody who did not belong to the two towns settled between the Harrison Road and Bowbazar turning it into a melting pot of cultures, cuisines and languages. In areas like Zakaria Street, Phears Lane, Bow Street, Chandni, BB Ganguly Street, and Eden Hospital Road, there were long queues outside polling stations since morning. “We wanted to avoid the heat so decided to vote in the early hours,” said Mohammad Rahil, a resident of Bow Street. “We are fasting, and it is better to conserve energy. It is also peaceful in the morning as trouble starts after 10 am,” said Rahil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trading-zones-take-heat-violence-in-stride/articleshow/82316872.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Pyare Khan entrusted with task of bringing 200 MT oxygen per day to city||NAGPUR: After helping the district administration transport 400MT of oxygen to the city’s government hospitals by spending Rs85 lakh from his own pocket, transporter Pyare Khan has been entrusted with the responsibility of bringing all the supply of gas from various locations to the city till the Covid-19 crisis ends. The decision was taken during a review meeting of coronavirus crisis in the city by Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday. Gadkari he assured to procure 200MT of oxygen purely for the district, even as the requirement is 166MT. The meeting was attended by divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, collector Ravindra Thakare, NMC commissioner B Radhakrishnan and Khan, who represented the city transporters’ association. Guardian minister Nitin Raut virtually joined the meeting. Khan will now look after the entire plan to bring oxygen from various places, provide drivers for tankers, and take care of their maintenance and repairs. “The entire transportation would be looked after by me and my team of 10-12 persons and not by the administration. We have a total of 13 vehicles to bring gas from Raipur, Vishakhapatnam, Bellari, and Rourkela, besides Bhilai plant. Of them, I’ve rented seven to eight vehicles and also paid nearly Rs1 crore rent to their owners. The rest of the amount would be paid by the collector,” the orange seller turned crorepati businessman told TOI. He added that he wouldn’t be charging anything for his services. The ministers also discussed plans for supply of Remdesivir and oxygen, purchasing more cylinders and other requirements. Kumar was directed to coordinate Remdesivir distribution and supply. The administrative officials informed that currently 140MT oxygen was coming from Bhilai, besides the quota produced by local companies. According to them, if 200MT was made available, the increased demand from private hospitals could be met. Raut directed them to clear payments to the transporters immediately on delivery. Gadkari said all these temporary measures could be a part of short-term solution, but they need to think about long-term solution to take care of future requirements. While assuring all technical support to the administration for setting up oxygen plants in the city, he said it would be handy in the long term. Wardha plant’s Remdesivir to be available from May 10 Gadkari said the first stock of 30,000 Remdesivir vials to be produced by Wardha-based Genetek Life Sciences would be available from May 10. “The divisional commissioners of Nagpur and Amravati would coordinate and equally distribute this stock in all Vidarbha districts. After meeting the region’s requirements, it would be made available to the rest of Maharashtra.” He also directed the administration to erect a dome at GMCH and IGGMCH for waiting patients and their relatives. He held talks with companies like Jubilee, Amogha Oxy and Aasi, that produce oxygen from air. He also suggested exploring use of high capacity aluminium cylinders used in China.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pyare-khan-entrusted-with-task-of-bringing-200mt-oxygen-per-day-to-city/articleshow/82316877.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The police have recovered ornaments worth Rs 28.52 lakhs from his possession. A team headed by senior inspector Rajendra Landge, assistant inspector Abhijit Patil and police constables — Rizwan Jinedi and Mehboob Mokashi — arrested the suspect, identified as Mushidul alias Maidul Lalchand Shaikh (32) of Hugli in West Bengal. Shaikh was produced before a city court on Thursday and was remanded in police custody till Friday. “Patil received a tip-off about Shaikh’s presence in Daund. A police team reached there on Wednesday evening and arrested him. A good amount of jewellery has been recovered from his possession. We have also recovered a cellphone and some clothes from him,” deputy commissioner of police (Zone I) Priyanka Narnaware said.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan high court notice to Centre over different vaccination prices||JAIPUR: Rajasthan High Court on Thursday issued notices to the Centre and the state and two pharma companies, Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech International Limited, on differential pricing for Covid vaccines. The division bench headed by Justice Sabina issued notice on a PIL by journalist Mukesh Sharma. The Covid vaccines, sold to the central government, the state governments and private hospitals are being charged differently, which the petitioner said is profiteering by the companies which enjoy monopoly on the vaccine. The petition in an interim relief sought a direction to the two pharma companies to supply of vaccine to the state governments also on the same price at which they had supplied to the Centre or the central government be directed to provide free vaccination to all as was being done to people above 45 years. The petition said the differential pricing adopted by pharma companies and approved by the Centre is highly discriminatory, illegal and arbitrary and be set aside. Further it argued that the pharma companies agreed to provide the vaccine doses for Rs 150 per dose to the central government. There was no occasion or reason to be charging exorbitantly high prices of Rs 400 and Rs 600 from the state governments for Covidshield and Rs 600 and Rs 1,200 for Covaxin from the other organisations. It said vaccination strategy adopted by the Centre is absolutely against public interest and a major impediment in India's fight against Coronavirus. "Since vaccination against a deadly virus is absolutely essential and vital for right to life of every individual and by charging a hefty amount for every dosage of vaccination, the Centre is imposing premium for guaranteeing the right to life to the people of India and the people of Rajasthan,” said the petition. The petition pointed out that the Centre in its budget had made an allocation Rs 35,000 crore for fight against Coronavirus and accordingly the state government did not make a provision in its budget for vaccination of the people of the Rajasthan. However, with the present liberalised vaccination strategy and pricing puts enormous burden on the state's finances which had now decided to provide free vaccination. The petition pleaded to quash the Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccine Strategy issued on April 20 2021 and government of India be directed to provide free vaccination to all persons within Rajasthan who desire to be vaccinated through the government operated vaccination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-notice-to-centre-raj-over-different-vax-prices/articleshow/82316866.cms||Joychen Joseph

Earlier, two crew members were allowed to leave for India on ‘humanitarian grounds’. SCA has accepted the request of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), the shipmanager, to relieve the crew on completion of their contract period. Currently, there are 25 Indian national crew members aboard the vessel. All were safe, in good health and good spirits. Day-to-day operations onboard the vessel continue with the seafarers aboard conducting routine fire and safety drills alongside ongoing planned vessel maintenance, BSM said. “When the vessel went aground all crew onboard were within the terms of their contracts. However, delays in allowing the vessel to depart mean that three crew members are now due to be relieved. Requests to allow the overdue crew to depart have been granted by the Suez Canal Authority (SCA). Minimum safe manning standards for the vessel will be maintained at all times and crew members who depart the vessel are being relieved,” BSM said. “Our utmost priority remains the safety and wellbeing of our crew. We are in regular contact with them and their families, offering all necessary support.

The collector has given the committee the authority to ensure covid compliance at the market.Speaking to reporters in Madurai on Monday, association president SMS Ramachandran and secretary R Muthu said that the Matuthavani flower market Mercy Jeyarani and her staff Thirumurugan and Selvam have been demanding extra money from the traders in the name of inspections.The market, inaugurated in 2006, has 104 shops which were sold on outright purchase. The buyers paid the money in instalments over a period of eight years and was completed by 2015. After they paid the dues, their deal with the Market Committee was that they have to pay the monthly maintenance fee while the committee would take up maintenance of the market complex. This went on smoothly for about 12 to 13 years till Mercy assumed charge as the secretary.She has been charging each shop Rs 50 daily in the name of Covid-19, which adds up to Rs 5,200 collected daily from the 104 shops. As restrictions were imposed due to the second wave, six shops were sealed by the committee on April 26 without citing any proper reason or issuing a show cause notice, traders say.When contacted, Mercy Jeyarani said that they sealed the shops after pasting notices on the six shops as they violated social distancing and facemask rules. “The committee erected the barricades at our own cost. The shops were only asked to give Rs 50 per day towards covid compliance, like appointing people for conducting thermal checks and hand sanitizing. The allegations by traders are totally false,” she said, adding only one of the six traders associations in the market are making these allegations. She added that two people were appointed for covid compliance for a monthly salary of Rs 3,200 each apart from masks and sanitizers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/traders-to-approach-court-as-six-shops-sealed-at-flower-mkt/articleshow/82317696.cms||---

As per treatment protocol of the Centre, the imported drug is recommended among Covid patients with moderate disease with progressively increasing oxygen requirements and in mechanically ventilated patients not improving despite use of steroids. The injection is also administered in case of presence of raised inflammatory markers. While the drug is reportedly out of stock in the local market, families of affected patients said attempts to arrange the drug from other metro cities and neighbouring states had failed to yield any results. Physician Dr Anand Deshmukh said shortage of remdesivir injections was triggering the demand for tocilizumab injection. “The use of tocilizumab injection is advisable only among some critical Covid patients. The drug is immune-suppressive and therefore needs carefully monitoring for secondary infections. The tocilizumab injection therefore must be used judiciously among selective patients,” he said. As per health experts, tocilizumab injection deals with cytokine storm syndrome, which refers a severe immune system response that sometimes may lead to organ failure and death. Sanjay Kale, joint commissioner with food and drugs administration, admitted that there is a shortage of tocilizumab injections in Aurangabad district. “We are expecting around 12 vials of tocilizumab injections for Aurangabad by Thursday night. We are keeping a tab on distribution of these injections and will further supply it to hospitals as per norms,” he said. The stock is, however, considered as insufficient as the Government Medical College and Hospital alone had 501 critical patients by Thursday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/relatives-scramble-for-tocilizumb-aurangabad-district-to-get-12-vials/articleshow/82315380.cms||Prasad Joshi

Singh is also seeking directions to the CBI to probe “aspects of criminal conspiracy and malicious attempts to thwart” its preliminary inquiry into his allegations of malpractices against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, as directed by the HC on April 5. The preliminary inquiry order “is merely a retaliation in vendetta by Deshmukh” and “punitive action’’ for having gone to court against him, said Singh’s petition. Seeking an urgent hearing before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale, Singh’s counsel Mukul Rohatgi with Vikram Nankani and Aabad Ponda said the state had issued an order on April 1 to DGP Pandey, while the HC had reserved for orders a batch of petitions for probe against Deshmukh, but had not informed the Supreme Court of its issuance. Rohatgi said the state did not disclose it to the SC either. Singh said “the order directing DGP Sanjay Pandey to initiate preliminary inquiry by invoking section 32 of CrPC in alleged suspicion of violation of service matter under All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968, is ex-facie, illegal, outside the frame of law and therefore cannot be sustained in light of settled principles of law.” Singh’s petition which makes the state, CBI and Sanjay Pandey parties has sought that the state’s orders be set aside as he “apprehends coercive steps will be taken” against him. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare said Singh’s petition was merely making allegations and sought time. HC posted the matter for hearing on May 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-param-bir-files-petition-in-high-court-challenging-state-inquiry/articleshow/82317724.cms||---

The delay in receiving two orders of around 30,000 IV saline bottles led to the crisis at region’s largest state-run health facility that caters to thousands of on a daily basis. GMCH authorities said due to high number of critically ill co-morbid Covid-19 patients being treated at its super speciality building, the demand for saline has increased manifold. As on date, GMCH requires over 1,000 IV saline bottles on a daily basis. The hospital ran out of the saline stock three days ago following which relatives of the patients were forced to buy it from outside. A couple of NGOs and individuals, after learning about the shortage, arranged and donated 2500 IV saline bottles but this stock got exhausted immediately. GMCH pharmacology HOD and in-charge of drug store Madhuri Kulkarni said, “We do maintain a buffer stock of medicines as well as IV saline bottles for any emergency and mass casualty like situation. But due to increase in IV saline consumption amongst Covid patients, we unexpectedly ran out of stock.” She added, “The IV saline received from the MP will ease out the situation for at least next four days. The stock from the government is expected to reach by Monday.” GMCH authorities said they need to anticipate demand of a particular drug or IV at least 60 days before as it takes between 15 and 45 days to receive the medicine after placing the order. When contacted, Jaleel said it was his social responsibility towards the people. “During the pandemic, people are suffering beyond description. If I am able to ease out even one person’s difficulty during such testing times I will feel fortunate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jaleel-provides-4000-bottles-of-iv-saline-to-gmch/articleshow/82314560.cms||---

---||Madurai||Call to hold blood donation camp ahead of vax drive||Trichy: To facilitate blood donation by those who are planning to undergo Covid-19 vaccination, Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam has urged the district administration to conduct a special blood donation drive in the district. A district-level blood donation camp was organised last year to collect blood from eligible donors. Submitting a petition to Trichy district collector S Divyadarshini, state advisor of the voluntary organisation K C Neelamegam asked for a similar blood donation camp to meet the emergency requirement of blood. He said there are possibilities of shortage of blood in hospitals in the days to come. He said in his petition that there is a constant requirement of blood in hospitals for patients undergoing surgeries, accident victims and those who need regular blood transfusion. The requirement is met out of the blood donated by healthy donors from the age group of 18-60. From May 1, people in the age group of 18-45 were allowed for Covid-19 vaccination. The same age group being potential donors, they will not be able to donate blood for more than two months.“Those undergoing Covid-19 vaccination cannot donate blood for a month. The optimal interval between two doses being 4-8 weeks, Covid-19 vaccinated blood donors may not be able to donate blood for 2-3 months,” he said. Neelamegam said that despite all the awareness created on the importance of blood donation, only a few come forward to donate blood. The surging Covid-19 cases are further discouraging donors from coming to the hospital. “To facilitate blood donation from those who are planning to get vaccinated, the district administration should conduct a special blood donation drive. Blood groups such as ‘O’ – negative are very rare and getting blood from donors with such rare groups before their vaccination will help in saving lives,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/call-to-hold-blood-donation-camp-ahead-of-vax-drive/articleshow/82316882.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan plans to procure oxygen concentrators from China||JAIPUR: The state government, faced with the bleak prospects of augmenting oxygen supply from local sources in the near future, is planning to import oxygen concentrators and other essential anti-viral medicines. A team of officials might soon be sent to China to explore the possibilities of getting supply chain running as the government expects the Covid second wave to reach its peak in second half of May. Highly placed sources said a team will be sent to China and other sources in other countries are being explored in co-ordination with the ministry of external affairs. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had directed the officials to explore all options, including foreign countries, to raise the life-saving medical oxygen and medicines. “The chief minister is worried over the high mortality rate in the second wave. Since medical oxygen is the vital for saving lives, the state administration is looking for importing oxygen concentrators from China and other countries,” according to officials. Chief minister directed that if there is a need to import other essential resources including oxygen concentrators, cylinders, and medicines, then plan and execute them quickly. He also directed to prepare in advance the apprehension of the third and fourth wave expressed by the experts. The direction to the officials is not worry about the finance at the moment but devote their full energy to saving lives. According to an estimate, demand for oxygen in the state has been estimated at 365 metric tons by April 30, 541 metric tons by May 9 and 900 metric tons by May 30 which the government thinks could not be met from local sources as transportation is a big challenge. This requires 65 cryogenic oxygen tankers which are in short supply now. CM again apprises Centre of oxygen crisisChief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday again talked to union home minister Amit Shah, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, principal secretary to prime minister PK Mishra and national aecurity advisor Ajit Doval and apprised them of the shortage of oxygen and medicines facing the state. The chief minister in a series of tweets said they were requested that the situation in Rajasthan has become very pracarious and oxygen and essential medicines should be made available to Rajasthan in proportion to the number of active cases which are increasing rapidly here. He said the number of active cases has gone up to 1.70 lakh now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-plans-to-procure-o2-concentrators-from-china/articleshow/82316873.cms||Joychen Joseph

She was rushed to Thanjavur medical college hospital in an ambulance. Her condition worsened on Thursday and she died in the afternoon. According to Thiruvonam police, one Ravichandran had erected a banner on the roadside for the inauguration of the portrait of his father Muthuveerappan who died a few days ago. Ravichandran was booked for erecting a flex board, which is banned by law, and subsequently arrested. Further investigation is on. The incident is the latest in a series of accidents that have claimed the lives of innocent citizens. Two years ago, a 24-year-old software engineer had come under the wheels of a water tanker near Pallikaranai in Chennai after being knocked off her bike by a flex banner erected for the marriage of the son of a political party’s functionary.Similarly, K Ragupathy, 32, lost his life in 2017 in Coimbatore when he was run over by a corporation truck after his bike slammed into an arch put up for a function. While Madras high court has banned the erection of flex banners on roadsides and other places, police say the violation has been rampant in interior villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/flex-banner-claims-life-of-woman-rider-in-thanjavur/articleshow/82316887.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The hostel wardens have also been directed to allocate rooms as isolation centres in each of the hostels. In a circular DU said it hopes students return to their native places and continue academic activities remotely. “At the same time, we recognise that some students are unable to return and need to stay on. So, students should watch out for symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, nausea, running nose, diarrhoea, etc. In case they develop any symptoms, they should contact hostel authorities or their local health provider for advice.” The university has made provisions for RT-PCR testing at INMAS, DRDO after filling a mandatory form and at Patel Chest Institute on the provost’s recommendation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/return-home-du-tells-hostel-residents/articleshow/82317754.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Dr Kailash Kagne, one of the protesting assistant professors, said we have deferred our agitation for time being as the state government has sought 15 days to act on their demand.“The state-level authorities held talks with us through video-conferencing and assured they will be considerate towards our demand for regularisation of our services. Considering the prevailing pandemic situation, we have decided not to go on en masse leave for now,” he said. Earlier, in November last year, the faculties, who are integral part of Covid care among other health services, had held a demonstration as part of the state-level protest to highlight the demand of regularisation of their services.Rendering their services for years, the agitating doctors were appointed on temporary basis after the joint approval from the directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) and Divisional Service Board for GMCH“Around 600 assistant professors across Maharashtra have been repeatedly demanding regularisation of their services, but the demand is falling on deaf ears. The government should not test our patience further, failing to which an outburst among doctors is inevitable,” Kagne said. The GMCH administration continued to distance itself from the demand of regularisation of services of temporary assistant professors, stating it was a policy matter coming under the purview of the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/gmch-temporary-faculties-defer-en-masse-leave-agitation/articleshow/82314574.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Crucial time, precious lives lost due to delay in RT-PCR reports||LUCKNOW: Delay in Covid-19 RT-PCR test results and inadequate sampling is adding to the misery of people having symptoms of the disease. Ashok Singh (31), a resident of Rae Bareli Road, gave his samples and that of his parents to a health department rapid response team (RRT) on April 19.  Seven days later, he got the message that repeat sampling was required as the samples collected were inadequate. Another team collected samples on April 26, but on Wednesday, he again got the message that second sampling was also inadequate. On Friday, he and his family gave samples to a private lab for tests. “In the meantime, the condition of my parents and mine deteriorated despite starting Covid medication as a precautionary measure. But, when blood oxygen levels dropped to 92-94%, we got a CT scan done and found that the infection has reached the lungs. Doctors have started steroids, besides advising oxygen support at home, and told us to get hospitalised if oxygen level drops below 90%. All this because of the delay in test results and faulty sampling by the RRT,” he told TOI. Similarly, City Station resident Narendra Singh had given his samples to an RRT on April 23 after coming in contact with a friend who had tested positive. “For two days, the report status on the portal showed ‘result pending’ and on the third day, it said ‘repeat sampling required’. Then, I got myself tested in a private lab and the result was positive. I started medication, but any further delay could have led to serious implications,” he said. Earlier, TOI had reported cases where delay in test results proved fatal for some patients because hospitalisation required RT-PCR test report, which they could not provide. Also, in some instances asymptomatic people became super spreaders as they didn’t isolate themselves till the reports confirmed the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/crucial-time-precious-lives-lost-due-to-delay-in-rt-pcr-reports/articleshow/82317718.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Man who sent money tells cops that he’s RSS member||THRISSUR: On Thursday, police disclosed the political links of the persons involved in highway heist case in which money, allegedly transported for the election work of a national political party, was looted at Kodakara recently. Thrissur rural SP G Poonguzhali confirmed that Dharmarajan, who had allegedly sent the money in the car, had told the police that he was an RSS activist. Dharmarajan reportedly told the police that the money was handed over to him by former state treasurer of Yuva Morcha (youth wing of BJP) Sunil Naik. When contacted, Naik confirmed that he had admitted to the police that he had given the money to Dharmarajan. However, police said more investigation is needed to confirm the allegation that the money was being transported for election work in recent assembly poll. “Investigations are on to find why the money was being transported. We cannot make an official statement without getting clarity on this aspect,” said DIG (Thrissur) A Akbar. Naik claimed that the money was meant for business purposes. “Dharmarajan had borrowed Rs 25 lakhs from me for some business purposes. I’m fully doing my business now and don’t hold any official post in BJP or its related organizations. Dharmarajan too is a businessman. For the past 10 years, I had financial transactions with Dharmarajan using banks and other routes. Anyone can verify these by looking at our bank accounts. My account is with the Union Bank of India,’’ he said over the phone from Kozhikode. “I and Dharmarajan are the complainants in the case as we lost the money. The impression that is being created is that we are the accused,” he claimed. Dharmarajan was not accessible over the phone despite repeated attempts. Earlier, it was reported that money was looted from the car while it was proceeding from Kozhikode to Thiruvananthapuram. The goons had followed the car in two other vehicles and intercepted it by creating a fake accident near Kodakara on April 3. As per the complaint filed by the driver, a sum of Rs 25 lakhs was stolen. But, there were allegations that Rs 3 crore was taken away by the assailants. The SP said police have arrested one more person, Shukoor, in the case and now the number of persons arrested in the case has risen to eight. Police recovered some money from him. Police issued a lookout notice for three other persons who are suspected to be the key accused. Police recovered Rs 23 lakhs and three gold sovereigns and the receipt of a bank loan totalling to Rs 6 lakhs from the house of the arrested accused Babu, who is the son of Muhammedali at Vadakkumkara village, near Vellangallur in Thrissur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/man-who-sent-money-tells-cops-that-hes-rss-member/articleshow/82316183.cms||T Ramavarman

The medical staff, whose salaries are pretty low, steal injections from the hospitals and sell them outside. Now, due to the huge demand for Remdesivir injections, they get customers within the vicinity of the hospitals,” said an official, who is a member of the committee for supply of Remdesivir injections and other medicines in the state. “Instead of injecting the patients, as advised by the doctors, some of them just put it in their pockets and leave the hospital premises. Such activities have been observed recently,” he said. “It is very difficult to catch these people because they don’t steal these injections in large numbers. They steal one or two injections and sell them at Rs 5,000 to 10,000.” “A decoy team has been formed to curb hoarding and black-marketing of medicines in the state. They catch them by posing themselves as bogus customers,” he further added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/decoy-teams-to-curb-hoarding-of-remdesivir/articleshow/82316889.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Covid patients with oxygen level below 90 will be admitted to hospital: Doctors||JAIPUR: As hospitals are flooded with the Covid patients, doctors are now focusing on admissions of patients having oxygen saturation below 90. State health minister and senior doctors of the Covid management and treatment team have issued guidelines in this regard to hospital superintendents, in-charges of various government and private hospitals. The purpose for the move is to de-congest hospitals and focus on patients having severe or very severe symptoms. Also, patients with HRCT score above 12 are allowed to get admitted. Senior doctors of the core team of Covid management and treatment on Thursday urged that focus should be on patients whose lungs are infected and have problems in breathing rather than patients whose ailments can be settled at home isolation. TOI on Thursday spoke to senior doctors of RUHS and the Covid care and treatment team to know how they are coping with the spurt in fresh infections and active cases. “Many patients whose oxygen saturation is around 95 and more are visiting hospitals for beds by using their sources. But the need of this hour is to intervene and help patients who have fibrosis in their lungs and their oxygen level has dipped below 90. It is getting difficult for us to segregate as patients and their attendants are in panic. So, it has been decided that patients whose oxygen saturation is normal (95 and above) but need Remdesivir intervention can come for the day care but can’t be given admissions,” said Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent of RUHS. Health minister Raghu Sharma has issued fresh guidelines for discharge and admissions for Covid patients in various Covid care centres. “Patients whose oxygen saturation is 90 or more should monitor their health under consultation of a physician at home itself. And patients in confusion state, unconsciousness, trouble in breathing, blood clotting and inflammatory markers and have their oxygen levels below 90 should get themselves hospitalised. Let me clarify again, every patient does not need oxygen support and Remdesivir,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. Also patients who are presently admitted to hospitals did not have any symptoms in past 48 hours and have their oxygen levels above 90 can be discharged. “We should focus on patients who need immediate intervention. Also, the patients discharged with no symptoms after treatment should monitor their health for next seven days and should be in isolation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-patients-with-o2-level-below90-will-be-admitted-to-hosps-docs/articleshow/82316894.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Quranic scholar, DAV College history professor succumb to Covid||LUCKNOW: In yet another jolt to the teaching fraternity, two more prominent academicians and a lab technician lost their battle with coronavirus on Thursday. Shock and grief engulfed the Lucknow University after the news of the demise of renowned scholar of Quranic studies and former head of LU’s Arabic and Arab Culture department, Ubaidullah Farahi (78), and assistant professor at DAV Degree College, Madan Lal (55), spread on the campus. Kirti Verma (50), a lab technician in the commercial art department of the College of Arts and Craft, also passed away due to Covid-19. “Prof Farahi was an internationally renowned scholar and was known for his work on Sufism and Quranic studies. He has more than 10 books to his credit on the philosophy of coherence in the Quran,” said Ayaz Ahmad Islahi, a faculty member in Arabic department. He said Prof Farahi’s contribution to LU and the country as an academician was unparalleled and his legacy as a renowned scholar and expert of Oriental-Quranic Studies was immortal. Prof Farahi had served as head of the department from 1994 to 2000. The death of Madan Lal, an associate professor in the Ancient History department of DAV College, came as a big loss to the city. He was admitted to the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) for the last 18 days after he complained of high fever. He was on ventilator support for the last three days. He is survived by his wife and two children. “He was a wonderful academician and was very popular among his students. He joined the college in 2003. For his brilliant work as an academician, he was made a member of UP Higher Education Commission in 2009 by then chief minister Mayawati,” said Deepak Kumar, incharge of English department at DAV College. “He was also a dalit rights activist and worked a lot for the education of poor and underprivileged children,” he added. Lab technician Kirti Verma (50) was in home isolation. “Her oxygen level dipped suddenly and she could not be saved,” a teacher of Arts College said. ‘Lost an ocean of knowledge’: Paying tribute to Prof Ubaidullah Farahi, coordinator of Arabic department, LU, Prof Ayaz Ahmad Islahi said: “We have lost an ocean of knowledge and an encyclopedia of Quranic studies. He was one of the few scholars who were well-versed in the theory of ‘Coherence in Quran’ which is regarded as a basic tool to understand the Quran.” “It elucidates the logical relation between the surahs (chapters) and verses of the Quran. The theory was introduced by his grandfather Allama Hamiduddin Farahi, who discovered ‘Nizam-ul-Quran,” he added. He also edited a manuscript of his grandfather, titled ‘Taliqaat’ (Quranic Note), and accomplished a literary feat in rendering it into Urdu from Arabic. His book ‘Tasawwuf’ is considered a landmark in Islamic mysticism. “Losing such scholars during this difficult time is a great tragedy. Our deepest condolences to the family. May God give them enough strength to bear the loss and may his soul rest in eternal peace,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/quranic-scholar-dav-college-history-prof-succumb-to-covid/articleshow/82317735.cms||---

Sugar expert P G Medhe said demand for sugar in domestic and international market has gone down and over production may cause further problems for the factories. “Mills across Maharashtra will face another problem as production is costlier than Rs 2 for every kg compared to other states in the country”, he said. Sources from the industry attribute huge production of sugar mainly to satisfactory rainfall last year owing to which number of sugar factories opting for crushing increased. Officials in sugar commissioner office said that around 11 lakh hectare land in Maharashtra was under cane cultivation as against 8 lakh hectare last year. The highest cane crushing in the past decade took place in 2018-19 when factories collectively crushed 953 lakh tonne of sugar cane and the lowest cane crushing took place in 2016-17 when only 373 lakh tonne of cane was crushed. Several farmers had stayed away from cane cultivation in 2016-17 owing to drought. This year, the number of sugar mills went up to 188 as compared to 143 that were operational during the last crushing season. According to official data, 188 sugar mills generated bills worth Rs 21,358 crore based on fair and remunerative price (FRP) till April 15. Last year, the bills generated based on FRP amounted to Rs 12,359 crore. Medhe said the huge difference of Rs 8,999 is an indicator of massive cane crushing and sugar production in the state. While sugar factories have been complaining about financial difficulties, 87 factories have cleared all dues based on FRP. The number of factories that have made part payment to the farmers is 101. As many as 48 factories have made 80 to 99% payment to the farmers during the current crushing season. According to official data, 19 factories in the state have been issued notices under the Revenue Recovery Code (RCC) for failure in making payment to the farmers. Under the RRC, it is mandatory for the mills to make FRP based payment to the farmers within 15 days after cane is take for crushing by the factories.An official from sugar commissioner’s office said 25 sugar factories are still operational while remaining have stopped crushing activities. According to a rough estimate, around 20 lakh tonne of cane in the state is yet to be crushed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/maha-mills-achieve-fresh-record-in-sugar-production/articleshow/82314594.cms||Satyajit Joshi

---||Pune||Oxygen crunch keeps small hospitals on tenterhooks||PUNE: Medical expert Nitin Pawar of Pawar hospital in Dhankawadi on Thursday raised an alarm about a situation common in several small and medium-sized health hubs treating Covid-19 patients. “We are left with oxygen supply that won’t last even for an hour,” said Pawar, whose hospital had 22 Covid-19 patients on oxygen beds, five in the intensive care unit (ICU) and a man on non-invasive ventilator support. “The 40-year-old man on the non-invasive ventilator support alone needs 12 jumbo cylinders in a day,” he said, regretting that the hospital’s SOS messages to the administration early in the day initially did not get much response. “It is only after MP Supriya Sule’s intervention that the administration moved. I have sent my hospital supervisor to a refilling station to replenish the empty cylinders. He is unlikely to reach within an hour. I am trying to borrow some cylinders from other hospitals to support my patients,” Pawar said. Rising hospital in Chandannagar was left with oxygen cylinders that would exhaust in three-and-a-half hours. The hospital has 32 patients in the ICU and as many on basic oxygen support. “We are not getting enough supply of medical oxygen. We may require shifting of all our ICU patients. Please help us with oxygen supply,” the hospital’s SOS message is making rounds on various networking groups of doctors. The Covid-19 case surge has pushed the city’s health infrastructure to the brink. Patients are scrambling for hospital beds — mainly those supported by oxygen — and ICU beds with ventilators. Doctors said small and medium-sized hospitals have no option, but to stop taking new admissions as there has been no guarantee of getting uninterrupted oxygen supply. “It has been more than 15 days now and there has been no respite. The situation is simply going from bad to worse every day,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India — a body of small and medium-sized hospitals in Pune. Officials involved in the mitigation of the oxygen deficit claimed the situation started improving from April 25 with the drop in daily caseload in the Pune Metropolitan Region. “The situation will worsen if urgent steps are not taken,” said health activist Abhijit More.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/oxygen-crunch-keeps-small-hospitals-on-tenterhooks/articleshow/82316896.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Dehradun||As cases surge in Haridwar, many ask why govt had to wait till after the last shahi snan to impose curfew in district||HARIDWAR: With Covid-19 cases surging and bed availability diminishing in Haridwar – over 8,500 cases and over 50 deaths have been reported since April 21 – residents are questioning why the administration waited till after the last shahi snan on April 27 to impose a curfew, when it was imposed in other districts of Uttarakhand much earlier. Hours after the last shahi snan, a curfew was imposed in the district till May 3. Local resident Ratanmani Dobhal told TOI, “Covid-19 cases started to surge in the district on April 14 but the district administration and health department did not take it seriously. They waited till the last shahi snan to impose a curfew. The situation had aggravated by then. The lack of basic facilities in government Covid hospitals and beds in private hospitals had resulted in a horrific situation.” Family members of Covid-19 patients alleged there was a complete lack of coordination between the health department and the district administration, as a result of which patients were made to shuttle between facilities for a bed. The district administration made a Covid-19 control room to help patients get admission at hospitals and facilitate home isolation, but residents alleged it is of no use at all. Patients recuperating at home said they were not getting home isolation kits and were forced to buy medicine from medical stores at inflated prices. Sunil Arora, a local resident who has formed a WhatsApp group “Covid helpline” to help patients and their families, said there were only three private hospitals in the district treating Covid-19 patients Jaya Maxwell, Vinay Vishal and Military Hospital (last two in Roorkee) and these were at capacity. “The 500-bed Covid hospital built in the city ahead of Kumbh lacks basic facilities. The wards are unclean, the toilets extremely unhygienic, food is served to patients late and doctors don’t attend to patients even after repeated calls. So naturally people prefer private hospitals. At the WhatsApp group, we receive requests for ventilator beds, ICU beds, blood plasma and remdesivir and all of these are hard to find in Haridwar. Also, the district administration provides no useful leads, patients are forced to waste crucial time calling up different hospitals and finalising a spot.” Haridwar CMO Dr SK Jha told TOI, “It’s true that the government Covid facilities have some problems. We do not have enough staff, we are trying our best to tackle the situation with limited resources.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/as-cases-surge-in-haridwar-many-ask-why-govt-had-to-wait-till-after-the-last-shahi-snan-to-impose-curfew-in-district/articleshow/82316186.cms||MS Nawaz

With daily rise in Covid cases, civic hospitals are falling short of ventilators and other equipment. Ambernath recently witnessed a spike of over 400 Covid cases in a day. Dr Prashant Rasal, attached with a civic hospital recently appealed the industrialists and citizens in Ambernath to step ahead and donate equipment to the civic hospitals as they were falling short to cater to the admitted patients. Speaking to TOI Kulkarni said, “First I had decided to donate an ambulance, but when I learnt that the civic body had sufficient ambulances and they require ventilators, I took an additional loan of Rs 2.5 lakh and purchased a ventilator. I hope my efforts can at least save some lives.” Around 850 civic employees have decided to donate their one day’s salary which will be used to purchase 5 Bi-PAP machines. Kulkarni, who lived in Ambernath for years recently shifted to Kanjurmarg. He lost his wife to cancer a few years ago and wanted to donate something for the civic hospitals and thought this was the right time to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-man-uses-entire-pension-fund-to-donate-ventilator/articleshow/82317765.cms||Pradeep Gupta

President of Ramanathapuram Archaeological Research Foundation, V Rajaguru said the artefacts are strewn over an area of about 20 acres and have similarity to those unearthed in Keeladi and other archeological sites. According to him, many potsherds were seen while a pond was dug opposite to Vazhavanthal Amman temple in Karungalakurichi village recently. It was a postgraduate Tamil teacher from the village, U Shanmuganathan, who brought this to the notice of the foundation.Rajaguru said they went to the spot and found many interesting artefacts including a microlithic tool and polished and unpolished black and red potsherds. There were also tiles, lamps and pipes made from terracotta, and a spout of what have been a part of a kettle or jar. They also found iron ore, hopscotches, a perforated potsherd and broken bowls. Other things included a piece of deer antler, a grinding stone and pestle. Two of the potsherds had graffiti on them. The graffiti resembles the English alphabet ‘E’ and ‘H’. Based on their similarity to artefacts unearthed in Keeladi and other archeological sites, this may have been a place that existed during the Sangam era, said Rajaguru.The brick found here was 29 cm in length, 15 cm in width and 7 cm in height, similar to the Sangam era bricks of the first century AD. It resembles bricks found in Peraiyur near Kamudhi. Antlers found here are hollow and look like those that belonged to the spotted deer known as ``Oolai maan’’. These deer had branched antlers that fell down and regrew., he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ancient-potsherds-deer-antlers-found-in-ramnad-village/articleshow/82317740.cms||---

A police team led by Chathannoor ACP Y Nizarudeen, which arrested Shiju M Varghese (Vypeen, Kochi) and his manager Sreekanth (41) (Vennala, Edappally) and Vinu Kumar (41) (Malayinkeezhu, Thiruvananthapuram), had produced them in Kottarakara court on Thursday morning seeking police custody. Investigators will now have to take the trio to gather evidence from Kochi, Palarivattom, Haripad and Ambalappuzha where they had allegedly met to hatch a conspiracy. They would also be brought to Kureepally where the accused hurled a petrol bomb at Shiju’s car on the morning of April 6 as part of the conspiracy to influence electioneering in the 33 coastal constituencies in the wake of the controversy over a deep-sea fishing deal between the government and EMCC International. Another accused Krishnakumar, a native of Thiruvananthapuram who was taken into custody, was admitted at a hospital as he contracted Covid-19. Another accomplice, a powerbroker who was part of the conspiracy based in Kochi and New Delhi, is under police surveillance. On Wednesday, police investigations into the petrol bomb attack on EMCC director and independent candidate in Kundara Shiju M Varghese took a new turn with police arresting him and two others in the case saying that Shiju himself had staged the attack. The police team investigating the case had examined CCTV visuals and telephone tower locations of suspects, including the man who was said to be driving Shiju’s car the day the attack took place. Police version is that Shiju conspired to put fisheries minister J Mercykutty on the defensive as she had withdrawn the deal with EMCC for deep-sea fishing. Shiju and his aide Sreekanth were arrested from Goa while another accomplice Vinu Kumar was arrested from Kozhikode. A police team led by Paravoor SI Samjith Khan claimed that they had arrested Shiju from a hideout in forests of Goa where leopards were also present in the vicinity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/emcc-president-2-others-remanded-in-police-custody/articleshow/82316192.cms||---

---||Madurai||MP seeks rapid steps in Madurai district||Madurai: The district administration should increase testing and take rapid steps to control the spread of Covid-19 in Madurai, failing which the district will run out of beds to treat the infected people, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan has said.In a statement he said that the proactive steps taken by the monitoring officer and the then district collector had helped bring down the numbers during the first wave quickly. The addition of more facilities for oxygen storage then, is helping the district immensely during the present crisis.He said that the district administration should once again step up and bring down the numbers through stringent methods. He said the the number of Covid patients undergoing treatment in government hospitals was 1,068 and those in private hospitals - 1047, as on April 28. In addition, there are 1,105 people in home isolation.If the current figures are correlated with those of the trends that existed 10 days ago, the private hospital beds would be full by May 5 and those in government hospitals by May 9 or 10.The total number of oxygen supported beds in government hospitals was 848 and together with 694 non-oxygen supported beds there are 1,542 beds, of which 999 were occupied as on Wednesday. Government hospitals had 345 ICU facilities of which 69 were occupied till Wednesday. Six government hospitals are treating Covid paitients, the MP said.Similarly, the 44 private hospitals treating Covid patients had 799 oxygen supported beds and 481 non-oxygen supported beds of which 1,280 were occupied. These hospitals have 247 ICU facilities of which 129 were occupied.It is very important that the district administration increases the testing and identifies more people without any time delay, he added. Coimbatore was testing 10,000 samples per day, while Madurai continued to cap the testing at 7,000 for many days. Hence, it is time that the testing is doubled to at least 15,000, Venkatesan said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mp-seeks-rapid-steps-in-madurai-district/articleshow/82317750.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: UDF candidate V V Prakash dies||KOZHIKODE: The UDF candidate in Nilambur assembly constituency and Malappuram district Congress committee president, V V Prakash, died following a heart attack in the early hours of Thursday. He was 57. According to family sources, Prakash experienced chest pain around 3am and was rushed to a hospital in Edakkara and the doctors referred him to the Kozhikode government medical college. As his condition worsened en route, he was admitted to a private hospital in Manjeri but his life could not be saved. He breathed his last around 5am. The demise of Prakash just three days before the counting of votes has come as a shock for the Congress and the UDF as Prakash had put up a strong fight in Nilambur constituency against sitting MLA P V Anvar. The front was hoping to wrest the traditional Congress bastion which it had lost in 2016. Prakash had attended an online meet of Congress workers in the constituency to review the counting day arrangements on Wednesday night. Known for his affable nature, Prakash, son of late Krishnan Nair and Sarojini Amma of Valiyaveettil house at Edakkara, had made his political foray through the Kerala Students Union during his student days itself and rose to the state leadership of KSU. Prakash went on to become the state general secretary of Youth Congress. He had served as secretary of KPCC and served as DCC president for four years. Prakash had unsuccessfully contested the assembly election in Tavanur constituency against LDF’s K T Jaleel in 2011. Leaders cutting across political divides condoled the demise of Prakash and remembered him as a sincere leader. Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi said that the demise of Prakash was extremely tragic. Chennithala said that Prakash had expressed confidence of securing an impressive win in the constituency when they spoke recently . Former chief minister Oommen Chandy said that with the demise of Prakash, the party has lost a dedicated leader who had shown exemplary commitment towards people and the party.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Virus, stress or fatigue can’t pull back resident docs from frontline||LUCKNOW: After spending 10 days in hospital for Covid-19 treatment, senior resident at SGPGI’s surgical gastroenterology department, Dr Anil Gangwar, returned to Covid duty on April 24, a few days after being discharged. And he was not the only one in the family to get infection. “My parents are Covid-19 positive with 40-50% lung damage. I am treating them at home as getting a bed is not possible,” said Dr Gangwar, who is also the general secretary of SGPGI’s Resident Doctors’ Association. “Of around 550 resident doctors at the institute, one-third have been infected so far. Be it doctors or patients or their families, we all are suffering. All we can do is motivate each other and stay mentally fit,” he said. Like Gangwar, over 1,800 resident doctors at city’s three premier superspecialty medical education institutes – KGMU, SGPGIMS and RMLIMS – are exhausted by the second wave that has infected over a lakh people so far, but they are working as the backbone of medical facilities. Majority of critical cases are referred to these three institutes and residents remain on ward duties in rotation round the clock. Radiotherapy resident at KGMU, Dr Jagrati Yadav, is on her second Covid duty. “A team member tested positive recently and soon after I started getting extreme body ache. Still, I came for duty as patient load is increasing. We have to be there for them wearing PPE kits for 2-3 hours at a stretch, which is exhausting, dehydrating and also limits our efficiency,” she said. While dealing with patients and their distress, many shared how difficult it becomes for their own voice to be heard by officials. “After a resident tested positive recently, the residents’ room required fumigation as per protocol but for this small task, we had to request repeatedly. Often, the supply of drinking water at the residents’ room takes hours,” said another KGMU resident. The residents also resent the protocol put in place by KGMU which does not have any rest days after recovery from Covid-19. “We are short of hands, but is it justified to call residents for duty soon after they recover – the period when you are still vulnerable,” a resident asked. A senior resident at RMLIMS general surgery department, Dr Saurabh Rai, is hanging by a thread of hope as he returns to emergency duty as not only he will be exposed to the risk of catching infection, but there is also a fear of taking it home. “I have done three Covid duties so far. My brother had to be hospitalised after getting infected in August 2020 during my first duty. My father got critically ill in January 2021 during the second duty and I got infected on April 9 in the third,” he said. “We can’t run away from our responsibilities. I try to keep away from negative news on social media and do yoga and breathing exercises to keep myself motivated. Otherwise, this pressure can get to anyone,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/virus-stress-or-fatigue-cant-pull-back-resident-docs-from-frontline/articleshow/82317747.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Bareilly||UP: Sick with Covid, teacher on poll duty posts video of her state||BAREILLY: A school teacher on poll duty in UP’s Shajahanpur during the last phase of panchayat polls on Thursday fell seriously sick while at the polling centre. But when no help came her way, she made a video clip of her condition and posted it on a teachers Whatsapp group from where it went viral. In the video, she can be seen lying on the floor, continuously coughing, gasping for breath and barely able to speak. In the video, she says, “My name is Aparna. My duty is at an upper primary school in Dasiya village of Kalaan. I am not well and there is no medical assistance provided to me at all. They are not even letting me go to the hospital. I am forced to stay here. What shall I do? Please help me.” Polling didn’t stop at the centre despite the deteriorating condition of the woman. Local police later shifted her to a nearby community health centre after the video became viral. Aparna Mahavar, 44, mother of two children, aged 10 and 3, is deployed at a primary school in Dadraul block and she was sent to Dasiya block in rural area for polling duty. She had requested that she be exempted from the duty but her request was turned down. At the polling station, her condition deteriorated and she informed her seniors but she was not allowed to return home. She was provided medical assistance nearly after two hours of waiting. Police took her to the district hospital but she decided to return home. When contacted, Mahavar told TOI, “The condition at the hospital was horrible. There were people lying on the floor begging medical attention. I found that it was better to take treatment at home but after I returned home, no one has bothered to provide me with any medicine. My Covid test is also not done and my husband’s report is awaited. I am scared as we have no support.” TOI spoke to the district magistrate Shahjahanpur, Indra Vikram Singh, about this incident over the phone. He said, “We had immediately replaced the staff and sent the teacher to the hospital for treatment. Her condition was found stable and her oxygen level was nearly 94, which is why her Covid test was also not done.” Chief medical superintendent, district hospital Shahjahanpur, U P Sinha said, “We are over-stretched despite doubling the beds in the trauma centre. Since she offered to return home, we didn’t stop her. Her Covid test was not done because she was not admitted to the hospital.” Speaking on the matter, Ankur Tripathi, leader of a teacher’s union said teachers are being treated in an inhuman manner. “I will be raising this issue with the National Human Rights Commission. We don’t know how we can do the ‘counting’ duty? We have been asked to work 12 hours at a stretch with no breaks and no medical facilities.” In a similar incident, Santosh Gupta, a presiding officer, collapsed minutes after voting was over in Dhulia village in Nigohi block on Thursday evening. He was immediately rushed to the nearest community health centre for treatment.

The officials said that a separate microbiology laboratory for them will ease the burden of the lab at the KAPV Government Medical College Hospital where samples from the entire district are being tested.As the fresh infections force authorities to test primary and secondary contacts, the surge in fresh cases and symptomatic people volunteering to get tested have increased the sample strength in the past week. From testing 850 samples per day until March, Trichy Corporation has drastically increased the numbers to 2,800 a day now. The civic body still collects samples from the 18 urban primary health centres and sends them to the government medical college lab at Periya Milaguparai at the end of the day. The process causes delays, as people have to wait for more than a couple of days to get the results. To overcome this, a section of corporation officials opined that a separate laboratory for them will help test more people as well as to reduce the waiting time.“Kodumal Hospital complex on WB Road and Woraiyur UPHCs have space to set up a laboratory. The MP’s development fund can be used to establish a testing facility in a few days,” a health official with Trichy Corporation said. Out of the 5,500 samples tested at the government laboratory per day, around 50% of samples were collected from the corporation limit. Similarly, more than 50% of the total fresh infections in the district have been reported from the city. “There is no delay in declaring the test results. Wherever there is a medical college, the protocol insists to use the medical college facility. We will discuss the demand,” a district health official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/exclusive-rt-pcr-testing-facility-for-trichy-city-mooted/articleshow/82316909.cms||Deepak Karthik

The officials added that Covid Care Centres across civic areas can be made available for better treatment, if oxygen beds are installed. Around 1,000 beds are available at the centres. “PMC is already treating patients at jumbo hospitals at CoEP, Baner and other civic hospitals. This can be improved, and more PMC-run hospitals can provide free-of-cost treatment if we’re given more oxygen,” said a senior PMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/make-an-effort-to-improve-occupancy/articleshow/82316902.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Doctor helps critical Covid-positive woman deliver at local healthcare centre||ALMORA: A Covid-positive pregnant woman was brought to Someshwar additional healthcare centre in a critical condition on Wednesday by her husband. As she had tested positive for the coronavirus, the woman was referred to Base Hospital Almora, roughly 40km from Someshwar and the district’s only Covid facility. But seeing she was in no condition to be shifted, a doctor present at the healthcare centre put on a PEE kit and operated on her, saving both mother and baby. Dr Deepika (she uses only her first name), who has been working at the healthcare centre for the last four years, saw that the woman’s condition had deteriorated and realized she wouldn’t be able to make it to Base Hospital. “The woman was very critical. Although she had been referred to Base Hospital, she wouldn’t have been able to make it. I called up a senior doctor for guidance, he said the only option would be to deliver the child at the healthcare centre,” said Deepika. The doctor and her assistants put on PPE kits and with Covid-19 norms in place, operated on the woman. A baby boy was born healthy and his Covid-19 report came negative. Deepika has done her MBBS from Haldwani’s Sushila Tiwari Medical College. Her father is the retired principal of a government school and mother a homemaker. In a similar case, an emergency operation was done on a pregnant woman who was brought to Almora Base Hospital from Takula block. The Operation Theatre (OT) at Base Hospital, which is usually closed at night, was opened on Wednesday just to treat the woman, who was Covid positive. Dr Usha Rawat Bhandari, head of department, gynecology, arrived at the facility at night and headed the operation with the help of senior anesthetist Dr CS Marchal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doctor-helps-critical-covid-positive-woman-deliver-at-local-healthcare-centre/articleshow/82316193.cms||---

While Trichy corporation maintained that it is not compulsory, health department officials said only those who had registered their mobile numbers in the portal will be permitted to get vaccinated. Those in the age group can get vaccinated in over 100 government healthcare units while in Trichy city, the urban local body is planning to establish a vaccination point in each of the four zones. A day after registration started, youngsters said the CoWin portal still did not have a provision to schedule vaccination location and it continued to be open only for those above 45 years. Also, since not all those in the age group are tech-savvy, many interested people have sought help in registering on the CoWin website. The vaccination covering the young age group with Covishield will be available in PHCs, government hospitals and government medical college hospital. In Trichy city, all the 18 UPHCs will vaccinate the people to be covered under the drive while the makeshift vaccination centre established at the main office of Trichy corporation will also administer the vaccination. “We are expecting 20,000 doses of Covishield in Trichy by Friday. Online registration is a must, people who need information and help in registration can utilise 104 helpline and visit the nearest PHC,” a senior health official said. Following the favourable response after converting a portion of its main office on Bharathidasan road as vaccination point, Trichy corporation has planned to replicate it at three more spots covering Srirangam, K Abishekapuram and Ariyamangalam zones. “People must bring Aadhaar card during the vaccination, registration is not compulsory. We have adequate stock of Covishield with us,” city health officer Dr M Yazhini said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/vax-for-18-trichy-corpn-says-no-need-to-register-health-dept-differs/articleshow/82316904.cms||---

Suresh Kadam (50), the wanted criminal, has been booked under section 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) of the Indian Penal Code. Pramod Bhandwalkar, assistant sub-inspector, Pimpri police, said that Kadam was convicted in an attempt to murder case in 2015. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he was released on temporary parole in May last year for a period of 45 days,” he said. He said during this period Kadam was staying at Bharatnagar in Pimpri. “His parole relief was extended time to time over the last 10 months,” Bhandwalkar said. On March 25, Kadam and his two sons assaulted a 19-year-old youth following an old dispute. “During the parole, Kadam was not expected to be involved in any criminal activities. He, however, flouted the norms. Following which the jail authorities cancelled his extended parole,” Bhandwalkar said. Kadam, however, did not return to the jail. Kishore Shelkande, an official from the Yerawada prison, has filed a complaint against him. “We have launched a search for Kadam,” Bhandwalkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/criminal-jumps-parole-commits-crime/articleshow/82316906.cms||---
---||Pune||Push for Ayush 64 for treatment of mild, moderate cases||Pune: The Ministry of Ayush on Thursday announced the repurposing of ‘Ayush 64’ for treatment of asymptomatic and mild to moderate Covid-19 cases, in addition to standard care. Ayush 64 was initially used for the treatment of malaria in the 1980s. “It has antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties that work to combat Covid- and flu-like illness,” said Bhushan Patwardhan, national research professor, Ayush, while addressing a news conference. The decision follows a series of clinical trials conducted at King George’s Medical University in Lucknow, Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences in Wardha and BMC Covid Centre in Mumbai, each with a sample size of 70 Covid-19 patients. “Patients who were given Ayush 64 tested negative in six-and-a-half days whereas the control group that was not given the drug recovered in 8.3 days,” said Arvind Chopra, director, Centre for Rheumatic Diseases, Pune. “While the patients were given the tablet twice daily during treatment, they were advised to continue taking the tablet for two-three weeks after a negative RT-PCR report to improve general health and boost immunity. Ayush 64 has also been observed to reduce anxiety, stress, fatigue, and increase appetite,” Chopra said. These multi-centre trials were monitored by Ayush-CSIR joint monitoring committee under the chairmanship of V M Katoch, former secretary, department of health research and former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research and periodically reviewed by an independent Data and Safety Management Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/push-for-ayush-64-for-treatment-of-mild-moderate-cases/articleshow/82316910.cms||---

---||Delhi||Covid-19: We don’t have enough vaccines, dip in positivity rate a ray of hope, says Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: The third phase of Covid-19 vaccination drive, which will allow people in the 18-44 age group to get inoculated, is slated to begin on Saturday. Delhi, however, still doesn’t have enough vaccines to start the drive at a big scale. Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday highlighted some concerns regarding the drive. “We don’t have enough vaccines. We have requested for procurement of vaccines from the respective companies. Despite all preparations being made, availability of vaccines is inevitable for the inoculation to begin,” Jain said during a press conference on Thursday. “As soon as these things are made clear and we receive the vaccines, we will let you know in a couple of days or so. We haven’t received the schedule from companies yet, which includes how many vials will reach on which dates,” he said. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said on Monday that the Delhi government has approved the purchase of 1.3 crore vaccines on that very day. Official sources said the government was also going to procure 67 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine from Serum Institute of India, apart from Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. The first tranche of three lakh shots will be delivered by May 3, they added. Jain said that while the number of Covid-19 cases being reported in Delhi has been above the 20,000-mark consistently, the positivity rate has shown a slight dip, which is a ray of hope. “With the positivity rate dropping down to 31.76%, Delhi reported 25,986 cases yesterday. The fact that the positivity rate has been declining is a certain ray of hope for us,” Jain said. Jain said that the number of tests conducted per day has come down due to the lockdown in place. “The Delhi government has not reduced its testing strategy. In the face of the lockdown, public movement has substantially dropped down, and the footfall has decreased in dispensaries and hospitals,” he said. Jain also said that the Kejriwal government had kept everything transparent in front of the people of Delhi and each Covid-19 fatality was reported. “The demand for oxygen has increased exponentially. Nearly 18-19,000 patients admitted in hospitals require it. Oxygen is being demanded by others as well. We are working round the clock to maintain its supply,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/we-dont-have-enough-vax-dip-in-positivity-rate-a-ray-of-hope-jain/articleshow/82317779.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Dehradun||Not selected IFS Sanjiv for lack of PG: Centre||NAINITAL: In response to the petition filed by whistleblower IFS officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi alleging discrimination against him in the selection process of the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) has said that his candidature was rejected as he did not have a valid PG degree and that his application was received by the department post-deadline. “The petitioner’s application was received in this office on 29.05.2020 i.e. after the expiry of the last date for receipt of applications i.e. 23.03.2020. Further, the petitioner did not possess a postgraduate degree from a recognized university or institution,” read the affidavit filed by DOPT under-secretary Rajbir Singh. Interestingly, Chaturvedi, in his petition before the Uttarakhand high court (HC), has said he has an AIGNFA Diploma and according to a notification issued by the Forest Research Institute, this diploma is equivalent to the PG Degree of MSc (Forestry). When contacted, Sudershan Goel, counsel appearing for Chaturvedi, termed the Centre’s reply ‘scandalous’ and said that he will file a perjury application as well. “The affidavit filed by the central government before the high court declaring FRI as not a recognized institution will play havoc with the future of thousands of students getting degrees from this prestigious institution. Now, we are going to file a perjury application before the HC,” Goel said. The Centre’s response comes after the Nainital high court asked the Uttarakhand government, the department of personnel and training (DOPT), the department of post, and private respondent Om Prakash, the person who was eventually selected for the job, to file their responses to Chaturvedi’s petition. As reported by TOI earlier, Chaturvedi has alleged that he was the only eligible candidate out of the 16 applicants for the post of the member of the SSC – the country’s largest recruitment agency. Chaturvedi, a Magsaysay Award recipient, has claimed that his records, including his date of birth and the date of receipt of his application, were forged under a ‘criminal conspiracy’ to debar him from the selection process of the members of the SSC. Meanwhile, the court will hear the matter next week as the HC is open only for important cases in the wake of the rising cases of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/not-selected-ifs-sanjiv-for-lack-of-pg-centre/articleshow/82316203.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Chandigarh||Amarinder Singh-Navjot Singh Sidhu tussle: Congressmen stand divided||CHANDIGARH: Even as Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has openly hit out at his former cabinet colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu, other Congress functionaries continue to speak in different voices, waiting to see how the episode unfolds in the days to come. Congress Qadian MLA Fateh Jung Bajwa said, “Navjot Sidhu holds a key role in the party and the party (leadership) should put up a united face. Both Capt Saab and Sidhu should not make such statements in the press as the party will have to pay a price for it. The need of the hour is to understand people’s pulse and try to find a solution. My feeling is that Sidhu will continue to be in the party.” On the other hand, Congress Amritsar West MLA Raj Kumar Verka, added, “Navjot Sidhu is a Congress MLA. It will be his individual decision whether he wants to continue in the party. Misunderstandings and mistrust could be the reason behind the situation that has emerged. The common sentiment of the MLAs is that we all should work for the party.” Meanwhile, hitting out at Sidhu, cabinet minister Sunder Sham Arora said the repeated statements by the former minister against the party leadership were a sign of “indiscipline and irresponsible behaviour”. He added, “Congress gained strength in Punjab under the able leadership of Capt Amarinder Singh. Questioning the chief minister’s leadership time and again by Sidhu amounted to challenging the party leadership.” The unfounded accusations by Sidhu were weakening the party, he said. “The CM gave him a significant portfolio despite that he could not fulfil the aspirations of the people,” said Arora, adding that discipline was important and something that could never be compromised. Congress MLA from Sultanpur Lodhi Navtej Cheema said, “If Sidhu has an issue, he should discuss it with the CM or the party high command. By making the public statements, he is only damaging the party.” The fact that the party’s central leadership has not clarified its stand on the way Sidhu had been targeting Capt Amarinder has left many party leaders perplexed. Secondly, Sidhu’s frontal attack at the CM came at a time when a section of MLAs too feel that the party is on the backfoot on the sacrilege issue. “The CM looks for support in wake of quashing of the sacrilege probe report in the Kotkapura firing case. But where most MLAs vented their ire over the alleged delay in justice, only two ministers – Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and Sunder Sham Arora – supported CM openly against Sidhu. ,” said a party leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-sidhu-tussle-congmen-stand-divided/articleshow/82317753.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Yogi asks Ayush doctors to join fight against Covid||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has called on all Ayush practitioners to contribute to the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. In a virtual interaction with Ayush practitioners on Thursday evening, Yogi said that they should provide treatment to patients of Covid-19. Ayush doctors should coordinate with local administration and the Integrated Command and Control Centre to create awareness and offer treatment. “There are currently 2.52 lakh people in home isolation and doctors of Ayush, homeopathy and Unani should be given access to them to give them consultation. The Ayush department should distribute kadha in every home,” he said. The CM said that a team comprising Ayush, Homeopathy and Unani doctors should be set up in each district. This team should give advice on health to people. They should also be linked with tele-consultation services. As part of these services, they should tell people about the simple treatment options against Covid-19 which are available to them. Yogi said the current time was ideal to make people aware of the benefits of Ayush. “Our ancient health systems are not only affordable but also more useful. We must extend the benefits of these to the most number of people. For this, contact monitoring committees which have been set up to keep a watch on those in home isolation and reach out to such persons,” he said. He also emphasised on the role of yoga in making one free of illness and said that Ayush doctors should tell people how their immunity can be boosted. In 2020, an Ayush Kawach app had been launched by the government. The CM said that the app can be used to benefit people now. “Yoga and prayanam have proven to be beneficial against Covid-19. People should be encouraged to follow these practices in their daily lives,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-asks-ayush-doctors-to-join-fight-against-covid/articleshow/82317774.cms||---
---||Delhi||3-month-old among 6 of a family dead in fire||New Delhi: Six members of a family were killed in the fire that engulfed their hut in a field in southwest Delhi’s Bijwasan, after an LPG cylinder in the house exploded in the early hours of Thursday. The deceased include a couple and their four children. They have been identified as Kamlesh (37), his wife Budhani (32), their two daughters aged 16 and 12 and two sons, 6 years and 3-months-old. Fire officials and local police received a call regarding the fire around 12.30am, after which four fire tenders were rushed to the spot. Officials found that two huts had caught fire and the occupants of one had been charred to death. However, the five residents of the second shanty escaped. Prima facie, enquiries suggest that the fire started from a nearby transformer after a possible short circuit and rapidly spread to the shanties. A cylinder in the house also caught fire and exploded, killing the six residents on the spot. Officials said that the residents were likely asleep and couldn’t escape. The bodies were taken to Safdarjung Hospital, where they were declared brought dead and sent for postmortem examination. Police said they have registered a case and are conducting an enquiry. In a related incident, four members of a family were severely injured after two LPG cylinders at their home caught fire. The victims were identified as Shailender (35), Koshlender (29), Rani (15) and Shubham (9). While Shailender and Rani suffered 80% burns, the other two sustained around 40% injuries. Police received two PCR calls regarding the incident at Ravi Nagar extension in west Delhi on Wednesday night. The incident happened while gas cylinders were being changed. It is suspected that one of them leaked and caught fire leading to the flames. The cops have filed an FIR into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-month-old-among-6-of-a-family-dead-in-fire/articleshow/82317826.cms||---

The Akali dissidents are likely to announce a new political party or a front to take on the traditional parties in the 2022 assembly elections. Sources said the newly merged SAD (Democratic) and SAD (Taksali) had sent feelers to Sidhu and former police officer Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh and will invite them to their joint meeting on May 3 in Mohali. Asked about it, senior Akali leader Karnail Singh Peermohammad, who is also principal spokesperson of the six-member Ekta Committee that has three members from both Akali factions, said the factions planned to get like-minded peoples. "Leaders such as Navjot Singh Sidhu, Pargat Singh, Sukhpal Singh Khaira, Bains brothers, and Dr Dharamvira Gandhi can change the picture of the state, and we hope they join us for the betterment of Punjab." A senior member of the AAP said on the condition of anonymity that Sidhu and Kunwar would make a winnable strong team in Punjab. Guru Nanak Dev University’s political science professor Kuldeep Singh said : "By now, Sidhu must have also concluded that he is about to go out of the Congress, and his outburst against his own chief minister, was evidence of it." He said Sidhu must have also realised that despite his firing these political salvos, the Congress leadership had given no sign of making him deputy CM or Pradesh Congress chief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/selectors-for-new-team-glued-to-congress-match/articleshow/82317770.cms||Yudhvir Rana

He was later booked in three other extortion related cases. He was suspended for three years till 2018. Ghadge told TOI, “Singh started targeting me in 2015 when I petitioned the ST/SC Commission against him. Since I did not follow his order to protect criminals, he implicated me in false cases and even got me arrested. I later filed five petitions in HC against Singh and the matter is still pending.” Calls to Singh went unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-inspector-had-long-running-battle-with-param-bir/articleshow/82317776.cms||Pradeep Gupta

After photos and videos of the ABVP members who were clad in PPE kits and had stickers of their organisation pasted on their kits, started doing the rounds on social media on Thursday, chief medical superintendent of the hospital Dr KC Pant said that the hospital has debarred the organisation members from entering the premises. Among the videos are those in which a man on oxygen support, gasping for breath, is being interviewed by the organisation’s members and asked to extol the good work that ABVP is doing. Dr KC Pant told TOI that the ABVP members managed to enter the Covid ward without their knowledge. “They were not permitted to enter. After we came to know of their presence, we have debarred them from the hospital,” he said. As per sources from Doon Hospital, the ABVP members 'tricked the hospital staff.' “They were wearing PPE kits where faces are not clearly visible, They must have placed the stickers with their organisation’s name after entering the ward. Otherwise we would have stopped them,” said the source. When contacted, Vikram Singh Farswan, member of ABVP’s national executive committee, told TOI that no rules were violated by the members of the RSS’s student wing. “All those who entered the Covid ward were medical students from one or the other medical colleges located across Uttarakhand. We are only trying to help people and are least interested in getting credit or doing politics during a pandemic,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cmo-bans-abvp-members-from-hosp-after-they-enter-covid-ward-click-pics-with-patients/articleshow/82316204.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Pune||Snags, lags annoy citizens trying to register for jabs||Pune: The Union government on Thursday tweeted that 1.33 crore people in the 18-44 age group have registered for the Covid-19 vaccine. The tweet, however, invited criticism from many citizens — especially in Maharashtra — who questioned the logic behind the plan, considering the general shortage of vaccines and a lack of appointment slots. In Maharashtra, the vaccination of those between 18 and 44 years of age is not expected to begin till the third week or end of May. Some likened it to an e-commerce startup boasting of a one crore user-base with “zero orders delivered”. “The purpose of the whole exercise was to book vaccination slots, which are not available for this category of citizens currently,” Arjun Mehta (24) told TOI. The rollout of the registration itself was marred by overburdened servers, delayed one-time passwords and other glitches, such as apps and portals crashing. “I managed to register myself after some trouble as the server was very slow. My guess is that it was because of the overwhelming traffic on the portal, as everybody was trying to register,” city-based working professional Sudeep Chintamani (40) said. Ajay Pardeshi (43) said he too faced issues. “There have been some glitches on CoWIN — after the login, the portal would not proceed beyond the first page. Also, I had to enter the OTP multiple times as it did not get through, even after the correct OTP was sent to my phone,” Pardeshi said. Ankit Srivastava (31), a city-based event professional, had no luck till Thursday morning, “I tried everything possible — CoWIN portal, Aarogya Setu app, but simply could not get the OTP. I tried multiple times from several devices, but had no luck till Thursday morning,” Srivastava said. Garima Mishra, another event manager, failed to get the OTP despite enrolling herself thrice. “I hope the vaccine shortage and other such issues get resolved soon so that we can get vaccinated, especially those of us in the entertainment and hospitality sectors,” Mishra said. Senior officials from the Union health and family welfare ministry said Wednesday’s issues were caused by “unprecedented” traffic. “We have successfully handled a peak load of 55,000 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) hits per second on Wednesday. This is unprecedented, even for the largest software systems across the globe. We are further improving the capabilities of the system to ensure that all those who register, and book appointments are vaccinated in a convenient manner,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/snags-lags-annoy-citizens-trying-to-register-for-jabs/articleshow/82316934.cms||Neha Madaan

These vials (about 3,120 in number) were distributed to the Covid hospitals across 17 districts in the state, including Pune, on Wednesday night. “We withdrew the vials belonging to a particular batch as a precautionary measure after three hospitals in Pune reported rigor in their patients. We shall investigate if the vial contents developed any contamination. The drug is safe and there is no need to panic,” said Shyam Pratapwar, FDA assistant commissioner (drugs), Pune Pune district on Thursday did not receive a single vial of remdesivir. “There were some issues on the production front,” Pratapwar said. Meanwhile, Pune district on Thursday received 87 vials of tocilizumab, an imported anti-rheumatic drug found beneficial in carefully selected critically ill Covid patients. The drug had been in short supply for more than a month now. “Maharashtra received 800 vials of tocilizumab on Thursday. Of them, Pune district received 87 vials,” said a health official. The allocation stands low as the daily requirement of the drug in the district alone has gone up to 500 vials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/remdesivir-batch-withdrawn-after-fever-in-patients/articleshow/82316932.cms||---

The civic body is unable to distribute the tax bills physically due to the Covid outbreak.Deputy municipal commissioner (tax) Pradeep Chaudhari said the revenue of the civic body through property tax has been badly hit due to the pandemic. “Like last year, the property tax collection is also likely to be affected due to the continuous rise in Covid cases in the city. Hence, we have introduced up to 5% rebate if taxpayers pay their complete property tax for the current financial year by May 31,” said Chaudhari.

Remdesivir shortage is well-known, but now the supply of the oral drug Favipiravir is also erratic. Favipiravir was earlier available readily in the market at medicine shops. At times one had to look for it at a few stores before finding it, but now there are days when it is not available in the market in most stores. The stores ask relatives or patients to come again as the drug is in short supply, if not unavailable. Sources in the drug market in the city said that the tablets were being manufactured by multiple companies. “Earlier, the stock of one or the other company use to arrive in the city on a given day and there was never a crisis. Now there are days when one exhausts the stock on a given day and has nothing to sell till new stock arrives on the next day,” said a dealer. President of the Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists Association Alpesh Patel said that while the market is not totally dry, one has to wait for stocks to arrive and supplies are erratic. “The issue is expected to get sorted out in a couple of days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/now-favipiravir-availability-becomes-erratic/articleshow/82315216.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Vax drive for 18+ may not begin in Jharkhand from May 1: Health minister Banna hints||RANCHI: Health minister Banna Gupta on Thursday hinted that the proposed vaccination drive for adults between 18-44 years of age in the state may not begin from May 1 owing to the delay in getting vials from the manufacturers. Addressing a press conference, Gupta said the state had placed orders with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India for 25 lakh doses of Covishield and with the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech for another 25 lakh doses of Covaxin for beginning the drive. “Both the companies told us that the Centre has placed advanced orders for 12 crore doses (10 crore of them from Bharat Biotech) already. Due to the sheer volume of the Centre’s orders, they will not be able to supply us the doses before May 15,” Gupta said. Gupta’s statement came a day after the registration window for the third phase opened. Over 1.5 crore people have registered nationally in the past 48 hours. Notably, there are 1.57 crore adults between 18 and 44 years of age who are eligible for jabs in the third phase of the nationwide vaccination drive. “We have also set up over 2,229 vaccination centres statewide (for the third phase). How will we inoculate the beneficiaries of our state if there is a delay? While the Centre is not being able to provide vaccines to backward states, it is supplying doses to countries like Pakistan and Bhutan,” Gupta said. As per Centre’s April 21-decision, manufacturers will have to reserve 50% of their monthly production for the Centre and sell the states and private entities from the remaining share. “We appeal to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan to provide us vaccines at the earliest. We are ready to pay for them,” the minister said. In her Budget speech in Parliament this year, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had allocated Rs 35,000 crore for the vaccination programme. “If they allocated so much money, why is that the state governments are being asked to pay for the doses? And why have different tariffs been imposed? This is injustice,” Gupta added. Gupta also criticised the Centre over its allotment of Remdisivir. “At present, we need 4,000 Remdisivir injections daily. We have borrowed 2,000 Remdisivir injections from Assam but the Centre has allotted us a mere 20,000 Remdisivir injections in the past 10 days,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vax-drive-for-18-may-not-begin-in-state-from-may-1-banna-hints/articleshow/82316263.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Online classes depriving hotel management students of practicals||NAGPUR: Online-only mode of colleges has hit hotel management students, as a major part of their degree course relies on practical training. Right from cooking, to service to housekeeping, the skills are best learnt in a physical classroom setting. A hotel management student told TOI that they are staring at a second year of online classes. “Learning to make different global cuisines is not something which can be learnt by watching cooking shows. That probably works if you are cooking for your family, but when it’s a career that’s at stake, we need face to face practical teaching,” said the student. Another student said that at home not all ingredients are available. “How many houses in Nagpur have exotic French dishes made at home? So it’s not surprising that ingredients are not easily available, and those that are at online grocery sites, are too costly. So colleges can afford to buy them in bulk, not us,” the student said. A student who will be entering the final year in 2021-22 session said, “For training as a professional chef, 50% of our preparations happen at the college while the rest is during internships at hotels. But that college period is very crucial because that is where we learn about different cuisines, different sauces and how to cut meat and vegetables.” Urvashi Yashroy, a veteran academic in the field of hospitality education, said last year has indeed been a challenge. “It’s true that unless you learn cooking in a college kitchen, the nuances smell, texture etc can’t be fully understood. But the situation being what it is now, we have to adapt and do the best possible. So we are going ahead with demo videos and YouTube links. I am convinced now that they way education is delivered will change forever and we are in an evolutionary process,” said Yashroy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/online-classes-depriving-hotel-mgmt-students-of-practicals/articleshow/82316230.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Ranchi||12 days after HC suspended sentence, Lalu walks free||Ranchi: Twelve days after the Jharkhand high court suspended the jail term of RJD president Lalu Prasad in a fodder scam case, lawyers of jailed former Bihar chief minister on Thursday secured his release order from the special CBI court here, following which he has been set free. Lalu's lawyer Prabhat Kumar said, "We have fulfilled the conditions set by the high court, including the furnishing of two sureties of Rs one lakh each and depositing a fine of Rs 10 lakh. The court has now granted the release order." When contacted, Hamid Akhtar, the superintendent of the Birsa Munda Central Jail, where Lalu is officially lodged, said, the court order has been sent by e-mail to the All Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, where Lalu is currently undergoing treatment under custody, for his release. Sources said AIIMS has accepted the court order. Lalu has been serving a prison term in the Dumka fodder scam case and was airlifted to AIIMS, New Delhi, in January for treatment of various illnesses. Notably, Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh had suspended Lalu's jail term on April 17 with certain conditions. Lalu’s lawyer, however, could not move the lower court earlier for his client's release as the Jharkhand State Bar Council (JSBC) had issued a directive on April 18 asking all lawyers and their support staff to stay away from both offline and online court work because of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The JSBC had further extended the period of court work abstention on April 26. However, the Bar Council of India (BCI), in a letter to all state bar councils on Wednesday, stated that it has come to notice that some state bar councils have restrained the lawyers enrolled with them from appearing before courts even for persons who have been asked to secure bails or release by fulfilling the court conditions. The council urged the state lawyers’ bodies to allow such persons furnish the bail bonds and sureties, saying such action restraining the lawyers affects the fundamental rights and the right to liberty of the accused persons. The BCI's letter said, “The council requests and directs the state bar councils to allow advocates to facilitate and furnish bail bonds /sureties for the release of those accused who have been ordered to be released by a court of law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/12-days-after-hc-suspended-sentence-lalu-walks-free/articleshow/82316289.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Jamshedpur||Former state BJP prez Gilua dies of Covid||JAMSHEDPUR: Former Lok Sabha MP and senior BJP leader Laxman Gilua died of Covid-19 at Tata Motors Hospital in the early hours of Thursday, about a week after he was admitted to the hospital. Gilua (56) had resigned from the post of the party's state president last year, taking moral responsibility for the defeat in the assembly polls. A two term Lok Sabha member and two time MLA, Gilua was the face of the saffron party in Singhbhum. "His death has created a void in the party. He was a devoted public representative popular among the ranks and was," former state BJP president Dineshanand Goswami said. State BJP spokesperson Kunal Sarangi said Gilua's death has brought irreparable damage to the party. Making, a successful debut in electoral politics, Gilua, was first elected to the Bihar assembly in 1995 from Chakradharpur assembly seat. In 1999, he became a household name in the mineral rich West Singhbhum when he defeated Congress strongman and sitting MP Vijay Singh Soy in the general elections, becoming the first BJP leader to win from the Singhbhum. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Gilua won from Singhbhum, defeating ex0CM Madhu Koda's wife Geeta Koda. The party appointed him the president of the state organisation in August 2016 in place of Tala Marandi after police leveled charges against him under Prevention of Child Marriage Act as he got his son married to a minor girl. BJP contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and the assembly polls later in the same year under the leadership of Gilua. This time, Gilua lost the parliamentary seat to Geeta Koda, who contested as a Congress candidate with support from JMM and RJD. In December, he faced another debacle, losing to JMM candidate Sukhram Oraon in the state polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/former-state-bjp-prez-gilua-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82324530.cms||B Sridhar

The property was purchased jointly by Safelkar and two petitioners through a sale deed on May 20, 2015. Branding Safelkar as a “notorious criminal”, the bench noted that various offences under IPC and MCOCA were registered against him, including a murder. “In these crimes, the allegation is that Safelkar has grabbed various parcels of lands from unfortunate owners by employing coercive methods. Therefore, serious police action has been initiated for demolishing the properties, which have been alleged to be obtained by using the proceeds of crime. We find that this is not a fit case wherein this court should make any intervention by exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,” the judges said before dismissing the plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-dismisses-safelkar-partners-plea/articleshow/82316242.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Business||Covid-19: Pay for home nurses rises as demand surges||CHENNAI: The spike in Covid cases and increased need for home isolation and treatment has led to a shortage of trained nurses, paramedics and phlebotomists. Consequently, there is almost a 20% increase in pay for such job roles and some institutions are also shortening the runway to student paramedics to onboard them quickly. Bengaluru-based home healthcare startup Portea saw a 40% rise in demand for home nurses between March and April. Covid care being specialised and in demand, we pay almost a 15-20% premium for our staff on such assignments, Vaibhav Tewari, co-founder, Portea Medical, said. In March, Portea handled around 3,000 clients for oxygen support, nursing and other services for Covid. Industry sources said that salaries of a fresher lab technician in diagnostic labs or a home nurse are at Rs 25,000-30,000 per month. India Home Health, another home healthcare enterprise, says the second wave has led to a ‘huge jump’ in demand for staff for home ICU set-ups, oxygen management, and other tasks. This is a ‘big surge’ compared to the lull we faced at the same time last year when SOPs for managing Covid were not welldefined and staff hesitated to take up Covid assignments, V Thiyagarajan, founder, India Home, said. TeamLease Services in its employment outlook for April-June 2021 reports that at 58% outlook, hiring intentions for the healthcare sector has almost doubled from the same period last year. “Phlebotomists for diagnostic labs for short-term contracts, nurses and paramedics staff for hospitals and large corporations are some of the roles high in demand,” Balasubramanian A, business head (consumer and healthcare), said.

In an incident highlighting the issue, a 55-year-old man allegedly ended his life by suicide in Rajkot city on Wednesday after his wife tested positive for Covid-19. According to police, the deceased, identified as Hashmukh Chavda, was a resident of Valkeshwar society in Rajkot city. Chavda and his wife Nirmalaben went for Covid-19 testing on Wednesday morning. Nirmalaben tested positive for Covid-19 so their son Rajendra took her to a doctor for further treatment. Chavda, alone at home during that time, allegedly committed suicide. When Nirmalaben and Rajendra returned home they found him hanging from a ceiling fan. “Chavda’s son Rajendra told police that his father was worried about getting infected with the virus after Nirmalaben tested positive and therefore he ended his life,” police said. Rajendra Chavda works as a goldsmith while his father used to work as a mason. Though the numbers aren’t alarming as of now, a disturbing trend of positive persons developing suicidal tendencies has come to the fore. In last 10 days, at least five Covid-19 patients have ended their lives by committing suicides in different parts of Saurashtra region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-ends-life-after-wife-tests-ve/articleshow/82315381.cms||---
---||Goa||Navy offers Goa help with Covid treatment||PANAJI: Gearing up to assist the state government, the Indian Navy has offered to take in Covid-19 patients who need oxygen support and is simultaneously exploring ways to supply medical oxygen to government-run hospitals in Goa if the need arises. Naval authorities with the Goa Naval Area headquarters said that INHS Jeevanti has earmarked some beds for civilian Covid-19 patients where oxygen can also be provided to patients whose levels drop. “Naval teams at Goa had set up community kitchens during the first wave of Covid-19 and are prepared to provide similar help as and when required. In addition to earmarking some Covid oxygen beds for civilians at INHS Jeevanti, Headquarters Goa Naval Area is exploring provision of oxygen to civil hospitals based on any requests received from the civil administration,” the Indian Navy said in a statement. With Covid-19 cases overwhelming government and private hospitals across the country and oxygen-supported beds for severe cases in short supply, the Indian Navy has decided to open up three naval hospitals under Western Naval Command (WNC) — INHS Jeevanti-Goa, INHS Patanjali-Karwar and INHS Sandhani-Mumbai — for the respective state governments. At Karwar, arrangements to support nearly 1,500 migrant labourers have been made. The labourers will be provided with essential items, rations and basic healthcare. “INHS Patanjali, the first Armed Forces hospital to treat civilian Covid-19 patients last year, is prepared to receive civilian Covid-19 patients if there is any emergent requirement,” the navy said. In Mumbai, facilities have been set up inside naval premises to provide basic amenities so that migrant labourers are not compelled to proceed to their home towns. At present naval hospitals are involved in the vaccination of service personnel and their dependents along with civilians and their dependents who are employed at defence establishments. The Indian Navy is also exploring the feasibility of extending the vaccination facility to the civil population in the vicinity once it vaccinates all its personnel and their relatives who are above 18 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navy-offers-goa-help-with-covid-treatment/articleshow/82317167.cms||---
---||Business||At $16.5 billion, Byju’s to be top desi startup||BENGALURU: A change is on its way in the top order of the most valued Indian startups. Edtech major Byju’s is set to be the most valued startup in India amid the pandemic, toppling SoftBank- and Alibaba-backed Paytm, which is valued at $16 billion. Byju’s is in advanced stages of talks to raise another $150-200 million from UBS Group, after which it is expected to be valued at around $16.5 billion, a person aware of the matter said. The cheque size could change. This is on top of the $1-billion funding it is currently closing at a valuation of over $15 billion from a clutch of new and existing investors. Byju’s had raised $1 billion in capital last year. The current discussions suggest the pace of fund-raising has increased sharply. Byju’s hasn’t made any official announcements as yet on these discussions. It has been using its capital to make multiple acquisitions, which has triggered consolidation in the education sector — both online and offline. “Byju’s would be the top ranked startup in India in the next few weeks. It is finalising some of the contours of the current deal,” the person quoted earlier said. Meanwhile, Byju’s has also sought Competition Commission of India’s (CCI’s) nod for its nearly $1-billion deal to acquire coaching network Aakash Institute, which was announced earlier this month. Edtech startups have been a direct beneficiary of the pandemic, attracting most of the new capital being pumped in by investors, besides sectors like digital payments and e-commerce. The second wave of Covid, which has battered India, is expected to further fuel the demand for online education. Byju’s was last officially valued at $11 billion based on the announcements it has made, but there have been fast-paced changes in the past seven months. Besides Aakash Institute, it has acquired WhiteHat Jr and US-based Osmo. TOI has reported that it is also acquiring rival Toppr. Reports indicate it is aiming to buy multiple other startups, both in India and abroad. It has also started expanding aggressively outside India. A Byju’s spokesperson declined to comment on the latest fund-raising. An email sent to UBS Group did not immediately elicit any response. Byju Raveendran, co-founder of Byju’s, recently told TOI its revenue grew by 100% in the financial year ended March 2021. This would translate into a revenue of around Rs 5,600 crore, compared to Rs 2,800 crore in the previous year. Byju’s said it has a cumulative base of over 80 million students, with 5.5 million being annual paid subscribers. It says its annual renewal rate is 86% and that it added 45 million new students in the first six months of the lockdown last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/at-16-5-billion-byjus-to-be-top-desi-startup/articleshow/82319693.cms||Digbijay Mishra

However, families/guardians must be advised to follow all safety norms in handling of the body and its last rites as prescribed by ministry of health and family welfare,” North Goa collector Ajit Roy said in his circular. Subsequently, dean of GMC S M Bandekar issued a circular authorising doctors to hand over the Covid bodies to the kin without asking for the SDM’s permission. “Deceased’s relatives claiming the body have to pay the preservation fees and obtain the free 108 hearse van service,” the circular stated. The South Goa district hospital has also effected the change in the Covid funeral SOPs with immediate effect. “All required formalities will be completed by the forensic medicine department of the South Goa District Hospital itself and there is no need for family members to visit the SDM’s office for permission to claim the body,” Dr Madhu Ghodkirekar, in-charge, forensic department, South Goa district hospital, told TOI. Ghodkirekar said that the South Goa Collectorate has arranged two hearse vans, free of cost. Four PPE kits are also provided by the South Goa administration to the kin for performing final rites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-need-for-govt-nod-to-claim-bodies/articleshow/82317190.cms||---

Companies that have announced closures include Toyota, Maruti Suzuki, Hero Moto and Honda Motorcycles and Scooter India (HMSI), while those that have reduced output are understood to include Havells, Nippon Paints, Panasonic, Mercedes-Benz, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), LG (Pune factory) and Tata Motors. With fears around the spread of the virus remaining supreme, it is believed that situation on the production front will remain challenging, especially as activity of suppliers’ and raw material vendors has also been hit. Many companies have advanced their factory maintenance shutdowns as they wait and watch the situation. HMSI has said that it is halting production across all four plants (Haryana, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Gujarat) from May 1 for 15 days. “Honda will utilise this temporary production halt for advancing its annual plant maintenance activities,” the company said. Anil Rai Gupta, chairman of Havells that also runs the Lloyd’s brand, said the company is reducing production across factories. “Markets are closing down and demand is less. We have seen demand go down by 20-30%. So, we are cutting down production,” Gupta told TOI. Sharad Malhotra, president (automotive refinishes and wood coatings) at Nippon Paint India said volume is already down by 40% and there is uncertainty. “Semi-automated setups that depend on manpower, such as ours, are facing a double whammy as worker availability is down by 30-40%,” Malhotra said. Hero Moto has also announced a “temporary suspension” as a precautionary measure. “Hero Moto has decided to halt operations temporarily at all manufacturing facilities,” the company — which will also carry out maintenance — said, adding, demand has been impacted by localised shutdowns in many states. Toyota has also stopped production at factories in Karnataka, and is utilising the period for maintenance and enhancing Covid protection measures. Rajeshwar Tripathi, chief HR Officer at M&M, said in accordance with the ‘Break the Chain’ guidelines shared by the Maharashtra government, its plants are operational with lower levels of manning and are following strict adherence to social distancing, hygiene protocols and safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/companies-shut-plants-cut-output-to-cope-with-fall-in-demand/articleshow/82319700.cms||Pankaj Doval

Assocham along with other national and regional organisations have urged the Centre to extend the deadline for statutory filings in view of the surge in cases and the economic slowdown brought about by the pandemic in the first month of 2021-22. “Every month MSMEs have to make statutory payments to the governments irrespective of whether the MSME does business or gets its payment,” said Raiker. “Solid penalties are levied if an MSME misses the date. The government has to rationalise and make necessary suitable changes by not adhering to the existing time schedules.” Raiker said that there are over 63 crore MSMEs registered across India of which 11-12% have most likely closed while another 10% are struggling to stay afloat. “Almost 50% of the MSME units are struggling because of the second wave,” Raiker said. He also said that MSMEs are struggling with statutory renewals and routine government inspections. Despite most of the licencing process and renewals being shifted online, certain states, particularly Goa, continue to create hurdles for industrial units and MSMEs that try to renew their licences. “We are in April and all licences are coming up for renewals. Once the MSME applies for renewal online, the authorities have to come for inspection. The inspector does not upload the inspection report and then they harass the entrepreneur. Renewals should be granted without an inspection because of the pandemic,” said Raiker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/assocham-msme-chairman-urges-centre-to-relax-norms-in-view-of-second-wave/articleshow/82317197.cms||Newton Sequeira

To ensure that their own economy and that of the daily wage labourers is not hit, boat owners have appealed to chief minister Pramod Sawant to ensure that fishing boat operations are not suspended till the season ends on May 31. “The fishing season should come to an end on May 31 as usual. We have made a verbal appeal to the CM on this and he has assured us that the fishing activity will continue. We cannot afford to have a total lockdown because we have workers that have a hand-to-mouth existence who will starve if operations are suspended,” said Harshad Dhond, president of all Goa purse seine boat owners’ association and director of Mandovi fishermen cooperative society.  He said that till now, there is no panic among workers at the Malim jetty because fishing operations come under essential services. The problem will occur only if the market is shut. Savio D’Silva, president of Cutbona Boat Owners Union, said that operations at the Cutbona jetty will continue till May 31. “Trawler boat owners and our workers will not be affected by the three-day lockdown,” he said. “The lockdown is necessary for Goa and our workers usually restrict themselves to the jetty itself. The migrant labourers are our responsibility, but the government must be prepared for the worst-case scenario,” said Jose Philip Dsouza, president of the Goa fishing boat owners’ association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/let-fishing-ops-continue-till-end-of-season-boat-owners/articleshow/82317206.cms||---

According to Kumar, if the country can grow at 10-11% per year for the next few decades, the per capita income would be $16,000 by 2050. He said that to achieve the potential growth rate, India will have to fulfil five major conditions. Coronavirus: Live updatesFirst, India must raise its rate of investment from below 30% of GDP to 35-40% of GDP. Second, India must increase exports as a share of GDP. Third, share of manufacturing in GDP must increase. “For that, manufacturing cannot remain small scale and, instead, it must emerge to be globally competitive,” he said. In this regard, he mentioned that the government has allocated Rs 1.95 lakh crore to 13 sectors. Fourth, India needs to modernise its agriculture. “Currently, our water usage is too high, yields are too low and stocks are so expensive that they cannot be sold. Given fragmented land holdings, industrial farming is not an option for India and therefore, the country should engage in organic farming,” Kumar said. Lastly, “the government will continue to remove regulatory hurdles for ease of doing business, and the private sector must demonstrate self-regulation to evolve as a responsible growth partner”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vaccination-for-50-people-key-to-eco-revival-niti-aayog/articleshow/82319706.cms||---

Pathak was booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code including 186 (obstructing any public servant in the discharge of his public functions).Gohil alleged that Pathak had accompanied one Jagdish Saatola, relative of a 60-year-old woman with hearing difficulty who was admitted to the Rajkot civil hospital two weeks ago. Saatola had been unable to locate the woman at the civil hospital since last 3-4 days. This was because she was shifted to Covid care centre after her health improved. However, Saatola was not informed of this by the staff at the civil hospital.On Wednesday, when Saatola came to receive the woman, he was told that due to some miscommunication his kin could not be traced. But now she was cured of Covid-19 infection and was being discharged.However, Patakha who had accompanied Saatola, started shouting at Gohil who was present at the Covid care centre and accused him and other government officials of harassment. Pathak also allegedly abused the officers and threatened them. Gohil tried to pacify him, but Pathak did not stop the abuses.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra sets up 1,451 centres for Inter exams||AMARAVATI: Determined to go ahead with the conduct of intermediate examinations, the state government has clarified that AP is not the only state that is conducting class XII examinations across the country. Education minister Dr Adimulapu Suresh said no state in the country has suspended intermediate examinations. He said the government has set up 1,451 centres to conduct intermediate examinations across the state. Speaking to the media here on Thursday, the minister said that they have set up 41 more centres compared to last year. “We are taking all precautions including sanitation and social distance in examination halls. The students and examiners should attend the exams with masks,” said the minister. He said the students could start downloading hall tickets from Thursday evening. The exams are slated to begin on May, 5. The minister said that the government decided to conduct the examinations keeping in view of the future of students. He said there was no need for the students or their parents to worry about the situation in the examination halls. He asked the positive tested students not to appear the exams. He assured that the government will again conduct exams exclusively for such students and issue regular exam certificates. He said that the results of such students will not be declared as supplementary exams but treated as regular exams. East Godavari district with 146 centres would be having the most and Guntur with 60, the lowest. The minister said the government has appointed a Covid-19 special officer to every district. He said special officers would ensure Covid-19 protocols at all exam centres. The minister said that they would sanitise all centres till the completion of the examinations on May 19. He said that they have also set up thermal scanners in all centres to check temperature of students and teachers. He said the students with abnormal temperature would be given seating in separate room while invigilators with high temperature will be withdrawn from duty. Dr Suresh said that they have set up separate isolation rooms in all the examination centres to facilitate the smooth conduct of the examinations. He said opposition leaders were making false campaign demanding cancellation of the examinations without any responsibility. Meanwhile, social media is abuzz with demands from parents and students to suspend the examinations. Many parents expressed apprehensions about safety in allowing their children to travel in APRTC buses to reach examination centres. “The government has made the conduct of intermediate examinations a prestige issue because TDP has called for cancellation. It should take fears of parents and students into consideration,” said Ram Makireddy, a parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/andhra-sets-up-1451-centres-for-inter-exams/articleshow/82315839.cms||Samdani MN
---||Bhopal||3 MP villages pool money, set up DIY Covid hospitals||BHOPAL: With many hospitals in MP nearly out of oxygen equipped beds, at least three villages in Maoist-hit Balaghat district have turned self-reliant and pooled money to convert existing hostels into Covid care centres, complete with vital oxygen supply. The villagers have purchased oxygen concentrators and are admitting patients. Government doctors have begun visiting these facilities twice a day. Local MLAs and administrative officers have extended their support to these ‘DIY hospitals’, and more villages in the surroundings are following in their footsteps. The first hospital came up a couple of weeks ago in Lalbarra tehsil after a small-time businessman had a hard time getting proper treatment for his daughter. In the tight-knit community, his anguish touched others and the idea took hold they could set up a hospital on their own. They started pooling money. It took villagers a month to get centre up & runningA local doctor named Arun Lange joined the effort. Word spread quickly and MLA Gauri Shankar Bisen contributed five oxygen concentrators. It took them nearly a month to start the Covid centre. Now, it’s running full steam, with patients getting food and medicines from the collected money, say sources. District collector Deepak Arya said: “The effort of people of Lalbarra is laudable. Now, people in Waraseoni and Lanji have raised money to start their own Covid centres.” “Lalbarra bought oxygen concentrators. Our doctor, Ritwik Patel, has led all the campaigns. He has pooled resources from government and private sector to convert hostels into Covid-care centres,” said the collector. Balaghat has reported 37 Covid deaths and there are nearly 1,200 active cases, over 70% of them in home isolation. About 230 patients are on oxygen support and 15 in ICU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/3-mp-villages-pool-money-set-up-diy-covid-hospitals/articleshow/82319720.cms||P Naveen
---||Nagpur||Move to relocate Jamni deer to Botezari opposed||Nagpur: Even as work on translocating 100 deer from Jamni in Tadoba range to Botezari in Kolsa range is in full swing, wildlife experts have questioned the move by the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). TOI on April 26 had reported TATR plan to shift 100 deer to Botezari area to augment prey base in Kolsa range. The PCCF (wildlife) has granted permission to shift the deer by capturing them by Boma method (enclosure where animals are herded naturally). The permit to capture and release the deer is valid up to August 2021. Now, former Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel has written to TATR field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar demanding the project be scrapped. Patel said, “There is history of chital presence at Botezari meadows. Where has this population disappeared? With poaching pressure from villages like Kolsa and Rantalodi, the relocated deer will not be safe. Are you releasing them for miscreants from these villages?” “Last summer, attempts to translocate 50 deer from Jamni to Botezari without permission of chief wildlife warden proved futile and many animals died. There is a need to strengthen corridor links between meadows by proper management measure through mini food and water provisions link,” said Patel. Wildlife conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar in a written statement also made the same demand. “Botezari was well-stocked with deer even before the village was shifted. The area losing its population even after adding village area and meadows to the wild is questionable,” he said. “Amazingly, the capture area of Jamni is famous for tigers, leopards, and other carnivores that have spotted deer as main prey. The current population of deer in Jamni is not an ecological burden or risk to the habitat. Then why the need to remove them from their habitat,” asked Bhamburkar. The conservationist asked if present herbivore number is insufficient in Botezari, then how have predators sustained here for long periods. The shifted elephant camp must be used to protect the said area that will help the deer population flourish naturally once again, he said. Even state wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre agrees. “TATR has sufficient prey base. As per the WII study in 2019 on ‘Status of tigers, co-predators, and prey in Tadoba’, chital density in the core area is 8.21 per sqkm followed by sambar (6.22), gaur (2.19), wild boar (3.92). Even if a certain area lacks prey population, a study needs to be done for reasons thereof and a plan should be prepared on how we can improve prey base in such areas. The way it is being done in Tadoba will cause heavy casualties. We should focus on relocation of villages instead,” he said. Retired DFO Deepak Chondekar, who was RFO Kolsa in 2008, too opposed the move. “Without a scientific study, how can you say deer needs to be shifted as there is no prey base in Botezari? When I used to do night patrolling then, we could see hundreds of deer in the Botezari meadows. There are sambars and gaurs too in Kolsa range. Efforts should be made to expedite the relocation of villages from there,” he said. “Research theory regarding animal life cycle and their existence is always not as per the thumb rules. The home range theory has always been changed due to many biotic factors. For example, the chital population in Koradi thermal power station had to migrate to Nara forest depot towards Nagpur due to the construction of a mega power plant. Even Nagzira-Navegaon corridor has same migration features,” said Bhamburkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/move-to-relocate-jamni-deer-to-botezari-opposed/articleshow/82316900.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

At 5,042, Gurugram added almost 1,000 more cases than Mumbai, which registered 4,174 new infections on Thursday. An even bigger concern for the NCR city was the daily positivity rate, which climbed to 41% with a little over 12,000 tests conducted, the highest so far. The positivity rate translated into one in less than three persons being tested having the SARS-CoV-2 infection, underlining the urgent need to step up both tests and cluster containment exercises. For the first time, the city also saw the number of Covid patients recovering in home isolation cross the 30,000 mark. It now has 33,893 active cases, which is about a fourth of the overall infection count of 1.18 lakh. To put the current surge in cases in perspective, Gurugram’s active cases are about 50% that of Mumbai’s (67,255). There is a large population difference between the densely inhabited Maharashtra capital and Gurugram, which is among India’s newest cities. According to the health bulletin, a total of 32,873 patients are in home isolation in Gurugram at present, while 2,221 are in hospitals (severe cases), 720 in Covid care centres (moderate cases) and 220 in district Covid care centres (mild cases). Nine Covid deaths were reported on Thursday, taking the overall toll to 462. The health department said 2,259 patients recuperated on the day, taking the total number of recoveries to 84,144. The recovery rate stands at 72%. Residents with Covid patients in their families, meanwhile, continued the scramble for hospital beds. According to government data, no ICU or ventilator bed was available at 8pm on Thursday. Gurugram’s medical infrastructure is under immense strain at present, with more than 3,500 fresh cases being added on an average daily in the past few days. The health department said over 1,000 cases reported on Thursday were actually backlog. “We had to include Wednesday’s backlog cases in Thursday’s bulletin as several cases were not declared the previous day because of technical issues,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. He added, “Our biggest worry at present is patients who are in home isolation. They need immense care as our health infrastructure is overstretched and we can’t let their condition become critical. We are advising these patients to consult our teams for any medical help.” The health department has already started conducting rapid antigen tests in the 91 large outbreak areas identified in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-hits-covid-peak-of-5k-records-nearly-1k-more-cases-than-mumbai/articleshow/82317498.cms||Ipsita Pati

He said drainage water should be diverted only into the sewage treatment plants. “We should also focus on disposal of solid waste. We should not allow solid waste to be set on fire anywhere in civic bodies. There must be scientific methods for disposal of garbage,” said the chief minister. He directed the officials to provide uniforms, gloves, shoes and goats to all sanitation workers. He asked the officials to provide additional sets of uniforms to workers for effective management of the dress code. He said there should not be any service deficiency in taking up the sanitation programme. He asked the officials to take up aggressive campaign to involve people in sanitation activities. He said every citizen should think about cleanliness of their village or town. He said the municipal administration department should work in tandem with the panchayat raj department. He said that any programme will be successful only when it was taken up with seriousness and dedication. He asked the officials to show their mark on the sanitation programme. The officials said they were launching a 100-day special sanitation programme from May 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/drinking-water-for-all-under-jal-jeevan-mission-says-cm/articleshow/82320708.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh govt to open new liquor outlets||VIJAYAWADA: The state government has decided to open new liquor outlets in entities such as ports, industries, and special economic zones (SEZs). In a communication sent to depot managers across the state, the commissioner of distilleries & breweries and MD of AP State Breweries Corporation Ltd (APSBCL) directed them to identify suitable locations like unviable shops in ports, industrial areas and SEZs like Sri City and Brandix to set up the liquor outlets and submit proposals for necessary approvals and licences. The new outlets will be opened either as tourism outlets or directly under the management of APSBCL like other existing retail liquor outlets in the state. The YSRC government, in its election manifesto, has said that complete liquor prohibition would be implemented in a phased manner in the state over a period of five years. After coming to power, the government reduced the number of retail liquor outlets by 33 per cent in two phases. The decision to reduce the number of bars was challenged in the high court. Later, the government renewed all bar licences after the new liquor policy came into force. The latest decision to open new liquor outlets again runs contrary to its policy. The commissioner’s communication does not mention the number of outlets to be opened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-govt-to-open-new-liquor-outlets/articleshow/82315949.cms||---

The hospital is at present treating only 38 patients because it does not have enough oxygen or infrastructure to admit any more. Of the 100 beds it’s supposed to have, only 60 are operational. But since there is no oxygen support to go beyond 38 patients, the 22 other beds are lying unused at a time when hospitals are overwhelmed and Covid patients are waiting days but are still unable to get admissions. Despite being a designated Covid facility for a year now, SGT does not have a tank to store liquid oxygen for patients’ medical needs and is running on cylinders. On Thursday morning, it had a scare as the stocks came alarmingly close to running out before they got replenished, a nerve-wracking experience that hospitals big and small have been going through every day in the city as medical oxygen’s supply struggles to keep pace with demand. The nodal officer for SGT, Bijender Sindhu, said, “We cannot admit more people as oxygen cylinder supply is irregular. Yes, 22 beds are vacant but there is no oxygen supply and thus admitting Covid patients will create more burden. The district administration has been informed of the situation.” According to the hospital, a liquid oxygen tank is under construction and it is working to increase the number of beds for Covid patients as well. “The work to upgrade infrastructure is going on,” said Sindhu. The Haryana government recently announced a capacity expansion of SGT to 500 so that more Covid patients are able to get hospital access but the hospital appears to be quite a distance away from providing any immediate relief. Relatives and acquaintances of Covid patients alleged they were asked to shift the patients from SGT on Thursday morning when the hospital ran low on oxygen. Sanjeev Singh tweeted, “No oxygen since morning at SGT hospital Gurugram, patients have been asked to take discharge (sic).” Another tweet from Pankaj Sikka said, “SGT Hospital Gurugram has run out of O2 & is asking to take patients away, can you please help to supply oxygen to the hospital (sic).” The hospital’s medical superintendent, Umesh Lamba, told TOI the hospital was indeed facing an oxygen crisis but refused to answer any other queries, stating he was on leave. SGT director Brig Chander Mohan did not respond to requests for a comment. The district administration confirmed that the hospital does not have 100 beds and is not admitting as many patients as it should because it doesn’t have a liquid oxygen storage tank in place. “They do not have an oxygen tank at present and they are still not able to increase bed capacity. We have held meetings with the management several times, but it has yielded no results yet. We have been providing them oxygen cylinders on time,” said deputy commissioner Yash Garg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/hospital-where-government-wants-500-beds-can-only-admit-up-to-38-patients/articleshow/82317543.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Vijayawada||HC allows ACB to continue probing TDP leader Narendra||VIJAYAWADA: Senior TDP leader Dhulipalla Narendra, who was arrested by Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) for alleged misappropriation of government assets, did not get any relief from the Andhra Pradesh high court as the petition filed by him challenging the ACB court’s order to send him to judicial remand was dismissed. In another petition filed to quash the case registered against him by the ACB, the high court asked to file a counter affidavit explaining as how, Narendra and others benefitted from the alleged transfer of government land. The high court allowed the ACB to continue its investigation. Narendra was arrested by the ACB on the allegations of misappropriation of 10 acres of government land. The land originally belonged to Guntur District Milk Producers Union Limited, in which the state government was one of the stakeholders by way of infusing share capital for its development. After the union converted to a Mutually Aided Society, the land was transferred to a trust managed by Narendra’s family members. The society later turned into a producer company under the name Sangam Dairy under Companies Act and Narendra was acting as a chairman of the company. The state government argued that at the time of formation of Mutually Aided Society, the share capital of the government was refunded but the assets of the union were not declared in which it has proportionate share. The transfer of land to a trust was done illegally by concealing information because of which Narendra benefited and the government incurred loss. Narendra, on the other hand, argued that entire process was done according to norms and the same issue which is being now raised was challenged earlier in the courts and the Supreme Court also ruled in his favour. He argued that he was not holding any position at the time of the land transfer and he did not gain anything personally out of it. Justice R Raghunandan Rao, who heard the matters, had reserved the judgement earlier. On Thursday he pronounced orders by dismissing the petition challenging the judicial remand and allowing the ACB to continue the investigation but asked to file a counter as to how Narendra benefited from land transfer. Further hearing of the matter has been posted to May 5. On the other hand, the ACB moved a petition before the special court seeking police custody of Narendra and separate bail petitions have been moved by the accused. The ACB special court likely to hear the petitions on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-allows-acb-to-continue-probing-narendra/articleshow/82316030.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Nagpur||Covid reaches Tadoba doorstep, villagers complacent on tests, vaccines||NAGPUR: Even as the second wave of Covid-19 has reached Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve’s (TATR) doorstep, villagers living on the fringes of the park seems to be complacent, are reluctant to get vaccinated and even conduct RT-PCR tests even if symptoms show up. The casual approach of the people may affect tourism as most of them are dependent on the buffer and core tourism with jobs in resorts, guides, gypsy drivers etc. If tests and vaccination of locals is not done extensively there are chances of coronavirus spread. Most of the such villages fall in Bhadravati and Chimur tehsils. TOI talked to several stakeholders and doctors who admit that there is fear in the minds of people that vaccination may result in complications and even death. Dr Ashwin Aghade, paediatrician & nodal officer in Chimur, admits, “The situation is going from bad to worse. There are over 800 active cases and only 200 beds in Chimur Covid care centre (CCC) with no ventilator beds. Barring 15, all villages have positive cases in the tehsil.” Dr Aghade adds, “We are a staff of 4 medical officers and 8 nurses catering to 265 gram panchayats at our sub-district hospital. There are 6 PHCs but Covid patients are not treated here due to lack of facilities. We have only 45 oxygen cylinders. The response of people to vaccination is poor even though over 6,000 have got vaccinated.” There is even a mismatch of Covid cases. As per the nodal officer, Kolara, the nearest village near Tadoba, has reported 24 active cases but gram panchayat member Vinod Uikey says eight people have tested positive for Covid. “Villagers are reluctant to do RT-PCR tests fearing that they will turn positive, have to get admitted and get no treatment. Of the 1,850 residents of Kolara, only 12 have taken the vaccines. Though awareness is being spread about vaccination, people fear it will create complications and lead to death,” said Uikey. Satara-Bamangaon deputy sarpanch Gajanan Gudadhe said, “People are relying on ayurvedic medicines and preferring home quarantine. There are 10 positive cases in one family. The fact came to light only when one of the family members died due to Covid. The number of positives may be more in villages but no RT-PCR tests are done even if people show signs. They are also not ready to take the vaccine. We are spreading awareness on vaccination by convincing people and displaying banners.” Madnapur village, 5km from Kolara, has seen 400 of 1200 residents getting vaccinated. “Our people walked 5km to take the vaccine at Masal PHC. Though there are not many positive cases, we don’t know how many people are affected as tests are not done,” said sarpanch Pooja Randaye. Even Mohurli sarpanch Sunita Katkar admits there are many misconceptions about RT-PCR tests and getting vaccinated. “We have to literally fight with the people to take the vaccine. Of the 1,800 here, only 200 have taken vaccine in camps that too after threatening them with action. People are complacent and not all wear masks,” she said. Katkar admits that health infrastructure has completely collapsed. “In the first wave, government vehicles used to ferry the positive. Now they ask us to bring them to the centre for admission. For entire Mohurli there is one oximeter. The fear of death after taking vaccine has derailed the drive,” she said. On pandemic-hit villages close to the forest affecting animals, zoonoses disease expert Dr Ajay Poharkar says, “Though there is a regular interface of people with wildlife around Tadoba and both animals and people are prone to mutation, We can’t say without a scientific study how far it will affect wild animals.” TATR field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar admits there is a need for a massive vaccination drive in villages in Mul, Bhadravati and Chimur tehsils surrounding Tadoba. “We will take special efforts to spread awareness by forest staff on vaccination in these villages. It is true that vaccination is low.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-reaches-tadoba-doorstep-villagers-complacent-on-tests-vax/articleshow/82316116.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Final exam results of Class 9 and 11 in government schools of Madhya Pradesh, which were supposed to be declared on April 30, will be declared on May 15. School education department issued orders on Wednesday. Notably, for the first time, like class 10 and 12 the results of class 9 and 11 exams will also be available online. Officials said that the school education department is working with only 10% staff after state government orders due to which the results preparation has affected. As the results are to be prepared on the basis of test and half-yearly examination the staff requires more time to complete the task. Incidentally, MP school education department has cancelled the final exams of classes 9 and 11. The exams have been cancelled for the government schools affiliated to the MP board. Issuing the notification department said that the result will be declared on the basis of the revision test taken in November and the half-yearly examination held in February. Exams that have better marks will be considered. The school education department issued an order earlier this month that the final exams of classes 9 and 11 will be on the basis of the open book system. However, the department later revised its order and stated that there would be no final exams. The new order had stated that the result of both classes will be calculated on the basis of best-5. If a student has passed 5 out of 6 subjects and even a minimum of 33 marks is not 1 subject then also, he will be declared a pass. Similarly, for students who do not get minimum passing marks in more than one subject, a maximum of 10 grace marks can be given. However, these marks can also be given in more than one subject if it is required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-class-9-11-results-will-be-declared-online-on-may-15/articleshow/82319754.cms||---

According to a kin, Dabhalkar came here on April 22 and soon left to make way for a much younger patient whose relatives were desperately pleading for a bed. On Thursday afternoon when TOI visited IGR there was no rush. Rather the hospital had vacant beds. Out of a total capacity of 92 beds, only 86 were occupied at the dedicated Covid wards. There was only one patient at the casualty from where Dabhalkar went away after opting for discharge against medical advice. “The situation has eased since nearly a week. The rush of patients has been gradually declining. Now, finally since two days there are vacant beds in the hospital too,” said Dr Sheelu Chimurkar, the medical superintendent at IGR. “Things are much under control. The stock of oxygen and Remdesivir is enough to manage the show,” she said. IGR, which comes under the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is located near Gandhi Nagar in West Nagpur. “So far we have treated 1,324 patients. There was only one death during the first wave. In the second wave around six patients have died — all in April when there was a huge rush of patients,” said Chimurkar. According to Chimurkar, these patients had come at a critical stage. “IGR does not have facility to admit such cases. As part of the protocol they were supposed to be referred to a higher hospital after being stabilized. However, there was no room in the hospitals those days. The patients died because they could not get advanced treatment in time,” she said. Chimurkar said that IGR only takes patients with moderate symptoms because there are no facilities like ventilator or bi-pap. Oxygen is administered through masks. “Due to this only patients who need oxygen without ventilator are taken. All the patients are checked in the casualty ward. Based on the examination they are referred to hospitals with advanced facilities,” she said. A source said that Dabhalkar’s oxygen level was around 50. Even in the normal course, he was supposed to be referred to an advanced hospital with ventilator and other facilities. He walked out of the hospital before that, as the story goes. “We have completely cured some serious patients also. Doctors and paramedic staff are working without rest. IGR caters to a large area and majority are walk-in patients,” said Chimurkar. Normally, the patients have to stay up to a week or so but some have stayed for as long as one month too, said a doctor. TOI was allowed a quick peep into the Covid ward from a safe distance. Patients were resting with oxygen masks on their face. There were some without it too. A female patient walked on her way towards the washroom as another was seen browsing on his mobile phone. No sign of panic apparently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/igr-sees-gradual-decline-in-rush-beds-vacant-too/articleshow/82316162.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: As firewood becomes free, kin give up eco-friendly methods for last rites||NAGPUR: After Nagpur Municipal Corporation started providing free firewood for cremation of Covid victims, kin of the deceased are seeking firewood instead of using eco-friendly methods for last rites. The eco-friendly methods like LPG and briquettes have always been free. At Ambazari ghat, on April 26, last rites of 23 Covid victims were performed using briquettes. On April 28, the figures were a completely contrast, with 26 of the 29 last rites performed using firewood, said the figures provided by the ghat staffers. “As long as NMC charged Rs 2,530 for firewood, kin preferred eco-friendly cremations and either opted for LPG or briquette,” said an official deputed at Ambazari ghat. On Thursday too, the second day after NMC waived off firewood cost at ghats for Covid bodies, Ambazari ghat felt the pinch. “Last rites of most Covid bodies are being done using firewood,” the official said. Similar reports are coming from other ghats where eco-friendly cremation facilities are available. Mankapur, Gangabai Ghat, Mokshadham, Sahakar Nagar, Manewada and Vaishali Nagar crematoria are also witnessing sudden demand of firewood for performing last rites of Covid bodies. Providing free firewood not only creates pollution but also increases the financial burden on the already cash strapped civic body, said sources. They pointed out NMC is paying Rs 2,000 for 250 kg of briquettes (required for cremation of a body), while it is spending Rs 2,400 for providing free 300 kg firewood. Environmentalists too wondered about NMC’s move to give firewood free of cost for cremation of Covid bodies. Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil Foundation, pointed out that making briquettes from agro waste is a common practice being followed across India, which can replace firewood to a large extent. However, at crematoriums, briquettes did not get much demand due to religious faith involved with firewood. “As it is, due to various development projects, Nagpur is rapidly losing it’s green cover. At this juncture, making firewood free of cost at crematoriums will increase the usage, resulting in more tree felling, impacting adversely the green cover of the region,” Chatterjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-firewood-becomes-free-kin-give-up-eco-friendly-methods-for-last-rites/articleshow/82316211.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The court has also asked the government to crackdown on the black-market of essential medicines required for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. A core committee of high court judges had held a meeting on April 28 and discussed the letter of the association seeking assistance for setting up a hospital on the court campus for its members. The committee referred the matter to the government directing it to take action immediately and will also monitor the progress. Secretary of the advocates’ association Navin Kumar told TOI lawyers have also suffered immensely as have public. “Our only objective is to provide aid to as many as possible in this time of distress,” Kumar said. Meanwhile, a division bench of Chief Justice and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad, while hearing a public interest litigation here on Thursday on the black market of important medicines, ordered the government to take help of CID to monitor the inflow of medicines in the local markets. The bench also suggested policemen in civvies should frequent government and private hospitals in the capital and find out about the illegal trade of medicines as has been reported in some local dailies. The bench sought a report from the Ranchi SSP in the matter.

---||Ranchi||Veggie prices fall in Ranchi as consumers stay indoors||RANCHI: Vegetable markets in Ranchi are witnessing a slump during the ongoing lockdown as growing Covid cases and administrative curbs keep customers confined to their homes. The prices of potatoes, onions, vegetables and other edibles have fallen over the past week as denizens avoid the marketplaces due to the fear of getting infected. Vegetable markets in the city were exempted from the lockdown. However, on Wednesday, the state government directed the markets to close at 2pm. In Lalpur, one of the city’s most crowded markets in normal times, the price of a kilogram of potato has dropped to Rs 18 a kg from Rs 25 before lockdown was initiated on April 22. Onions, which were priced at Rs 30, are now going for Rs 20. In Hinoo market, sellers have slashed the price of cauliflower to Rs 40 per kg. Likewise, the price of pointed gourd has also been slashed to Rs 40. “Before the lockdown, they were priced at Rs 50 per kg,” Janardan Saw, a greengrocer, said. However, the price of tomatoes, which were at Rs 10 per kilo before lockdown, have risen by Rs 5. Besides vegetable sellers, chicken sellers have also slashed their prices. Poultry chicken, priced at Rs 150 per kilo, have fallen by Rs 10. Desi chicken is being sold at Rs 450 per kilogram. Even with prices falling, the sellers are not being able to draw buyers. “The consumers are not turning up for chicken even if they venture out to purchase vegetables. They do not want to wait in open as we cull the chicken and dress it,” Kuldeep Verma, a meat seller in Doranda, said. Many consumers are also asking vegetables to be delivered to their doorstep. “There are a few customers who regularly purchase veggies from me. Since lockdown, they are placing orders over phone and asking them to be delivered at their home,” Rajesh Kumar, a seller from Lalpur market said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/veggie-prices-fall-in-ranchi-as-consumers-stay-indoors/articleshow/82315954.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Anubrata keeps indoors, goes to vote past noon, says ‘bhalo khela holo’||Bolpur/Kolkata: Trinamool Congress’ Birbhum president Anubrata Mondal made a small detour in his usual poll day routine. Instead of casting his vote in the morning, he chose to ride a bike to his booth — Bhagabat Ninya Buniadi Primary School — well past noon, daughter Sukanya in tow. Mondal — under the Election Commission’s “constant watch” — also did not meet reporters, telling them he would speak to them after elections were over. On the two other occasions that he was under EC radar in 2016 and 2019, Mondal had not missed his interaction with journalists. For the man who had made terms such as “charam charam”, “gur batasa”, “nakuldana” and “Khela Hobe” — that became Trinamool’s war cry this election — political currency, this year was largely restricted to operating from indoors. As Trinamool workers returned to the centrally air-conditioned party office at Nichupati in Bolpur by 5.30pm, their beloved ‘Kestoda’ was ready to ask them to start filing their reports. Besides these “aberrations”, Mondal hardly made any change to his poll day schedule. Not only did he stay put at home till noon, making calls to Labhpur, Illambazar, Mayureshwar and Nanoor — all of which reported clashes through the day — he also went to the party office immediately after casting his vote. A large crowd waited outside the booth to catch a glimpse of the man. “Kestoda is popular here. But see how central forces took him away from even the waiting media,” said voter Shaktipada Sen. Despite fears of violence in Birbhum, the day passed off largely peacefully, barring a few stray incidents. Both Trinamool and BJP alleged that their workers were attacked by the other side across the district. BJP’s Bolpur candidate Anirban Ganguly said he was attacked by some miscreants armed with sticks at Illambazar. “Despite threat and attack, we could make safe passage for our supporters who were prevented from going to the booth by TMC goons,” he said. Trinamool’s Bolpur candidate Chandranath Sinha denied the allegation saying locals protested when BJP workers tried to create trouble. Biswajit Mondal, brother of BJP’s Mayureswar candidate Shyamapada Mondal, reportedly suffered a head injury in a clash while Mahadev Singha, a BJP IT cell worker, claimed he was injured at Illambazar. Trinamool’s Sainthia candidate Nilabati Saha alleged that two party workers were injured when central forces resorted to lathicharge. Back at the party office in Bolpur, Mondal looked in command throughout, with none of the WBCS officers deputed to maintain surveillance on him and central forces around. All were apparently waiting outside after being politely told he had no plans to travel during polling. Anubrata said: “Bhalo khela holo (It was a good contest). It was a good opponent. BJP had hired Dhritarashtra (EC) to fight for them.” He later said he was confident of Trinamool retaining office. “I am hopeful of getting all 11 seats in Birbhum. In total, we will get 220-230 seats. The EC and BJP can now go. After all, they spread Covid across Bengal. I have nothing to say against commissioner... Only the commissioner knows why I was kept under observation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/anubrata-keeps-indoors-goes-to-vote-past-noon-says-bhalo-khela-holo/articleshow/82317202.cms||Someswar Boral
---||Kolkata||Sitalkuchi repoll peaceful, clashes rock Birbhum and Murshidabad||Jalpaiguri/Suri/Berhampore: Repolling was largely peaceful on Thursday at booth 126 in Sitalkuchi, where CISF firing had killed four persons on April 10, even though the day witnessed some tense moments as Trinamool Congress candidate Partha Pratim Roy engaged in a verbal duel with a cop. Birbhum — where all the 3,800 polling stations were declared sensitive — had “peaceful polls”, according to district Trinamool president Anubrata Mondal who has been placed under EC vigil till Friday morning. Ground reports and complaints lodged with police suggested otherwise. The car of BJP’s Nanoor candidate Tarakeswar Saha was vandalised early in the morning, allegedly by Trinamool supporters. Anirban Ganguly, BJP’s candidate from Bolpur, was attacked at Illambazar. Both his car and another in his convoy were damaged. While Ganguly blamed “Trinamool goons”, TMC candidate Chandranath Sinha denied the charges. Biswajit Mondal, brother of BJP’s Mayureswar candidate Shyamapada Mondal, sustained head injuries in a clash while Mahadev Singha, a BJP IT cell worker, was injured at Illambazar. Nilabati Saha, Trinamool candidate from Sainthia, claimed two Trinamool workers were injured when central forces lathi-charged. In Murshidabad district, Domkal witnessed violence, including bombing. A 37-year-old CPM worker, Kader Mondal, died in hospital following a road accident on Wednesday night. The CPM has claimed that Trinamool candidate Jafijul Islam’s car hit Kader and two others when they tried to stop him from campaigning. The others are in hospital. Sanjukta Morcha supporters later intercepted and vandalised Islam’s car at Shibnagar, when he went there following booth capture complaints. Mustafijur Rahaman (Rana), the Morcha’s Domkal candidate, said Kader’s family members had lodged an FIR against the Trinamool candidate. Islam rubbished the charges and said: “The CPM, Congress and BJP are framing us.” At Alinagar in Domkal, the house of Sanjukta Morcha polling agent Sabirul Islam was allegedly attacked by Trinamool supporters. He was not allowed to go to the booth. At Mominpur, also in Domkal, Morcha workers allegedly kidnapped a Trinamool agent. There were bombings at Raina. Police later seized 23 socket bombs in two containers. TMC and Congress supporters clashed at Hosseinpur in Hariharpara, Murshidabad. Two houses and five vehicles were damaged. In Ghoshpara, Raipara and Rajapur in Jalangi, which are close to the Bangladesh border, Trinamool supporters allegedly attacked CPM workers. Five were injured. ADG (law and order) Jag Mohan, however, denied any incident of bombing in Birbhum, Malda and Murshidabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sitalkuchi-repoll-peaceful-clashes-rock-birbhum-and-murshidabad/articleshow/82317462.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Trinamool confident of a ‘comfortable majority’||Kolkata: The Trinamool Congress said on Thursday that it would win the Bengal polls with a comfortable majority and Mamata Banerjee would take office for a third term. “The Trinamool is winning Bengal. Mamata Banerjee will be CM for the third time. Despite trying every filthy trick, the BJP-EC alliance will lose,” TMC Rajya Sabha MP and spokesperson Derek O’Brien said, without making any direct comment on the exit polls and adding that “a Union minister” was set to lose from Kolkata. CM Banerjee, leaders said, was likely to meet all candidates and their election agents virtually at 3pm on Friday, two days before the May 2 counting. “The protracted and controversial Bihar counting is a factor,” a party senior said. This meeting was originally slated for Saturday but was brought ahead by a day because of the EC’s stringent Covid-safety protocols, Trinamool leaders said, explaining that they were “not going to leave anything to chance”. The Bengal CM has repeatedly instructed candidates and their poll agents to remain focused till the last vote is counted, “given the tricks that the BJP uses after the vote”. Leaders took comfort from the fact that both 2011 and 2016 exit polls had given fewer seats to the Trinamool than it actually won. “I believe our party will get more (than what the exit polls say) and the BJP will get less. But, irrespective of the numbers, all opinion polls nullify the 200-plus-seats lie repeated by PM Narendra Modi. He held 21 election meetings in Bengal, union home minister Amit Shah made Bengal his second home and the EC played a very partisan role,” Trinamool MP Saugata Roy said. Other Trinamool seniors said they were confident that the two biggest pre-poll defectors from the Trinamool to the BJP — former ministers Suvendu Adhikari and Rajib Banerjee — were set to lose from Nandigram and Domjur, respectively. They stuck to the “internal assessment of at least 175-180 seats for the Trinamool”; the BJP would get around 100 seats, they added. “The party has been making its own assessment after every phase. We were close to the half-way mark before the last two phases of polling. And, in these two phases, Trinamool strongholds went to vote amid a growing public anger against the centre’s handling of the Covid situation,” another party senior said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trinamool-confident-of-a-comfortable-majority/articleshow/82318045.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Bokaro General Hospital not sharing data on Cov deaths, says IDSP; hosp denies||BOKARO: The district’s biggest Covid hospital, Bokaro General Hospital (BGH), is not reporting the death toll of patients to the IDSP section of the district health department, officials in the administration said expressing concern. From April 25 to April 28, BGH has not sent the report of deaths to the IDSP. Bokaro civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak said, “We are looking into this matter.” According to sources, district health department had given BGH a format to provide information related to Covid deaths but BGH management is taking it lightly. Bokaro deputy commissioner Rajesh Singh said, “The district administration will look into the matter and ask BGH to provide actual information of deaths of patients to the IDSP.” “As BGH is not sending information about the death of Covid patients, the correct information about the deaths in the district is not uploaded in the government portal,” said a source. However, Spokesperson of Bokaro Steel Limited, which runs BGH, Manikant Dhan said, “Data and information regarding status of Covid patients in BGH is being provided to the IDSP on a daily basis, including data on death of patients. BGH is not hiding any information.” The district health department has reported nine deaths from April 25 to April 28. This doesn’t include data of the BGH, which has almost 220 covid patients admitted for treatment. When district health department queried BGH management on Wednesday, they sent a report of April 27 and April 28 on Thursday but not of April 25 and 26. The IDSP staff also raised concerns against delay in sending of death reports. Sources alleged BGH was under reporting number of deaths especially on days when the figures are higher. Meanwhile, rising number of deaths in the districts is corroborated by the fact that the burning ghat in Chas is now facing crisis of wood for cremation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bgh-not-sharing-data-on-cov-deaths-says-idsp-hosp-denies/articleshow/82315998.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Exit polls are unreliable, wait for two more days: BJP||KOLKATA: The Bengal BJP chose not to read much into the exit poll predictions, saying huge turnouts in Bengal’s hinterland — despite Covid — indicated that people had decisively voted for a change. “Wait for two more days,” said Bengal BJP general sec-retary Sayantan Basu. “When you get to see the results, you will see BJP has won Bengal with a comfortable majority,” he added. State BJP leaders also said that various exit polls differed by over 50 when it came to the seat count; that meant that the “margin of error” was beyond the 10%-15% mark, and therefore unreliable for basing any decisions on. “BJP will win with a comfortable majority,” said Sisir Bajoria, the party spokesperson, adding, “I would not read much into the exit poll results, as between the highest seats given to the BJP to the lowest (by the various agencies conducting the polls), the gap is huge. It shows the fallacy of these polls. In a state where the demography is so varied, a small sample size can never give a right prediction.” Did Covid have any impact? “This had impacted both BJP and Trinamool Congress,” he answered, adding, “The high turnout despite Covid in Bengal’s hinterland is an indication that people have decisively voted for change.” The Bengal BJP also said the high voter turnout in rural Bengal indicated a strong anti-incumbency factor, which would “singe Trinamool Congress”. The party also did not agree to suggestions that the Covid surge would undermine the party’s prospects. “The Covid impact was felt after the sixth phase,” a senior leader said, arguing, “If the issue of insufficient oxygen, vaccines and medicines was levelled against the BJP by the Trinamool Congress, the TMC also had a lot to answer on the acute bed scarcity and patient refusal in Bengal — a reason why Mamata Banerjee had to refer to the steps taken by the state government in every election meeting.” The leader also felt that “undercurrents of a sentiment against the BJP were also primarily an urban problem, and the bulk of urban Bengal — barring Kolkata — had voted before the problem became an acute crisis, when Covid wasn’t an issue in rural Bengal.” Bajoria played down the very premise of such polls. “Why would you expect someone who has just voted to tell an unknown person for whom they voted? All the more, if they have voted against the party in office. Therefore, these poll outcomes are misleading,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/exit-polls-are-unreliable-wait-for-2-more-days-bjp/articleshow/82318059.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Trinamool, BJP seek clarity on EC advisory for May 2||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress and BJP have sought clarification from the Election Commission on its May 2 Covid advisory that makes RT-PCR/RAT tests mandatory before candidates and their agents can enter counting halls. The parties have raised questions in their memorandums submitted to chief electoral officer (CEO) of Bengal Aariz Aftab. Trinamool leader Subrata Mukherjee has asked why the EC guidelines don’t mention protocol for the 24,000-plus central force personnel who will guard these counting halls. He asked if they should wear PPE or furnish Covid-negative reports. The EC advisory is also silent on its own officials taking the RT-PCR test, he said. Mukherjee has also suggested that postal ballots be counted before EVMs. The BJP has, on the other hand, sought clarification on how the district electoral officers (DEOs) will organise testing a day in advance and if candidates and agents can get their tests done at any authorised centre. CEO Aftab said all DEOs had received directives on how to go ahead with Covid test for candidates and counting agents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trinamool-bjp-seek-clarity-on-ec-advisory-for-may-2/articleshow/82317281.cms||---

He admitted he is not fully satisfied with the Karnataka government’s measures to tackle the situation but claimed the Centre has been doing its best to ensure lives are saved. He said the BS Yediyurappa government needs to take additional measures to curb the spread of infections and also provide facilities like beds and oxygen to those who are affected. “Congress has to stop criticising the saffron party in these difficult times and help us fight the pandemic,” Ravi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/polls-one-of-the-reasons-for-2nd-wave-bjp-national-general-secretary-ravi/articleshow/82319770.cms||Darshan B H

Agreeing to hear a plea filed by 28 prisoners of Central Jail, Agra seeking direction to the state government to release them, a bench of Justices Navin Sinha and Krishna Murari asked the petitioners’ advocate Rishi Malhotra to serve the petition copy to the standing counsel of Uttar Pradesh government. The bench, at the outset, said many similar petitions were being filed in the Supreme Court by prisoners for their release and there is a virtual “deluge” of such petitions being filed from one state (Uttar Pradesh). As the apex court had earlier allowed some prisoners to come out of jail on bail during the pendency of their application, many similarly placed life convicts who have spent over 20 years in jail have approached the court for relief. Referring to the previous orders in which the court passed order in favour of life convicts in more than two dozen of cases, Malhotra pleaded that similar order be passed in case of the 28 petitioners. The bench said it can ask the government to take a decision on their representation within four weeks. The bench, however, deferred the hearing to May 4 after their advocate insisted that the petition be heard with similar other petitions pending in the court. The court had on April 15 passed order on a similar petition filed by a life convict and asked the additional advocate general to assist it in deciding the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uttar-pradesh-sits-on-remission-pleas-worried-supreme-court-gives-govt-a-deadline/articleshow/82319773.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi toll at new high of 395, positivity at 32.8% even as recoveries rise||NEW DELHI: The daily toll of coronavirus in Delhi touched 395 on Thursday, the highest till date. It means 16 people died in the city in every one hour a day before. Earlier, on April 27, 381 deaths were recorded in a day. From April 1 to April 29, Delhi has recorded 5,475 deaths, averaging 189 fatalities daily. In March, the average deaths reported daily were around four. The number of new cases reported on Thursday was 24,235, lower than Wednesday’s 25,986. However, the low numbers were due to very low testing. In the last 24 hours, data shared by the state health department shows, only 73,851 tests were conducted, of which 54,600 were done using RT-PCR and 19,251 were rapid antigen tests. In April second week, the city conducted over one lakh tests of which nearly 70,000 tests were done using RT-PCR, which is considered the gold standard for testing Covid-19. Recovery rate boost: Over 25k test negativeThe positivity rate is around 33%, meaning one in every three persons getting tested is positive for the disease. "This is because of lower testing. Only highly symptomatic or direct contacts of positive cases are getting tested. There is little or no contact tracing or largescale testing happening in Delhi," said a senior doctor. On the brighter side, the recovery rate has increased. On Thursday, the government said 25,615 people had recovered in the last 24 hours. Now, the total number of active Covid-19 cases stands at 97,977 from Wednesday’s 99,752. The availability of oxygen and ICU beds remains scarce though. Data shared by the state health department shows 55% of the active cases are recuperating under home isolation. The number of patients admitted in various hospitals is 24,667, which is 25% of the total active cases. Despite that, there are very few vacant beds. Hundreds of patients requiring admission, especially those in need of critical care, can be seen waiting outside the emergency of various private and public hospitals. "There are only 11 ICU beds available in the city as per the Delhi Corona app. I tried to call the hospitals where these vacant beds are but didn’t get a favourable response," Nikhil Saxena, a resident of Malviya Nagar, said. He added that people are gasping for breath and dying due to the lack of facilities for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-19-delhi-toll-at-new-high-of-395-positivity-at-32-8-even-as-recoveries-rise/articleshow/82319771.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The firm, however, did not mention the nature of content it had pulled down recently. Lumen is a project of the Berkman Klein Centre for Internet & Society at Harvard University. The database collects and analyses legal complaints and requests for removal of online materials, making users aware of their rights to know and understand the law. These data enable users to study the prevalence of legal threats and let them see the source of content removals. The database contains millions of notices, many of them with a valid legal basis, some of them without, and some on the murky border. The database grows by over 40,000 notices per week, with voluntary submissions provided by companies such as Google, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia, Medium, and Wordpress. To put the spotlight on credible conversation on the pandemic in India, Twitter has launched a dedicated Covid-19 hub that one can navigate to via the Explore tab where one can find a series of live event pages, public service announcements, debunks and more. It has also rolled out the Covid-19 SOS page that helps surface information from those offering or seeking immediate help during this crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/twitter-clarifies-on-government-requests/articleshow/82319797.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

To be able to provide the vaccine to this large chunk of people, the state government has decided to float a global tender for four crore vaccine doses. “A decision in this regard has been taken by the state task force on Covid-19 vaccination programme implementation,” said a government spokesperson on Thursday. The tender will be in addition to orders of 50 lakh Covid-19 doses, each placed by the state government to Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India. Officials pointed out that while registrations for the vaccination have begun, the global tender was a need of the hour in wake of the huge demand. They also said that the UP Medical Supplies Corporation will place the tender in a day or two. Stating that vaccination was a potent tool against the pandemic virus, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that 1,23,50,426 doses of the vaccine have been given to people in the state. Of these, 22,26,942 are fully vaccinated. This includes health and front line workers besides civilians.
