While night curfew has been on for a few days already, it was then extended to include the weekend (Friday night to Monday morning), while also ordering the shutting down of venues for performing arts and cinema halls, among other measures to reduce public gatherings. Where does this leave artistes, who had only begun to return to some form of normalcy in recent times? Concerts and events postponedEvent organisers say that they had an inkling about such a move, given the steadily rising numbers of COVID cases, and had begun postponing or even cancelling some of their programmes. "We had a few private gigs lined up, but those got pushed, which gave us an idea about the current mood and what it was likely to be in the days to come. So, we decided to move our private shows online, while also utilizing this time to connect with fans," says Behram Siganporia, frontman of Best Kept Secret. Danseuse Madhu Nataraj’s upcoming hybrid conference has been pushed to July for the same reason. "The Dr Maya Rao Kathak & Choreography Conference for this year was scheduled for the first week of May. We have now pushed it ahead. Last year, we were among the first conferences to go online, but this year we were looking at hybrid events, both online and offline. With the current situation, we have decided to push the event to July. I'm looking at just doing my classes, which will now be completely online again and take a break and maybe help society, as that becomes the priority," she shares. Learnings of 2020 come to the aidMany artistes say that last year's experience proved to be a lesson in terms of prepping for a situation like this. Arundhati Nag says, "We began recording shows at Ranga Shankara over the past few months, just in case things go wrong again. We have around eight plays recorded and have three more in the works. We are also looking at reviving our work from the archives spanning 16 years, and make those available too." Cinema industry in a fixWith no definite guidelines yet for the film industry, they are not sure on how to work during this next fortnight. While some film teams that were to begin work on new projects have decided to push the dates of shoot, others are in a quandary. Like, for instance, director R Chandru, who has erected multiple sets for his period gangster flick Kabzaa that also requires a lot of cast and crew members on set. "We need a minimum of 500 people on the set, which includes a lot of technicians and will be in a big fix if guidelines require us to reduce the number of people," says Chandru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/performing-arts-return-to-the-online-format-as-venues-close-for-pandemic-control/articleshow/82179490.cms||Sunayana Suresh

A government order in this regard was issued on Wednesday. The five-member STF, headed by additional director general of police (CID) RR Swain, is tasked with scrutinizing cases of employees suspected of activities requiring action under proviso (C) of Article 311(2) of the Constitution. Under proviso (c), where the state is satisfied that the retention of a person in public service is prejudicial to the security of the state, his/her services can be terminated without recourse to the normal procedure prescribed in Article 311(2). Apart from Swain, the other members of the STF are IGP Kashmir/Jammu, representative of the home department not below the rank of additional secretary, representative of law department not below the rank of additional secretary and representative of the department concerned, as necessary, not below the rank of additional secretary. The STF has been empowered to compile records of such employees and refer the same to the J&K chief secretary-headed committee constituted on July 30 last year to scrutinize and recommend cases under proviso (C). According to the government order, the STF has also been empowered to engage with members of the Terror Monitoring Group (TMG) for identifying such employees, if necessary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-govt-sets-up-special-task-force-to-fire-employees-with-anti-national-attitude/articleshow/82186435.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Oxygen crisis: No power cuts, local interference at plants, Govt to covert nitrogen, argon tankers||NEW DELHI: Responding to what it has termed “an extremely urgent requirement” to augment supply of liquid medical oxygen (LMO), the Centre has directed states that there be no power cuts at the plants manufacturing oxygen and that district/local administrations be told that there be zero interference so as to ensure smooth functioning of the plants. Also, to ensure uninterrupted movement of LMO the Centre wants to convert “most” tankers presently carrying nitrogen and argon into oxygen-carrying tankers. As per the centre there are 1,199 — 434 argon and 765 nitrogen — tankers in the country and 516 LMO tankers spread across 11 major states. The 516 LMO tankers have a capacity to transport around 7,300MT, which is insufficient to tackle the problem at hand. Thus, urging for conversion of other tankers, a letter from union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba has identified 516 (214 argon and 353 nitrogen) non-oxygen carriers that can transport 7,500 metric tonne (MT) to augment the transport capacity of LMO. TOI has a copy of the letter. “There’s an extremely urgent requirement to augment supply of LMO. However, availability of tankers can become a bottleneck in the supply chain as most of these have already been pressed into service. An alternative to ensure uninterrupted LMO movement is to convert tankers that carry nitrogen and argon. It is advised that the maximum number of such tankers, as found feasible, should be converted into oxygen-carrying tankers to facilitate this movement, in an expeditious manner,” Gauba said. Saket Tiku, president, All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers Association (AIIGMA), said that transportation has been a problem and that the industry too wanted this. “The process of converting nitrogen or argon tankers to oxygen-carrying vehicles is not complicated and the centre has also agreed to give other permissions,” he told TOI. And, a circular dated March 29 from regulatory body Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) says cryogenic tankers licenced for transport of nitrogen and argon are permitted to transport LMO without needing amendment of licences. Subhashish Guha Roy, managing director, Universal Air Products said: “The reason to choose nitrogen and argon tankers are because they are cryogenic (-150°C). We can do it in a day as the process is simple: Purge the tanks using oxygen, bring it to oxygen compatibility and purity and then fill it with oxygen. You just need to do it once,” he said. In another letter from the Centre to states accessed by TOI, Sumita Dawra, additional secretary to GoI, has said: “Oxygen manufacturers are situated in different states and they are required to supply oxygen as per the requirement of various states... Kindly ensure there is no power disruption to these units. Further, the health departments of all states must ensure that the District Administration does not interfere with the oxygen manufacturing plants which may be located in the district.” Pointing out that the manufacturing plant would be supplying oxygen to the rest of the state and to other states of the country, the letter marked ‘most urgent’, notes that local level interference would cause disruption in the oxygen supply chain at the national level, “which is best avoided.” Multiple oxygen manufacturers TOI spoke with said that among other things local administration should ensure that the movement of the tankers is akin to ambulances. “There must be no stops at toll booths or other checkpoints to avoid delays and better turnaround time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oxygen-crisis-no-power-cuts-local-interference-at-plants-govt-to-covert-nitrogen-argon-tankers/articleshow/82186389.cms||Chethan Kumar

It was unclear who was behind the bombing at the Serena Hotel. Police said rescuers transported victims to nearby hospitals. Footage on Pakistan news channels showed burning cars. Southwestern Baluchistan province is the scene of a long-running insurgency by secessionist groups like the Baluchistan Liberation Front and the Baluchistan Liberation Army. They have for decades staged attacks to press their demands for independence. The Pakistani Taliban also have a presence there. Liaquat Shahwani, a provincial government spokesman. called the bombing an act of terrorism without elaborating. “Enemies of Pakistan are behind today's attack,” he said. Security forces were rushing to the hotel and no one was being allowed to go near the site of the blast. According to senior police official Azhar Akram, some of the wounded were listed in critical condition. He provided no further details, saying police were still investigating. Wasim Beg, a spokesperson at the provincial health department, said four people died and 12 were wounded in the bombing. Arbab Kamran Kasi, a doctor at Quetta's main hospital, said about a dozen wounded were being brought their and they declared an emergency at the hospital to handle victims. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in Quetta, the capital of southwestern Baluchistan province.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/bombing-in-hotel-parking-lot-kills-at-least-4-in-southwestern-pakistan/articleshow/82186552.cms||---
---||Pune||Meet Pune's 'Scottish Ladki' who has been delivering homemade food, amid the COVID-19 second wave||It’s been around two weeks since Aakanksha Sadekar, aka 'Scottish Ladki', from Pune started preparing dabbas for people in the city, starting from medical school friends of her brother who requested it first. What started with one dabba, which she was sending to her brother, soon turned into 10, 15, 40, and currently stands at around 350! Yes, that’s the number of tiffins that Aakanksha is involved in sending out on a daily basis amid the COVID-19 second wave. And all this, free of cost! If you are in and around #Pune and a #healthcareworker #doctor or #medicalstudent living alone, happy to cook extra… https://t.co/vju2CdnXic— Aakanksha (@scottishladki) 1617645512000For Aakanksha, who delivered her 1000th tiffin a few days ago, this is not a business venture. It’s just a means of helping people. “When the COVID-19 restrictions were implemented in Maharashtra in the first week of April, even food delivery services were suspended due to the night curfew for a while. I had then come across a tweet from a young doctor who had said that he reached home around 9.30 pm after his duty and all he could eat was instant noodles. That stayed with me. Here was a guy who was putting his life in danger for people like us, and he didn’t even have access to good food,” shares Aakanksha, who then put out a tweet saying she would be happy to cook and deliver homemade food to those working through the day for the benefit of others. “I was anyway sending a dabba to my brother. So, I could manage to do a few more for sure,” she adds. Her tweet, however, snowballed into a much larger initiative with doctors, ambulance drivers, cops and even students requesting her to send them food. Ask her how the last few days have been, considering the requests and support she’s been getting on social media, and she replies, “Frankly, it was an overwhelming feeling. From 10 a day, I went up to cooking for almost 80 people on my own. It was still manageable and I thought that’d be it,” she says. It wasn’t. The requests kept coming in, as did offers of help and donations. “So many people volunteered to help out with money, but I have restricted taking monetary help from just my friends. It’s easier that way. That, however, won’t be the case a few days from now because the requests haven’t stopped yet. As of today, there are four of us, including another girl named Ronte, who are preparing around 350 dabbas on a daily basis. We are in the process of putting together a transparent system which will make it easier to keep a track of the donations and what the money is going into,” shares Aakanksha. So Finally I have decided to setup a Community Run Kitchen which will provide free of charge, Taking baby steps int… https://t.co/wZCJCCD2ik— Aakanksha (@scottishladki) 1618995687000While there are multiple people across the country offering food and tiffin services at nominal costs, what sets Aakanksha and her fellows apart is the fact that they are not charging a single penny from those they serve. She says, “It’s always going to be that way. This is not a business. It’s the least we can do for those in need. We’ve gone from preparing food for medical and competitive exam students, to doing this for policemen, ambulance drivers, doctors and more. We are even planning to deliver food to the migrant workers who are heading back to their villages in trains or buses.” With the work that she’s been doing over the last couple of weeks, Aakanksha has brought about a change. But despite the appreciation coming her way, she remains media-shy, not wanting credit for what she’s been doing. But the numerous interview requests have led her to oblige, albeit hesitantly. “I don’t want to be labelled as a messiah or life-saver. Media exposure, at some point, leads to that. If I had my way, this whole initiative would have remained faceless forever,” she laughs, adding, “I appreciate the help, the amplification of this service we are providing and the good words coming our way. But, like I said before, this is something I am doing on a personal level. If I am helping take one worry off the list of people working to save lives, I will be satisfied.” For those who wish to get in touch with Aakanksha or her partner in this initiative, Ronte, you can do so by tweeting to them @scottishladki or @rons1212 or call on 9967869613||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/meet-aakanksha-sadekar-whos-been-delivering-homemade-food-to-punekars-amid-the-covid-19-second-wave/articleshow/82181392.cms||Mihir Bhanage

Deaths from the virus climbed to another high of 2,102 in the past 24 hours. According to TOI's data, India logged 3,15,925 new cases on Wednesday, crossing the 3-lakh mark for the first time and going past the previous highest daily case count of 3,07,581 reported in the US on January 8, as per worldometers.info. It has taken just 17 days for the daily case count to rise from 1 lakh on April 4 to over 3 lakh on Wednesday. During this period, cases have surged at 6.76% daily, more than four times faster than a similar growth in daily numbers in the US -- the only other country that has recorded more than 1 lakh cases in a day. Coronavirus in India: Live updatesIn terms of cases per million population and deaths, the Covid outbreak in the US has been far worse. The US has in all recorded 97,881 cases per million so far, nearly nine times higher than India's numbers (11,418). The US's deaths per million, at 1,752, are more than 13 times India's per-million toll of 132, as per worldometers.info. However, the current spike in India is already overwhelming the healthcare infrastructure in many states, even as the high positivity rates -- 19.2% nationally over the past three days -- indicates that the surge may be far from over yet.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); As many as 17 states and Union territories registered their highest ever spike in cases on Wednesday, led by Uttar Pradesh that logged 33,214 new infections -- the highest daily number ever recorded in any state outside Maharashtra.

He was 97 and is survived by two sons and two daughters. His son Saniyasnain Khan said Maulana Khan was admitted to a private hospital last week after he had a chest infection and he had tested positive for Covid-19 too. Born in Azamgarh in 1925, the Maulana was educated at a traditional seminary. A known peacenik who advocated peaceful co-existence and counselled moderation in conduct, he crusaded against extremism and orthodox interpretations of the holy texts. He penned over 200 books, including a commentary and a translation of the Quran in English, Hindi and Urdu. His lectures, many of them available on YouTube, are immensely popular. Maulana Khan was founder of the Islamic Centre in New Delhi. He had hit the headlines when he gave his ‘peace formula’ for the Babri Masjid-Ramjanambhoomi dispute and asked Muslims to forego their claims on the disputed land in Ayodhya. His request was though rejected by a huge section of his community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/famed-islamic-scholar-maulana-wahiduddin-dead/articleshow/82187190.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||India||West Bengal elections 2021: Election Commission rejects calls to rejig poll schedule||NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Wednesday ruled out any change in schedule for the remaining phases of polling in West Bengal, rejecting the demand of Trinamool Congress to club the last three phases and also that of the Congress to schedule these phases after the fasting month of Ramzan. Shooting down the Trinamool Congress’s suggestion to club Phase 6, 7 and 8 of polling, the Commission said scheduling of polls was an activity planned much in advance taking into account the complex interplay of variety of factors ranging from optimal utilisation of resources, manpower and training thereof, logistic involved in the mammoth exercise, voters’ convenience, festivals etc and assessment of prevailing law and order situations. It added that separate notifications already issued for each of the phases required polls to be held on different days, counting the minimum 14 days – as mandated under Section 30(d) of the Representation of the People Act 1951 -- from the last date of withdrawal of candidature for each phase. “Suggestion to club Phase 6, 7 and 8 is not feasible,” the EC wrote to Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien on Wednesday in response to his April 20 letter submitted to the West Bengal chief electoral officer on Tuesday, requesting holding of polls for the last three phases on a single date in view of the current state of Covid pandemic. “Each phase of election is distinct and notified separately u/s Section 30 of RP Act, 1951. In view of this, your submission that 52 days of campaign period has already been availed is misleading and not in accordance with the law,” it said. Also terming as “unacceptable” the Congress’s suggestion to conduct the remaining phases of polling after Ramzan and dilution of the present pandemic, EC on Wednesday wrote to West Bengal PCC chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, stating that Commission was mandated under the Constitution of India to complete the electoral process before May 30, when the term of the West Bengal assembly would expire. “Any postponement of scheduled elections would affect adherence to Constitutional and statutory provisions related to timely conduct of elections,” it reasoned. On concerns regarding the Covid surge, the EC on Wednesday reminded both TMC and Congress that it had already invoked its powers under Article 324 to prohibit campaigning between 7 pm and 10 am to discourage public gathering and also extended the silence period to 72 hours for the remaining phases. In view of this, campaigning in West Bengal will end at 6.30 pm on April 26. It added that EC had issued Covid guidelines to ensure that safety norms are adhered to during campaigning without any exceptions, and directed the West Bengal chief secretary, chief electoral officer and district election officers to strictly enforce the same. “You would have also witnessed that all safety measures have been put in place in the polling stations adhering to the extant guidelines…which has helped in creating a conducive and safe environment for electoral participation,” EC said adding that the measures shall continue to be followed in the remaining phases. The Commission has also made elaborate arrangements for counting on May 2, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/west-bengal-elections-2021-no-plan-to-merge-last-three-phases-of-polls-says-election-commission/articleshow/82187164.cms||Bharti Jain

---||World||Putin vows a 'quick and tough' Russian response for its foes||MOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday sternly warned the West against encroaching further on Russia's security interests, saying Moscow's response will be ``quick and tough'' and make the culprits bitterly sorry for their action. The warning during Putin's annual state-of-the-nation address came amid a massive Russian military buildup near Ukraine, where cease-fire violations in the seven-year conflict between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces have escalated in recent weeks. The United States and its allies have urged the Kremlin to pull the troops back. ``I hope that no one dares to cross the red line in respect to Russia, and we will determine where it is in each specific case,'' Putin said. ``Those who organize any provocations threatening our core security interests will regret their deeds more than they regretted anything for a long time.'' Moscow has rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the troop buildup, saying it doesn't threaten anyone and that Russia is free to deploy its forces on its territory. But the Kremlin also has warned Ukraine against trying to use force to retake control of the rebel-held east, saying Russia could be forced to intervene to protect civilians in the region. ``We really don't want to burn the bridges,'' Putin said. ``But if some mistake our good intentions for indifference or weakness and intend to burn or even blow up those bridges themselves, Russia's response will be asymmetrical, quick and tough.'' As Putin spoke, a wave of protests started rolling across Russia in support of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and a human rights group said over 1,000 people were arrested. Thousands marched in central Moscow, where police blocked off a square next to the Kremlin. Police in St. Petersburg blocked off Palace Square, outside the Hermitage museum, and protesters instead massed along Nevsky Prospekt. The politician, who is Putin's most persistent critic and was poisoned with a chemical nerve agent last year, started a hunger strike three weeks ago to protest what he said was inadequate medical treatment and officials' refusal to allow his doctor to visit him. His supporters called the rallies as his health reportedly is in severe decline. In his speech, Putin pointed to Russia's moves to modernize its nuclear arsenal and said the military would continue to build more state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles and other new weapons. He added that the development of the nuclear-armed Poseidon underwater drone and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile is continuing successfully. In an apparent reference to the US and its allies, the Russian leader denounced those who impose ``unlawful, politically motivated economic sanctions and crude attempts to enforce its will on others.'' He said Russia has shown restraint and often refrained from responding to ``openly boorish'' actions by others. The Biden administration last week imposed new sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2020 US presidential election and for involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies _ activities Moscow has denied. The US ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and individuals, and imposed new curbs on Russia's ability to borrow money. Russia retaliated by ordering 10 US diplomats to leave, blacklisting eight current and former US officials, and tightening requirements for US Embassy operations. ``Russia has its own interests, which we will defend in line with the international law,'' Putin said during Wednesday's address. ``If somebody refuses to understand this obvious thing, is reluctant to conduct a dialogue and chooses a selfish and arrogant tone, Russia will always find a way to defend its position.'' In an emotional outburst, Putin chastised the West for acquiring a defiant stance toward Russia. ``Some countries have developed a nasty habit of bullying Russia for any reason or without any reason at all. It has become a new sport,'' he said. In an apparent reference to the US allies, he compared them to Tabaqui, a cowardly golden jackal kowtowing to Shere Khan, the tiger in Rudyard Kipling's ``Jungle Book.'' ``They howl to please their lord,'' he said. Russia this week engaged in a tense tug-of-war with the Czech Republic, following Prague's move to expel 18 Russian diplomats over a massive Czech ammunition depot explosion in 2014. Moscow has dismissed the Czech accusations of its involvement in the blast as absurd and retaliated by expelling 20 Czech diplomats. Putin also harshly criticized the West for failing to condemn what he described as a botched coup attempt and a failed plot to assassinate Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko, allegedly involving a blockade of the country's capital, power cuts and cyberattacks. Belarusian and Russian security agencies arrested the alleged coup plotters in Moscow earlier this month. ``The practice of organizing coups and planning political assassinations of top officials goes over the top and crosses all boundaries,'' Putin said, drawing parallels to plots against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the popular protests that led to the ouster of Ukraine's former Russia-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014. Russia responded to Yanukovych's ouster by annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and throwing its support to the separatists in the country's east. Since then, fighting there has killed more than 14,000 people and devastated the industrial heartland. Putin dedicated most of his annual address to domestic issues, hailing the nation's response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the quick development of three coronavirus vaccines underlined Russia's technological and industrial potential. He called for a quicker pace of immunizations, voicing hope the country could achieve collective immunity this fall. He put forward incentives to help the economy recover from the pandemic and promised new social payments focusing on families with children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/putin-vows-a-quick-and-tough-russian-response-for-its-foes/articleshow/82187780.cms||---

ICMR director Balram Bhargava underlined the importance of vaccination and said the data on infections in those who were fully vaccinated indicated that a very small percentage of people contracted the disease. Read AlsoIs Indian Covid variant behind second wave that started from Vidarbha?International scientists are now trying to decode the Covid variant — B.1.617 — that appears more infectious in India. There is a theory that this variant emerged in Amravati and caused the huge surge in cases in nearby districts in February, though more research is needed to confirm this.So far, .04% people have tested positive after the second dose of Covaxin and .03% after the second dose of Covishield. Experts and doctors continue to insist that precautions like sanitisation and use of masks should not be abandoned even after vaccination. Coronavirus: Live updates Studies have shown lesser virulence and mortality among vaccinated people. Some protection is evident even after the first dose though completion of the vaccination is important.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); “This too is mostly among health and frontline workers who were vaccinated on priority but have occupational exposure and because of the intense second wave which is likely to have contributed,” Bhargava said. The data is encouraging and should go a long way in dispelling vaccine hesitancy that continues to pose hurdles to the vaccination drive. The data reflects a robust performance for both vaccines being used in India. So far, over 1.1 crore doses of Covaxin and 11.6 crore doses of Covishield have been administered. Among those who received Covaxin, 695 tested positive after the second dose and in the case of Covishield, 5,014 tested positive.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); “These vaccines reduce severe infection and death. They also reduce chances of infection but it is still possible to get the disease.

Many states, including Maharashtra, have begun providing police protection to vehicles carrying cylinders and gas tankers. Live updates: CoronavirusOn Wednesday, Haryana health minister Anil Vij accused the Delhi government of “looting an oxygen tanker belonging to Haryana while it was passing through in New Delhi” early on Tuesday morning. According to officials of the Haryana food and drug administration department, which was asked by Vij to carry out a probe, the incident took place when a tanker carrying liquid oxygen from a plant in Panipat was on its way to Faridabad and Palwal districts for supply to hospitals. Read AlsoCovid-19: Centre increases states' oxygen quota amid shortageCentre on Wednesday increased the quota of Oxygen for several states including Delhi, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh in view of the sudden spike in demand due to an exponential rise in the number of Covid patients admitted in hospitals.As the tanker was passing through New Delhi, a team of policemen and officers allegedly stopped it and forcibly filled oxygen cylinders from the tanker. “This is the worst one could expect from the Delhi government. They should have asked us. If we can treat their patients, we would not mind sharing oxygen as well,” said Vij, who also holds the home portfolio. The Haryana government is yet to file a police complaint or officially complain to the Delhi government. However, sources said it has stopped the supply of 60 metric tonnes of oxygen that had been allocated to Delhi from the Faridabad plant.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Vij has also ordered police escorts for all vehicles carrying oxygen stocks and deployment of police teams at oxygen manufacturing plants in the state. Meanwhile, in Madhya Pradesh, a truckload of oxygen cylinders was looted by relatives of Covid patients as soon as they were stacked up in the storeroom of a hospital in Damoh on Tuesday night. “They were not outsiders, but family persons of Covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital. They thought there would be shortage of oxygen, so they forcibly took away the cylinders,” Damoh SP Hemant Singh Chauhan told TOI. An FIR was registered on Tuesday night. Damoh was exempted from weekend and night curfew due to the bypolls and is now reeling under a surge of Covid infections — a 600% rise in active cases since April 1. In Maharashtra, an oxygen tanker headed for a hospital in Dhule district was reportedly diverted to a different place forcibly two day ago. Following this, the state police decided to escort such vehicles. Acting Director General of Police (DGP) Sanjay Pande said, “We were informed about the Dhule incident through unverified sources. We are ascertaining the facts. People are reacting in panic due to shortage of oxygen gas. Since the last two days, we have begun piloting vehicles transporting oxygen cylinders and gas tankers across the state to avoid any untoward incident.” Pande stated that the police are coordinating with district collectors for escorting for these vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oxygen-carriers-get-police-cover-after-lootings/articleshow/82189241.cms||---

---||World||China: Put border issue at appropriate position in ties||NEW DELHI: Asking India to bear in mind the overall interests of the “long-term” development of China-India relations, China reiterated Wednesday that the boundary issue be placed at an appropriate position in bilateral relations. The remark by the Chinese foreign ministry was in response to queries on Indian ambassador to China, Vikram Misri’s comment that there was a tendency to sweep the border issue under the carpet. Misri had also said there was a need to respect each other’s concerns and sensitivities. “We hope that the Indian side will work with China to meet each other halfway, bear in mind the overall interests of the long-term development of China-India relations, place the boundary issue at an appropriate position in bilateral relations and bring China-India relations back to the track of sound and steady development,” said spokesperson Wang Wenbin, adding that China’s position on the China-India boundary issue was consistent and clear-cut. Asked about the pending disengagement in remaining areas, the official said India should “cherish the hard-won de-escalation of the situation” in the border areas and uphold peace and tranquility in the border areas with concrete actions. He said China was committed to maintaining peace and stability in the border areas and firmly safeguarding national territorial sovereignty and security. “Recently, China and India have maintained close communication through diplomatic and military channels. On the basis of realizing disengagement in the Galwan Valley and the Pangong Lake area, the two sides have had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on promoting the settlement of the remaining issues in the western sector of the China-India boundary,” said Wang. In his recent address to the India-China dialogue forum, Misri had said the significance of the consensus reached between leaders of the two countries to maintain peace along the LAC cannot be “swept under the carpet” and called for the complete disengagement of troops in Eastern Ladakh to rebuild bilateral ties strained by the “serious incidents”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-put-border-issue-at-appropriate-position-in-ties/articleshow/82189531.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Oxygen demand doubles as supply chain takes a hit||KOLKATA: In less than a month, the state’s medical oxygen requirement has almost doubled from 150 tonne per day to around 270 tonne per day as Bengal touched 60,000 active cases, with more than 10,000 new cases on Wednesday. Several nursing homes, pharmacies and oxygen equipment suppliers in Kolkata reported shortages of medical oxygen for a growing pool of patients who are gasping for breath. Be it in Kolkata or the rest of the state, oxygen suppliers said they had almost run out of stock in less than a week and were not being able to get fresh stock due to an acute crisis across the country. “While there is additional requirement from hospitals, several companies and individuals are also stocking cylinders to tide over the future crisis and at present most pharmacies and oxygen suppliers have run out of their stock,” said Sajal Ganguly, a senior functionary of the Bengal Chemist and Druggist Association. Abhijit Ghosh, the owner of Seba Medical on Sukeas Street said, till four days ago, he had 25 oxygen cylinders at his store. On Wednesday, he had only two, both of which were already booked by a customer. Ilias Rahman, a supplier in Chinar Park, said even the dealers and companies who provide cylinders can’t provide them with fresh stocks anymore. The suppliers said the problem is accentuated with the existing customers not returning the cylinders. Oxygen supplier Aryan Shaw said there were five major companies who manufacture oxygen cylinders in the country, of which three are in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Considering the Covid spike in those states, the stocks from those plants are getting utilized locally. “Bengal is yet to match Madhya Pradesh, Gujrat, Maharashtra or Delhi numbers. As a result, we still have to supply oxygen to those states as per instruction by the central government. If large numbers are reported, the Centre would take adequate measures and this scarcity in Bengal can be met with,” said a senior official of a leading medical oxygen manufacturer in eastern India. “There are not enough cylinders and tankers to store and transport oxygen. It requires specially trained labourers as well as machines to increase the production of cylinders,” an industry expert opined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/oxygen-demand-doubles-as-supply-chain-takes-a-hit/articleshow/82186015.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Allahabad||Amid surge, rise in recoveries a little respite for city||Prayagraj: Even as Sangam City had reported over 2,000 Covid cases everyday for the last six days (April 15-20), the graph of recoveries rose progressively in the same period. Between April 15-20, a total of 13,698 Covid cases were reported while 6,918 patients had recovered (discharged from hospitals/completed home isolation) in the same period. Statistics from the health department revealed that 2,324 Covid cases were reported on April 15, and 629 patients recovered on the same day. Data further claimed that in next five days, as many as 2,236, 2,436, 2,416, 2164 and 2,122 cases were reported on April 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 respectively while 863, 998, 1201, 1530, and 1697 patients also recovered on same dates respectively. Moreover, health department statistics claimed that 1,682, 1,628, 1,754, 2,142 and 1,891 Covid cases were reported on April 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 while the number of recovered patients was 99, 224, 290, 403 and 622 respectively. If one observes the graph of Covid cases and recovered patients, the number of recovered persons started improving after April 10 and kept on rising by every passing day. The city’s recovery rate currently stood at 68.92 % which was below 60 before April 5. Nodal officer and Additional chief medical officer, Dr. Rishi Sahai told TOI that the second wave of Covid and subsequent analysis of cases and trends revealed a higher pathogenicity and infection index in the city. As it was a dangerous trend, so the department completely focused on extensive testing to contain the spread of the disease. The department has scaled up testing target to around 12,000-13,000 tests per day. However, there is some relief as the graph of recovered patients started rising gradually in past week. Currently, there are a total of 16,373 active cases undergoing treatment, including 15,100 in home isolation and 1,273 admitted in hospitals. As per official data, Prayagraj district had 54,447 cases till Tuesday. While 37,528 patients recovered with 7,347 being discharged from hospitals and 30,181 completing home isolation.

---||Patna||Oxygen supply improves in Patna hospitals||PATNA: The oxygen supply has improved a bit in the city hospitals, much to the relief for serious Covid patients. Some private hospitals, however, complained of short supply of the oxygen cylinders, which compelled them to refuse fresh admissions. Though there is no shortage of oxygen in the PMCH, its superintendent Dr IS Thakur on Wednesday wrote a letter to the DM with a request to maintain the supply chain. He said it was needed not only for the 102 Covid patients admitted there but also for other patients undergoing surgeries or having low oxygen saturation, medically called as SpO2. Thakur said as 90% of the patients admitted in the Covid ward were on oxygen support, the PMCH required about 900 cylinders per day. Meanwhile, the superintendent also constituted a three-member committee headed by deputy superintendent Abhishek Basuki to monitor the delivery of cylinders to the hospital. Finding no bed with oxygen support in any private hospital for treatment of her Covid positive 76-year-old father on Tuesday, one Nimisha Shandilya had to rush him to the PMCH. “His condition could have deteriorated but timely oxygen support at PMCH made him stable,” she said. There was no oxygen problem at NMCH either. Its superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said the hospital had sufficient supply of oxygen cylinders. “Of the 259 patients admitted in the Covid ward, 197 are on oxygen support,” he said. NMCH deputy superintendent Dr Satish Kumar said most of the patients admitted there were immediately put on oxygen support and it helped in improving their condition. The managing director of Ruban Hospital, Dr Satyajeet Singh, said oxygen supply has improved but short supply of Remdesivir continued. “We could get only 30 vials of the injection against the demand for 60 on Wednesday,” he said. Altogether 178 patients are admitted there. Paras HMRI also complained of short supply of Remdesivir. However, its regional director Dr Talat Halim said the hospital had sufficient oxygen to meet the requirement of coming 15 days. Ford Hospital’s quality manager Pradeep Sharma said there was no crisis of oxygen and most of the 55 patients in the Covid ward were on oxygen support. Sri Sai Hospital director Ashutosh Singh also expressed satisfaction on the availability of oxygen for 45 Covid patients. However, Jagdish Memorial Hospital reported problem in oxygen supply. Its managing director Dr Alok Kumar said he had to arrange oxygen cylinders from Nalanda and Ramgarh in Jharkhand. “We have not got any oxygen cylinder since April 17 and had to bring 50 cylinders from Ramgarh. Another lot of 60 cylinders for 30 Covid patients is likely to reach by Thursday morning,” he said. High-Tech hospital official Abhay Pandey said due to short supply of oxygen cylinders, the hospital had to refer many other patients to PMCH, NMCH or AIIMS-Patna for guaranteed oxygen availability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oxygen-supply-improves-in-patna-hospitals/articleshow/82185073.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Tejas announces 13-member doc team for Covid assistance||PATNA: Political parties have come forward to provide voluntary assistance as the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic casts a long shadow on the state. On Wednesday, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav announced that his party has constituted a 13-member team of doctors to provide free medical consultancy under a telemedicine programme undertaken by its medical cell. “A 13-member team of the medical cell has been constituted to give corona-related information and free medical consultancy to the needy. Affected persons can talk to doctors on their respective helpline numbers,” Tejashwi said in his tweet on Wednesday. “Those in need will be given all possible assistance through telemedicine on the respective helpline during the hours fixed by the doctors deputed for the purpose,” he added in his second tweet. Incidentally, the idea of voluntary assistance by political parties amid surging Covid-19 cases in the state was mooted by the state Congress chief, Madan Mohan Jha, at the all-party meeting convened by governor Phagu Chauhan, on April 17. Jha, in his deliberation, had voluntarily offered the offices of the Congress party, including its state headquarters Sadaqat Ashram in Patna, to be utilized by the state government as isolation centres for Covid-19 infected persons. On Wednesday, state BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal also geared up the party’s organizational machinery to provide services to the needy. It is a part of the ‘Sewa Hi Sangathan’ campaign launched by the party’s national president J P Nadda during the pandemic last year. In this connection, Dr Jaiswal virtually interacted with the party’s office-bearers across the state and asked them to start working on providing the "17-point services" to the needy down to the booth level, underlining that providing service to needy people should be the main objective. “My booth, corona-free booth” should be the driving motto, Dr Jaiswal said. He dubbed this year’s campaign as ‘Sewa Hi Sangathan Abhiyan -2,’ adding that the services provided will be over and above the work that was being done by the state government and health minister Mangal Pandey. As had been advised by Nadda last year, Dr Jaiswal asked the state, district and other office-bearers to depute an active worker for each of the 17-point services, and a 24x7 helpline should be opened in every important town. On the other hand, unwilling to be identified, a JD(U) source said, “The government has taken the steps. Our party functionaries and members must ensure that the needy persons get the required help. Even otherwise, they have been told to see that if anyone approaches them for assistance it should be provided.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejas-announces-13-member-doc-team-for-covid-assistance/articleshow/82185008.cms||Abhay Singh

City police recently busted a racket of manufacturing sanitizer using methanol — a hazardous chemical. The police have detained the firm owner Nitij Kotwani for attempting to commit culpable homicide and cheating people. According to the police, Kotwani had taken license to make sanitizers about 10 months ago. “Initially, he sold sanitisers for affordable price. When the demand for sanitisers shot up, Kotwani decided to mix methanol in the liquid to further bring down the cost of manufacturing,” said a police official. Police inspector J J Patel of the prevention of crime branch (PCB) on Tuesday raided A K Industries in Gorwa BIDC. When the cops reached the spot, they found that the manufacturing firm didn’t have any board on its entry gate. PCB sleuths said that the accused started sourcing methanol that is cheaply available in the market. Cops seized 8,024 litres of sanitizer filled in 14,741 bottles valued at Rs 45.47 lakh from the manufacturing unit and sent it for FSL tests. “The test results showed that the duplicate sanitizer in many of the bottles had over 70 per cent methanol. The chemical was dangerously high in proportion,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. Kotwani had set up the sanitizer unit in June last year and he used to supply it to different cities in Gujarat. “He said that the price of ethanol, that is a major component in sanitizer went up and its supply was also short. So the accused replaced ethanol with methanol that he sourced from the industries,” Singh told TOI. Kotwani used to buy methanol for Rs 9 per litre and his total cost of making the sanitizer was Rs 15 per litre. “He made huge money by selling the duplicate sanitizer for Rs 50 per litre in wholesale,” Singh added. The police said that Kotwani made a profit of about Rs 10 crore in 10 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/counterfeit-sanitizer-racket-busted-unit-owner-detained/articleshow/82184902.cms||---
---||Patna||People want action to curb Covid-19 spread||PATNA: The appeal made by PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday to form local committees and involve ‘Bal Mitras’ (children) for ensuring self-regulations among people to put a curb on second phase of Covid-19 pandemic in the country has evoked a mixed response in the state capital. While some residents appreciated the PM’s suggestions, others called for a real solution to the unprecedented problem being faced in the second wave of Covid-19. Retired government officer Ashok Kumar Singh said if the local bodies ensure Covid protocols in a society or colony, it can be very effective. “If we take responsibility for our actions, the spread of infection can be curbed,” he said. Aarti Mishra, a Hindi teacher, said children are far more capable and can take responsibilities of their parents as well. "Children can be stubborn and force family members to ensure Covid safety. But they need to be aware about the severity of the situation,” she said. The pandemic-hit common people expect more result-oriented approach from the government as opposed to suggestions. “The need of the hour is to ramp up our health infrastructure and provide hospital beds to patients. Instead of making futile suggestions, the Centre should take some action,” said Archana, an advocate at Patna high court. Dr Gautam Kumar, a general physician echoed, “More health professionals, better infrastructure and solid supply of Covid testing and treating equipment such as oxygen cylinders, PPE kits, RT-PCR test kits, drugs like Remdesivir should be made available to states like Bihar where the Covid figures are rapidly rising.” Kavya Arya, an economics graduate, said it’s high time for the central government to intervene in state health decisions related to Covid. “The perks of a coalition government at the state level is nowhere to be seen. The Centre should help Bihar in overcoming this crisis,” she said. Soumya Chaudhary, president of an apartment society on Boring Road, said her society has certain rules that everybody adheres to. “No delivery person is allowed to enter the main gate and entry of maids are also prohibited for now. The building guard does grocery shopping once a week for all the occupants,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/people-want-action-to-curb-covid-19-spread/articleshow/82185106.cms||---

While fresh Covid cases are breaching records every day in the state, the number of discharges remained almost static over the past 10 days. “We are seeing more new cases daily and the number of people needing hospitalization has also increased. The number of beds is being increased to accommodate more patients, but on the other hand the status of discharged patients is same,” said Dr Ashish Naik, deputy municipal commissioner (health and hospitals), Surat. “This time patients are more critical and most need oxygen support. Hence, discharge is taking time,” Naik added. However, the recovery curve promises to go upwards marginally from Thursday onwards with decline registered in number of daily cases in Surat. On April 18, 1,929 fresh cases in Surat city were reported which were 1,553 on Tuesday. Doctors believe that although there may be a decrease in number of new cases, the number of patients getting discharged, however, will more or less remain the same. “The active cases are still high and there is no reduction in number of patients getting hospitalized. If hospitalization rate decreases, the discharge rate will also improve,” said a doctor at New Civil Hospital in Surat where 85.64% of beds are occupied while 61.42% of total beds at SMIMER Hospital are filled.“The recovery rate indicates how many patients are discharged against new people testing positive, so it shows the active cases. If the recovery rate reduces, it reflects that active cases have increased,” said Lalit Vaja, municipal health officer of Rajkot municipal corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/recovery-rates-tank-in-10-days-as-hospitalization-shoots-up/articleshow/82185015.cms||Jay Pachchigar

While receiving the best actor and lifetime achievement trophies on behalf of his deceased father that night, Babil had moistened many eyes in the house with his emotion-drenched eulogy. “You know how people say you can’t fit into your father’s shoes... I fit into his clothes somehow,” Babil said before revealing the fact that his father was supposed to teach him acting after he returned from film school — a promise that would be thwarted by the hospital visit from which the actor would never return. This touching speech was among the many key highlights of the starry evening that drew the attention of millions of social media users across the world when the ceremony was shared real-time on Instagram Reels and Facebook Watch. In less than three weeks, the content around the awards garnered over 256 million views and more than 40 million engagements from global viewers across Instagram and Facebook. Worldwide Media, a lifestyle and entertainment content company, had tied up with Facebook and Instagram as the official global digital partners of the 66th Vimal Elaichi Filmfare Awards 2021. For the first time, the awards show was simultaneously telecast on Facebook and television, while people around the world also got access to red-carpet highlights, backstage footage and special moments via Facebook and Instagram. Viewers virtually joined the presenters, nominees and the stars on Filmfare’s official page where on offer were behind-the-stage trivia, performance rehearsals, exclusive celebrity bytes, rapid fires and celebrity challenges. Actors Nora Fatehi and Jaideep Ahlawat were among those who made their Instagram Reels debut with Filmfare. And stars such as Janhvi Kapoor, Rajkummar Rao, Ayushmann Khurrana, Hrithik Roshan, Sara Ali Khan, Fatehi, Sunny Leone and Riteish Deshmukh — who had earlier used Reels to either promote their work or share updates — amused their instafam by participating in various challenges. If actor Sonakshi Sinha shared a sketch of the much-coveted Filmfare Black Lady in real time with her followers, actor Ali Fazal shared a hilarious take on the Filmfare acceptance speech. Among the other highlights released across Facebook and Instagram are winning speeches by Taapsee Pannu, Tillotama Shome, and Saif Ali Khan as well as breath-taking performances by stars like Fatehi and Roshan. “Thank you Filmfare for making space for actors of all kinds,” Shome had said in her speech on receiving the critics’ award for best actor (female) for delicately conveying a domestic worker’s complicated feelings for her employer in the film ‘Sir’. “Movies and cinema are extremely popular among our communities on Facebook and Instagram,” said Manish Chopra, director and head of partnerships, Facebook India. “The Filmfare awards are iconic and intrinsic to India’s entertainment industry and fans across the world — and this is what makes it perfect for our platforms,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/filmfare-awards-get-256mn-views-in-3-weeks-40mn-fan-clicks-on-fb-instagram/articleshow/82186719.cms||---

Most sports and recreational clubs in the premises are being shut. Similar restrictions will be in place at KMC parks and Eco Park as well. An official of KMDA, custodian of the two Lakes — Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarobar, said, “Only morning walkers will be allowed in the two Lakes for four hours from 5.30am.” On December 10, Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarobar at Kadapara off EM Bypass, had returned to their pre-Covid timings, from 5.30am till 7pm. The Lakes had been shut completely from March 23 to June 30 last year. Swimming clubs like ILSS, Calcutta Sports Association and Lake Friends’ Swimming Club will operate till April 30. KMC, too, may shut all major parks across the city after 7.30 am. “As the Covid situation worsens, we may need to take a call to open all major parks for two and half hours in the morning allowing the morning walkers. We will monitor the situation for a week and then decide on the next course of action. If the situation improves, we will slowly enhance the timings and may open parks in the afternoon. If the situation deteriorates, we may have to shut all parks,” said a KMC parks department official. Hidco has already imposed restrictions on Eco Park, keeping only two gates open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/revised-timings-for-kmc-parks-lakes/articleshow/82185962.cms||Saikat Ray

The Indian Banks’ Association held a meeting of bank chiefs on Wednesday to take stock of the Covid situation. Instead of a centralised decision, it was decided in the meeting that state-level bankers’ committees (SLBCs) will take a call on the services branches will provide. The SLBC will also provide the standard operating procedure (SOP) for branches. In the same period last year, bank branches had discontinued several services to curb footfalls. HDFC Bank had reduced its operation timing in 2020 and had also halted sales of foreign currency. In the first phase of the lockdown last year, SBI had restricted services like account opening, cash withdrawals, passbook printing and currency exchanges. “There are a number of digital modes through which customers can get their balance or statement. There is missed call banking, WhatsApp banking, mobile apps and ATMs through which customers can avail most service without face-to-face interaction,” said a banker present in the meeting. According to IBA data, around 600 bank employees have lost their lives due to Covid. Bank branches, being classified as essential, have been exempted from the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-to-curb-branch-ops-in-covid-zones/articleshow/82186476.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 11 die in Ambejogai hosp, families blame shortage of oxygen||Aurangabad: Eleven Covid patients died allegedly due to oxygen shortage, at the Swami Ramanand Teerth Rural Medical College at Ambajogai in Beed district, around 220 km from Aurangabad city, on Wednesday. The relatives of six of the victims alleged that the oxygen supply to the patients, who were on the ventilator, was disrupted for around 30 minutes in the afternoon at the facility. The hospital authorities, however, refuted the allegations made by the relatives and said that the patients had multiple comorbidities and had died due to health complications. Hailed as the first rural medical college in Asia, Swami Ramanand Teerth Rural Medical College has been serving as a Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH) during the pandemic with a bed capacity of 300, including 34 ventilator beds. When contacted, hospital dean Shivaji Sukre said the DCH facility faced shortage of oxygen on Wednesday, but the issue was addressed by sourcing it from other places. “We require 550 to 600 jumbo cylinders of oxygen per day and felt the shortage after supply from Latur was disrupted between 10 am and 11 am. However, we immediately arranged the necessary supply from five district places from Marathwada, among other areas, to regulate supply,” he said. Sukre said the 11 deaths in question happened between midnight and 4 pm on Wednesday. The affected families claimed that six Covid patients died within a few hours around Wednesday noon. Sukre said the DCH caters to the rural population, but public awareness about Covid-19 is low there. “Late hospitalisation is common here, which often leads to health complications. We had witnessed 12 Covid deaths in our hospital in a day during the first wave of the pandemic last year,” he added. Meanwhile, Kej legislator Namita Mundada said, “The deaths of Covid patients at the Ambejogai hospital were due to oxygen shortage. The Maharashtra government must offer ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh to the kin of each deceased, on the lines of Nashik tragedy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-11-die-in-ambejogai-hosp-families-blame-shortage-of-oxygen/articleshow/82188091.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Business||In a first, Tata Steel uses blockchain for trade finance||Mumbai: In a global first for the steel industry, Tata Steel has used a blockchain platform pioneered by HSBC to complete a trade finance transaction with a UAE-based company. Blockchain-based platform Contour has enabled end-to-end digitisation of the letter-of-credit transaction, including the e-presentation of trade documents. It also enables the parties involved to transfer, manage and present electronic bills of lading and other supporting documents within its platform. Trade finance typically involves a lot of paperwork. Digitising the process on the blockchain platform makes it more efficient and reduces risks of fraud. Tata Steel’s export to the Dubai-based Universal Tube & Plastic Industries was enabled by HSBC India and HSBC UAE. “The use of blockchain technology in trade finance enables comprehensive visibility for all involved parties and enhanced security. It also reduces the document negotiation and banking transaction cycle times from weeks to a few days, thereby aiding unlocking of working capital for businesses,” said Hitendra Dave, head (global banking & markets), HSBC India. The platform is seen of particular significance to the India-UAE corridor as it is India’s third-largest trade partner and the physical transfer of goods often takes place faster than the completion of administrative paperwork, which delays delivery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-a-first-tata-steel-uses-blockchain-for-trade-finance/articleshow/82186590.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Covid-19: India Inc scrambles to get staff vaccinated||NEW DELHI: Leading corporate brands have started to tap private healthcare providers to conduct on-site and off-campus Covid vaccination drives for their entire workforce, with costs to be borne by them. The move comes with a little over a week left before inoculation coverage of all adults against Covid begins in the country. Inoculation against the disease is key to India safely reopening large parts of its economy, production facilities and office complexes. Though not mandatory, companies are hopeful that all their employees will take the vaccines as India allows people of 18 and above to get immunised against coronavirus from May 1. Coronavirus: Live updatesOrganisations like Infosys, IndiGo, Taj, Mahindra & Mahindra, Apeejay Surrendra Park and ITC have been facilitating Covid jabs for employees over 45 years in line with the current eligibility norms through partnerships with hospitals. Now, they will be expanding their collaborations to get the rest of their staff vaccinated too. “So far, over 81% of our eligible employees have been vaccinated. We look forward to these numbers going up significantly from May 1,” said K Raheja Corp’s chief HR officer Urvi Aradhya. On Thursday, Wipro will be organising its first Covid vaccination camp at its Electronics City campus in Bengaluru. “We are making necessary efforts to roll out vaccination camps across other major offices in India,” said a Wipro spokesperson. Sony India, which has extended the mediclaim policy to cover Covid treatment even under home quarantine, is in the process of setting up vaccination camps for its staff. On Wednesday, the Indian Banks Association decided that vaccination of 10 lakh bank employees must be given top priority and costs for the same should be reimbursed. But the association left it to individual banks to arrange for tie-ups with hospitals. “We are working with our medical partners to organise a vaccination camp on premises for our employees, subject to approval from state and relevant authorities,” said IDFC First Bank. TCS is “working out modalities of vaccination drive in direct partnership with suppliers”. Likewise, Infosys is “in discussions with healthcare providers and vaccine suppliers”, according to its HR head Richard Lobo. ITC head-HR Amitav Mukherji said, “Designated managers have been nominated to facilitate vaccination across locations in partnership with healthcare facilities.” On Wednesday, the Serum Institute of India said it will sell Covisheild vaccine to private hospitals at Rs 600 per dose. While companies would like employees to get vaccinated as quickly as possible, they are also concerned about the availability of vaccines. “Our plan is to vaccinate everybody, but there is too much complexity still to be worked out on that front, including vaccine availability,” said a Ford India spokesperson. “We are seeing a shortage of vaccines at our partner hospitals and hesitancy in some team members to avail the vaccines, which we are countering by making them aware of the benefits,” said Apeejay Surrendra Park VP (HR) Sujata Gain, adding that, however, 70% of employees above the age of 45 have been vaccinated. “We are hopeful that the majority of our employees will soon receive the first dose of the vaccine now that the government has given the permit for people above 18 years to get vaccinated,” said a Hindustan Unilever spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-inc-scrambles-to-get-staff-vaccinated/articleshow/82186574.cms||---

The varsity constructed a separate building for the incubation centre on the campus. While the already constructed two floors have got a 10,000 square feet incubation space, two more floors are being built for the centre, making it a total of 20,000 square feet incubation space. A prerequisite, which may boost employment and employability skills of Andhra University students, for the startups incubated at this AU Hub is that they have to provide internships and employment opportunities based on their seating capacity at the centre. For instance, if a startup has got a 40-seat working space, it shall provide internships for 20 students (50 per cent of its seating capacity) of Andhra University and its affiliated colleges annually. Similarly, they have to hire 10 students (25 per cent of seating capacity). According to AU officials, the focus of the hub would not only be on IT/ITeS, but also several next generation technologies for multiple critical sectors such as pharma, marine, e-learning, manufacturing, automation, robotics, etc. The centre has been designed to work on a round-the-clock basis. A separate entry would be given to this hub. AU officials want to operate the hub on the lines of similar successful models such as T-Hub in Telangana. Speaking to TOI, Ravi Eswarapu, CEO – Andhra University incubation centre, who earlier served as the president of IT Association of Andhra Pradesh, said that the centre would have a collaborative working space with a combined 450 seating capacity in the all four floors, while the fifth floor would get a cafeteria. “The hub would help empower the startups to scale faster, increase their reach and create business value for their ideas. Three hardware companies occupied the ground floor and the internals would be taken care of by them to suit their needs. About 100 seats have been allocated to the six growth stage start-ups in the first floor. Virtual incubation started for them about two months ago,” said Ravi. Explaining the operations of the hub, Ravi said that the centre would be operated as a not-for-profit entity – Section 8 company with board of directors. “Full time employees would take care of the operations. Experts from the industry and investors and officials from Andhra University would be drawn to get a right mix to guide, support and mentor the startups,” said Ravi Eswarapu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/au-incubation-hub-looks-to-drive-innovation-in-ap/articleshow/82185595.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

There are a large number of people who are holding out hope of defeating the virus and recovering every day. Septuagenarian Bhairao Prasad is one such person, who defeated the disease even after being hospitalised for six days. "On the fifth day of the home quarantine, I was feeling weak and my blood oxygen level was below 90%. As I also had other few co-morbidities, I was immediately rushed to the hospital and stayed there in the observation for six days. The doctors and nurses used to monitor my oxygen level, blood pressure, blood sugar level and temperature regularly. I was prescribed with several injections as well vitamin and zinc supplements tablets," Prasad told this newspaper. "Keep checking your oxygen level if you are Covid positive. Don't panic and get hospitalized only if it's needed," he suggested. Srishti Singh (21), an undergraduate student and a resident of Boring Road, fought the disease in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a hospital. "I was admitted to the hospital after testing positive for Covid-19. As I already had respiratory issues, I was taken directly to the ICU. Doctors and nursing staff used to examine my oxygen level, blood pressure, blood sugar and temperature regularly. I stayed under observation for five days." She added, "The second wave of the pandemic is hitting young people and making them weak. Don't step outside without any reason. Home is still a better place to recover from the virus than hospitals." Alka Prasad (48), housemaker at Patel Nagar, who was under home- quarantine for 14 days, said, "I preferred staying at home even after testing positive for the virus. I was isolated for 14 days. I used to check my oxygen level regularly. I would suggest everyone stay home as the second wave is more severe and life-threatening." According to the Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician Dr Arun Shah, immunized people can donate their plasma after the estimation of antibody present in their blood. "People who have fully recovered from Covid-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to donate plasma, which may help and save lives of other patients. Convalescent plasma must be collected only from the recovered people. Individuals must have had a prior diagnosis of Covid-19 documented by pathological laboratory and should meet other donor qualification tests as well. Individuals must have complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days before donation," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/its-not-all-gloomy-2nd-wave-covid-survivors-hold-out-hope/articleshow/82185187.cms||---

The district has total 2,014 active cases, including 346 detected on Tuesday. The district has logged as many as 10,670 Covid cases since the onset of pandemic last year and 39 persons have succumbed to the infection till date. Despite strict mask-checking drive and other Covid preventive actions, the district has witnessed a surge in cases with the number of infected people hovering around 300 or more each day over the last few days. Begusarai DM Arvind Kumar Verma said more than 400 people were found Covid positive on Wednesday as well, which will be the highest single-day caseload till date. Meanwhile, the number of Covid patients admitted in various private hospitals has also surged over the last few days. Despite, a closed plant here having started production of medical oxygen last week, a few hospitals are still citing difficulty in treatment of Covid patients even on Wednesday owing to short supply of oxygen. Verma, however, said its more out of panic than actual shortage as there is enough supply to meet the demand of oxygen. “To avert any crisis situation, the district administration has arranged a tanker full of oxygen. Further, 100 more cylinders of oxygen are expected to arrive by Thursday,” he said and added that there was no dearth of beds for Covid patients even in private as well as government hospitals. As per local health department officails, altogether 655 beds for Covid patients are available in the district, including 315 oxygen-equipped. As per information available till April 19, 46 patients were admitted in various private hospitals and 39 in the government hospitals. Ten patients died in April. As per the district health office, 120 people out of those tested positive for the virus in April have recovered and subsequently discharged as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-of-active-cases-crosses-2000-mark-in-begusarai/articleshow/82185082.cms||Rajiv Kumar

The board increased the crop size from last year’s 88 million kg to 97 million kg. Sources said Karnataka exerted pressure on the board to clear a higher crop size. The crop size for Karnataka was fixed at the board meeting chaired by Yadlapati Raghunatha Babu here on Monday. “We have decided to fix the crop size of Karnataka at 97 million kg keeping in view of demands of growers as well traders,” said Raghunatha Babu. He said that they have also taken the global demand into consideration before increasing the crop size. Tobacco board had authorised 99 million kg crop size for Karnataka for the 2020-21 crop season a little after the outbreak of Covid-19. After taking the seriousness of the pandemic into consideration, the board trimmed the size to 88 million kg. There is no big change in demand for the stock in the international market due the second wave of Covid-19. Trade analysts say the markets, particularly high tobacco-consuming nations, are yet to return to normalcy due to Covid-19 conditions. The demand for tobacco in global markets has dipped due to Covid-19. In this context, the board’s decision to increase the crop size before the threat of pandemic is over has surprised many insiders of the board. Sources said that tobacco growers in Karnataka who switched to ginger crop following the reduction of the crop size last year reported to have suffered heavy losses. Farmers associations demanded the board to bring their crop size back to pre-Covid levels. Sources said the exporters betting big on the AP stocks during the ongoing auctions might have prompted the board to go for higher crop size for Karnataka. Traders have started picking stocks in AP due to shortage from Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tobacco-board-raises-crop-size-for-ktaka-on-farmer-demand/articleshow/82185647.cms||Samdani MN

Mortgage finance major HDFC has entered into a pact with Indiabulls Housing Finance to co-lend under which the former will retain 80% of the loan on its books while the balance will be on Indiabulls’s books. Co-lending is a process in which two lenders come together, usually the smaller one originates the loan, performs credit appraisal and disburses a small amount of the total loan. After that the larger lender steps in to lend a bigger chunk of the loan. Under the current arrangement, Indiabulls Housing Finance will originate retail home loans according to jointly drawn-up credit policy and retain 20% of the loan on its books and 80% will be on HDFC books, a release from Indiabulls Housing Finance to the exchanges said. Indiabulls Housing Finance will service the loan account throughout the life cycle of the loan, it said. “Co-lending partnership with HDFC will act as a cornerstone to Indiabull’s new balance-sheet light growth business model.” Under this strategic co-lending partnership with Indiabulls Housing Finance to offer housing loans, homebuyers would get such loans at competitive rates, a release from HDFC said. “The participation by both the entities in extending the credit facilities shall be on a sharing of risk and reward basis on mutually agreed terms,” it said. Technology led co-lending is expected to help both companies to offer convenient and seamless experience to its customers as well as help expand their reach to tier-3and -4 cities, HDFC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-indiabulls-to-co-lend-home-loans/articleshow/82186652.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The service, which works as an intelligent layer over a bank account, is currently offered with an underlying savings account from Federal Bank. Speaking to TOI, Narayanan said that the bank account is targeted at salaried millennials and is positioned as a high-end salary account with all the features including zero minimum balance and free ATM withdrawals. According to the founders, they chose a savings bank account as the base because most personal finance involved either paying someone, investing money or borrowing and it is the bank account that offers all three features. “This is the first time that a reward programme has been structured to incentivise savings,” said Narayanan. According to Gwalani, the mobile application has automated a lot of tasks, like looking up an IFSC code, analysing transactions or choosing the best mode for fund transfer, which will encourage users to overcome the inertia of having to change their bank account. “There are 8 crore salaried individuals in the country and every year a large number of young people are graduating and getting into salaried jobs. We are looking at opening two to three million accounts in two years,” said Narayanan. epiFi, which is behind the Fi bank account, had raised $13.2 million in seed funding from Sequoia India and Ribbit Capital. Other investors included Hillhouse Capital and angel investors like David Velez, founder of Nubank, and Kunal Shah, founder and CEO of Cred.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/former-gpay-execs-set-to-launch-neobank-fi-soon/articleshow/82186669.cms||Mayur Shetty

Sources said the airline has planned to lay off 300 out of the 590-strong staff. These largely comprise loaders and drivers who have been employed for 3 to 15 years on fixed-term contract with SpiceJet to carry out ground handling work like loading/unloading cargo, baggage, and transporting passengers between terminal & aircraft. “On one hand, SpiceJet has bid for Air India and, on the other, they say they don’t have funds to pay full salaries or keep the employees on payroll. We served them a strike notice on Tuesday. They have 14 days now to resolve the issue,” said Arvind Sawant, president of Shiv Sena union Bharatiya Kamgar Sena (BKS). This is — a recognised union of SpiceJet ground handling staff. A SpiceJet spokesperson said, “The current Covid wave has severely impacted passenger demand and flight operations. In view of the massive uncertainty of demand created by the second wave of Covid in India, SpiceJet has outsourced partial ground operations at the Mumbai airport to CelebiNAS from May 1. As part of the arrangement, CelebiNAS will have a recruitment drive to absorb maximum support staff from SpiceJet to protect employees’ interest.” Sawant said that the airline management did not write to them or inform about the move. “On Monday, a subordinate suddenly announced that from April 26, 300 ground handling employees won’t work any longer for SpiceJet and that they should try to get absorbed in Celebi,” Sawant said, adding that neither has the airline paid full salaries for over a year now, nor has it paid the statutory annual bonus since 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/spicejets-ground-staff-to-go-on-strike-over-layoffs/articleshow/82186553.cms||---

Devotees worshipped Lord Ram at home, instead of thronging the temples. For the second consecutive year, the famous Mahavir Mandir near Patna Junction wore a dessert look due to the absence of devotees, who used to turn up in unprecedented numbers on the occasion. Mahavir Mandir Trust secretary Acharya Kishore Kunal said the sales of famous ‘naivedyam’ were down to just 1000kg as opposed to 40,000kg on Ram Navami in 2019. “Around 4 lakh people used to visit the temple. This time devotees could only watch the rituals performed by the priests through live darshan on the temple’s Facebook page,” he said. No ‘shobha yatras’ were taken out in the city this time, but people were seen offering prayers at the closed gates of many temples. “Since we are not allowed within the premises, I am lighting a ‘jyot’ at the entrance only,” said Kriti Kumari, who was praying outside the Panch Shiv Mandir in Kankarbagh. As Ram Navami also marks the culmination of Chaitra Navaratra, the nine days when Lord Ram and Goddess Durga are worshipped and also as the day when Lord Ram was born, Ram janmotsav was also celebrated by many people on the day. Renu Shree, a resident of Gola Road, said continuous ‘bhajan’ and ‘kirtan’ were sung from 10am to 12 noon at her residence. "All of us recite couplets from the Ramayana and sing religious songs to celebrate the birth of Ram,” she said. Mahima Mehta said, “We worship infant version of Lord Ram in a cradle, shower him with curd and milk and offer him his favourite food.” Some people who used to visit their native villages for Ram Navami puja and flag hoisting, avoided it this time owing to the second wave of Covid-19. Vishal Rathour of Gola Road said, “It’s a tradition to change the flag at my ancestral temple every year, but due to the pandemic it has not been changed for the last two years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-shobha-yatra-in-city-as-people-celebrate-ram-navami-at-home/articleshow/82185189.cms||---

Archaeological exploration and excavations of art objects, terracotta and stone ware, pottery, numismatic sources, Brahmi and Kharosthi inscriptions and Sanskrit, Prakrit literature mention the existence of a regional network of internal trade here over 2,000 years ago, which led to the beginning of international maritime trade in the Indian Ocean region. The findings also suggest Buddhism played a significant role in spreading Indian culture overseas. A study titled ‘Archaeological explorations of Kalingapatnam, Dantapur and Salihundam on the east coast of India’ was undertaken by marine scientists Sila Tripati and R Mani Murali from CSIR-NIO and archaeologist Rudra Prasad Behera and published in in 2019. Earlier, excavations in Salihundam had yielded remains like megalithic black and red ware, inscribed pottery, red polished ware, terracotta beads, single and double mast ship motif coins issued by the Satavahana rulers between 145 CE to 194 CE, punch-marked coins, Roman coins of Tiberius (14-37 CE), Satavahana and Puri-Kushan coins, Buddhist sculptures and stupas, viharas and chaityas dating back to the 3rd century BCE to 8th century CE. Three divisions of Buddhism, such as the Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana are documented at Salihundam. These finds indicate that Salihundam port had trade relations with the Romans and Southeast Asia. In another study prior to an underwater survey by NIO, a single-hole stone anchor from Kottapatnam port and lagoon site of Nellore was found. Here, Chinese pottery and an early 15th century coin of Emperor Taizong of the Ming dynasty, with Chinese script and a square hole, signify Kottapatnam had contacts with China from the 3rd century BCE until 15th century CE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/north-aps-link-to-the-romans-se-asia/articleshow/82185637.cms||Sulogna Mehta
---||Patna||Bihar: ‘Slight drop in mercury likely’||PATNA: Skies remain partly cloudy at Patna and most other places in the state on Wednesday and weathermen have predicted light isolated thundershowers, primarily in east Bihar. Rainfall is unlikely at Patna, but weathermen have claimed that residents can expect slight drop in temperature over the next 24-48 hours. An official at Patna Meteorological Centre attributed the slight change in weather conditions to moist easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal and a cyclonic circulation over Punjab. “Easterly winds blowing at the lower level of atmosphere are carrying moisture from the Bay of Bengal, whereas a cyclonic circulation has formed over Punjab due to western disturbance. Under the influence of the two weather systems, skies are most likely to be cloudy and it will shift to eastern parts of Bihar over the next 24 hours, which can lead to formation of thunderclouds along with squally wind and light rain at one or two places,” the official said. Maximum temperature across the state was hovering in the range of 38-41 degrees C on Wednesday. It was perhaps due to the partly cloudy skies that the maximum temperature at Patna was recorded at 35.5 degrees C, which was two notches lower than the corresponding normal. Gaya in south Bihar was tad cooler as the maximum temperature there was 37.1 degrees C, which was three notches lower than the corresponding normal. Forecast of rain or thundershowers towards afternoon or evening has been issued for Gaya for Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/slight-drop-in-mercury-likely/articleshow/82185143.cms||---

Forbes magazine informed Shriti through e-mail on Tuesday that she figures on its 30 under 30 Asia list-class of 2021, her father M N Pandey told TOI. The Forbes 30 under 30 Asia list features 30 bright and innovative millennial and Gen-Z leaders in 10 categories who have preserved and thrived despite global uncertainty. 29-year-old Shriti has been selected in the Industry, Manufacturing & Energy category. Shriti is the founder and CEO of Strawcture Eco, which is registered in Gorakhpur and has an office in Delhi, and her enterprise makes panels made of agri waste that are environment-friendly and low cost, sustainable and non-toxic. Strawcture Eco is one of the first Make-In-India companies committed to manufacturing carbon negative products. Her innovative idea also resolves the problem of crop residue burning that causes a lot of air pollution in the country and offers an eco-friendly housing model. Talking to TOI on Wednesday, Shriti said, “It was a real surprise for me when I received an email from Forbes regarding my selection in the 30 under 30 list from Asia.” “We make eco-friendly boards with compressed agri fibres that are then used in house construction and making furniture. The boards are acoustic, thermal, termite and moisture resistant,” she said. Shriti did her class X from Gorakhpur and class XII from Delhi and went on to do her masters in construction management from New York University. She returned to India and founded Strawcture Eco in 2018. She had earlier won SBI youth fellowship and worked in rural areas of Madhya Pradesh. In 2018, during UP startup Conclave at IIM, Lucknow, her innovative idea was acknowledged by the UP government and her project was included in the startup. The United Nations also appreciated her work in 2019 and honoured her as her technology aims at reducing pollution by compressing crop waste into agri fibre panels for industrial and commercial builds. Last year she was named a climate fellow by the New York-based nonprofit Echoing Green and received $90,000 in seed funding. At present we have 10-12 full time employees. I would like to hire more women in my firm but we rarely have women in this field. Even in the US, there were only six women in my class of 45. I will be happy to employ women if we get suitable candidates,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/gorakhpur-girl-shriti-pandey-brings-laurels-figures-on-forbes-list-2021/articleshow/82185988.cms||---

Serious Covid patients are sent to ANM Training School at Forbesganj, 24km away from the district headquarters, without even a single ventilator. The critical patients are referred to Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Medical College and Hospital (JNKTMCH), Madhepura. When asked about the ventilators lying idle at the Sadar hospital, Araria civil surgeon Dr MP Gupta attributed it to lack of technicians for which letters had been sent to the health department. “A well-equipped ambulance with an advanced life supporting system has been pressed into service for very serious patients,” he added. Meanwhile, Araria district had 432 active Covid patients, out of which six were kept at isolation centres in Forbesganj and two having breathing problem have been shifted to JNKTMCH for better treatment. Altogether 88 fresh Covid cases were detected in Araria on Tuesday, which was the highest in the district till date. Besides, at least 28 persons have died due to Covid in the district and about 582 people have been found positive in the last 20 days, out of which 424 were in home isolation. Despite strict measures being adopted by the district & sessions judge, Araria judicial division, about 5 employees of the civil court, including the steno of the district judge court, have also been found corona positive. With regard to vaccination, around 1,17,096 persons above 45 years of age have received the first dose and 18,945 got the second dose in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/six-ventilators-at-araria-sadar-hospital-gather-dust/articleshow/82185192.cms||L P Nayak
---||Business||Smartphone shipments may fall 10%-15%in Q1||CHENNAI: The second wave of the pandemic and resulting restrictions in Delhi, Mumbai and other locations is likely to dent smartphone shipments by almost 10%-15% in the period April-June as sales in these cities account for almost one-fourth of the total market. This will result in a loss of around 5 million units, estimates market tracker Counterpoint Research. However, the research firm said it is keeping its annual forecast for the year unchanged for now. “This estimate factors in that more states will likely have partial lockdowns. Smartphone demand is generally resilient and there are other variables at play like e-learning that may drive sales,” Tarun Pathak, director, Counterpoint Research, said. In April to June of 2020, India’s smartphone shipments declined by 51% year-on-year, as per Counterpoint’s data. While the nationwide lockdown wiped out shipments during April, pent-up demand helped lift May and June numbers. Prabhu Ram, head of industry intelligence, CMR, said the challenge for the smartphone makers is likely to be two-pronged stemming from both local Covid-related curfews in key markets as well as global supply chain hurdles leading to a shortage of components. “We currently anticipate a dip of 3-5 million in smartphone shipments in Q2 2021 (roughly 8-10%) owing to lockdown in key cities. If smartphone production were to get stalled in Noida, it would dent the impressive rebound that the industry enjoyed,” he said. Samsung, Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo all have their production hubs in Noida. On the retail side, the industry’s biggest slump is likely to come from the fact that e-commerce firms are only allowed to deliver essentials in key markets Delhi and Mumbai and e-retail currently contributes to almost 45% of the total smartphone sales. Demand is also likely to suffer as a result of increasing prices, a mobile retailer in Chennai said. “The component shortage has forced brands to decide to pass on cost to customers, and smartphone price hikes are set to take effect in the coming weeks,” the person said. Offline retail of smartphones too has been struggling for a year now. Arvinder Khurana, national president, All-India Mobile Retailers Association, said consumer behavior has changed drastically in favour of buying gadgets online and brands too have favored exclusive tie-ups with e-commerce sites, putting smartphone retailers in hard times. “Our business has already dropped by around 60% and if e-commerce is allowed to sell non-essentials like mobiles during the current restrictions, then many stores may never re-open post the lockdown,” he said. The real acid test would be to see how the situation is in May as that is typically the peak in the April-June quarter, Faisal Kawoosa, founder of research firm techARC said. “Last year, people scrambled for digital devices for a variety of uses but there is no major trigger this time in terms of pent-up demand and sentiment is down,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/smartphone-shipments-may-fall-10-15in-q1/articleshow/82186714.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Some states are facing a severe demand-supply mismatch for oxygen due to the soaring number of coronavirus cases. While Maharashtra is the top producer of oxygen in India followed by Gujarat, demand has outstripped supply in the two western states. On the other hand, Madhya Pradesh does not have a single oxygen manufacturing plant and has to depend on its neighbours for supplies. Coronavirus: Live updates“The two western states which manufacture the maximum liquid medical oxygen in the country are also the ones consuming it the most at present,” said Inox Air Products director Siddharth Jain. The company, a 50:50 joint venture between the Jain family and American liquid medical oxygen producer Air Products, has 27 plants in India, of which four are in Maharashtra and three in Gujarat. Read AlsoHealth ministry floats global tender to import 50,000 MT of liquid medical oxygenNEW DELHI: As India is facing an acute shortage of oxygen supply at hospitals designated for Covid patients, the government on Wednesday floated a short-term global tender to import 50,000 metric ton of Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO). The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has floated this global“Excess oxygen is available in other regions like Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha. But the challenge is logistics (storage and distribution system),” Jain added. He lauded the initiative by the Indian Railways of a roll-on, roll-off (RoRo) train on which empty cryogenic tankers will be ferried to oxygen-surplus destinations and then delivered to states needing it. “Oxygen, which is air, is just around you, it need not travel. But this (transporting liquid O2 from East to West through RoRo) has never been done anywhere in the world. Liquid oxygen is not designed to travel thousands of kilometers. Usually, plants are set up where there is a requirement (like in industrial locations),” Jain explained. Read AlsoDelhi oxygen quota hiked, but situation still criticalThe unprecedented crisis of hospitals in Delhi running out of oxygen continued for the second day with many of them, which have hundreds of critical Covid patients on oxygen support, sending out distress calls that they had just enough stocks for a few hours. It was touchand-go whether they wouldIndia produces 7,000 tons of liquid oxygen a day. Of this, Inox Air Products manufactures 2,000 tons. On people complaining about shortage of oxygen (though Inox Air claims its availability), Jain said, “People need to understand that this is not the government’s fault or the government’s doing. There is a supply-demand variance where some states have excess supply.” In the pre-Covid period, 20% of the total oxygen production was sold to the healthcare sector. Post-Covid, this increased to 70% when the infection wave peaked last September. Now, the entire production caters only to the medical industry. Talking about metal producers, refineries and other manufacturers diverting oxygen supplies to hospitals, and a possible impact on their productions, Jain said, “Certain industries will have to sacrifice. But it will be short-lived, maybe for a month or two.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-has-enough-oxygen-but-transport-a-problem/articleshow/82186506.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Several private hospitals as well as government facilities have been prescribing Remdesivir and asking relatives of the patients to procure it from the market. People are forced to pay higher rates on the black market to keep their loved ones alive. Shivangi Mishra, whose mother was admitted at a private hospital on Annie Besant Road, said, “The doctors have asked to arrange six shots of Remdesivir. But affording Rs15,000 per shot is difficult for me. The state government and the administration need to interfere and assure the supply of required drugs at the crisis time,” she said. Rashmi Pathak, who was also desperately trying to arrange Remdesivir, said, “We are struggling to find its vials in Patna and can only buy it for Rs 20,000 each vial on the black market. There is no preparedness of state government to tackle the situation. Instead, they are waiting for more casualties to happen before they make Remdesivir adequately available for Covid patients.” The Indian Medical Association (Bihar) has repeatedly asked the health department to make arrangement for Remdesivir and provide oxygen supply to all private hospitals treating Covid patients. IMA (Bihar) secretary Dr Sunil Kumar said not a single vial of Remdesivir was available in the shops. “However, it is being sold on the black market. Same is the case with the oxygen cylinder. Private hospitals have less than 50% supply of oxygen. Due to the crisis, they are not able to treat the patients and forced to discharge them. Besides, the gas agencies are supplying oxygen at high rates,” he said. “IMA national president Dr Sahjanand Prasad Singh also met the health minister and raised these issues, but the situation in hospitals are still the same,” he added. When the families of Covid patients are not able to find a hospital bed, doctors are advising them to arrange oxygen cylinders at home. The oxygen cylinder rate has also skyrocketed to Rs20,000-25,000 per cylinder. Even the portable ones at chemist shops are being sold at Rs5,000. IMA’s former president Dr Raiv Ranjan Prasad said, “People who failed to get beds in the hospitals are now acquiring oxygen cylinders from touts as there is a huge demand of oxygen. This situation arises due to disproportionate demand and supply of oxygen.” One Ram Kumar (name changed) said his elder brother was admitted at a private hospital in Kankarbagh. As the hospital was facing acute shortage of oxygen, the family was asked to arrange oxygen cylinders. “The hospital earlier asked us to get the patients discharged but as the other hospitals are not taking patients, it asked to arrange oxygen. I tried 3-4 agencies, but they said I have to deposit Rs8,000 as security money and pay up to Rs15,000 for an oxygen cylinder,” he said. Aniket Shukla from Bhagalpur said the agency was asking Rs14,000 for a cylinder and they had to pay to save someone’s life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oxygen-cylinders-remdesivir-being-sold-on-black-market/articleshow/82185040.cms||Faryal Rumi

A 78-year-old elderly man and his son were turned away by Baranagar state general hospital thrice and were told to come after a week when they went there with severe Covid symptoms to get their test done. An elderly couple has already missed their second dose of Covid vaccine and has been told by multiple private hospitals to enquire after two weeks as they have run out of Covid vaccines. Horror stories have been coming up from different sections of society as the state crossed the 10,000 infections-a-day mark on Wednesday. While the state is reeling under a severe scarcity of beds, stories of sufferings were reported from all quarters — be it testing, deaths or the vaccination process. At Chinsurah, the family had to keep the body of the elderly man at the morgue for three days before they could finally cremate him at Shyambabu Ghat on Tuesday. “The man’s son had to visit the crematorium on three days. On the first two days, he was told there were others in the queue. On the third day, the family was told the electric pyre had developed a snag that ultimately got repaired late in the evening,” said a close acquaintance of the family. At Baranagar’s Tobin Road, Tirthankar Mukherjee (34) and his 78-year-old father have been suffering from fever since last Friday. When they went to Baranagar State General Hospital to get their test done, they were turned down the first day, saying the registration time was already over. “We went again for the next two days but on each day, we were turned down saying the hospital was testing only 50 people and there was a queue of several hundreds. The hospital said as per my registration, our turn could come only around the weekend. I took my father to a private hospital on EM Bypass on Tuesday where we waited for five hours before we got tested but are yet to get a report,” said Mukherjee. Vaccination for elderly persons has also become a prime concern with hundreds of elderly people complaining of missing their second dose of Covid vaccine. “I had a scheduled second dose of vaccination of Covaxin at a private hospital off EM Bypass but the hospital said they didn’t have enough stock and asked us enquire in the first week of next month. We even tried to get vaccinated at government hospitals and KMC health centres before finally managing to get the jab on Wednesday, after waiting for more than four hours,” said Sujit Mondal, a Thakurpukur resident .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-tests-to-last-rites-families-go-through-a-tough-time-at-every-step/articleshow/82185978.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Varanasi||VMC creates new cremation groundat Samne Ghat to tackle Covid rush||Revised Varanasi: Manikarnika and Harishchandra ghats, known as ‘mahashamshanas’ (cremation grounds) of Kashi, have proved insufficient in size and capacity for holding last rites of bodies following the second wave of Covid-19. In view of the massive increase in influx of dead bodies leading to long queues for cremation at these two ghats where pyres keep burning round the clock, the district administration and Varanasi Municipal Corporation have to create a new cremation ground at Samne Ghat in Ganga upstream. Talking to TOI on Wednesday, municipal commissioner Gaurang Rathi said, “Bodies of Covid-19 patients dying in hospitals are mainly taken to Harishchandra Ghat as it has both CNG crematorium and wooden pyre cremation facility. If CNG crematorium is operated round the clock, 25 bodies can be cremated here while additional arrangements for cremating 25 bodies have also been made by the VMC at this ghat.” The arrangements by the VMC have been made for cremation of mainly the bodies of persons dying due to Covid or other ailment during treatment in hospitals. “As a huge number of bodies are reaching at Harischandra and Manikarnika Ghats, the queue for cremation is stretching longer. In view of the increased load on these two ghats, it was decided to make additional arrangement at Samne Ghat. Under the new arrangements made so far, at Samne Ghat 10 bodies can be cremated in a day. This new site of cremation was started on Tuesday with the cremation of five bodies of Covid patients,” he added. Manager of Mahashamshan Nath temple at Manikarnika Ghat Gulshan Kapoor said, “In normal days around 80-100 bodies are cremated at Manikarnika Ghat while these figures go up to three time in harsh weather condition during summers, winter and also flood seasons every year. But, despite no extreme heat conditions more than 250 bodies are reaching here on an average per day with fresh surge in Covid-19 menace.” Rambabu, involved in trade of articles used for cremation at Harischandra Ghat, said the number of bodies coming for cremation have increased by three times than normal days. While around 50 bodies used to reach here normally, the number has increased to 150 for past 10 days. The massive rise in the number of bodies at two mahashamshanas has not only led to shortage especially of pyre woods, but many people involved in trade of cremation articles have started taking undue advantage of the situation resulting in massive overcharging. Rathi said, “To check the problem of overpricing, we fixed price of cremation at CNG crematorium and also on wooden pyres.” The district administration and police also displayed the rate board for cremation at ghats and warned action against those involved in overpricing. Though Rathi was personally monitoring all these exercises and massive sanitization work was also done in the vicinity of new cremation ghat at Samne Ghat for both Covid and non-Covid bodies, a section of people from nearby areas like Maderwa also started opposing this move of cremation there by writing a letter to the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/vmc-creates-new-cremation-groundat-samne-ghat-to-tackle-covid-rush/articleshow/82185980.cms||---

Liquor is banned in Bihar since April 5, 2016. The matter came to light during a probe into a complaint lodged by one Srikant Kumar with state excise commissioner B Kartikey Dhanji following his detention and subsequent release. Srikant was caught by three constables — Vinay Kumar, Pravin Kumar and Manish Kumar — of the excise and prohibition department when he was carrying a bottle of liquor near Churi Market under Kadamkuan police station in the state capital on April 10. The constables allegedly demanded Rs1 lakh for his release. The alleged bootlegger contacted his accomplices who struck a deal with the cops. Srikant was let off without any formal complaint after an alleged payment of Rs70,000 as a bribe to the constables. Later, Srikant’s relatives approached the excise commissioner with evidence against the constables. Taking a serious note of the complaint, the excise commissioner ordered a probe. During investigation, the allegations against the three were found to be true. On Wednesday, the erring cops were suspended and departmental proceedings were initiated against them. “The disciplinary action was taken on the basis of evidence against them,” a senior excise department officer said. According to a directive issued by the excise and prohibition department, the three constables will remain attached to the office of assistant excise commissioner of Bhagalpur during the period of suspension. “The report was submitted to the excise commissioner within a week of the probe order. However, the action was taken against them today,” a senior excise department official confided, on the condition of anonymity. As many as 2,55,111 cases related to the violation of Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 have been lodged and 3,39,401 people have been arrested since April, 2016. A record 51.7 lakh litres of countrymade liquor and 94.9 lakh litres of India-made foreign liquor have been seized by the police and excise department officials in the state.

Zoho has opened around 20 satellite offices of roughly 20-30 seater capacity each in rural districts across TN, Kerala, Andhra and Bihar in the last one year, and is now working to scale these to 100-seater hubs, while also planning to open 100 more such offices.Additionally, Zoho is taking its rural revival focus global. The SaaS company is opening rural offices in Texas, Mexico, and in two locations in the European Union, and says it already has a non-urban office in Japan.A recent study by the Economix Consulting Group (ECG) (commissioned by Zoho) has found that the company’s presence at Tenkasi — its first rural entry — has resulted in an rise in overall income, employment and education, and community development in the district. Zoho set up a R&D hub in Tenkasi in 2011 with a six-member team and its product Zoho Desk was created and launched from Tenkasi in 2016. Over the last 10 years, its presence at Tenkasi has grown to around 500 of which 18% are women. Zoho Schools of Learning (ZSL), the company’s alternative education arm for training and hiring talent, is also present in Tenkasi.The local administrative officials interviewed for the study said, Zoho is a key reason for Tenkasi being given a district status. New housing facilities have come up to accommodate Zoho employees, the company’s organic farming initiatives has also increased awareness amongst locals and farmers.Similarly, almost 50% of Zoho’s vendors/clients in the region said they were able to ‘improve education and healthcare of their family’ being associated with Zoho.When it comes to uplifting women, around 64% of Zoho’s women employees at Tenkasi reported ‘spending more on themselves’ since their employment.As for employees hailing from Tenkasi, Tirunelveli, and surrounding areas, 67% said they now support family or friends (monetarily or otherwise) since working with Zoho. ECG’s study involved around 7,300 minutes of interactions with 300 stakeholders. “Concentration of jobs in urban cities has taken away talented youth from the villages where they are most needed. By bringing high-paying jobs to villages, Zoho is helping restore the talent where it belongs,” says Sridhar Vembu, co-founder and CEO, Zoho Corp. “We have over 1,000 job openings to be filled and we are actively recruiting. Most of our hiring is based in our rural centres with a strong training and skill creation focus,” he added. Vembu moved out of Silicon Valley last year before the pandemic struck and settled in Tenkasi to personally lead the rural upliftment vision. Not just rural talent but a few of Zoho’s employees from Chennai — who share the company’s vision — have moved to the centres and serve as anchors for the new rural offices, Vembu added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zoho-bets-on-hinterland-pushes-revival-plans/articleshow/82186741.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Instead, ‘K-Juice Grape’ — marketed by Kalis Sparkling Water — will be subject to GST at 28% as the Appellate Authority for Advance Rulings (AAAR) has held it to be a ‘Carbonated beverage with fruit juice’. While the company had earlier contended that their product is a thermally processed fruit beverage, complying with para 2.3.10 of the FSSAI regulations, the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) had held otherwise. This order of the AAR has now been upheld at the appellate level. The AAAR distinguished the case on hand from an order of the Supreme Court, which was given in the case of Appy Fizz — a fruit juice-based drink. In that case, the apex court had given a finding that fruit juice-based drinks are not treated as ‘aerated branded soft drinks’ as they have a separate entry (classification). However, the AAAR pointed out that the Supreme Court’s order will not apply as it is evident that K-Juice Grape is a carbonated fruit beverage, as marketed by the company. While it contains fruit juice, it is not a fruit pulp or fruit juice-based drink. Interestingly the AAAR also indicates in its ruling that the pre-GST tax incidence on carbonated fruit beverages was much higher at 40%. In yet another case relating to beverages, flavoured milk was recently held to be a ‘beverage containing milk’, subject to GST at 12%. This ruling was given by the Gujarat bench of the AAR in the case of Vadilal Industries. On the other hand, earlier the Karnataka AAR had held flavoured milk to fall in the category of ‘milk and cream, concentrated or containing added sugar or other sweetening matter’, which attracts a lower GST of 5%. According to indirect tax experts, the classification-related tussles continue under the GST regime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/carbonated-grape-juice-to-face-28-gst-rules-aaar/articleshow/82186565.cms||---

Earlier this year, the district had a requirement for medical oxygen of 65 MT a day, which gradually increased to 85 MT. “We now need 139MT of oxygen per day. We are taking all the efforts to get the oxygen but there are limitations,” Bhujbal said. The Nashik civic body has installed two large oxygen tanks at its Bytco and Zakir Hussain hospitals with a total capacity of 32,000 litres of liquid oxygen. They also get regular supply of oxygen from a Pune-based company, an Indian subsidiary of the Japanese firm with which they have done a 10-year contract.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh farmers get Rs 128 crore in zero-interest loans||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday credited Rs 128.47 crore directly into the accounts of 6,27,906 farmers under ‘YSR Zero-Interest Crop Loan Scheme’ for 2019-20 Rabi season. The loans were paid to those who availed loans up to Rs 1 lakh in the previous season and repaid them in the stipulated time. Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said that promoting agriculture would create employment for 62 per cent of the population in the state. He said the state government’s objective is to prioritise the welfare of farmers and farm labour. Since the government came to power in June 2019, a total of Rs 1,132 crore was paid to 61,22,585 farmers under the zero-interest subsidy scheme. He urged the farmers to get enrolled under the e-crop database for availing interest subvention from June 2021. The chief minister said that the government has been providing nine hours of free electricity to the farmers during the day benefiting over 18.78 lakh farmers by spending Rs 8,800 crore annually. Through this scheme, each farmer will be saving a minimum of Rs 46,000 every year. The state government has completed the capacity building of feeders to provide free power to farmers with a cost of Rs 1,700 crore. Jagan Mohan Reddy stated that almost all the promises made to the farmer community have been fulfilled in the 22-month governance starting with YSR Rythu Bharosa, the first promise of Navaratnalu, benefiting 51.59 lakh farmers at an expenditure of Rs 13,101 crore. The government has set up over 10,641 Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) to benefit farmers in numerous ways, standing by the farmers from seeds to marketing. Moreover, the government is providing input subsidy to the farmers to cover losses in the same crop season and credited Rs 1,055 crore, added Jagan Mohan Reddy. The state government had set up a market intervention fund with Rs 3,000 crore and is providing a minimum support price for the crops to aid farmers. Minister K Kannababu, principal secretary for agriculture Poonam Malakondaiah, AP Agri Mission vice-chairman MVS Nagi Reddy, officials of agriculture and marketing were among those present at the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-farmers-get-rs-128cr-in-zero-interest-loans/articleshow/82167567.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Chandigarh||Art in underpass, ‘birds’ on roundabout create a flutter||Chandigarh: With seemingly endless pandemic playing on, the city’s Sector 17 has been wearing a forlorn, deserted look unlike its previous pulsating crowds. However, the two recent developments have sneaked in some art and vibrancy into the city heart. The hugely over-scaled pedestrian underpass connecting the Sector 17 Plaza with the Rose Garden is rather sparsely used for the purpose it was originally intended for. But it has found an interesting function by default. The immensely large covered space open to the public has emerged as a favourite venue for holding art exhibitions and other such events in the city currently. The credit goes to the ingenuity and grit of the city’s cultural organisations as the city’s museums padlocked during the lockdowns and they discovered the underpass to be a unique ‘inside-outside space’ which is easily accessible to the public during the Covid-19 restrictions to become a venue for putting up art shows etc. Innovative display stands holding up art canvases or other exhibits have brought art to the people - if the museums won’t deliver it. Such mobile art displays also open up myriad other possibilities of ‘art in the park or plazas’ as future happenings. Adding to the popularity of this ‘passage to art’ is the interesting scale and enclosure of its forecourt as one descends down below from the plaza. The court has become a popular space for holding impromptu public performances. It’s usually abuzz with cheering crowds as amateur singers’ belt out popular Bollywood songs or skaters display ballet dancing in sync to the lilting melodies resonating with the air. Spaces like these are the echo-chambers of a city speaking to itself. Another art happening in the city occurred recently, barely a few hundred metres away from the underpass. The city’s Matka Chowk roundabout at the intersection of the two most important avenues - Jan Marg and Madhya Marg - acquired an evocative art installation called ‘murmurations’. The chowk for years has been defined by a domical, pitcher-like container spewing out water from its mouth and trickling down below in cascades. Once upon a time laden with flowers during spring time, the show-piece feature went into decay and neglect for years. The cacophonic traffic noises, blaring horns and frayed nerves of the marauding drivers were the only ambient sounds. But recently a makeover of this nodal roundabout happened with the installation of an imaginative art feature there. The installation called ‘murmurations’ is inspired by a flock of birds in flight, symbolising freedom of the human spirit. A ring of ‘birds’ perched atop steel poles of varying, asymmetrical heights, encircles the central water pitcher to become a metaphor for the mortal quest for the skies. Perhaps, its enigmatic composition will evoke its own interpretation by every onlooker in his own idiom. At night, subtle illumination metamorphoses ‘murmurations’ into nocturnal abstractions of light and voids. Initially, there were some apprehensions that the closely spaced steel rods would perhaps obliterate the grand vista, but these have been allayed by the diaphanous curtain created by the rods rather than any opacity. Even though the full concept of the installation as was initially envisaged, replacing the ‘matka’ with a better art form and making the birds more conspicuous than their perches is yet to be realised, it’s aesthetically exciting enough to be fulfilled. Finally, the city lights up with murmurs of art.

Keeping that in mind, the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) has set up neighbourhood work cocoons in three places in New Town, which will be launched soon after the elections, for people to work in a convenient working environment, a few steps from their houses. The air conditioned set ups will have WiFi facilities, work tables, café corner and a library with sitting arrangements for about 18 people with proper social distancing following the Covid safety protocols. People using the cocoons will be charged Rs 20 per hour. It was during the lockdown last year that Hidco came up with the idea to set up these work cocoons with the help of architect Abin Chaudhuri and his team. “The whole idea is to reach to ones’ workplace quickly, maintaining social distance without the need of using public transport by walking or cycling,” said a Hidco official. The spots where the cocoons are being set up are opposite Nazrul Tirtha, New Town bus stand in Action Area I and another in Action Area II.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/work-cocoons-to-make-wfh-easy/articleshow/82185981.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Meerut||11 patients shifted after hospital runs out of oxygen||MEERUT: A private hospital ran out of oxygen on Wednesday prompting the authorities to shift at least 11 Covid-19 patients to two medical colleges in Meerut. The authorities blamed demand supply gap for the crisis. According to ADM (city) Ajay Tiwari, “There is a sudden surge in demand for oxygen cylinders. It is simple mathematics of supply and demand. But additional plants are being installed at many places including Meerut Medical College which should get functional in 5-6 days.” Meanwhile, a patient, who was in a serious condition a day before the incident, and was shifted due to oxygen shortage to Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College, died on Wednesday. “My brother in-law was 47 years old. He was not even provided with oxygen support when he needed it desperately. When his condition worsened, he was referred to LLRM Medical College where he died. The private hospital was only concerned with making quick money out of the misery of patients. If they did not have proper facilities why they were made Covid-19 hospital,” asked Nitin Sabrangi, whose relative died a day before due to the alleged callousness of the hospital. Despite several attempts, hospital staff cannot be contacted. Chief medical officer Dr Akhilesh Mohan said, “Out of 11 patients one was already referred to LLRM Medical College while the rest were sent to Mulayam Singh Yadav Medical College. We have restored the supply of oxygen to the said hospital and most of the patients have returned now. We are ensuring the crisis does not repeat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/11-patients-shifted-after-hospital-runs-out-of-oxygen/articleshow/82185203.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra adds over 1,000 deaths in 2 days||MUMBAI: The state reported 568 Covid-19 deaths on Wednesday, the highest so far. The highest single-day death count before now was 519 deaths on Tuesday. In just two days, the state reported over 1,000 deaths, taking the month’s total to 6,983 and its death rate to 0.5%. The Covid-19 death toll in the city rose by 62 on Wednesday. The city added 7,654 cases, which was lower than 8,000 for the third day in a row. The state added 67,468 cases, the second-highest number so far, taking the total cases to 40.2 lakh. A state government official said that of the 568 deaths reported on Wednesday, 303 occurred in 48 hours and 160 were from last week. The remaining 105 occurred more than a week ago. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said cases in Mumbai had shown signs of plateauing. “Even though deaths are higher in April, the case fatality rate for Mumbai hasn’t increased beyond 0.5%-0.6%,” she said. Covid deaths usually peak a fortnight after a peak in daily cases, which in Mumbai’s case was on April 4 (11,206). Around 50,000 tests are conducted in Mumbai every day. The deaths in the Mumbai administrative circle, which includes nine municipal corporation areas, increased to 150 from 115 a day before. The daily caseload here was 16,491. As per the state government’s Covid update, 40 people died in Mumbai’s neighbouring Raigad. TOI has learnt that all the deaths did not occur in one day. Raigad collector Nidhi Chaudhari said: “There has been a marginal rise in daily deaths. It was 13 deaths on Sunday and 20 deaths on Wednesday. There is a rise in mortality and also the number of Covid patients because there has been increase in testing, when even co-morbid persons are detected by contact tracing.” The BMC on Wednesday rushed oxygen supply to Hindu Mahasabha Hospital, Ghatkopar, after the management stated that it had stocks only for one and half hours for 60 patients who needed it. In Palghar, where over 20,000 patients have been added to the overall caseload in 20 days, the administration has taken the decision to not allow home quarantine for those above 45 years of age. Thane city recorded 1,266 cases and 10 deaths on Wednesday.

The team will submit a report within a week. District collector Antar Singh Nehra on Tuesday sent a show-cause notice to the school authorities for violating the guidelines. Meanwhile, parents’ association had filed an FIR against the school for not following Covid protocol. On Monday, a team of district education officer went to the school after receiving a complaint that practical examination of class XII was being conducted despite Covid-related restrictions in the state. The issue was found to be true and the school was asked to close immediately. The school claimed that they had taken permission from the collector, but the latter refuted these claims. An official of the Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights said, “Through media reports, we found about the violation of the Covid guidelines. As the violation of calling students was found to be true thereby risking the lives of the children in times of pandemic, we have taken cognizance of the matter and a fact finding team will look into the incident which will submit its report in seven days time.” As the commission has started virtual registration of complaints till May 3, officals have asked persons to connect with them through the portal as well as the whatsapp number. However, in some cases like this one, the commission has taken cognizance of the incidents which have been reported in media and action has been taken accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-panel-takes-cognizance-of-norm-violation-by-school/articleshow/82186945.cms||---

They claimed even though the government has allowed labourers to work on site, construction is happening at snail’s pace in the absence of materials. The letter received by the UDH department reads, “Breaking of supply chain is one of the most crucial factors which has affected the availability of important materials like cement, steel, electrical material, flooring tiles, sanitary items, plumbing material, windows of aluminium etc., manufacturing of which are primarily outside Rajasthan. The work cannot be expedited till supply is not smooth. The government should take steps in this regard.” The developers registered with RERA have also asked for one year extension as many equipment like elevators are obtained from overseas, which in the near future doesn’t seem possible. The effective supply of raw materials is likely to take more than 10-12 months post the situation settles. Many claimed that after the first lockdown, many labourers migrated to their home towns. Labourers, who had gone back to their homes in March 2020, are yet to return, causing hardship in completing the work. They are not likely to return for the next 10-12 months post the situation settles. “People of different states are experts in different work like people of Rajasthan are experts in brick work and flooring work, people of Odisha are experts in plumbing work, people of West Bengal are experts in plastering etc. It will be difficult to have them collectively available at the same time in order to execute the work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/builders-face-shortage-of-raw-materials-in-state/articleshow/82186942.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Pyre wood prices shoot up after sudden rise in demand||PRAYAGRAJ: The pyre wood sellers at the crematoriums in the city are finding it difficult to create a buffer stock to meet the increased demand as the number of bodies coming for cremation has shot up. Since the demand for pyre wood has increased manifold in the past fortnight, the prices have also gone up steeply, so much so that there have been instances of heated discussion between mourners and the wood sellers. The cremation grounds at Daraganj Ghat, Rasoolabad ghat and Phaphamau, which handle the bulk of funerals, have sought additional stock of wood from Trans-Ganga, -Yamuna areas and neighbouring Kaushambi. Shyam, a wood stockist at Daraganj ghat, told TOI, “The demand has suddenly shot up in the past fortnight and we are buying wood from Trans-Ganga, -Yamuna and Kaushambi. The price of wood has also increased by Rs 300 to 400 per quintal.” He also said, “Earlier we used to keep 500-600 quintals wood and were able to meet demand, but had to increase our stock to 800 to 900 quintals after the rise in demand. Our suppliers have hiked prices due to surge in demand and so we have passed it on to our customers.” A wood seller at Phaphamau ghat said, “Around four-five quintals of wood is required for one cremation. Since the rates of wood have increased, the cost of wood for one cremation has shot up to Rs 6,000 to 8,000 from Rs 3,000 to 4,000 earlier.” Mourners think they are being overcharged and some videos of heated arguments over prices have gone viral on social media. In some instances, the kin of the dead were forced to carry wood on their personal vehicles to ghats for cremation as sellers refused to provide any transportation. Police and local administration have also received complaints of overcharging. A senior official said policemen have been assigned duty to check overcharging and action would be in case any overpricing comes to light. The electronic crematoriums have also been working round-the-clock for the past five days. An official posted at the Daraganj electric crematorium said, “The number of bodies coming for creation has doubled since April 14.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pyre-wood-prices-shoot-up-after-sudden-rise-in-demand/articleshow/82186060.cms||Kapil Dixit

An official of the organisation said that all beds will be equipped with oxygen and 500 bed will be available in the first phase in a couple of days. Dr Naresh Arora, the medical services co-ordinator of the ashram, said that the shed was used for the weekly satsang congregations before the pandemic. “The Covid Care Centre will be a joint effort with Delhi government,” he said. Joginder Sukheja, the social welfare secretary of the organisation, said, “We will provide the beds, food supply, air cooling system while the government has assured that they will take care of the medical equipment and healthcare personnel.” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain has visited the site twice to take stock of the progress. After his Wednesday visit, he said that the preparations are proceeding at full speed. “The facility will be made available soon,” he said. With an exponential rise in the number of Covid cases that is overwhelming city’s medical infrastructure, various premises of socio-religious organisations, schools and sports facilities are being turned into Covid Care Centres. Preparations are a race against time as relatives of gasping patients helplessly search for empty beds in hospitals across city. At 9pm on Thursday, Delhi’s bed availability app displayed that 4,648 out of 4,663 ICU beds were occupied. An ashram official said that it will take 3-4 days for the facility to start taking in patients. Medical officers and para-medical staff will be provided by Indo Tibetan Border Police. Touted as the biggest Covid Care Centre of India, the facility closed this February. In the last stint, the facility treated more than 11,500 patients, official said. Across east Delhi, Delhi government has turned the Commonwealth Games Village into a Covid Care Centre for the treatment of patients. The makeshift hospital is equipped with 436 beds, including 210 with oxygen facility. In northwest part of city, a 50-bed Covid Care Center has been started at Venkateswara Global School, Rohini. The school building has been converted with help from Delhi government. “Under the supervision of doctors of Bhagwati Hospital, the facility will have oxygen-equipped beds for Covid patients. Patient admitted to this center will be admitted to Bhagwati Hospital, Rohini, if the condition is critical,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/satsang-shed-in-burari-to-house-1000-oxygen-beds/articleshow/82204006.cms||Paras Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: State may grant transgenders one-time assistance of Rs 1,500||Mumbai: The state social justice department is contemplating a one-time Rs 1,500 financial assistance for transgenders in view of the hardships brought on by the Covid pandemic. Ravindra Kadam-Patil, deputy commissioner of social justice, has written to all divisional deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners, asking them to gather information on the number of transgenders in their respective jurisdiction, an estimated impact of the aid on the state exchequer, and the process through which the aid needs to be disbursed, whether it should be provided through direct benefit transfer (DBT). He said the required information should be submitted by April 26 on priority with a proper proposal and subsequently, the administrative process will be initiated, and the proposal will be tabled, stated the letter. The state government has already announced similar assistance of Rs 1,500 to various economically disadvantaged groups including hawkers, construction workers and autorickshaw drivers. An organisation of transgenders, Dai Welfare Society, though, said the amount is paltry and the state should consider an aid of at least Rs 5,000 for each transgender. Rani (Ambre), president of Dai Welfare Society, told TOI the transgender community suffered several problems during the last lockdown and may have to face them again. “It is good to hear that the state government is considering helping out the community. If it’s a one-time assistance, Rs 1,500 is too little. At least Rs 5,000 should be considered,” said Rani. She suggested the state should adopt the DBT method, even though a few who do not have ration, Aadhar or PAN cards and thus could not open bank accounts. “Authorities should pay them in cash,” she said, adding there are around five lakh transgenders in Maharashtra, of whom over a lakh are in Mumbai. One said most of them are deprived of basic health facilities. “Transgenders do not expect any government or private jobs,” she said.

---||Pune||Gultekdi Market Yard starts functioning at 50% capacity||Pune: Authorities at the Gultekdi Market Yard reported that the crowd had reduced drastically due to the new set of measures, including operating 50% of 1,000 shops on alternate days, which came into effect from Wednesday to contain the spread of Covid-19.Only registered retail vendors are being allowed to visit Market Yard to pick up groceries, fruits, vegetables and other farm produce, while retail sale for common customers has been banned for now. Normally, the wholesale market witnesses around 15,000 visitors every day from Pune as well as adjoining districts. The authorities were expecting the number of visitors to reduce to half due to the alternate-day arrangement.The measure was also decided after Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta visited Gultekdi Market Yard on Monday to review crowd management arrangements and other issues.Madhukant Garad, secretary of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) and chief administrator of the Market Yard, said, “We saw a total of 826 vehicles bringing 17,788 quintals of agricultural produce on Wednesday. This is sufficient to meet the requirement from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. There was no abnormal fluctuation in the price of farm produce.”“By 8.30 am, about 85 percent of the total produce that had arrived at the market was auctioned without any issue. There was enough space for vehicles to load the produce. Around 11 am, internal roads at the market were totally empty,” added Garad. APMC authorities have curtailed the number of staffers allowed to work at each shop in the market. It has started inspecting shops on a daily basis.“On Tuesday, we had charged 15 commission agents’ shops and collected over Rs 40,000 as fine amount from them. A similar drive will continue in the market to ensure that the agents follow and adhere to social distancing norms,” said Dattatray Kalamkar, head of the vegetables section of the market.Further, the APMC has allowed wholesale grocery shops to function only between 7 am and 11 am. “At the same time, wholesale shops will be allowed to operate between 8 am and 4 pm. So that license holder grocery traders can purchase grocery items smoothly at the market yard,” added Garad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gultekdi-market-yard-starts-functioning-at-50-capacity/articleshow/82186948.cms||Sandip Dighe

We have been at the station since 7am trying to get confirmed tickets. Even the general tickets we bought are on the wait list. We are hoping that our tickets will be confirmed by evening. The officials said that getting a sleeper class confirmed ticket was next to impossible. ‘Lagta hai hamara koi bhagwan nahi hai dekhne waala (It seems we have no God to take care of us),” Singh told TOI. A few yards away, many people are seen filling reservation forms for different trains. A crowd mills around a middle-aged man, who promises to make things work for them on return for some extra money. He tells those following him to be seated on the stairs leading to the reservation centre and then disappears inside. “We all are travelling to either Bihar or Uttar Pradesh. We have been trying to get reserved tickets, but in vain. Today this person showed up and he promised us reserved tickets for Rs200 extra. We don’t want to be stuck here without food and shelter if a lockdown happens,” one of them said. The railways have made it clear that only those with confirmed tickets will be allowed to board trains. On Wednesday, the Central Railway announced two additional trains from Pune to Gorakhpur in UP and from Pune to Bhagalpur in Bihar. “I have been working in Pune for over two years as a security guard. My mother doesn’t want me to return and as some people in my village have decided not to let in anyone coming from places with huge Covid patients. How can I survive here when I have been fired from my job and a lockdown appears imminent? At least, I can live on the village outskirts,” Sudhir Ojha, who hails from Lakhisarai district in Bihar, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/desperate-to-return-home-migrant-workers-throng-pune-railway-station/articleshow/82186953.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Pune||Drop in sale of chicken amid strict Covid curbs||Pune: Retail chicken outlets across the city have reported a drop in chicken sales against the backdrop of the strict Covid norms. The rate of chicken had gone up over the last two weeks because of high demand. It has, however, come down due to the present restrictions in the city, a retailer said. Vijay More, owner of Amir Chicken, which has 850 outlets across the city, said, “Our sale has come down to 25 tonnes per day from the average 35-40 tonnes in the last one week. The drop is due to multiple reasons such as hotels, restaurants and eateries now operating for parcel service only. They don’t require chicken in the regular quantity.” At present, a live chicken in wholesale market is being sold in the range of Rs68 to Rs70/kg. But, at the retail outlets, it is being sold at Rs160-180/kg in the city. “The rate too has dropped from Rs200-Rs220 to Rs 160-Rs180 because of less demand,” More said. Prasanna Pedgaonkar, the general manager of Venky’s chicken and secretary of Maharashtra Poultry Breeders Association, said, “Now, many retail chicken outlets are operating with limited inventory because of the existing timing restrictions. Even retailers are assessing the situation and stocking limited chicken. So, it would be a little early to comment on the market scenario at this juncture.” Poonam Sonawane, a retailer from Pimpri, said there was steady sale of ready-to-make chicken in the last fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drop-in-sale-of-chicken-amid-strict-covid-curbs/articleshow/82186956.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Jaipur||Pandemic takes sheen off weddings in Jaisalmer for 2nd time in 2 years||JAISALMER: With increasing number of Covid cases in the second wave, the wedding season starting April 23 has lost its sheen. This time record marriages were expected to take place, but the government guideline permitting only 50 people has disappointed many stakeholders including jewellers, tent houses, textiles, fancy showrooms, priests, caterers, etc. However, people are neither cancelling the weddings nor in a mood to postpone them. Siwana MLA Hamir Singh Bhayal shot a letter to chief minister Ashok Gehlot demanding to allow jewellers, textile dealers and cosmetic dealers to open their shops for the people who have weddings during the curfew. On April 23, a large number of marriages have been scheduled across the state and people have made wide preparations for this, but corona has played a spoilsport. Due to curfew, people are not able to buy clothes for marriages and not able to make preparations. Jewellers and textile dealers are suffering heavy losses, stated the letter. Mohit Kumar, whose son is getting married on April 28, said he is facing lot of problem in buying clothes and making other preparations. The local market is closed and he was planning to go to Jodhpur for buying clothes, but the markets are closed and he is not even getting jewellery. Similarly, Kailash Kumar, whose daughter is getting married on April 25, said that only four days are left, but he is not getting clothes, cosmetics and saris for the bride. Although he had made some preparations earlier, but some purchasing was to be made, which he is not able to do now. Wedding planner Manwant Gehlot said there were huge number of bookings for marriages in April and May, but many are getting cancelled. As per government guidelines, only 50 people can attend the wedding, so programmes have been made small as a result tent houses and caterers are suffering losses. Meanwhile, the trade and industry association submitted a memorandum to the district collector requesting to allow textile and garment dealers to open shops during curfew. According to textile businessmen, their economic condition is already bad and they had stocked up for the wedding season from April 25 to 30, while the curfew is till May 3 and in such a situation they will be ruined as they will suffer huge losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pandemic-takes-sheen-off-weddings-in-jaisalmer-for-2nd-time-in-2-years/articleshow/82186958.cms||---

Inspite of increasing the number of beds to 250, the facility has almost run out of beds. Not only patients requiring medical attention, but even those with mild symptoms after testing positive have been trying to secure a bed in the AIIMS. Deputy director (Administration-AIIMS) NR Bishnoi said bed capacity for Covid patients has become a major concern for them. “We have increased beds from 160 to 250, but this has been insufficient given the surge in number of patients”, he said, adding that beds are now available only after it is vacated on account of recovery or casualty. While talking to the media on Monday, Union cabinet minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat had also said there was huge pressure on AIIMS for admission of patients as most of them have been using their clout. Admitting that even he has been receiving calls from people seeking help in admission in AIIMS, Shekhawat said everybody wanted to get admission in the facility. “This is not right. We will have to work out a protocol to decide which patient needed to be admitted in which hospital,” he said, adding that he had spoken to officials about it. Terming this to be a matter of human psychology, divisional commissioner Rajesh Sharma said people should understand that it was not the hospital, but the protocol of treatment, which mattered and that was same across hospitals. “Considering this, I have constituted a district referral committee to see if a patient required admission there or not”, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/aiims-jodhpur-short-of-covid-beds-as-cases-surge/articleshow/82186964.cms||---

---||Mumbai||State may grant transgenders one-time assistance of Rs 1,500||Mumbai: The state social justice department is contemplating a one-time Rs 1,500 financial assistance for transgenders in view of the hardships brought on by the Covid pandemic. Ravindra Kadam-Patil, deputy commissioner of social justice, has written to all divisional deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners, asking them to gather information on the number of transgenders in their respective jurisdiction, an estimated impact of the aid on the state exchequer, and the process through which the aid needs to be disbursed, whether it should be provided through direct benefit transfer (DBT). He said the required information should be submitted by April 26 on priority with a proper proposal and subsequently the administrative process will be initiated, and the proposal will be tabled before the state, stated the letter. The state government has already announced similar assistance of Rs 1,500 to various economically disadvantaged groups, including hawkers, construction workers and autorickshaw drivers. An organisation of transgenders, Dai Welfare Society, though, said the amount is paltry and the state should consider an aid of at least Rs 5,000 for each transgender. Rani (Ambre), president of Dai Welfare Society, told TOI the transgender community suffered several problems during the previous lockdown and may have to face them again. “It is good to hear that the state government is considering helping out the community. If it’s a one-time assistance, Rs 1,500 is too little. At least Rs 5,000 should be considered,” said Rani. Rani suggested the state could adopt the DBT method, even though a few who do not have ration, Aadhar or PAN cards could not open bank accounts. “The authorities should give them cash,” she said, adding there are around five lakh transgenders in Maharashtra, of whom over a lakh are in Mumbai. One said most of them are deprived of basic health facilities. “Transgenders do not expect any government or private jobs. Most are engaged in dancing, singing, and begging for livelihood,” she said. NCP MP Supriya Sule thanked Dhananjay Munde, minister for social justice, on social media. “Thanks for understanding the plight of the transgender community and initiating the administrative process to provide special assistance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-may-grant-transgenders-one-time-assistance-of-rs-1500/articleshow/82185285.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The bodies were taken to Civil hospital, Thane. There have been incidents of trees falling on residents, leading to casualties and injuries over the last few years. Activists have been raising doubts on the manner of tree-trimming by civic contractors and blamed haphazard road-digging, which loosens the grip of trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/two-killed-as-tree-crashes-over-auto-in-mumbai/articleshow/82188432.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Chandigarh||‘Not failure of govt or party, 1 person hand in glove with culprits’||Chandigarh: In yet another cryptic tweet, Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday alleged that it was not the failure of the government or the party on the issue of sacrilege, but of “one person” who was hand in glove with the culprits. Sidhu tweeted: “Carefully crafted collusive abetment leading to ... hum toh dubenge sanam, tumhe bhi le dubenge (I will sink and take you along with me). It is not a failure of the government or the party, but one person who is hand in glove with the culprits.” The post also had videos of Sidhu’s statements made in the 2019 Lok Sabha election campaigning in which he alleged that a “friendly match” was on over issues concerning the state. The post came two days after Sidhu claimed that it was the home minister of the state, a portfolio with chief minister Amarinder Singh, who was responsible for acting on sacrilege cases. Earlier this month, addressing media in Patiala, Sidhu alleged that the Congress was voted in on the twin issues of sacrilege and drugs, but people were now feeling betrayed. It was seen as an attempt by Sidhu to raise questions on his own party’s government in the state. After remaining in self-imposed exile ever since he resigned from the state cabinet in 2019, Sidhu got active to raise the issue of farmers and later gave his reaction to the quashing of a probe report in the Kotkapura firing case. Sidhu has been regularly posting on social media for some time now, with veiled references at the functioning of his own government. Sidhu did not mention in his post who the “one person” he was referring to was. YAD chief: ‘Don’t politicise’  Bathinda: Youth Akali Dal president Parambans Singh Romana on Wednesday accused Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu and former inspector general of police (IG) Kunwar Vijay Pratap of politicising sacrilege and police firing cases. He demanded that the entire case be handed over to the Supreme Court for a probe by the chief justice or a special investigation team (SIT) supervised by the chief justice. Speaking to media in Faridkot, Romana said the previous SAD-BJP government had registered a case under murder charges in Behbal Kalan against senior police officers, including then SSP Charanjit Sharma and several others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/not-failure-of-govt-or-party-1-person-hand-in-glove-with-culprits/articleshow/82187011.cms||---

Through various social media platforms, its members are dispersing important information — including the availability of beds in hospitals, oxygen cylinders, contacts of food and essential goods suppliers etc — to people across the twin cities. According to rough estimates drawn up by UFERWAS, based on feedback received from various RWAs, about 15,000 of the total 40,000 (approx) apartments in Hyderabad have reported Covid-19 cases between the second week of March and now. Apart from souring information from the ground, the apex body is also using the state government’s daily Covid bulletin to update residents about vacant beds and other crucial informations that can help people. “We are sharing information about the availability of beds (hospital wise) and also oxygen cylinders to our RWAs through social media platforms. We are also suggesting that they coordinate with doctors, staying in their apartments, so that they can help affected people, especially those who need hospitalisation,” said B T Srinivasan, general secretary, UFERWAS. The body has also prepared a safety protocol that is being circulating among all RWAs. It suggests that RWAs sanitise all floors of an apartment, that have positive cases, and restrict movement in these areas. “Particularly for patients living alone, or where the entire family has been affected, we have recommended that RWAs approach catering services so that they can be delivered food on regular basis, till the quarantine period is over,” Srinivasan added. Apart from this the apex body has also appealed officials of the state Medical and Health Department to allot specific time slots to senior citizens, in their respective upper primary health centres and hospitals, to ensure they are vaccinated at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/apex-body-of-rwas-draws-up-action-plan-to-assist-covid-affected-apartments/articleshow/82187002.cms||Sunil Mungara

With the transport department finalizing a plan to disburse Rs1,500 each to the permit holders of autorickshaws across the state, a Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO) official said those not holding permits were out of the relief package for now. “Those holding the badges, which enable them to drive autorickshaws, have been for now kept out of the relief package scheme. Moreover, the registration process is yet to start too,” deputy regional transport officer Sanjay Sasane told TOI. In Pune, there are around 90,000 autorickshaw permit holders (those who own autorickshaws). Besides, there are around 10,000 of them who don’t have the permits but hold the commercial licence and badges provided by the RTO.“It is worrying as they have been kept out of the scheme,” Nitin Pawar of the Rickshaw Panchayat said.

---||Pune||Labour exodus sets alarm bells ringing, cos worried||Pune: Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) serving as key ancillary units as well as end-product manufacturers in and around Pune have expressed concerns over workers’ exodus, affecting their production lines. While the absolute numbers of people moving back to their home states, largely Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal, are not as large as the numbers reported by the industry bodies last year, the exodus now is complicated by the fact that a number of industries are operational this year, despite key raw material shortages and restrictions. Many of them, however, are working at vastly reduced levels, or have to stop their production altogether, thus, keeping the labour force idle. “Some people have indeed gone back to their home states, but the numbers are clearly not as high as last year. The issues with MSMEs is that because they are smaller in size, one or two people leaving the unit will mean that there is no one else to operate a particular machine,” said Prashant Girbane, director general of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA). Industry observers said around 15,000 to 20,000 workers from outside Maharashtra had moved back to their home states in the recent weeks. Most of them are from the units that are idle due to raw material shortages or have been restricted by the state government orders to operate. Some have also been forced to move due to landlords telling them to move out of low-cost housing, due to stray positive cases of Covid-19, they added. Factory operators said the workers who have left represent a wide range of functions, having a direct impact on their production and the overall supply chain. “Two people from my plant have moved back to their home towns. They are moving back due to uncertainties as they are constantly hearing about lockdowns that may or may not happen, and they are being told to move out of the chawls and other housing that they live in,” said Sandeep Belsare, president of the Pimpri Chinchwad Small Industries Association (PCSIA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/labour-exodus-sets-alarm-bells-ringing-cos-worried/articleshow/82187057.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Chandigarh||‘Why are ministers so quiet and not defending the CM?’||Chandigarh: The political fallout of the quashing of the Kotkapura firing probe report seems to have resulted in a slugfest within the ruling party in Punjab. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu on Wednesday questioned the silence of the state ministers on the sacrilege issue. “Irrespective of the current situation, where people of Punjab are aggrieved by the delay in justice in Bargari case, we, the Congress party, have always stood for each other through thick and thin. I ask, very politely, why are the esteemed ministers so quiet on this sensitive issue? They should come forward to defend the CM and disclose the facts,” said Bittu. “This, even when one of their former colleagues is accusing the CM directly of collusion, and the council is quiet,” he added, in obvious reference to the crypted tweet by party colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu. Bittu told TOI, “He (Sidhu) has been a part of the cabinet and could have done more to press for expeditious action in sacrilege cases. He was with the BJP when the sacrilege incidents actually happened in 2015. The ministers should give a reply to him when he is raising these questions.” Already, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa has demanded that an emergency meeting of party MLAs and MPs be convened to discuss the ‘setbacks’ in the Kotkapura firing issue. He has also been blaming the advocate general for allegedly failing to take the sacrilege cases to a logical conclusion. Bittu’s statement comes at a time when most senior leaders of Punjab Congress have tried to distance themselves from the way the state government handled the emotive issue. Even though chief minister Amarinder Singh held a meeting with a group of ministers and MLAs to discuss the issue last week, it was reportedly decided to wait for the detailed court order before taking a political position on the new developments in sacrilege cases. “It is a scenario where the party MPs are openly making statements while the state leaders have been cautiously watching the developments in the case. Almost every MLA is concerned about the political implications if a negative perception is portrayed on the sacrilege issue ahead of the next assembly elections due in early 2022,” said a Congress leader. Last week, Bittu posted a video addressed to the CM, asking him to take note of public sentiments on sacrilege issue and said it could hurt the party’s poll prospects if not handled properly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/why-are-ministers-so-quiet-and-not-defending-the-cm/articleshow/82187086.cms||Vibhor Mohan

Even I have to pay (part of this amount) to those inside (Rajkot Civil hospital). You will get the bed within 30 minutes.” This is a part of the conversation between an agent and some relatives of a needy Covid-19 patient in Rajkot where hundreds have been braving blistering heat and waiting for hours to get admission into the Civil hospital for days together now. On Wednesday, as the video of this backdoor entry deal went viral, the detection of crime branch (DCB) and Pradhyumannagar police station detained two persons - Jagdish Solanki (20) and Hitesh Mahida (18) - late in the night. Solanki works as an attendant in the hospital while Mahida is a sweeper. Both are residents of Jamnagar. Coronavirus: Live updatesIn the video, Solanki, sitting in the rear seat of the car, is heard asking for Rs 9,000 per bed while those negotiating with him reduce the amount. In between their conversation, Solanki gets a call and is heard telling the person on the other end, “ I won’t take anything less than Rs 9,000. If you have money, come in your vehicle at Chaudhary school and call me.” V K Gadhvi, police inspector, crime branch told TOI, “They used the loopholes in the system to give backdoor entry to Covid patients in exchange for money. We will register an FIR against them after collecting more evidence.” They admitted to have arranged a bed for only the relative whose video had gone viral. Those negotiating with Solanki also assure there are more patients desperately seeking admission and they would direct all of them to him. “I have to pay other people above me.. it’s very difficult at present to get a bed. There are many people taking this,” he says and answers in affirmative when asked “Do you have to pay the doctors also?. We thought these were your charges alone.” The deal is finalized for Rs 8,000 and those giving him the money recorded the video handing over the amount to Solanki at an ATM of a nationalized bank.  At any given point of time, there are 50- 60 vehicles including cars and ambulances lined up at Chaudhary High School ground just behind the hospital. People even park their two-wheelers in the queue and when their turn nears, they call up home and ask relatives to bring the patient. 516 new cases, 77 deaths in RajkotOn Wednesday, Rajkot reported 516 new Covid cases in the district while 77 people succumbed in various Covid hospitals across the district in the past 24 hours ending on Wednesday morning. Jamnagar saw a new peak in new cases with 509 on Wednesday while 260 tested positive in Bhavnagar and 188 in Junagadh district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/covid-beds-up-for-sale-for-rs-9k-in-rajkot-civil-hospital/articleshow/82187074.cms||---

Commission member Justice Mahesh Chandra Sharma, taking suo motu cognizance, sought factual report from district collector and superintendent of the hospital. The report will be submitted by May 5. The commission said according to the relatives of the deceased, oxygen supply in the Covid ward was disrupted for about two hours which resulted in the casualties. The hospital authorities had also reportedly accepted that there was reduction in pressure of oxygen supply.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s active cases likely to touch 11 lakh by May 2||MUMBAI: Active cases of Covid-19 in the state may rise by 57% — from nearly 7 lakh at present to 10.94 lakh — by May 2 if cases continue to rise unhindered, and it may bring the already stretched medical services to a breaking point. Such a fortnightly projection was presented to the state cabinet by the public health department and it became one of the grounds to solidify the decision taken on Tuesday for a near-lockdown in the state. Statistics show the city, which currently has 83,450 active cases, may breach the 1 lakh mark by May 2 and reach an estimated 1.46 lakh cases if the current growth rate continues. In that eventuality, the city would fall short of 6,433 oxygen beds, 1,477 ICU beds and 121 ventilators. For Thane, too, the prediction is that active cases could multiply from 80,000 to 1.22 lakh, leading to a shortage of nearly 5,000 oxygen beds, 1,267 ICU beds and 432 ventilator beds. By May 2, other high-burden districts, such as Pune, Nagpur and Nashik, are estimated to add between 54% and 58% of the curent figure of active cases. Nagpur district has been one of the worst-hit in the second wave and may face a shortfall of 32,364 isolation beds, 10,476 oxygen beds and nearly 2,000 ICU beds if the active cases reach the predicted 1.23 lakh. An official said the projected numbers were based on the growth rate and daily detection of cases, among other parameters. “With restrictions, the projections may or may not come true, but it provides a baseline for districts to augment their infrastructure,” he said, adding that nearly all districts have been projected to show a jump. Earlier, the Centre had predicted that the state would hit 11 lakh active cases by the end of the month. “Most districts from the Marathwada region are grappling with the current active cases. If the projections come true, the health infrastructure in most of the districts will totally collapse. This was one of the reasons why the demand for a strict lockdown was raised in the state cabinet,” a minister from Marathwada said. Rural areas are reporting more cases than cities. In Bhandara district, acting district health officer Dr Shekhar Naik said the number of hospitalised patients had already surpassed the available Covid-19 bed strength.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtras-active-cases-likely-to-touch-11-lakh-by-may-2/articleshow/82188385.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Of course, some employees were stopped by police at checkpoints, but they were let through after showing their identity cards or authorization letters,” said an industry observer based in Pune.A group of employees belonging to a food processing unit, however, said they were stopped and asked to go back by police, as it was not clear to the on-duty team if food-processing was exempted being an “essential” industry. “However, our office reported that they had sorted out the issue after discussions with the police, and food processing is an exempted sector,” said an employee of a food processing unit on the outskirts of Pune. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/employees-movement-to-and-from-industries-remain-largely-free/articleshow/82187090.cms||---

Directorate of Education issued the orders on Wednesday as many private schools were continuing online classes in spite of vacations. On Tuesday, the private school association had also held a meeting and resolved to continue with the classes till mid- May. The circular, said, “It has been brought to the notice of this directorate that despite the summer vacation, which has been advanced due to surge in Covid-19 cases, online classes are continued by some private unaided recognised schools…it is expedient that the direction issued with respect to government schools and government aided schools for suspension of online classes is extended for private unaided recognised schools of Delhi also.” However, the schools have been allowed to conduct vacation-related specific activities, remedial classes for a specific set of students and other activities for creativity, happiness and overall social and emotional well-being to enrich the overall growth of the students without calling them to school physically. The order added that vacation plays a very important role in the academic cycle- both for students and their teachers. “It provides an opportunity to both of them to break free from the monotony that might creep in due to continuous teaching-learning activities. Hence, vacation is a time to relax, learn new skills, read new books, pursue hobbies etc as it is an opportunity to rejuvenate oneself,” it said. The DoE notice further said that in the present circumstances, it is all the more important that the intent of summer vacation is realised not just in letter, but in spirit too. Due to rising Covid cases, summer vacation has been advanced from May 11 to April 20. The vacation ends on June 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/summer-vacations-no-e-classes-for-pvt-schools/articleshow/82187095.cms||---

There would also be a risk of “high vaccine wastage”. In an affidavit to a PIL filed by two Mumbai lawyers, Dhruti Kapadia and another, seeking doorstep vaccination for the very elderly and the specially abled, the ministry stated there may also be an increased risk of “contamination and exposure beyond recommended temperature which could affect vaccine efficacy and cause adverse events following immunisation, which will be detrimental to vaccine confidence and programme performance.” Meanwhile, state Congress president Nana Patole on Wednesday had requested chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to immediately launch a door-to-door vaccination drive to tackle the pandemic.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/door-to-door-jabs-not-possible-under-rules-says-centre-to-bombay-hc/articleshow/82185335.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Govt has barricaded roads just to defame farmers, say morcha leaders||Bathinda: Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Wednesday accused the central government of indulging in a campaign to defame the farmers’ protest by showing that they were obstructing the fight against Covid-19 and their congregations were turning into a hotspot for spreading the virus. In a statement issued by it, the SKM said a propaganda was being spread that farmers had stopped trucks of oxygen and other essentials on the borders of Delhi. It said this was not true and misleading. The morcha stated that a false narrative was being built even as farmers had never intended to sleep on the roads or stay away from their homes and land. The SKM said farmers were fighting a battle of existence, and now they were also battling Covid. On Tuesday, complaints were made that supplies of oxygen had to take a longer route to reach Delhi due to road blockades by farmers. It was alleged that due to blockades, the supplies were delayed. The morcha said the government was running away from its responsibilities at the time of the pandemic and it was ironical that it was choosing to blame farmers. In fact, on humanitarian grounds, farmers have been more than willing to assist locals and others, despite hardships they are facing in the ongoing protests, he said. The SKM said farmers were compelled to protest on the road. It said they wanted to enter Delhi on November 26, 2020, but were prevented (from entering Delhi). After January 26, more obstacles in the form of large barricades, spikes, boulders and other materials were placed on the roads by the government. Even internal roads and footpaths were not left un-barricaded and sealed off, said the morcha. Local communities, however, supported farmers and opened alternative avenues. Protesting farmers had kept service roads open to essential services right from the time they had to squat at the borders, said the SKM. “The barricades put up by the police are the biggest obstacle to vehicular movement. We urge the government to remove the obstacles that they have put up to lock in Delhi, so that ordinary citizens do not face difficulties,” stated morcha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/govt-has-barricaded-roads-just-to-defame-farmers-say-morcha-leaders/articleshow/82187115.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||HC tells govt to frame policy for remdesivir distribution||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday ordered the state government to form a policy for distribution of remdesivir injections for Covid-19 patients on basis of their requirement and not to consider whether they are being treated in private or government hospital.In response the suo motu PIL on Covid-19 after the issue of availability of remdesivir was much contested during hearing on Tuesday, the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia said, “There has to be a reasonable policy of the state taking into consideration the overall factors and to ensure that all patients falling in the same category should be first administered or provided with remdesivir injection i.e. the patients on ventilators whether they are in private or government set up/facility, then it should be provided to patients on ICUs in private or government set up/facility and thereafter to patients on oxygen depending upon the period they have been on oxygen and thereafter other patients who are advised remdesivir. The condition of the patient should be the criteria for providing remdesivir injection and not whether he/she is admitted in private or government facility.”The judges have ordered the principal health secretary to convene a meeting of all stakeholders and frame a policy for the state for distribution of remdesivir. The court said that this policy issue cannot be left to the discretion of district collectors and municipal corporations and is required to be dealt with at the government level because the issue is “delicate and requires careful handling” . The collectors and commissioners can only look after the distribution of the medicine according to the government policy.The judges disapproved the state government’s present system of giving priority to government hospitals over private hospitals in distributing the much sought-after drug. The judges said that the government must decide which type of patient requires the medicine first and accordingly redirect the stock.The high court has also asked the government to respond on complaints that are being made by designated Covid hospitals that they are getting short supply of remdesivir from SVP Hospital than the requests placed.The HC has sought explanation from the government as to why patients are not admitted in Covid hospitals even though beds are available, if they are not brought in 108-ambulance and brought in private vehicle howsoever critical he is. The HC also wanted to know why admission is denied, if a patient is brought from other nursing home or hospital, where he turns into a Covid patient later. The HC has sought to know the system and modalities of 108 ambulance, the time it takes in picking a patient and why patient’s criticality is not considered.After hearing about the condition of oxygen supply, the HC has said, “…apparently there should be no shortage of oxygen for medical use and even though there is any shortage, the same is being actively augmented to cater to the additional demands.”The HC has sought answers by April 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-tells-govt-to-frame-policy-for-remdesivir-distribution/articleshow/82186156.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||30 years later, Comrade Bindu leads father’s fight||Bathinda: From a teenager who saw terrorists kill her father, Harinder Kaur Bindu has come far to become feminist face of the farmers’ agitation. On the bullet-riddled bodies of her father, Megh Raj Bhagtuana, and his 17 Leftist comrades at Sewewala village of Faridkot district on April 9, 1991, she had resolved to continue their fight. Three decades on, she has kept her word, at the cost of her marriage and with the challenges of raising a 14-year-old boy alone without land or own house. Now head of the women’s wing of Punjab’s largest farmer union, the BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan), she got here in five years of carrying farmers’ flag on her shoulders. The Naujwan Bharat Sabha comrades of Bindu’s father had formed ‘Jabar Te Firqaprasti Virodhi Front’ (against communalism and repression) in the times of religious killings and police encounters in Punjab. She recalled the front’s slogan: “Hindu Sikh ladan ni dena, mud santali banan ni dena’ (Won’t let Hindus and Sikhs fight and 1947 reoccur),” adding: “They staged the plays of Gursharan Singh and Ajmer Singh Aulakh in villages to promote unity.” As daughter of the front’s area convener, she would accompany him to these meetings. On one such afternoon of plays and revolutionary songs, terrorists came over and sprayed the stage with bullets. Woman activist Sada Kaur was among the 18 dead, while 22 others were wounded. Bindu was in Class VIII then. Somehow she passed Class X with those mental scars. In 1996, two Left bodies united to make the Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union and she got the task of motivating women to join it. She said: “Apart from women, even students and girls are part of the movement now, working as separate teams at the protest sites in Punjab and on the Delhi borders.” Amolak Singh and Lachman Sewewala of her father’s front and Chaman Lal, who has written books on Shaheed Bhagat Singh, endorsed her contribution to the farmer’s cause, saying that she increased the women’s partnership in the agitation singlehandedly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/30-years-later-comrade-bindu-leads-fathers-fight/articleshow/82187120.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Ahmedabad||For docs, saving kin was anxiety-ridden op||Ahmedabad: An orthopaedic doctor in Gandhinagar was stuck in the middle of nowhere earlier this month when his wife, who had tested positive for Covid-19, was gasping for breath. Her oxygen levels were falling constantly. He made a few desperate calls to his doctor friends but with hospitals dealing with long waiting lists of patients, he did not get much help. Also, it was way past midnight then. In a last-ditch attempt to give his wife care, he took her in his car and admitted her at his orthopaedic clinic. “He treats patients who have been in serious accidents and have fractured bones,” said a Covid-19 doctor who is a friend of the orthopaedist. “He had oxygen supplies at his clinic. It seemed to be the only way to save his wife.” The doctor’s wife has recovered from the infection. The source refused to disclose the identity of the doctor as he is unsure if what the doctor did to save his wife will be considered legal in the strictest sense. Several such private clinics in Gujarat got a shot in the arm on Tuesday as the government cleared the decks for them to treat Covid-19 patients. “So far these private clinics were treating patients behind closed doors. Now, they have the government authorization,” said an official working with a private hospital in Ahmedabad. “This move is expected to ease the burden on government and private Covid-19 designated hospitals.” The pressures on the medical infrastructure in Gujarat have been posing a severe challenge to the state government in this latest wave of Covid-19. A large number of doctors and their families have also been affected in this wave and these private clinics over the past month have served as the last resort to get treatment. In another case, a doctor in Ahmedabad converted his paediatric clinic into a Covid-19 treatment centre for friends and relatives after his brother-in-law tested positive. A few years ago, it was the very same brother-in-law who had celebrated the opening of the clinic. “The brother-in-law, a chartered accountant, was seen offering ice cream to guests,” said a person aware of the matter. “He is very close to the doctor and when his condition started deteriorating due to Covid-19, the doctor took him in at his clinic for treatment.” Over time, other family members also were infected. The paediatrician had shut down the OPD due to Covid-19 and except in some serious cases was interacting with patients via video calls. He got his kin and friends admitted to his clinic. Requests from other doctor friends also poured in for treating their close ones so he converted his 7-8-bed clinic to a 15-bed clinic, said sources. “The patients were all relations or close friends and there was a time when they even shared oxygen at regular intervals,” a source said. There was no financial transaction between the patients and the clinic or doctors as all this was between friends or family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/for-docs-saving-kin-was-anxiety-ridden-op/articleshow/82186163.cms||Maulik Pathak

Jusab added that he thought Salma might be at her father’s home. Worried over her daughter, Juma initially filed a missing complaint with Anjar police on Tuesday morning. Later, when he visited Asgar’s home he noticed stain of blood on the floor. He informed the police about the same and also told them that he feared his daughter might have been murdered. The police detained Asgar on Tuesday evening and grilled him about Salma’s missing. Asgar soon spilled the beans and confessed to have murdered his wife.

The announcement comes in the wake of serious challenges facing oxygen-cylinder refillers. “In fact, the 12 major oxygen refillers of Ahmedabad district are running at full capacity,” adds the senior AMC official. “They are filling as many as 1,100 to 1,200 cylinders a day, which is already over capacity. Any increase will cause a breakdown.” The AMC has already begun calculating the total bed capacity of private and trust-run hospitals. The entire city has 12,978 beds, as revealed to the AMC by 985 registered hospitals within the municipal limits. Of the 985 registered hospitals, 117 have 20 beds or more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/oxygen-low-but-8-hospitals-show-covid-courage/articleshow/82186182.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lokayukta seeks report on plaint against Anil Parab||MUMBAI: The Lokayukta has directed the principal secretary (housing) and chief officer of Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority’s (Mhada) Mumbai Board to submit a report on an alleged land grab complaint against Shiv Sena minister Anil Parab. Parab denied the allegations and said he would respond to the Lokayukta. Last month, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya had lodged a formal complaint with the Lokayukta claiming that five years ago, Parab had illegally grabbed compulsory open space between two buildings (No. 57 & 58) of Gandhi Nagar in Bandra (E) opposite his residence and constructed an over 1,000 sq ft structure which he uses as his office. In August 2019, Mhada issued Parab a notice granting him three weeks to demolish the structure on his own. When Parab did not do so, Mhada issued a notice for demolition, but nothing happened. In February 2020, after Parab was sworn in as a minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, Mhada sent another demolition notice. Somaiya then approached Mhada and Nirmal Nagar police asking why no action was taken. “Officials admitted they were under pressure not to take action,” he claimed. The BJP leader then wrote to Parab, attaching the notice, and asked the minister to demolish the structure on his own. When nothing happened on the ground, Somaiya finally approached the Lokayukta in March. The Lokayukta, in its letter to Somaiya, said it would take a decision after receiving the final report from the state government. “Even after being sworn in as a cabinet minister, Parab continues to brazenly occupy and use the illegal structure as his office. As a public servant, he is now pressuring government authorities to not demolish the illegal structure. This amounts to corrupt practice as he is misusing his office which he holds as a public servant,” alleged Somaiya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lokayukta-seeks-report-on-plaint-against-parab/articleshow/82188487.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM, Adar Poonawalla meet online to plan for 18-45 vaccine drive||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday held a virtual meeting with Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), to plan for the vaccination drive for the 18-45 age group that kicks off on May 1. An estimated 8.5 crore people in Maharashtra will be eligible to get the vaccine in the age bracket. So far, 1.2 crore have been administered at least one dose and nearly 15 lakh have got both doses. Senior officials said it was a very brief meeting to discuss how much stock will Serum, which manufactures Covishield, be able to provide to the state considering its previous commitments. There was no discussion on price negotiations, said an official. Thackeray is likely to hold a detailed meeting on vaccinations in a day or two. TOI reported on Wednesday that with Serum and Bharat Biotech’s entire monthly capacity tied up under the Centre’s advance purchase agreement, there may not be much capacity left to supply to state governments or the private market. Serum, in particular, will be able to market Covishield in the private market only after a few months, and not before August or September, sources had said. SII has fixed the price of Covishield at Rs 600 per dose for private hospitals and Rs 400 for the state governments. An official from the state said they may consider free vaccination for a section of society that may not be able to afford it. A meeting between state health officials and the Centre was also held on Wednesday to plan for the drive from May 1. Dr T P Lahane, director of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said detailed discussions on vaccine strategy and procurement would be held in the next few days.  Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has decided the vaccination drive for the 18-45 group should be done on priority and there will be no budgetary constraints to purchase the required doses. “If necessary, budget from other funds will be diverted for it,” said Tope. In Mumbai, cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray said vaccination centres should be started in all 227 corporator wards, considering all aged above 18 will be eligible to take the jab from May 1. He was talking at the inauguration of the vaccination centre at Acworth Leprosy Hospital in Wadala. The city currently has 129 vaccination centres, including 73 private facilities. Private hospitals are waiting for better clarity on the road ahead. Some may even consider directly negotiating prices with manufacturers, said Joy Chakraborty, COO of P D Hinduja Hospital. Private sector is anticipating a rise in demand for vaccines with the drive being opened for all adults, he said. On Wednesday, 36,045 got vaccinated, including 17,484 above 45 years and 14,786 seniors. Civic authorities said as many as 39 private centres did not conduct sessions due to non-availability of vaccines. This was the third day in a row that many private centres couldn’t vaccinate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cm-poonawalla-meet-online-to-plan-for-18-45-vaccine-drive/articleshow/82186204.cms||Bhavika Jain

According to Limbdi police, Vikash Udani, 52, a resident of Shyam Vihar Apartment in Ahmedabad, lodged a complaint against Chetan, Manoj Desai, Uday, Jagdish and Gokul for looting Rs 40 lakh from him on April 17. As per information received, Chetan, a resident of Rajkot and the key accused in this case, used an age-old trick to win over the victim’s trust. In the first deal, Chetan delivered the promised bitcoins at a low price to Udani. The first transaction was worth Rs 25,000 and Manoj Desai had visited Ahmedabad to collect the cash from Udani. Chetan then promised Udani more bitcoins at low price, but this time the deal was worth Rs 40 lakh. Falling prey to the con, Udani and his friend Vishal came to Limbdi in a car with Rs 40 lakh cash last Saturday. Chetan’s men — Uday, Jagdish and Gokul — met the victims near Limbdi. Instead of giving them the promised cryptocurrency, the trio looted the cash from them and fled in a car. Udani, who operates tours and travels business, lodged a complaint with the police on Tuesday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lured-by-cheap-bitcoins-bizman-looted-of-rs-40-lakh/articleshow/82186243.cms||---

Those failing to follow are not only getting themselves infected, but are becoming the source for spreading the infection,” he said.In some of the villages that have zero cases, it has also been found that despite having considerable population as they have formed Gram Dakshata Samitis to ensure that no outsider enters the village.Even the villagers returning from cities or other states, where they work, are being allowed only after completing the prescribed quarantine period at a facility outside the villages.The precautionary measures being taken by villagers is now being looked at as an inspiration for other villages and appreciation is pouring in for them from the administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/800-villages-in-aurangabad-have-zero-covid-19-cases/articleshow/82184557.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Bareilly||4 die in Lakhimpur within hours of first Covid symptoms||BAREILLY: A woman on her way from the hospital with her mother’s body, an income tax official who had fever for a few hours, a school vice principal who had a chest congestion and an eatery owner who contracted pneumonia just a day ago — four people died in Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday within hours of developing symptoms or coming in contact with someone who had Covid-19. In the first case, the woman, 28, had to take her mother, a retired school teacher, to Lucknow for treatment after the latter developed chest-related complications on Tuesday. She had found no hospital in Lakhimpur Kheri to admit her mother to. But before her mother could be admitted anywhere, she died. Her body was taken to a hospital in Lucknow, where her samples were collected. She had tested positive for Covid-19, it was later found. Meanwhile, the woman was bringing her mother back to Lakhimpur Kheri early morning on Wednesday when she developed symptoms as well. She could not breathe. She died in the ambulance. In a similar case, an income tax official, 42, died within hours of having fever. He had also developed a chest congestion and passed away at the government-run Covid-19 facility in Lakhimpur Kheri within an hour of admission. Across town, an eatery owner in his 40s developed pneumonia, fell ill and died before he could be admitted to a hospital in hours. And a vice principal of a school, 48, being treated at home for chest congestion suddenly got high fever and passed away at a private hospital. He had not tested positive for Covid-19. The official Covid-19 death count in the district for Wednesday, however, is two. “There have been two confirmed Covid-19 deaths in the district on Wednesday,” Lakhimpur Kheri chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agarwal told TOI. Last Saturday, three brothers got pneumonia, had high fever and died without hours as their condition deteriorated before doctors at the hospital they were in could do anything. Their samples were collected. “But we haven’t received any report. We don’t know yet if my cousins died of Covid-19,” a cousin said. “Three others in the colony have died since then in exactly the same way.” Another doctor, on condition of anonymity, told TOI the rapid emergence of such cases has stretched them thin. “The condition in the district is alarming. Some patients from Lucknow had come to our hospital with Covid-19-like symptoms. We referred them to Covid hospitals and informed local health officials. Then, we got to know, a few of them died a day or two later. I couldn’t do anything to save them,” the doctor said. Last year, samples were being collected from any person who died before they could be tested. “We still ensure that RT-PCR tests of the deceased are being done and the body is being cremated following Covid protocols. If the deceased tests positive, we collect samples of all contacts,” the CMO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/4-die-in-lakhimpur-within-hours-of-first-covid-symptoms/articleshow/82185373.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Utilise schools as isolation centres, say residents||HYDERABAD: UFERWAS suggested the state health department to utilise government and private educational institutions as isolation centres for the treatment of Covid-19 pandemic patients. With the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases, residents affected with the coronavirus are facing the major problem of shortage of beds in government and private hospitals across the city, according to BT Srinivasan, general secretary, UFERWAS. The state government has already shut these educational institutions and the health department can utilise classrooms as isolation centres, Srinivasan said. In fact, most of the reputed private educational institutions have air-conditioners with spacious classrooms. From the safety and security point of view, most schools have compound walls too, he opined. Additionally, UFERWAS has appealed the state agriculture department authorities to set up mobile vegetable and fruits vehicles. “Though vegetables are being sold by the petty vendors through pushcarts, it is risky for the consumers. These vendors visit every by-lane and sell the vegetables, coming in close contact with consumers, which poses a serious threat to others,” Gopal Das, an RWA member at Madhura Nagar said. The civic body has to deploy more sanitation workers and take up sanitisation at every by-lane on a regular basis to avoid further spreading of virus, advised a senior citizen of Uttamnagar in Malkajgiri GHMC circle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/utilise-schools-as-isolation-centres-say-residents/articleshow/82187135.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Delhi||Gurdwaras show compassion best served hot||New Delhi: Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee has been getting innumerable requests for food to be delivered to the homes of Covid-positive people. DSGMC has been able to cater to most of these requests. Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who heads the Sikh body, said that they send food packages to each house based on their demands. DSGMC has set up a separate langar to prepare meals for Covid patients across the city. The packed food is distributed from four gurdwaras to those who have called on the recently launched helpline number. “From Wednesday, Bangla Sahib Gurudwara is not the only gurudwara where food is being prepared for needy people. For those in north Delhi, the meals are being cooked in Gurdwara Nanak Piao, for those in east Delhi at Gurdwara Sis Ganj and for those in south and west Delhi at Gurdwara Moti Bagh Sahib,” said Sirsa. There are thousands of people, including migrant workers and Covid-infected families, who need help of this kind. “Because we are getting thousands of requests, we are sending food from four gurdwaras in different parts of the city so that people get hot food at an appropriate time. Earlier, we were preparing meals only at Gurdwara Bangla Sahib,” said Sirsa. On Wednesday, the Sikh body prepared 15,000 food packages and distributed them mostly among migrant workers and labourers who have been hit by the weeklong lockdown. It also sent 1,200 food packages each in the morning and evening to Covid-hit families. Last year, when the pandemic was at its worst, DSGMC had similarly delivered food packages to thousands of people. Ever since, there have been occasional requests for the service from people that the body complied with. Those in need of food had become acquainted with Sikh volunteers last year, and apparently they have been directly contacting them with requests for food.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gurdwaras-show-compassion-best-served-hot/articleshow/82204137.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

Police registered a case against 18 people, including two rival candidates. According to police, two candidates - Satyaveer and Pankaj Sharma - in the fray for the post of village head were reportedly in a neck-and-neck contest. The villagers had cast their vote on April 19 during the second phase of panchayat polls. Things turned ugly when supporters of Satyaveer started saying that some villagers "ditched him and cast their vote in favour of his rival Pankaj Sharma". The two groups then got into a heated argument and began to intimidate each other. Soon, both sides started pelting stones. At least six persons sustained severe injuries. Police reached the spot and took the injured to district hospital for treatment. Dhampur SHO Arun Kumar said, "Police have registered a case against 18 villagers, including both the candidates, under relevant sections. Five persons have been detained.

---||Mumbai||Two Jain temples in Mumbai turn into Covid centres||MUMBAI: Strings of prayer beads have all been locked in a cupboard, books on Jain philosophy have been bundled up, the big bhandaar or donation box which occupied the central space has gone to a corner and the pooja room has an X-ray machine. Now, beds have been rolled in, oxygen cylinders have been ordered and a pipeline for supply has been welded along the circumference of the premises. Pawan Dham, translated as holy space, is a religious temple trust in Kandivli (West) where Jains throng to pray and meditate. On Thursday, it will open its doors to everyone Covid positive, irrespective of religion. The centre is replete with its team of medical professionals, doctors, nurses and ward boys and will admit those who need non-ICU hospitalisation. Life-saving machines, portable X-ray, oxygen concentrators and defibrillators are in place. “The time is such that every place of worship should open its doors and allow people to come in so that they get the necessary services and stay calm. Why do people donate? As they believe that temple trusts would put their monies to good use. So, at a time when people need us, we cannot step back or not act. And what is religion? Nothing more than service for humanity. Every place of worship currently needs to embrace humanity,” Jain monk Namramuniji Maharaj told this correspondent. A team of 50 doctors, nurses and ward boys from a local hospital in Borivli will attend to the patients. With a total of 100 beds in Kandivli, 60 in the temple at Ghatkopar, and more at two others in Rajkot, now all efforts are on to open up temples in Junagad and Kolkata as well. “In Rajkot, 300 oxygen cylinders have been ordered and we are delivering them to those people’s homes who are unable to get space in hospitals,” added Maharaj Sahebji. Those who are home quarantined are being supplied free food in Mumbai, Kolkata, Bhavnagar, Rajkot, Ahmedabad and Baroda by Jain volunteers. Volunteer Pradeep Mehta said, “Everything in the temple has been packed and put away. Our 50,000-sq-ft space will wake up as a hospital. Every detail from breakfast to regularly informing their families on health and passing medical reports on a daily basis, has been taken care of. The five-storey temple building is no less than a Covid hospital minus ICU beds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-jain-temples-in-city-turn-into-covid-centres/articleshow/82185396.cms||Hemali Chhapia

Steep rise in positive cases has continued with the district registering highest-ever 7,229 cases on Wednesday. In all, 98 patients died in the district on Wednesday. This was second highest tally in a day after 113 recorded on April 19. The district is witnessing new highs in fatalities every day during the last week. This has taken total number of deaths in April to 1,477 so far. Previous, highest fatalities in a month was 1,465 were in September last year which was peak of first wave. The district is witnessing second wave since third week of February. Cases and deaths are surging since beginning of March. The case fatality rate (CFR) of the district in April is less compared with August to October last year due to high number of positive cases. CFR of April is 1.26%. It was 3.80% in August, 3.02% in September, and 3.55% in October last year. Cumulative deaths of the district surged to 6,575. Deaths in the city crossed 4,000. City’s fatalities were 4,050 on Wednesday followed by 1,549 in rural. Remaining 976 deceased were residents of other districts who tested positive and succumbed during treatment in the hospitals here. Overall CFR of the district was 1.9% on Wednesday, which was higher compared with average of state- 1.5% and India’s 1.2%. With consistent rise in cases, total tally of the district increased to 1,17,551 in 21 days of April which is more than that registered in any of last 13 months. Cumulative cases were 3,43,589.

Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari on Wednesday visited NMC’s Covid Hospitals at Imambada and Pachpaoli. “Directions have been given to complete works on liquid oxygen tank at Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital by Sunday. This hospital will have 110 beds and there will be no problems of oxygen supply after completion of works of tank. A plant that can produce oxygen from air was under installation in Butibori MIDC. I shifted the plant to NMC’s Isolation hospital where too oxygen shortage will end. This hospital is operating 36 beds and we will increase it to 50 soon,” he said. Tiwari added another plant to produce oxygen will be installed at Covid hospital at NMC’s Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya (IGR). “Thus, there will be no issue of oxygen supply at NMC’s three hospitals. Cylinders of these three hospitals will be used at remaining hospitals of the NMC which too will benefit,” he said. NMC has delayed opening of 130-bed Covid Hospital at KT Nagar due to shortage of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/at-7266-district-reports-most-recoveries-in-a-day/articleshow/82187218.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Ahmedabad||Fearing lockdown, migrants head home||Ahmedabad: The scenes are eerily reminiscent of the lockdown of 2020. Due to fears of lockdown and loss of livelihood, many migrant labourers have begun moving out of Gujarat with the pandemic hitting new peaks. They are scared of getting stuck away from home without work and wages, if a lockdown is imposed. The situation was telling at Nagarwel Hanuman Crossroads in Ahmedabad at a private bus jam-packed with migrant labourers, just before it left for Madhya Pradesh. Talking to TOI, Dushyant Kumar, a resident of a village in Indore district of Madhya Pradesh, said, “The factory where I work is operating on 50% capacity and there is hardly any work. With so many cases, I don’t feel safe and if there’s a lockdown, I’ll get stuck without food and supplies. I am going home. I’m not sure when I’ll return.” Narendra Singh, another migrant who was about to board the bus to MP said, “I work at an engineering unit which has shut down. With so many cases, if there is a lockdown, I will not be able to afford rent. I am leaving for my hometown.” The situation was similar at the Kalupur railway station, where scores of migrant workers were waiting to board a train to UP or Bihar. “We are seeing some migrant movement at our plant locations, but it insignificant in comparison to last year. We have come out with special incentives to retain workers. Like last year, we will provide workers accommodation within the factory premises if the need arises. Moreover, as during last year’s lockdown, we will also provide food facility and other basic necessities if required,” said Angshu Mallick, CEO & MD, Adani Wilmar. With demand taking a hit in of territorial lockdowns worldwide, industrial production has slowed, leaving little demand for workers. Consequently, labourers, left with no work, have begun moving homewards again. “Some workers have already begun to flee as our unit remained shut for the past five days due to limited oxygen supply,” said Niraj Shah, owner of an engineering unit in Sanand. Similar is the situation at dyes and intermediates manufacturers in Vatva. “The majority of our workforce comprises of migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Currently, we’re operating at barely 30% staff because demand has taken a hit and industrial production level is at 40%. Workers therefore have begun moving out gradually,” said Yogesh Parikh, president, Gujarat Dyestuff Manufacturers’ Association (GDMA). Ajit Shah, president, Sanand Industries Association (SIA), said, “In Sanand, most labourers are still around. However, some have begun to move out from isolated places. Those who left for Holi haven’t yet returned, but that has not affected production activity, as yet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fearing-lockdown-migrants-head-home/articleshow/82186256.cms||Niyati Parikh

Suspecting theft, he immediately called up all his 12 workers. However, only 10 came while Abdul and Samrat didn’t turn up. Later, Mandliya checked the CCTV in which the two were seen breaking the lock and escaping with the gold.Police, based on CCTV camera footage, launched a probe in the case. Police also searched the area where both workers were living in Junagadh but they escaped by then. Police suspect that two might have left the state with the booty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-employees-rob-jeweller-of-gold-worth-rs-89-lakh/articleshow/82186254.cms||---

Due to the recent surge in cases, 127 symptomatic cases were recorded, resulting in a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 78% against mild, moderate, and severe Covid-19 disease,” they said in a joint statement. “The efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease was 100%, with an impact on reduction in hospitalisations. The efficacy against asymptomatic Covid-19 infection was 70%, suggesting decreased transmission in Covaxin recipients,” they added. Though the second interim analysis was planned to be conducted once 87 participants got infected, a higher number – 127 cases – was recorded among the Covaxin trial participants due to the surge in cases because of the second wave and the interim efficacy data was calculated on this basis. The final analysis of the safety and efficacy results will be available in June after which the final report will be submitted to a peer-reviewed publication, they added. Prof Balram Bhargava, director general of ICMR, said the 78% efficacy in the second interim analysis as well as the findings that Covaxin works well against most variants of SARS-CoV-2 consolidates the position of the indigenous vaccine in the global vaccine landscape. Terming Covaxin as a global innovator vaccine derived from R&D conducted in India, Bharat Biotech chairman & managing director Dr Krishna Ella said Covaxin had demonstrated an excellent safety record in human clinical trials and during emergency use. "The efficacy data against severe Covid-19 and asymptomatic infections is highly significant as this helps reduce hospitalization and disease transmission, respectively,” he said. The developers of the desi vaccine also said that following the achievement of the success criteria, those who received placebo shots during the trial have now become eligible to receive two doses of Covaxin. In the first week of March, the Covaxin developers had declared an interim efficacy of nearly 81% based on the first interim analysis of phase 3 trials data after 43 cases of Covid-19 were reported among the trial participants. Of these 43 infected volunteers, only 7 had received the two Covaxin shots while the remaining 36 had all received a placebo shot. In the phase 3 study, 25,800 participants between the ages of 18-98 years were enrolled, including 10% participants over the age of 60.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-efficacy-78-bharat-bio-icmr/articleshow/82188508.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Covid marches on||CHANDIGARH/MOHALI: Most residents complied with the one-day lockdown on Ram Navami on Wednesday even as novel coronavirus continued to rampage across the city that reported 622 new cases and two deaths, while Mohali logged six fatalities and 754 fresh infections. Just like the weekend lockdown, markets, shopping malls and tourists places were shut. Temples were closed on a day of festival that draws huge crowds. People preferred to remain indoors. Traffic was visible but not that as heavy as on Chandigarh-Zirakpur entry point. As police had set up check points, long queues of vehicles entering Chandigarh were formed. Police was allowing people only after verifying their documents. Unlike last time, police were present on internal roads as well and checking documents of motorists. Only shops selling essential items were open. Sector 17 was deserted. Just a few cleanliness workers were found doing their job. Traders were not pleased, although, about closing their shops. “Frequent lockdowns are damaging the economy. The administration should take traders into confidence before imposing a lockdown,” said Charanjiv Singh, president, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal (CBM). The traders’ body will hold a meeting on Thursday to decide its strategy to stop such lockdowns, he added. Rajesh Sharma, a resident of Sector 50, said they followed the instructions issued by the administration. “But many in our society violated the rules. Maids came to many houses, while people went out for morning and evening walks without masks. Some even enjoyed cycling,” he said. People were also found freely moving in colonies and villages. The Sector 26 vegetable and fruit market too once again witnessed rush of vendors. In Mohali, cops put up special check posts throughout the district at main entry and exit points from Tuesday night. A few persons were seen outside temples at various places in the morning, but most residents celebrated the festival in their homes. People who wanted to enter Mohali from Panchkula and Ambala were stopped and sent back if they did not have any permits. On the Covid front, Mohali death toll touched 517. The confirmed cases are 38,316, including 6,995 active cases. The recovery count is 30,804 The Chandigarh Covid death toll mounted to 423, with a 56-year-old man from Maloya having diabetes and a 56-year-old woman from Sector 44 suffering from hypertension succumbing on Wednesday. The confirmed cases are 35,770, including 4,125 active cases.

---||Hyderabad||Youths conduct final rites of Covid victims for free across Telangana||HYDERABAD: Since the pandemic broke out last year, Mohammed Muneer and his 12-member team have buried or cremated bodies of nearly 80 Covid-19 patients. With the second wave spreading fast and casualties mounting, Muneer group’s responsibilities to conduct the final rites of Covid-19 victims have also increased. For that matter, performing the final rites has become a daily routine for the group at a time when families and relatives are shying away from conducting the ritual worried over Covid-19 fears. The group neither asks for money nor takes it to do the rites. “It is all about brotherhood. People may belong to different religions and castes, but our primary responsibility is to help everyone in need,” Muneer, president of Bilalpur New Youth Help for Society, said. Muneer goes about doing what he has been doing along his dedicated team of volunteers in the past one year. “In the last 20 days, we have performed the rites of a large number of people who fell victim to Covid-19,” said Mohammed Ateeq, one of the members of the group. The youth said they believe in the principle of all humans being equal before god. The NGO was set up in 1996 with the motive of helping people, but it was during the pandemic that the group took it upon itself to do social service. “We have seen bodies of Covid-19 patients being dumped in a grave with the help of JCBs. That was when we thought this is not how a person should be treated at his or her farewell,” Muneer said. On Wednesday, they buried the body of a 60-year-old woman from Raikal and a 40-year-old woman from Metpally. They also performed the last rites of five persons on Tuesday and conducted the rites of six others on Monday in Karimnagar district. The group members wear PPE kits and follow Covid-19 protocols while performing the last rites. “It all depends on the religious beliefs of the families and we conduct the last rites as per their wish,” Ateeq said. Muneer speaks to each of his team members and gives specific tasks. “We get calls during the day and night and we attend to them and perform the rites as per Hindu tradition,” he said. When a woman who was standing in line for a Covid-19 test died last year, the group performed her last rites when the family was unwilling to come anywhere near her body. Muneer said it was a matter of grave concern that families were choosing to stay away from the last rites. “A man refused to attend his mother’s last rites, leaving it to us to conduct the ritual,” he recalled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/youths-conduct-final-rites-of-covid-victims-for-free-across-t/articleshow/82187166.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

While the elderly man died, his son sustained injuries. However, police claimed that he died of a heart attack and not due to the assault. Sources said Irshad Ahmad's nephew was a local candidate for the post of village pradhan, but a rival group was putting pressure on him to "vote for someone else". Furious that Ahmad did not toe the line, four men allegedly barged into his house and started thrashing him. His son, Salman, was beaten up, too. Ahmad later succumbed. Ahmad used to work as a labourer at a brick kiln in Meerut. He came to his village only to cast his vote. His nephew, Kamil, was a candidate for the village pradhan's post from Paldi. "Ahmad's wife has filed a police complaint. She stated that on Tuesday evening four men went to their house and picked up a fight with Ahmad and Salman. Ahmad was then beaten to death while Salman sustained injuries," Kamil said. Area police later reached the place and launched a probe. The man's body has been sent for postmortem. Initially, a case was registered under IPC section 302 [murder] against four accused at Shahpur police station. On Wednesday, Budhana DSP Vinay Gautam said, "The postmortem report stated that Ahmad died of a heart attack. And his son was thrashed. Action will be now taken under relevant sections of the IPC. Probe is on."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-60-killed-son-brutally-beaten-for-not-voting-in-favour-of-pradhan-candidate/articleshow/82184584.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: To skirt DA probe, GST official faked Covid reports, says CBI||HYDERABAD: CBI sleuths have alleged that arrested assistant commissioner of Goods and Services Tax, Bollineni Gandhi, produced fake Covid-19 reports of family members to escape being investigated in a disproportionate assets case. On Wednesday, Gandhi was produced in a CBI court and remanded in judicial custody at Chanchalaguda jail. The top investigation agency had on July 8, 2019, registered a case against Gandhi and his wife, alleging that they had accumulated assets worth Rs 3.8 crore illegally. In the past Gandhi had worked in the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI). CBI in a note said, “During investigation, we have issued notices under the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code. However, the accused did not cooperate with the investigation and also did not furnish requisite information or documents pertaining to the case.” CBI further alleged that the accused had influenced witnesses and dissuaded them from joining the investigation and from disclosing relevant facts of the case. “The accused had also furnished false and fabricated Covid-19 positive reports in the name of his family members,” CBI alleged. Gandhi has been remanded in judicial custody till May 7. The arrested GST official served in ED for more than seven years and handled high profile money laundering cases. He is also facing a CBI case in another scandal. He along with deputy commissioner of service tax evasion, Chilaka Sudha Rani, are named as accused in a Rs 5 crore bribery case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbi-to-skirt-da-probe-gst-official-faked-covid-reports/articleshow/82188514.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Senior officials told TOI they were prepared to tackle any possible increased movement over the weekend. Delhi government’s task force also held meetings with stakeholders to keep a plan ready to avoid crowding. Dr Punit Sethi, estate manager at Anand Vihar and a member of the task force, said: “From Anand Vihar and Kaushambi, approximately 980 buses and 29,400 passengers left between 6pm on Wednesday and 6pm on Thursday. We are regularly getting the toilets cleaned and drinking water is being provided. Coordination with other states is also going on for smooth passage of the migrants.” Not all families at Anand Vihar bus stand were going home because of the lockdown. “Cases are rising everyday and we don’t know if we will be safe. The lockdown reminds us of the horrors of last year. We would have still stayed back, but our relatives back home are sick and in such times, they need my presence,” said a labourer heading to Badaun. To facilitate the movement of the migrant workers in a smooth manner, a task force was constituted on Wednesday. KK Dahiya, special commissioner of transport, has been made as the nodal officer to make all necessary arrangements and to maintain close liaison with the transport authorities of neighbouring states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. “The task force will render necessary assistance to any person wishing to undertake interstate travel and for that purpose adequate number of helpdesks will also be set up at ISBT,” stated the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/number-of-migrants-at-isbt-railway-stns-down/articleshow/82204184.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The interim allocation has been made till April 30. UP, Gujarat and MP have been given 1.22 lakh, 1.63 lakh and 92,400 doses. Remdesivir, which is prescribed to Covid patients going from moderate to severe, has seen a tremendous surge in demand in the pandemic’s second wave in the country. In Maharashtra, there is an estimated daily shortfall of 15,000-2,0000 doses of the drug. The Centre said that looking at the jump in demand, the manufacturing capacity of domestic firms has been ramped up. The 11 lakh doses will come from seven manufacturers: Zydus Cadila, Hetero, Mylan, Cipla, Sun, Jubilant and Dr Reddy’s. Zydus and Hetero will provide 3.27 lakh and 2.42 lakh doses, respectively.  “The production capacity is being ramped up from the current level of 38 lakh vials per month to 74 lakh vials per month, and 20 additional manufacturing sites have been approved,” the Centre said on Wednesday. It also said that the export of Remdesivir has been prohibited on April 11 to shore up domestic supplies. In Maharashtra, the collector’s office is now allocating doses to respective Covid hospitals. Hospitals are allocated doses on a daily basis depending on their patient load. The Centre has asked states to appoint a nodal officer to track Remdesivir usage and availability. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-to-get-2-7-lakh-doses-of-remdesivir/articleshow/82188521.cms||---

The six labourers were working in Haryana's Jind district and were returning to their native village fearing lockdown, sources said. All of them were residents of Bulandshahr district. Soon, local villagers along with relatives blocked traffic at night. It was only when sub-divisional magistrate, Padam Kumar Singh, reached the site and pacified the relatives, the road blockade could be lifted.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Flyer count dips from 45k to 25k in 2 months as cases rise in Delhi, Mumbai||KOLKATA: The onslaught of the second wave of Covid-19 has battered air travel with Kolkata airport registering a 45% nosedive in traffic. “Flights to Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Raipur and Port Blair with less than 40% load. We are hitting a new low every day. It hasn't been this bad since last September,” said an airline official after passenger count dipped from a high of 45,000 in February to 25,000 now. Mumbai and Delhi, both high density routes, have been among the worst impacted by the sharp rise in Covid cases since March with flyer count showing a steady decline. In a month, the load on flights to these two cities from Kolkata has halved. The announcements of different kinds of measures by various states like partial lockdowns, night curfews and mandatory RT-PCR tests within 72 hours of arrival has also spread fear and confusion among travellers, leading to a drop in air traffic over the last two weeks. While loads have also halved on flights to Port Blair, Ahmedabad and Raipur, loads from several other cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Jaipur to Kolkata have also dipped to the mandatory requirement of RT-PCR reports prior to boarding. “Demand for RT-PCR reports has shot up everywhere due to higher infections. Laboratories are no longer able to do the tests at short notice. Those, who are suspected to have contracted the virus, have to wait nearly 48 hours to get the swab test done. The report is taking another 48 hours. Someone wanting to get the test done for travel is low priority,” said a travel agent. Flyer count had increased from 25,000 a day in September to 30,000 a day in October. In December, it moved up to the 35,000 a day with the passenger count even hitting 40,000 during weekends. In February, the flyer count was 45,000 on Monday, Wednesday and Friday when flights were allowed to operate from Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Chennai and Ahmedabad. On the other four days of week, flights from these cities are not allowed to fly into Kolkata. As passenger count continues to slide, flights are being clubbed or cancelled. An airline official said reduction in frequencies was inevitable as carriers would not be able to sustain poor loads for long, particularly at a time when the Covid graph is rising and a turnaround is not immediately in sight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/flyer-count-dips-from-45k-to-25k-in-2-months-as-cases-rise-in-del-mum/articleshow/82186292.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Vijayawada||Hanuman born in Tirumala, says Tirupati temple; Karnataka mulls ASI survey||VIJAYAWADA: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams on Wednesday announced that Anjanadri hill in Tirupati is the birthplace of Lord Anjaneya or Hanuman. The TTD made the formal announcement during Sri Rama Navami celebrations in Tirumala. Prof Muralidhara Sharma, vice-chancellor of National Sanskrit University who made the announcement on behalf of TTD, explained that elaborate research was conducted by an expert committee set up to study Lord Hanuman’s birthplace. The panel submitted its report declaring Anjanadri as Hanuman’s birthplace, he said, adding that all 12 Puranas also mention Anjanadri as Lord Hanuman’s birthplace. “Besides, there are mythological, epigraphical, scientific, literary and geological evidence as well. In Valmiki Ramayana’s Sundarakanda episode, it is clearly mentioned that Hanuman was born to Anjana on these sacred mountains after a penance was done. Rock inscriptions at Srivari temple of 1491 and 1545 CE also mention Anjanadri as birthplace of Anjaneya,” Sharma said. However, there are several doubts among historians over the birthplace of Anjaneya. The five other places, which too lay claim to Hanuman’s origins, include the hillock near Anjanadri at Hampi in Karnataka, Anjan village in Jharkhand’s Gumla district, Anjan mountain in Navsari region of Gujarat, Kaithal region in Haryana, and Anjaneri at Tirambakeswar near Nashik, Maharashtra. Karnataka claims Hanuman was born on Anjanadri hill in Kishkinda, near Anegundi, in Koppal district, which abuts Hampi. Quoting Ramayana and mythological references, experts said it is believed that Kishkinda is the place where Rama and Lakshmana met Hanuman as they came in search of Sita. It is also believed that Anjanadevi gave birth to Hanuman on a hill in Kishkinda. Hence, the hillock is called Anjanadri. The scholars of Kannada University at Hampi have affirmed that there is no material evidence to prove that Anjaneya was born in Karnataka. Nevertheless, historians point out that Hampi region was popularly known as Kishkinda in the Puranas. Hence, it is possible that Anjaneya could have gone to Hampi from Tirumala which was just 363 km away. As Hampi was 1,240 kms from Gumla, 1626 km from Kaithal, and 616 km from Maharashtra, they ruled them all out and suggested that Hanuman’s migration to Hampi is feasible. “Our team of pundits worked hard to bring out concrete evidence and presented a 22-page report. We will display this report on our website too. Other states like Haryana, Jharkhand and Maharashtra do not have any evidence to back their claims,” TTD executive officer KS Jawahar Reddy said. Tamil Nadu governor Bhanwarilal Purohit, who was present during the programme, appreciated the research. “Ayodhya is the birthplace of Lord Ram and Anjanadri is Anjaneya’s,” he said. Meanwhile, the Karnataka government is contemplating seeking a survey by the Archaeological Survey of India. “We will not get into a confrontation with Andhra Pradesh. However, we will seek a survey by the ASI on the lines of Varanasi court’s decision to settle the matter over Kashi Vishwanath temple,” said KS Eswarappa, Karnataka minister for rural development and panchayat raj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hanuman-born-in-tirumala-says-ttd-ktaka-mulls-asi-survey/articleshow/82188522.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The activists left from across Punjab on vehicles hired by local or district units of the organisation, and also on trains. Several women were also among the activists. Jathas headed by BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan, secretary Shingara Singh Mann and functionary Ram Singh Bhainibagha left from Dabwali, Khanouri and Sardulgarh borders in hundreds of vehicles. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, after flagging off jathas, said, “Nearly 15,000 activists, including a large number of women, had left for Tikri border, where thousands of activists are already putting up. Besides, protests at 42 places across Punjab are continuing and will continue till farm laws are not repealed”. He said they chose April 21 for leaving for Delhi so they could pay tributes to the foundation of the Ghadar Party in 1913 in US. He said the party was founded to throw out imperial forces from India and the ongoing protests were like a second war for independence. Kokri Kalan said protesters will stay at the border for a week and then another jatha will replace many who would be wanting to return and this process of sending activists to protests would continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/thousands-leave-for-tikri/articleshow/82187189.cms||---

The centres are located in Shahdara, Rohini and Dwarka. Delhi Police commissioner S N Shrivastava said, “These facilities have been made for immediate relief till the time the patients get admission in regular Covid hospitals.” All districts were asked to identify places that could be turned into such facilities and these three sites were shortlisted. Delhi Police has taken help from Hamdard Foundation and Sewa Bharti to set up these centres. Doctors are being sourced from hospitals like GTB and Sir Gangaram while nurses and other paramedic staff are being provided by Hamdard Foundation. Oxygen cylinders are being provided by Sewa Bharti, an official said. The facility at the newly built quarters in the Shahdara police station complex is now functional with 78 beds, of which 20 are oxygen-supported. The Rohini centre will become operational soon with 20 beds, 10 with oxygen, Shrivastava said. Delhi Police PRO Chinmoy Biswal said, “Other facilities and medicines will be provided from Delhi Police resources that also include a dedicated ambulance to attend to emergencies.” A police team headed by an inspector-rank officer will look after the coordination at each centre. “One doctor and one nursing officer from GTB Hospital and a doctor from Gangaram and four nursing assistants from Hamdard Foundation are present round the clock at the Shahadra facility, which will be increased as per the patient load,” Biswal said. The Delhi Police top brass said it was taking all possible steps to help the infected personnel and their families. Since Tuesday, 243 cops have tested positive and two policemen have died due to Covid. Around 1,100 personnel have been infected during the current wave. During a stocktaking review with district DCPs, ACPs and SHOs on Tuesday, Shrivastava had stressed the health and safety of police personnel who were performing their duties as frontline warriors and running the risk of Covid infection. He had also directed deployment at pickets and areas in small groups and with social distancing while checking people or vehicles so that their exposure risk would be minimum. “The district and unit officers were told to keep sufficient stock of Covid equipment like PPE kits, masks and sanitisers and pay attention to repeated cleaning of toilets and common areas in the barracks and the police stations. Daily health monitoring of the staff is also being carried out for Covid safety,” Biswal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/may-the-force-be-with-you-care-centres-for-city-cops/articleshow/82187206.cms||Raj Shekhar

The south Delhi Police averted a major crisis when it restored oxygen supply to Batra Hospital, where over 350 covid patients are under treatment. On Wednesday night, R K Baniwal, the hospital’s chief engineer, informed the cops that there was oxygen only for two hours. Atul Thakur, DCP (South), immediately formed teams to handle the emergency. One team was sent to Mohan Cooperative Industrial Area with 60 empty oxygen cylinders to be refilled there and others teams went to escort two tankers, one from Panipat, another from Modi Nagar, tankers to Delhi. The teams managed to restore the hospital’s stocks within three hours. After Max Hospital, Saket, reported shortage of oxygen on Thursday, the cops created a green corridor from the Apsara border and escorted the vehicle coming from Kashipur in UP to Max. Police from Shalimar Bagh similarly escorted two trucks with oxygen and ensured their timely arrival at Fortis Hospital. In the case of Primus Hospital in Chanakyapuri too, police were able to persuade the Linde company in Faridabad to replenish the gas stocks that, at 8.30am on Thursday, was adequate only for five hours. Similar assistance was provided to Manipal Hospital in the delivery of oxygen from Faridabad by the Dwarka cops. Police actually arranged gas cylinders for Rathi Hospital in Ranhola, which had run out of oxygen. The cops arranged 37 cylinders from Bawana, 40 from Kanjhawala, 24 from Balaji Action Hospital and 20 from a Mayapuri Plant. Similarly, they arranged 17 cylinders from Faridabad for Jeewan Hospital in Sunlight Colony and 27 for Park Hospital in Vikaspuri. When informed that Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, Narela, had oxygen only for two hours, police took empty cylinders and rushed to the refilling station in Bawana to return with 20 cylinders. It carried out a similar rescue act at 4am in Maya Munni Ram Hospital in Maurya Enclave too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-restore-o2-supply-in-hospital-save-350-lives/articleshow/82204205.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Pvt hospitals gasp as supply of oxygen falls short||Rajkot: For the past two days, Rajkot private hospitals had been facing short supply of oxygen resulting in a few hospitals declining to admit new patients on Wednesday. However, later the district administration assured the hospital administrations of restoring normal supply by evening. Oxygen requirement in Rajkot’s Covid hospitals is around 90,000 kilo litre (KL) per day of which, around 40,000 KL is consumed by the civil hospital and Samras hostel alone. Around 900 patients are being treated in these hospital facilities. Dr Hiren Kothari, member of national working committee of Indian Medical Association (IMA) said, “We have been told that there is low supply from the agency where we are procuring oxygen. We had no option but to stop admitting newer patients as we have to first ensure that we can provide enough oxygen support to the existing patients.” The hospitals procure oxygen from private agencies but looking at the current scenario, the supply is being regulated by the government. According to doctors, a big chunk of the supply is diverted towards the civil hospital looking at its bigger number of patients.Congress leader Dr Hemang Vasavda said, “Shanti Covid hospital had repeatedly informed the district administration that their tank will soon get exhausted, but there was no response. Its administration had to then manage from another hospital. The majority of the hospitals have stopped admitting fresh cases owing to lack of sufficient oxygen support.” President of Rajkot Medical Association affiliated with IMA, Dr Praful Kamani said, “There was only 20 percent stock with the hospitals and the demand has also increased on Wednesday. Hence, there was anxiety among the hospitals in case they do not get more supply. We had a meeting with the collector and we are told that one tank has arrived at 4 pm and the other three tanks will arrive by midnight.” Nodal officer appointed by the state government to look after Covid situation in the Rajkot district, Rahul Gupta said, “There was a problem since Tuesday, but it has been resolved on Wednesday afternoon. So, there is no short supply now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/pvt-hospitals-gasp-as-supply-of-oxygen-falls-short/articleshow/82186288.cms||---

The relatives of six of the deceased alleged that the oxygen supply to the patients, who were on the ventilator, was disrupted for around 30 minutes in the afternoon at the facility. The hospital authorities, however, refuted the allegations and said the patients had multiple comorbidities and died due to health complications. Hailed as the first rural medical college in Asia, Swami Ramanand Teerth Rural Medical College is serving as a Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH) during the pandemic with a bed capacity of 300, including 34 ventilator beds. When contacted, hospital dean Shivaji Sukre said the DCH facility faced shortage of oxygen on Wednesday but the issue was addressed by sourcing it from other places. “We require 550 to 600 jumbo cylinders of oxygen per day and felt the shortage after supply from Latur was disrupted between 10am and 11am. However, we immediately arranged the necessary supply from five district places from Marathwada among other areas to regulate the supply,” he said. Sukre said the 11 deaths in question happened between midnight and 4pm on Wednesday. The affected families claimed that six Covid patients died within a few hours around Wednesday noon. Sukre said the DCH caters to the rural population, but public awareness about Covid-19 is low among them. “Late hospitalisation is common here, which often leads to health complications. We had witnessed 12 Covid deaths in our hospital in a day during the first wave of the pandemic last year,” he added. Meanwhile, Kej MLA Namita Mundada said. “The deaths of Covid patients at Ambajogai hospital were due to oxygen shortage. The government must offer ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh to the kin of each deceased, on the lines of Nashik tragedy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/11-covid-patients-die-at-beed-hosp-kin-blame-o2-shortage/articleshow/82185439.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Ahmedabad||Covid hospital moves Gujarat high court over government quota||AHMEDABAD: A designated Covid hospital in Patan has approached the Gujarat high court challenging the district collector’s decision to reserve 50% of beds to be administered by the government and alleged discriminatory treatment in comparison with other hospitals in the district. The case involves the 125-bed Sabrimala Hospital and Research Centre Pvt Ltd, which has been declared a Covid-19 hospital by the Patan district collector and has 62 reserved beds to be filled on the orders of the government authority.  The hospital filed a petition on Monday and senior advocate Sudhir Nanavati mentioned it before the high court on Tuesday, requesting the division bench headed by the chief justice for a hearing by an appropriate bench. The division bench agreed to grant a hearing on the issue soon. According to case details, the hospital was designated a Covid hospital in July 2020 and Covid patients were treated there on the basis of rates fixed by the government. The hospital has treated some 550 Covid patients since then. Nanavati said that the district collector issued another resolution on April 14, for Sabrimala Hospital, reserving 50% beds. He claimed differential treatment as MoUs inked with other hospitals in the district are not same. The petition contends that when a patient approaches the hospital for Covid treatment, it cannot admit it though these beds are empty as they are reserved by the government. The hospital raised a question as to how a government official can decide whether this particular hospital is proper for treatment and take a decision about treatment, which otherwise is a doctor’s purview. The hospital also faces difficulties as it has to spare four ventilators, the senior advocate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-hospital-moves-hc-over-govt-quota/articleshow/82187223.cms||---

The CM had tested positive for Covid-19 infection on February 15 this year. After getting the jab, Rupani appealed to eligible people, including those who had contracted coronavirus earlier, to get themselves vaccinated. “I contracted coronavirus around 60 days ago, and recovered from the infection after undergoing treatment. Do not be under the impression that you do not need vaccination if you have contracted the virus earlier. Even if you had tested positive for coronavirus in the past, you must take the vaccine as per the doctor’s advice,” Rupani told reporters. He said the state government has started preparations to expand the vaccination drive as the Centre has allowed people above 18 years to get inoculated from May 1. “In the current scenario, a vaccine is the only effective remedy against the virus. I urge people to get themselves vaccinated,” said Rupani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cm-gets-first-shot/articleshow/82186370.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Candidates, officials urge voters to wear masks, keep distance||Kolkata: The surge in Covid cases has led cops, poll officials and even candidates to appeal to voters to wear masks, keep their hands clean and maintain as much physical distancing as possible, when they visit the booths to cast their votes on Thursday. The caution has been especially sounded in North 24 Parganas, which alonme registered 2149 new Covid cases and 13,000 active cases on Wednesday. “We have been urging voters to wear masks and maintain distancing at polling booth as well as on roads and to avoid gatherings on poll day. We have been making announcements and distributing leaflets to make residents aware of Covid-19 even as they get ready to cast their votes,” said Ajay Nanda, commissioner of Barrackpore City Police. Election Commission officials had held a special meeting with cops and poll officials to ensure Covid protocols were maintained during the poll process and install barricades even before the entrance of booths to impose social distancing norms. “No one will be allowed to enter a polling booth without a mask and everyone will have to undergo temperature screening,” said a poll official. Marked by largescale pre- and post-poll violence in the past few years, the Election Commission has deployed 110 companies of CRPF, 4,500 state police force and 110 Quick Response Teams for the seven assembly constituencies in the Barrackpore industrial belt. All booths in the segments have been marked as “sensitive” as even a day before the poll, one person was killed and another was seriously injured when a bomb exploded inside an abandoned house on Wednesday morning near Titagarh railway station. In the evening, BJP candidate at Khardah Shilbhadra Dutta claimed bombs were hurled at him. A total of 306 contestants are in the poll fray in the sixth phase across 43 segments, including Trinamool ministers, such as Jyotipriya Mullick from Habra and Chandrima Bhattacharya from Dum Dum North assembly seats in North 24 Parganas and senior BJP leaders, such as Mukul Roy from Krishnagar North, his son Subhranshu from Bijpur, Arjun Singh’s son Pawan Singh from Bhatpara and Rahul Sinha from Habra. “While everyone should exercise their voting rights, voters should ensure they wear masks and maintain social distancing at the booths. While voting is important, people should also take care of their health and maintain all Covid precautions,” said Pawan Singh, sitting Bhatpara MLA and BJP candidate. Tollywood director and Trinamool Barrackpore candidate Raj Chakraborty also appealed for peace and maintenance of Covid protocols by his party workers as well as voters in his constituency. “I will personally distribute sanitiser and masks to all polling assistance booths set up by our party. I urge all voters and party workers to wear masks and not put themselves to risk during the poll process,” said Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/candidates-officials-urge-voters-to-wear-masks-keep-distance/articleshow/82186388.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Nashik||Nashik district struggles with supply of oxygen||Nashik: District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal said they have a daily requirement of 139 metric tonne of oxygen supply for the Covid patients as the number of new infections has seen a rise since March. Earlier this year, the district had a requirement for medical oxygen of 65 metric tonne a day, which gradually increased to 85 tonnes a day. “We now need 139 metric tonnes of oxygen per day in the district. We are taking all the efforts to get the oxygen but there are limitations,” Bhujbal said. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has already installed two large oxygen tanks at its Bytco and Zakir Hussain hospitals with a total capacity of 32,000 litres of liquid oxygen. They get regular supply of oxygen from the Pune-based private company, an Indian subsidiary of the Japanese firm, with which they have done a 10-year contract. While the capacity of the oxygen tank installed at the new Bytco hospital is 19,000 litres of the liquid oxygen, it is 13,000 litres at Zakir Hussain hospital. The NMC recently decided to set up an oxygen manufacturing plant in the city at a cost of over Rs 3 crore. The capacity of the proposed manufacturing plant will be around 500 jumbo cylinders per day. Both the large tanks installed at Bytco and Zakir Hussain have been hired on monthly rent along with supply of the liquid oxygen as per the requirement of oxygen for the NMC for the period of 10 years. While some government and private hospitals in Nashik are facing the shortage of oxygen, the two NMC hospitals with 430 oxygen beds are getting regular supply. Private hospital owners are themselves arranging cylinders and has appealed to the administration to streamline the supply as soon as possible. Additional collector Dattaprasad Nade said that four tankers are continuously ferrying liquid oxygen from the Konkan region. “There are about eight to nine oxygen manufacturing plants in Nashik, which process the liquid oxygen to medical oxygen and provide the same through jumbo cylinders to private hospitals,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-district-struggles-with-supply-of-oxygen/articleshow/82185451.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Clear rules for Covid care under govt health schemes’||AHMEDABAD: Public health activists and a group of NGOs from Gujarat have appealed to the chief justice of Gujarat high court to direct the state government to ensure that relevant protocols for Maa Yojana or Ayushman Bharat Card holders are in place for Covid treatment following its April 15 directive. In an affidavit filed on April 15, the Gujarat government had claimed that the two health schemes have been merged to provide medical treatment covering a wide spectrum of ailments including Covid-19 disease also. Apart from cities, a majority of the card beneficiaries are in rural areas and far-flung tribal talukas. In a letter to the CJ on Saturday, Mahiti Adhikar Gujarat Pehel secretary Pankti Jog explained that the card holders are facing three major issues. Firstly, the government list of Covid-designated hospitals are not empanelled under Maa or Ayushman card, but are recognised as ‘Covid hospitals’, and these hospitals are yet to be provided with guidelines or protocol on how to treat card holders with Covid infection. Jog also stated that there are orthopaedic and paediatric hospitals that have been converted to Covid hospitals, but there are no clear guidelines from the government on the line of treatment for Covid patients. “After the government provides a guideline, the hospitals will be required to upload test reports, CT or X-Ray scan reports and other Covid-related treatment details. These changes are yet to be undertaken by the government,” said Jog. She added that since many private and trust-run hospitals across the state are yet to get clarity from the government, they have not started admissions of MAA and Ayushman Bharat cardholders yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/clear-rules-for-covid-care-under-govt-health-schemes/articleshow/82187229.cms||---

A fourth year student of Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad, Shahi took the initiative days after the number of Covid-19 cases started surging across the city. At a time when thousands were crying for help on social media, a tweet by Shahi stating – “If you live in and around Khairtabad (Hyderabad), are in isolation and need someone to run errands for you, reach out to me. Will be happy to help.” came as a ray of hope for many of those in crisis. “I needed some essential items such as hand gloves, mask, fruits, sanitiser etc. after I was tested Covid-19 positive. I reached out to Rikit, who was happy to purchase all this and deliver it at my place,” said Abhi Yadav, a final year MBA student. Following the tweet put out by the law student, he was flooded with calls from people seeking information, requests to buy and deliver essential items among others. “Almost 20-30 people reached out to me of which six to seven requests were from those who wanted me to purchase items and deliver it to them. Many sought help in sourcing verified information regarding medicines, availability of beds and oxygen cylinders,” said Shahi. His spirit of helping out people was lauded by many on social media. “Really lost at words of how so many unknowns have reached out to help. I dropped a tweet with 0 hope of getting even a rt. Thanks everyone and it really means a lot. Also thanks to @chotesarcar for connecting me with a local pharmacy in Hyderabad,” tweeted Akash John, who was frantically looking for doses of Remdesivir on social media. It is not the first time that Shahi has gone out of his way to help people during the pandemic. “During the first wave, I along with few other law students had started an initiative to help migrants go back or rehabilitate them by finding them jobs. Looking at hundreds of requests on social media from people seeking help, I thought running errands is the least I can do,” said Shahi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/student-delivers-essentials-to-infected-sources-crucial-info/articleshow/82187232.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Kolkata||Bahubali politics takes the centre stage in factory belt||Barrackpore: A bomb blast in Titagarh a day before of the sixth phase polls has left voters guessing what is in store in this land of bahubali politics for Thursday. Issues have taken a back seat in the industrial belt in North 24 Parganas where late night bombings keep tormenting residents. A glance at the list of candidates in the fray makes it all too apparent. BJP candidate from Barrackpore, Chandramani Shukla lost his son Manish Shukla, killed in front of the party’s Titagarh office a few months back. Investigation has not made any headway over who killed him. Outgoing MLA and BJP strongman Arjun Singh’s son Pawan Singh is in the fray from Bhatpara that has been witnessing violence since Singh won the Barrackpore Lok Sabha seat in 2019. Arjun’s relative Sunil Singh is the BJP candidate from Noapara. All the three switched from TMC to BJP after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. They carried with them a majority of councilors from each municipality in this belt. But Trinamool regained control of the municipalities within months, sending out the message that the game is far from over. The strong-arm tactic and the continuing violence have made people, particularly in the old residential settlements of this industrial belt, feel insecure. They are known to be averse to such aggressive brand of politics. Trying to cash in on this sentiment, Trinamool has fielded Raj Chakraborty from Barrackpore, Manju Basu from Noapara to win support among the peace-loving people. Seasoned MLA Partha Bhowmik is the TMC candidate from Naihati. The film director-turned politician Chakrabarty has been reaching out to households putting on a “next-door boy” image. It has worked to some extent, especially among women voters who happen to be Mamata Banerjee’s mainstay. However, there is a rumour that a section of Trinamool men, who have been denied tickets this time, may play a spoilsport. Outgoing MLA and BJP leader Mukul Roy’s son Subhranshu is the BJP candidate from Bijpur. Pitted against him is Trinamool’s Subodh Adhikari who shepherded the majority councilors of Halishar and Kanchrapara municipalities back to the party. Adhikari is not going to concede any ground to Subhrangshu without a fight. The scene is not the same in three other key seats in urban North 24 Parganas — Dum Dum Uttar, Habra and Khardah. Habra is poised for a high-stake battle where state food minister and TMC’s North 24 Parganas president Jyotipriya Mullick is up against former BJP state president Rahul Sinha. If Mullick loses, he may lose the grip over the district party organization. And curtains may fall on Sinha if he can’t make it this time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bahubali-politics-takes-the-centre-stage-in-factory-belt/articleshow/82186393.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

The couple was found hanging to a tree on Tuesday evening in Sanga Reddy rural limits. The constable, 45, and his wife, 40, were residing in Kandi area of the district. The couple have two daughters. The eldest daughter had recently got engaged to a person chosen by her parents. Days before her marriage, the young woman allegedly eloped on Saturday. Family members suspect that she got married to her lover. After knowing about this, the couple reportedly felt dejected and humiliated. “The arrangements for the wedding was almost done. After they came to know about her elopement, they could not tell their relatives about this development as they felt very humiliated,” Sanga Reddy police said. Police said that though they did not come across any suicide note, as per the couple’s family members and other relatives, their daughter’s elopement perhaps made them take the extreme step. Both husband and wife hanged themselves using a single rope. Following the incident, the police sent the bodies to post-mortem and later they were handed over to their relatives. The constable was on leave for past two days, ever since he came to know about his daughter’s decision to go against their wishes. The girl had not told her parents that she was in love with another man. A case was registered under Section 174 (suspicious death) of CrPC.

---||Pune||Mark sheet, FYJC norms worry state board||Pune: Now that the state education board has decided to cancel the SSC examination for this year, there are questions about who will give the mark sheet to the students. There are other issues like how will these students apply for the Union government or state services without getting a mark sheet from the state board. Along with the immediate concern regarding First Year Junior College (FYJC) admissions as well as ITI and Polytechnic admissions are being discussed by the education department’s top officials. A senior official from the education department said all kinds of problems that have cropped up due to the cancellation of exams and solutions are being discussed. “ If the state board is not conducting the examination, then how can it give a mark sheet? If the state board doesn’t give a mark sheet, then who will? Many services in state and Union government that students can apply for after SSC. But for this, they need a mark sheet. Then there are a plethora of problems for FYJC admissions. Many suggestions are coming in and discussions are on. A decision will be out soon,” he said. A cut-throat competition erupts every year to get into the top colleges in the city. Many are filled up in the first two rounds. However, the cancellation of exams and possible differences in the way results will be calculated by each board has caused much confusion among parents. Educators are of the opinion that the best possible way is for each of the eight centralised admission committees to conduct their own online entrance examination. They also suggest that the board take the last three year’s results and declare a formula based on the same. Since none of the boards has yet declared what formula will be used, finding common ground is also hard at the moment, officials said. Meanwhile, parents of students of each board feel that the other boards will show leniency in marking, leading to lesser chances for their wards during admission. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, has suggested that a formula where the performance of students in the previous three or five classes is taken up and marks are given accordingly. Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) had come up with a similar formula last year, he said. Meena Shendkar, assistant director of education Pune division, said various ideas were being discussed and one of the suggestions is whether an entrance examination would be possible for FYJC admissions at least in the metro cities. “No decision has been taken at the moment but discussions are on and we are sending various proposals to the government. One of them is an online entrance examination, at least in the municipal corporation areas where the centralised admission process is followed. In rural areas, the internal marking pattern will not be a problem but in cities, especially in colleges, the case will be different. Equivalency across the board will not be a problem as we deal with it even when normalising regular board exam marks during FYJC admissions,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mark-sheet-fyjc-norms-worry-state-board/articleshow/82187247.cms||Ardhra Nair

At Titagarh, a 27-year-old youth was killed and another was seriously injured in an explosion at a local club off the GC Road at Khatal Para late on Tuesday night. Even the roof of the club building was blown away by the impact of the explosion. Police later seized at least eight container bombs, several empty containers and bomb-making materials from the spot. Police, however, suspect that the blast was caused by crude bombs. “Either the bombs were stored in the club building, one of which exploded, or the blast occurred while those bombs were being made there,” a senior police officer of the Barrackpore commissionerate said. According to local sources, the victim Rajkumar Jadav, a car driver by profession, was in the club while the blast took place around 1.30 am on Tuesday. He was rushed to the Barrackpore BN Bose hospital where he was declared brought dead. The Barrackpore BJP MP Arjun Singh claimed that Jadav was known as a Trinamool supporter who died while making bombs. The state food minister and district Trianamool chief Jyotipriya Mallick alleged that Singh hired miscreants from Bihar and Jharkhand to unleash a reign of terror in the area before the polls. In another incident, at least four persons were injured after bombs were hurled after a clash broke out between the supporters of Trinamool and BJP at Kanchrapara’s Manashapara on Tuesday night. Mamudpur in Jagaddal also witnessed similar incident with locals having alleged that both the rival groups hurled bombs at each other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1-killed-in-titagarh-on-election-eve/articleshow/82186396.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

Tope said the state currently has 6.85 lakh active Covid cases, 10-15% of whom require oxygen supply. “Maharashtra is producing 1,250 metric tonne oxygen and the entire quantity is being fully used for medical needs. In addition, we are getting 300 metric tonne oxygen supply from Bhilai, Jamnagar and Bhillari,” he said. He added that the Centre is planning to import 50,000 metric tonne oxygen and Maharashtra could get supply from that too. In addition, there are six places in Maharashtra that are manufacturing oxygen but do not have bottling facility. This is posing as a hurdle over transporting oxygen. "There is a proposal under consideration to set up 500 bed temporary hospitals at these places. This will add 3,000 beds in the state," Tope said. These are at Pen, Thal, Wardha, Khaparkheda, Paras and Parli. The purity of the oxygen manufactured here is 97% and it can be provided to patients, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/centre-should-give-500-tonne-oxygen-to-maha/articleshow/82185482.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chennai||How green isn’t my valley||Thadagam valley appears battered. The greenery of the land is pulled out in chunks, nearly 100ft deep trenches crisscross it and the age-old streams that ran across it are dry. The scene is the effect of exploitation by brick kilns that mushroomed on the forest fringes in the area over the past few decades. This forced elephants to change their tried and tested paths, bringing them closer to human territories and resulting in more instances of man-animal conflict.Though most of the brick kilns in the valley have been shut and sealed for over a month now, environmentalists say the damage done to the elephant corridor and the valley’s groundwater table is immeasurable. Now to recreate the elephant corridor and revive some of the streams may be impossible or take decades, fear environmentalists. Though people can dig only as deep at 6.5ft, for any mining activity, and are not allowed to dig at all in land under the hill area conservation authority, brick kiln owners had dug anywhere between 15ft to more than a 100ft deep trenches along the fringes of the Western Ghats, a Unesco world heritage site and a biodiversity hotspot. "Thadagam valley used to be a paradise for bull elephants. At a specific time of the year the animals would leave their herd and wander away to find a mate," says S Muralidharan of the Indian Centre for Animal Rights and Education, one of petitioners who filed a case against the kiln owners. "The valley used to be a farming region so the animals could access food easily," he says.The natural water sources too felt the heat of exploitation. Many streams like Sanganoor used to originate in Thadagam and were fed by at least 14 other streams, says environmentalist, Mohan Raj. "The Kowsika river used to pass through Thadagam and would recharge groundwater, help to irrigate farms and was a drinking water source for animals," he says. The first brick kilns began to appear in the early 1990s. There were around 10 units producing around 3,000 bricks each after taking mud from under the waterways. They mushroomed after 2010 when Kerala and Karnataka banned mining of red sand that was required to make tiles and brick. Many entrepreneurs bought the old machinery from closed tile and brick factories in the neighbouring states, modified them and set up their own units in the region."The deep trenches formed by scooping out mud were in the path of the elephant corridor. The elephants would often fall into them. The ones that tried to avoid the trenches and take alternative routes would enter human territory and be chased away," says activist S Ganesh. "The trenches would also prevent elephants that wandered out of the forest for food to re-enter it easily," says Mohan Raj.The effects of the brick kiln industry go far deeper, says Muralidharan as the units have poisoned the corridor by burning material like rubber, lignite, furnace oil and palmyra bark. "The palmyra wood also attracts elephants. The burning of the other material emanated thick smoke that led to respiratory issues among people in the area," he says.Erstwhile farmers of the region recall how fertile the Thadagam valley used to be where all kinds of millets, pulses and vegetables could be cultivated. "Our issues began when the kiln owners began mining sand from trenches much deeper than the permitted 6.5ft," says state secretary of Tamizaha Vivasaikal Sangam, V Venugopal alias Velu Naicker. "The trenches were so deep they broke the flow of multiple natural streams. The groundwater level began falling. As the trenches grew deeper, the soil’s moisture holding capacity too began depleting leading to the soil’s becoming infertile," he says. "When we build check dams a few years ago, the kiln owners broke them while mining mud."The damage is so deep that restoration would take decades and would need focussed planning, say experts. "We have to first take back the patta land and poromboke lands where the trenches were dug by cancelling pattas and landscaping the entire stretch to reduce depth of the trenches," says Mohan Raj. "We also have to find ways to replace the top soil," he says. The broken check dams also have to be reconstructed, said Velu Naicker. But the obstacle starts there as the forest department says it cannot take up remediation activities because the trenches have been dug up in patta and poromboke land. "We think we should let nature correct itself with the rain over many years slowly, correcting the landscape on its own," says district forest officer Venkatesh Durairaj."The truth is there is no specific department to take up remediation work unless the government sets up such a force," says Mohan Raj. Looking forward, Muralidharan says their fight is to remove all encroachments on elephant corridors in the district because only then will man-animal conflict stop and the forest fringes begin to rejuvenate again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/how-green-isnt-my-valley/articleshow/82189503.cms||---
---||Erode||Parents of 6-year-old held over bid to sacrifice kid in Erode||ERODE: Five people, including the parents of a six-year-old girl, were arrested in Erode district on Wednesday on charges of planning to kill their daughter in a child sacrifice bid. The girl’s maternal grandmother, who lodged a complaint with the police against her daughter and son-in-law, said the child’s parents and three others had tortured the child and his 15-year-old brother for a long time. The accused were identified as the girl’s mother R Ranjitha, 37, father R Ramesh, 44, from Punjai Pilyampatti near Sathyamangalam, Ramesh’s second wife R Indumathi, 34, and their acquaintances Dhanalakshmi alias Sasi, 38, and S Mariappan, 42, from Edappadi in Salem. Police said it was Dhanalakshmi, a sorcerer, who allegedly persuaded the couple to sacrifice the six-year-old girl. “We have nabbed five people. The allegations seem to be true. Further probe is on,” ADSP Kanageswari said. According to the complaint lodged by the girl’s grandmother, B Bagyam, on April 13, her daughter Ranjitha and son-in-law Ramalingam had two children aged six years and 15 years. “Ramalingam, a textile trader, had married Indhumathi, six years back. Since Ranjitha did not object to the marriage, the three were living together at a house at Rail Nagar in Rangampalayam with the two grandchildren,’’ Bagyam said in the complaint. Narrating further, Bagyam said Indhumathi brought home her acquaintance Dhanalakshmi, a sorcerer from the same locality last year. She used to frequent the house ever since and of late started performing odd rituals at night. She would dress like Lord Shiva during the process. “In February, Dhanalakshmi told the couple that they would be bestowed with enormous power, if they sacrifice the girl,’’ police said. The 15-year-old boy overheard the conversations and informed the grandmother. When she went and sought an explanation, Ranjitha and Ramalingam abused her and sent her away. Bagyam visited the office of the district superintendent of police and lodged a complaint. She had alleged that they discontinued the boy’s schooling and did not admit the girl in school though she was six years old. They were forced to do household chores throughout the day and were beaten often, Bagyam alleged. “I asked for the boy’s school transfer certificate so that I can enrol him in another school. But they refused,’’ she said. As soon as she lodged the complaint, the five fled Erode. A special team was formed which was searching for them. The team intercepted a car near Perundurai on Wednesday morning and found the five inside, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/parents-of-6-yr-old-held-over-bid-to-sacrifice-kid/articleshow/82187248.cms||---

---||Nashik||Cylinders brought on scooters as kin raced to save lives||Nashik: A desperate scramble began for oxygen cylinders as soon as the leak started at Zakir Hussain Hospital. According to eyewitness accounts, doctors and nurses were running from patient to patient to save as many as they could. A total of 157 patients, including 63 critical with serious Covid symptoms, were undergoing treatment at the hospital when the oxygen tank started leaking around 12.30pm on Wednesday. “We immediately shifted five patients to other city hospitals. We also managed to bring in some oxygen cylinders from outside locations and kept up supply to patients till lines from the tank were restored after an hour,” Manoj Kankriya, the hospital's medical officer, said. Relatives of patients described chaotic scenes. Many were seen bringing in oxygen cylinders on scooters. Sanjay Prasad, a resident of Shivaji Nagar in Satpur, said, "I was outside the hospital's main gate when the leak started. I ran inside when I started hearing shouts of people. When I reached the ward where my mother was admitted, I saw nurses and doctors running from one patient to another. I saw a woman near my mother's bed; she was gasping for breath." Prasad said his mother survived the incident as she was not on oxygen support. "She has been in the hospital for nine days. I don't have the courage to move her to another hospital because there's a city-wide shortage of oxygen and beds." Ravi Shinde, from Pawan Nagar, said patients were dying in the arms of their relatives. "I saw people trying to press the chests of patients. There was intense chaos as people were screaming for doctors or nurses. It was horrifying." Shinde said his father is stable and recovering. For days now, Nashik city has been facing a serious shortage of hospital beds. Most hospitals in the city are completely occupied with administrators saying there are not enough beds or medical oxygen. Officials said arrangements are being made to procure more medical-grade oxygen. State health minister Rajesh Tope, who visited the hospital on Wednesday evening, said Nashik divisional commissioner, Radhakrishna Game, will head the investigation into the incident. He said an official report will be released within a week. It’s still unclear what triggered the leak in the tank. "The investigation team will determine if it was a human or technical fault that caused the leak. The team will also come out with standard operating procedures to prevent such incidents from happening. The team will submit a report within a week," Tope said. He added that there should be a mechanism to remotely monitor pressure gauges of the tank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cylinders-brought-on-scooters-as-kin-raced-to-save-lives/articleshow/82185486.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Pune||First-year law courses may end in December||Pune: The first-year law courses for the academic year 2020-21, which generally end by May, will now conclude in December. The extended institutional round for admissions ended on April 17 and each semester is expected to have at least 90 days. As a result, the first semester that started on April 5, will end in July and the next semester will end by November/December, said Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). Meanwhile, if the 2021-22 batch is also admitted before August this year, then colleges will have two first-year batches at the same time and would need to hire visiting faculty as well as arrange additional online classes, added Karmalkar. Among all admissions conducted by the state CET cell, the law admissions were delayed the most due to incessant technical glitches in the software used for the process. “Most centralized law admission rounds were completed on April 8. However, the extended institutional round ended on April 17. If we consider the term to begin from April 5, 90 to 100 days of the first semester will be completed by July and the second term will be completed by November-December. Colleges have already started teaching in March for the first two divisions as their admissions were completed earlier. For the next two divisions, online classes started in March-end or April first week. Hence, the first year will get extended till December 2021,” said Karmalkar. He added that there is very little chance of two first-year batches overlapping this year. “For the next academic year, the CET notification is not yet out . From the year CET was introduced for Law admissions, the centralized process has continued till October or November. So, if the same pattern continues, next year’s LLB admissions will also be pushed till October/November ,” added Karmalkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/first-year-law-courses-may-end-in-december/articleshow/82187260.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Citizenship, agri issues at play as 43 seats go to polls||KOLKATA: The 43 assembly seats in north and south Bengal going to polls during the sixth phase on Thursday offer a mixed bag throwing up similar patterns beyond their geographical locations. For instance, one feels like covering the Bihar elections while talking to voters in Chopra, Islampur, Goalpokhor assembly constituencies of Uttar Dinajpur. A large section of Muslims here speak Urdu that one gets to find deep down south in the jute mills areas of North 24 Parganas spread over Barrackpore, Naihati, Jagatdal, Bhatpara assembly constituencies. But there is a difference also. The above three constituencies plus another two — Chakulia and Karandighi — in Uttar Dinajpur popularly known as the “chicken’s neck” are flanked by Bangladesh on side and Bihar on the other, making the poll issues quite different from Bhatpara, Jagatdal or Naihati. Uttar Dinajpur is also home to a large number of converted Muslims — Nashya Sheikhs who migrated from Rangpur and Rajshahi in erstwhile East Pakistan. They speak in Bengali like the resident Rajbanshi population. The next set in this list of 43 assembly seats is a couple of rural assembly constituencies in Nadia and North 24 Parganas that have at least one thing in common. Chapra and Krishnaganj assembly seats in Nadia and Bangaon Uttar, Bongaon Dakshin, Gaighata, Swarupnagar in North 24 Parganas border Bangladesh. What’s more is this land is known as the Matua belt — the home to Namashudras, the Matuas. Both BJP and Trinamool are playing up sentiments over citizenship, infiltration, to woo voters. The Matuas were with the Left before 2006. They started gravitating towards Trinamool after that and solidly remained with Didi till 2016. The BJP made inroads into this belt during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. PM Modi paid a visit to the seat of Matua religion at Orakandi in Bangladesh to checkmate Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. The third and a crucial set in the mixed bag is a host of rural constituencies where farming is the mainstay. The most prominent among them are five seats in Purba Burdwan — Katwa, Ketugram, Mangalkote, Ausgram and Galsi — part of Bengal’s rice bowl. Add to them the Nadia seats — Tehatta, Kaliganj, Nakashipara and Karimpur, Amdanga and Bagda in North 24 Parganas, Hemtabad and Kaliaganj in Uttar Dinajpur. BJP seniors are desperate to win support from this farming belt so that they can tell the world that farmers are with PM Modi despite the continuing farmer agitation in the Singhu border near Delhi. The sixth phase will cross the half-way mark of the total 294 assembly seats. This phase is packed with big fights between state food minister Jyotipriya Mullick and former BJP state president Rahul Sinha at Habra, state minister Chandrima Bhattacharya and Tanmoy Bhattacharya in Dum Dum Uttar. BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy is in the fray this time from Krishnanagar Uttar. BJP heavyweight Arjun Singh’s son Pawan Singh will be put to test at Bhatpara. Trinamool minister Abdul Karim Chowdhury is contesting from Islampur and former minister and CPI leader Srikumar Mukherjee from Itahar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/citizenship-agri-issues-at-play-as-43-seats-go-to-polls/articleshow/82186407.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Neta ‘browbeats’ civic doctor, caught on video||MUMBAI: A video of a Shiv Sena corporator trying to “arm-twist doctors into attending to a patient” at a BMC-run hospital has gone viral on social media. The footage shows Sandhya Doshi, a corporator from Gorai, arguing with a doctor at Bhagwati Hospital, Borivli, telling the medico that she (Doshi) can “replace the doctor with 10 other” medical professionals. The video shows Doshi accompanied by a man who is not wearing a mask. This has set the fur flying between Shiv Sena and its former ally, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which has put out the video on Twitter. The video also triggered an angry reaction from the health care fraternity. Doshi, on her part, claimed that the issue was being politicised. In the same vein, she said that she was willing to apologise to doctors. Doshi, who also holds the post of chairperson of the civic education committee for a second term, called up the officer of the municipal ward concerned, asking her to come to the casualty immediately. The patient over whom Doshi is purportedly arguing with the doctor was still to be admitted. The BJP’s Pratik Karpe who tweeted the video said that the incident has upset doctors. “Covid cases are increasing and we need doctors the most in these tough times,” said Karpe who is a member of the civic education committee. “I have written to the chief minister and the municipal commissioner, seeking action against her.” Soon after the video went viral, health care staff at the hospital responded by recording a video. This one shows them threatening to resign due to the incident. In this video, a doctor says: “We have been working under constant stress everyday and are seeing our colleagues fall ill due to Covid. Amid all this, if someone expects us to pay attention to a particular patient, it will not be possible... Whoever claims they can get 10 doctors in our place, we request them to go aghead and do so. We will resign.” Doshi, a three-term corporator, clarified that she has never tried to use throw her weight around. “But this was a genuine case. The patient, who has a heart ailment, was being kept waiting despite his deteriorating condition ,” said Doshi. “But, I would like to apologise to doctors if they have been hurt by anything that I have said.” Watch Viral Video: Shiv Sena corporator Sandhya Doshi creates a ruckus at Bhagwati Hospital||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-neta-browbeats-civic-doctor-caught-on-video/articleshow/82188562.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||Cops provide green corridor, pick and drop oxygen cylinders too||New Delhi: With various hospitals in the city facing an oxygen crisis, Delhi Police has turned out to be their SOS number. Since Tuesday night, at least five hospitals were supplied oxygen cylinders, with the cops even creating green corridors for their fast and free movement. A green corridor was created after an oxygen tanker that was scheduled to reach Jaipur Golden Hospital got stuck in Haryana near the Singhu border. Another corridor was created for Santom Hospital in Rohini. Its medical superintendent called the SHO Prashant Vihar to tell him that the facility had a critically low level of oxygen supply, which might put life of 130 patients at risk. “Various vendors dealing in oxygen cylinders were contacted and cylinders were arranged from Rithala within an hour,” Rohini DCP Pranav Tayal said. A green corridor was also provided by the Prashant Vihar police station to the ambulance carrying the cylinders, he added. In Dwarka, Akash Hospital also got oxygen cylinders after police were informed that its supply might not last long. Inspector Surender Sandhu, station house officer (SHO) of Dabri, and a team collected empty cylinders and looked for oxygen at Wazirpur Oxygen Gas Godown and Jeevan Park in Dabri, but couldn’t get any due to shortage of supply. But they managed to arrange 37 cylinders from Mayapuri Oxygen Plant and took it to the hospital. The cylinders were taken immediately to the ICU ward. “We have provided our mobile numbers to the hospital doctors for any such need in future,” said Dwarka DCP Santosh Meena. In Shahdara, senior officials of ESI Hospital Jhilmil contacted the SHO Vivek Vihar as the oxygen supply was running short for its 52 Covid beds. Oxygen was supposed to reach the hospital at 10pm on Tuesday night, but didn’t till 4pm on Wednesday as the driver of the vehicle carrying the supply went on a wrong route. With the supply left for just one-two hours, the SHO managed to get oxygen within an hour. Both Holy Family and Jeevan hospitals also faced the same problem. Without wasting a minute, the staff members of Jangpura police station arranged 10 oxygen cylinders for Holi Family and five for Jeevan hospitals, respectively. Another hospital in Janakpuri was also provided oxygen cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-provide-green-corridor-pick-and-drop-oxygen-cylinders-too/articleshow/82187275.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Trichy||This Trichy bard puts his poems for sale online to feed the needy||TRICHY: Poets are known to be hungry to do something for the community, but this techie-turned-bard from Trichy has found his true calling in feeding those crying of hunger. Meet Kavin Kumar, a 24-year-old project engineer with Wipro in Chennai, who dabbled with Tamil poetry as a pastime and soon turned his passion into service to feed 2,000 people with the Rs 70,000 he earned by selling poems online through his Instagram page ‘Malalai Kavingan’ in a year. A native of Annamalai Nagar in the city, Kavin used to distribute food packets to the needy at Teppakulam, Amma Mandapam and near Rajagopuram in Srirangam. He says he started off charging Rs 20 for a poem from those who wanted to use it. “Soon, people started liking my work and I started receiving requests for customized poetry,” Kavin said. To support him in his cause, his Instagram followers started paying him more than what he normally charged for a poem. “There are people from Canada and Sri Lanka, too, who support my cause,” said Kavin who has more than 35,000 followers on social media. Kavin recalls that it was his habit of signing in Tamil in his childhood that brought him closer to the language and earned him attention in school and college. But instead of burying his poems in notebooks, he published them on social media. “As the lockdown started last year, people living on the streets found it difficult to get food. As I started working from home, I could not balance my work and food distribution. So I decided to take requests for poems in advance so that I get more request and more money to feed more people,” he said. “There are many people abandoned by their family members who had painful stories to narrate. On many occasions I had one food pack in hand and there were more than three waiting for it. I could not think about wasting food after seeing their longing faces,” he said. Kavin tested positive for Covid-19 along with his father while distributing food last year but the family never discouraged him from doing the service. With people struggling to fend off the second wave of Covid-19, Kavin has started taking advance requests from his over 35,000 followers on social media so that he can feed more people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/this-trichy-bard-puts-his-poems-for-sale-online-to-feed-the-needy/articleshow/82187267.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Muslim family buries Hindu Covid patient after hospital switches bodies, exhumed later||BAREILLY: A Muslim family ended up burying a Hindu man, thinking it was their kin, and a Hindu family nearly cremated a Muslim man after a private hospital mistakenly swapped the bodies of two Covid-19 patients in Moradabad on Monday. The Hindu man, in his 60s, from Bareilly, had been admitted to the hospital on April 15 after he complained of shortness of breath. The Muslim man, in his early 40s, had been admitted on the same day. Both tested positive for Covid-19 on April 16 and died on Monday. “The body was handed over to us wrapped in PPE. We had requested the hospital authorities to let us see the body one last time but they refused because of Covid-19 protocols,” said the Hindu man’s brother-in-law. When they got the Loco Shed crematorium in Moradabad, they waited four hours — there was a long queue ahead of them. But just as they were about to place the body on the pyre, they realised it was “too light”. Then, someone caught a glimpse of the face. “It was someone else,” the brother-in-law said. “When we got in touch with the hospital, they were not of much help.” So, they called the police. They did not know whose body that was. “Moradabad Police then accessed the data of all patients who had died at the hospital that day. It turned out the body we had been given was that of a man from Rampur,” the brother-in-law added. The Muslim man’s family had, by then, buried the body they had received — which was that of the Hindu man. “Keeping in mind Covid-19 guidelines, we did not check the body and performed the last rites,” the Muslim man’s brother said. The body was exhumed on Tuesday and the Hindu man’s family identified it as his. The Muslim man’s body was also handed back to his family. “It was a great lapse on the part of the hospital,” additional SP (Moradabad) Anil Kumar said. Sub divisional magistrate of Sadar Moradabad, Prashant Tiwari, added, “Because the bodies were wrapped in triple-layer PPE because of Covid protocols, it is possible the hospital handed over the wrong bodies to families. It is a matter of negligence and a probe has been ordered."

The officer said, “The complainant and her husband got acquainted with the suspect in 2017 through a mutual friend. The suspect introduced himself as a civil engineer and owner of real estates at various places. He also told them that many people had earned a good profit on their investments made through him in the share market.” The suspect then told the woman that he was in need of money and promised her handsome returns. “Believing him, the woman gave him Rs 5 lakh. The suspect and his wife gave her in writing that they were borrowing money from her,” the officer said. Kamble said using a similar modus, the couple duped 11 more people. In all, they committed fraud of Rs 66 lakh. “The couple have been booked under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/couple-booked-for-cheating-12-of-rs-66l/articleshow/82187265.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Shortage of Remdesivir and oxygen continues for 2nd day in row||NAGPUR: The doctors at Covid hospitals in the city remained very tense as anti-viral drug Remdesivir and oxygen were in short supply. This prevented them from concentrating on treating the patients. As per sources, for the second consecutive day on Wednesday, the city received around 1,000 vials of Remdesivir with the death count reaching 98. Sources from the district and Food and Drugs Administration stated that long queues at Bhilai plant and slow movement of the tankers have added to the problem. “There is heavy rush at the Bhilai plant as the demand for oxygen is from many states. Also, tankers have to move at 4o kmph to avoid dangerous breaking,” said a senior official from the district administration, adding that a tanker takes “at least three days to reach Nagpur from Bhilai”. The FDA, following heavy protests over shortage of oxygen by some hospitals, is learnt to have reframed the oxygen allotment policy for Covid and non-Covid patients. Some hospitals are learnt to be receiving a separate quota of oxygen for non-Covid patients now to avoid inconvenience. It’s also learnt that the chief secretary has written to the commissioner of the Skill Development Department to extend help in setting up an oxygen plant for clinical use at Mahagenco sites at Khaparkheda in Nagpur, Paras in Akola and Parli in Beed. The state government has also urged district collectors to focus on setting up more oxygen-generation plants. After the day’s anxious wait, some of the hospitals on Wednesday got a few vials of Remdesivir (Orange City Hospital and Research Institute got 17 vials). While a couple received one and there were some like Radiance hospital in east Nagpur which did not receive even a single vial. The Remdesivir allotment was made from some of the stock which was received on Tuesday. It was nowhere close to the demands of more than 16,000 vials for the existing patients at different hospitals. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of the Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA) and managing director at Orange City, said he had to set up a clinical committee to decide the names of the patient who would get those 17 injections. “We have got 17 cylinders of oxygen,” he said. Dr Manoj Purohit, of the Radiance hospital, said he received no stock of Remdesivir but is hopeful of being provided some when the vials arrive. “We are continuing with whatever drugs possible to replace Remdesivir but recovery would certainly be slow,” he said. While the hospitals claimed to be under stress for not receiving Remdesivir, the district administration kept the fingers crossed about receiving more stock on Thursday. After being heavily pulled up by the high court, the district administration and FDA are trying to fetch more stock from the manufacturers. Oxygen shortage too kept the hospital managements, district administration and FDA on their toes. With a shortfall of at least 25-30 metric tonnes, the district administration remained engaged in rationing the supply to hospitals. According to Ehtesham Parekh, a social worker engaged in providing free oxygen cylinders, his vehicle is waiting at “the supply station where there is a serpentine queue” and his turn “is expected to come after several hours”. According to Dr Praveen Bais of Nucleus Mother and Child Hospital, said he got some oxygen cylinders which helped him save some patients. A relative of a patient told TOI that he managed to get one oxygen cylinder on his own allowing the kin to continue treatment in the same hospital. “I took an empty oxygen cylinder from the hospital and got a refill after roaming for hours. I had to pay Rs 1,500 for refilling whereas its costs around Rs 400 during normal times. I had no option as finding a bed in another hospital is impossible. I don’t know how I will manage this again,”he said. BOX Highway patrol on alert, Upadhyay Additional DG (state traffic) BK Upadhyay said the highway patrol police have been alerted to remain on toes to ensure smooth movement of the oxygen tankers across the state. He said state government has told the highway patrol department to ensure the oxygen tankers are not obstructed or held up at traffic snarls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/shortage-of-remdesivir-and-oxygen-continues-for-2nd-day-in-row/articleshow/82187281.cms||Soumitra Bose

Speaking to TOI, Pandey said they would study the standard operating procedure (SOP) of oxygen supply to patients admitted to the hospital and at which stage the supply was disrupted. “Our enquiry is underway and things would soon be clear,” he added. By Wednesday evening, no case had been registered by the police. The police commissioner said the oxygen supply was cut possibly at the time of refilling the hospital tank. “A tanker had come to refill oxygen at the hospital. However, it is yet to be ascertained if the incident happened at the time of refilling the oxygen from the tanker or not. Things will be clear during the course of enquiry,” he said. The police had maintained a strict bandobast at the hospital to ensure that there is no untoward incident as the relatives of the deceased patients were in a state of shock and visibly aggrieved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/conducting-inquiry-into-leakage-says-top-cop/articleshow/82185505.cms||Santosh Sonawane

In an FIR lodged with the Bhosari MIDC police, the teacher stated that the firm added investors through a multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme and duped them. In the Marathwada region, as many as 300 people have fallen prey to the scheme offered by the company. “In 2018, representatives of the company visited Beed district and introduced an MLM scheme where the people had to invest Rs 7,500 initially. The company offered commission on the basis of multiplication of members by one investor in the scheme,” the complainant stated in the FIR. He said the company also offered a Thailand tour and an additional 5% commission on the profit earned by the firm. “I invested Rs 8.5 lakh in the scheme. In the last three years, the firm returned only Rs 92,000. They also promised a piece of land to the investors. With the land being barren, I insisted on the return of my money. When the firm did not return it, I filed a complaint,” the FIR read.

The hospital, meanwhile, admitted “disruption of services during refilling of oxygen”, but said that it did not lead to the deaths. Chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the medical college, Dr UP Sinha, said, “The authorized firm was refilling oxygen cylinders and there was some disruption in services. But it did not cause any deaths.” But the families alleged negligence. Minutes before dying, a man called his son and said that there was “no care inside the hospital”. Pradeep, son of a Covid-19 patient, Sarvjeet Singh, 52, from Kahaliya village, told TOI, “My father was diabetic. On Tuesday night, he called and said that he was not able to breathe and would die soon. He also said that he wasn’t put on oxygen support and there was no one in the ward. I was outside the hospital and immediately rushed to the Covid-19 ward. But I was denied entry by doctors. A ward boy tried to help me. He arranged a video call. But soon he was asked to disconnect the call. I was told that my father was given medicine and he had gone to sleep. The next morning, I was told that my father had died in the night and his body was kept in the mortuary. I wish I hadn’t brought my father here for treatment.” Suneel, the son of another Covid-19 patient, said, “My father called me four times saying that he was unable to breathe and there was no oxygen support. Later, his phone got switched off. Sometime later, I was told that my father passed away. His phone was deliberately switched off but the staff said that his phone’s battery had drained. They didn’t want him to make a complaint. The phone was new and the battery was above 50% when I spoke to him last.” Vipashna Saxena, a woman with a complaint of breathlessness, was admitted at district hospital on Tuesday morning. She died during midnight hours. Her sons and other family members created ruckus at the hospital, vandalised the ward and threw medicines on the floor. Police have registered an FIR against them. The CMS told TOI, “The doctors and the support staff are working day and night to treat the patients. Many patients have recovered while a few have died but there is no negligence. There was possible oxygen scarcity in the general ward where a woman died during treatment but the doctor had treated her throughout the day and she was also put on oxygen support. The priority is to ensure oxygen supply in the Covid-19 ward as per guidelines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/3-patients-die-in-shahjahanpur-medical-college-kin-say-there-was-no-oxygen-support/articleshow/82184669.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Maximum number of cancellations are being reported for April 25, which is a Sunday and one of the most auspicious dates of the month.Manish Rai, owner of a city hotel, said, “At least six functions were booked at my hotel from April 20 to 30 that have been cancelled due to the capping of guests at 20. There is also panic among people as now every host requires a permission from the authorities for organising a function for more than 10 guests. Though we are going to suffer huge losses, we have refunded the entire booking amount on humanitarian grounds as it was not clients’ fault. Instead of allowing 20 people and imposing a curfew 8pm onwards, the government should have imposed a full lockdown in Punjab.”Jagdish Kumar, a florist, said, “We were booked for four functions scheduled to take place at marriage palaces of the city in these 10 days, but all have been cancelled. It has put us in a difficult situation, as we had already placed orders and even paid an advance for flowers to our suppliers. Now, we don’t know if they will adjust our advance against new orders or not.”Prem Singh Baghel, an event manager, said, “Marriage palaces are seeing the largest number of cancellations, as the number of persons allowed in outdoor functions was earlier 100 and now it has been reduced to 20. Maximum cancellations are for April 25, which, besides being a Sunday, was among the most auspicious days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/hospitality-inc-suffers-as-large-number-of-events-cancelled/articleshow/82185507.cms||Mohit Behl

Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar issued a statement on Wednesday saying a criminal case would be registered against a private YouTube channel for reporting false information. “The channel had wrongly shown that police used lathi last night.

---||Pune||Pune: Ex-MP Kakade held for criminal’s rally, gets bail||PUNE: Former Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Kakade was arrested by the Pune police on Wednesday on the charge of aiding the rally of criminal on police record Gajanan alias Gaja Marne, involving more than 300 vehicles with several ‘supporters’ in tow, from Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai to Pune on February 15. The rally was taken out after Marne’s acquittal in a murder case and his subsequent release. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI, “We have found his (Kakade’s) role in planning and providing logistical support to the rally and related activity. Hence, he has been arrested.” Later on Wednesday afternoon, a magisterial court ordered Kakade’s release on bail against a cash surety of Rs25,000 with the condition that he should furnish a personal release surety on Thursday. Kakade’s lawyer Chinmay Inamdar told TOI, “Barring Section 7 of the Criminal Amendment Act, which is a non-bailable offence, all other charges including criminal conspiracy and criminal intimidation were bailable offences. Even in the case of the non-bailable charge, we brought to the court’s notice that there was no evidence against our client. The court upheld our view.” Kakade, a real estate developer-turned-politician, was elected to the RS as an independent candidate and he later joined the BJP. Marne, who is accused of heading one of the active organised criminal gangs in Pune, has seven serious criminal cases in Pune city, Pune rural and Navi Mumbai which are in different stages of trial. It is the police’s case that the rally with several high-end cars and raucous supporters was part of a ploy to terrorise witnesses and victims in the pending cases and send a signal to the rival gangs about Marne’s clout and influence. The rally created a furore in Pune as it cocked a snook at law enforcers. For a week later, video clips of the rally with many likes and messages glorifying Marne were circulating on different social media platforms, prompting the Pune police to register an FIR with the Bund Garden police. Kakade’s arrest came as a consequence of this FIR, the police said. Earlier on Wednesday, the city crime branch officials had summoned Kakade for questioning in connection with the rally. Senior inspector Vinayak Gaikwad and his team arrested Kakade around 11.30am and later in the afternoon produced him before a holiday court seeking his custodial remand for five days. In his remand report, senior inspector Gaikwad stated that the police wanted to find the link between Kakade and Marne and how the rally was carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ex-mp-kakade-held-for-criminals-rally-gets-bail/articleshow/82187273.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Mumbai||17 out of 200 BMC Covid victims’ kin get Centre’s aid||MUMBAI: More than 200 BMC staff died of Covid-19 since March last year, but only a handful of their kin got Rs 50 lakh compensation under the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). BMC urged the ministry of health & family welfare to extend benefits of the scheme as under current rules claims of most employees were rejected. Officials said requests for the compensation for 177 employees were sent to the Centre but 114 were rejected and only 17 received compensation. Civic chief I S Chahal has written to ministry of health & family welfare joint secretary Manohar Agnani. BMC said the scheme was beneficial for employees who are in direct contact and take care of Covid-19 patients. “Apart from healthcare staff working in hospitals, there are employees at containment zones, like sweepers, drainage cleaners, pest control workers, firemen and those distributing PPE kits and conducting surveys to facilitate citizens. All are working for the care of Covid patients, and are in direct contact with them. But they are not eligible under PMGKY. The eligibility criteria has to be liberalised,” said a sen ior civic official. Officials said even security guards of hospitals were not eligible. “These employees are providing services, which are not in hospitals, but for taking care of Covid patients, and are in direct contact with patients. We requested the Centre to extend benefits of the scheme to such employees, or in the second wave, they will be left with no cover, and BMC will have to pay,” the official said. Kin of 67 staff have been given a compensation of Rs 50 lakh by BMC and kin of 62 have been given jobs in BMC. The Centre’s Rs 50 lakh insurance scheme expires on April 24. After demands from several quarters, the ministry said the government was in talks with an insurance firm to come up with a new scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-17-out-of-200-bmc-covid-victims-kin-get-centres-aid/articleshow/82188596.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

RWAs are now circulating messages, requesting people to look for beds in hospitals if a patient’s condition doesn’t improve in a day and return the cylinders on time so that others can use them too. Kapil Kakkar, president of Jangpura Extension RWA, said that there are two oxygen generators and one cylinder for helping people and there is unending demand for it.  “People come to us for help even at midnight. Since it’s a tough time for everyone, we are requesting residents to share these facilities slot wise . Usually, people won’t need the oxygen cylinders for more than 2-3 hours at a time,” he said. “If the situation worsens, then it better to arrange for shifting of person to a hospital.” Pankaj Agarwal of Safdarjung Enclave RWA said that all their oxygen cylinders and concentrators have been taken for days. “Unlike last year, when none of our 7 oxygen cylinders and 5 oxygen concentrators were used, this time demand is at an all-time high,” said Agarwal. “We are ready to provide all assistance and have even tried buying more concentrators, but these are not available in the market right now. Also, it is really difficult to ask people who have taken the cylinders to return it because they need it desperately too.” The RWA for E-block Greater Kailash I has three oxygen concentrators in the colony. “These are being given to people whose oxygen saturation levels go below 89,” said Rajeev Kakria. “We are trying to help out everyone equally, but the situation is still unmanageable sometime,” he said. Kakria said that the RWA had asked district administration for help in acquiring oxygen cylinders. “We need oxygen more than quarantine centres. This will automatically help in reducing the footfall at hospitals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mounting-demand-for-oxygen-makes-rwas-plan-cylinder-slots/articleshow/82187303.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Goa||Coaching is not just about trophies, love and respect from players is very important: Sergio Lobera||Sergio Lobera has now won everything in India and that too by playing some of the most attractive football the country has seen. The Spaniard won the Super Cup and League Winners Shield during his three-year stint with FC Goa. In his first year at Mumbai City FC, he picked up the league title and Indian Super League (ISL) trophy, a rare double. He looks back at his time in India in this exclusive interview with TOI. Excerpts… Before you came to India, not too many teams played possession-based football. How difficult was it to implement your philosophy, first in Goa and then with Mumbai? It’s not easy because it’s a new style of play, with new players, new contexts. But the most important thing is that the players believed in this style. They believed this is the best option, not just to play beautifully but also win trophies. We are speaking of professional football. We need to win (trophies) and play well (too). When we achieved the targets and results were there for all to see, everyone spoke well (about the style). But during the first few games, when you make some mistakes, people have doubts. In the end, when you win trophies and have good results, everyone wants to play this kind of football. You made Goa play beautifully in three seasons. How difficult was it to do the same at Mumbai in the first year itself, when the club recruited 17 new players? It was difficult. We had a very short time to work with the players. We didn’t have (a proper) pre-season. It was possible to train with the full team just three days before the first game (in ISL). Between games, there was not too much time to work with the players about the tactical situations. I am very proud because we achieved our targets. We won two trophies and my players played good football. This season was a big challenge with a new team, new club, new players. Did you at any point feel a more pragmatic approach helps, rather than just style? We need to compete well. Competing is to have the capacity to adapt to different circumstances, different situations during the game. When you are playing a lot of games in a short time and you have problems with injuries, suspensions, you need to adapt. It’s impossible to dominate the game for 90 minutes, impossible to dominate all the games in a league. Mumbai started the league very well but there was a slump in between when you won only one of six games and lost two on the trot. Was there pressure? You have to be ready for these moments. You cannot always dominate games, and you cannot be dominant all through. Good teams show their best during the bad moments. We were a very good team, and we were a family. When you are a family, during the difficult moments, you can come back stronger. We need to analyse when you win and lose. You cannot think like a journalist or a fan -- when you win, it’s amazing; when you lose, everything is terrible. That’s not correct. Maybe when you are on an unbeaten run of 12 matches, winning 10 and drawing the other two, there is still a need to improve. When you lose a game, maybe you played better than the last game, which you won. The most important thing is balance. It is not all black and white. For me as a coach, there is grey. At every club, we have seen that domestic players improved considerably under you… Improving players is a part of my job. It’s very important for me as a coach. I have to gain their confidence and make them play better. It’s an amazing feeling when players from the national team, who played with you in the past, message you and say they are thankful for the help as they realise their dream. Coaching is not just about trophies. Getting love and respect from the players is very important. This is a good reward. Did you expect success so soon at Mumbai? With the City Football Group, I have the tools here to try and win trophies. It’s not easy in the first season to win all the trophies, but the big effort everyone put into this project made it possible. It’s very difficult in football to win trophies, especially in the first season with new players and a new project. I am very happy because there are a lot of people working behind the scenes too. How difficult would it be for Mumbai in the AFC Champions League? It’s one challenge more. It’s a big challenge and I think you need to have different planning. But now, most important is to enjoy the present. About the future, we will have time to think. Do you think an Indian club can do well in AFC Champions League? If you have a very good plan for the long term, not just short term, if you sign good players it’s possible for Indian clubs to compete in Asia. Have you forgotten the bad chapter at FC Goa towards the end when the club sacked you? I think that is the past. The present and future are more important. I enjoy working with City Football Group a lot. The last season was amazing. (Read Sergio Lobera’s detailed interview online on TOI Plus.

According to sources, patients’ kin are approaching the chemists shops, hospitals and their attached pharmacies and openly offering to pay any amount they can manage to buy Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Alzumab. While some unscrupulous ones are capitalizing on the opportunity to make fast money, the more conscientious ones are counselling the kin to have patience and faith. “I have paid Rs 25,000 to purchase one vial of Remdesivir for treatment my kin,” said a security guard who somehow managed the amount. TOI also come across a person who admitted to buying a replacement of Tocilizumab for Rs85,000 to save his mother. “The standard price of Remdesivir in the black-market is between Rs15,000 to Rs30,000 depending upon the buyer’s capacity. Black marketing is rampant in other districts too, especially Amravati where the infection has spread fast and the toll is high too,” said an insider. According to a senior pharmacist from Gandhibagh, the hospitals must stop issuing prescriptions to the patients’ kin for Remdesivir or Tocilizumab “as it’s paving way for black marketing”. “When doctors and hospitals know that collector has issued order stopping retail sale of Remdesivir, then why are they issuing prescriptions?” said the pharmacist. City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who has cracked down on Remdesivir black marketeers, warned the patients’ kin against approaching such people. “Buying or attempting to buy Remdesivir or other drugs from black marketeers is as criminally liable as its sale. There could be a fraud too and one’s hard-earned money can go down the drain,” he said. Bullion trader Rajesh Rokde, who is an office-bearer of city’s sarafa association, said has received at least 25 calls in the last few days from people wanting to sell off or mortgage their gold. They all said it was either to foot the hospital bill or to buy Remdesivir. As our shops are closed, we had to divert them to different financial institutions and banks,” said Rokde. According to a real estate broker from north Nagpur, he has been receiving calls from people requesting help to sell off their farms, lands and other properties. “Distress sale calls have certainly increased but there are not much buyers too due to the economic slowdown,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kin-mortgaging-valuables-to-buy-meds-from-black-market/articleshow/82187378.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||India||Is Indian Covid variant behind second wave that started from Vidarbha?||NAGPUR: International scientists are now trying to decode the Covid variant — B.1.617 — that appears more infectious in India. There is a theory that this variant emerged in Amravati and caused the huge surge in cases in nearby districts in February, though more research is needed to confirm this. International researchers believe this variant is typically of Indian origin. As a result, researchers and media houses from across the globe are now focusing on Vidarbha; some even visited Nagpur while tracing the new “Indian variant”. “It’s different than the UK, or Africa or Brazil variant, which have been discussed at the start of this wave,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, who has been receiving inquiries from many international researchers and journalists about the second wave in India. Coronavirus: Live updates“Many countries, including the UK, have imposed travel bans to India. This is because a specific variant of the virus – B.1.617 – is becoming increasingly common,” said Dr Shinde. He believes the Amravati surge was also due to this variant, though it needs to be confirmed with more research. Read AlsoTriple mutation Covid variant in India? Here's what we know so farNEW DELHI: Even as India continues to witness an unprecedented surge in Covid cases, a new triple mutant strain has emerged as a fresh threat in the battle against the pandemic, reported IANS. Here's what we know so far ... * Late last year, scientists had detected aAccording to data shared by th eGlobal Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GSAID), B.1.617 was first found in samples collected in December 2020 in the country. They have data of genome sequencing of Indian samples up to April 3 this year. Until then, this variant was visible in 29% of the samples in India.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); GSAID is recognised for its importance to global health by G20 health ministers. In 2020, WHO called this data-science initiative “a game changer” with regard to the pandemic. Dr Atul Gawande, from Umarkhed in Yavatmal district of Vidarbha and currently a member of US President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 control advisory team, has also expressed concern about this variant while calling it “extremely frightening”. “I am seeing this variant go through entire households of my family in India. Whether it is more lethal, and whether vaccines work well against it, remain unclear,” he said.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); As noted by Dr Gawande, it has been observed, especially in Vidarbha, that this variant is infecting entire families, unlike its predecessors in the September 2020 wave. This means the virus is significantly more infectious, he says. But whether it is lethal or not is still to be studied. At present, the variant is “under investigation”. It is still not designated a “variant of concern” but scientists have recognised it as a “variant of interest”. According to an initial study by virology researcher Grace Roberts from Queen’s University, Belfast, this variant is estimated to be around 20% more transmissible than the earlier form of the coronavirus that circulated during the first wave. However, officials in the ministry of health said the rise in cases is not linked to the variant as B.1.617 hasn’t been detected in high enough quantities to determine whether it is directly responsible. Experts, though, think that this may be due to lack of data, and many have stressed the importance of increasing virus sequencing to get a better picture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/is-indian-covid-variant-behind-second-wave-that-started-from-vidarbha/articleshow/82189536.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The health department claims to have written to the state government for more vaccines. District immunization officer (DIO) Dr Puneet Juneja said they had vaccine doses for Thursday only as no new stock arrived. The DIO said that Wednesday’s sessions were being wound up so that the exact doses needed could be known in the evening. Health officials said though exact doses left would be known by late Wednesday evening, the number of vaccines required for Thursday’s sessions were around 5,000 to 6,000. They said most likely the district would have more stock of Covaxin for Thursday’s sessions as compared with Covishield. Health officials said in urban areas, Covishield was being mostly used at four centres, including civil hospital, civil surgeon’s office, Vardhman mother and child hospital and urban community health centre at Jawaddi. At other centres, Covaxin was being given. They added that if the health department didn’t get stock by Thursday, it would be difficult to carry out vaccinations on Friday. Sources in the state health department said the stock was expected to arrive in Chandigarh on Thursday and then sent to various districts. Health department officials said Ludhiana would get the highest number of doses due to high consumption in the district.Meanwhile, health experts said inoculation must go on at a brisk pace. “As the number of cases are surging, vaccination is very important, apart from following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Government should send more vaccines so that maximum number of eligible persons can be protected,” said former president of Ludhiana Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr Sunil Katyal. He suggested that the authorities should run vaccination campaigns on the pattern of polio, where drops were administered at doorsteps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/second-wave-surges-dist-running-out-of-vax-stock/articleshow/82185535.cms||Shariq Majeed

All of them have been put in home isolation for the next few days. It may be recalled that six people of a family, including two children, were hacked to death by a man at Juttada last Thursday. Both the accused and the victims hail from the same area. Visakha west ACP Sripada Rao and some cops from Pendurthi police station were in the area earlier this week when they were surrounded by hundreds of locals who demanded that the cops hand over the accused to them. The police managed to pacify the angry crowd, but some of them developed Covid symptoms after returning from the village. “Around six to seven cops, including ACP Rao, have tested positive,” a senior police official said.Meanwhile, a special drive would be conducted on Thursday for people waiting to take the second dose of Covid vaccine. District collector V Vinaychand said 39,111 people are waiting to take the second dose in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cops-probing-juttada-murders-test-positive/articleshow/82185590.cms||---

Businessmen said all gas re-fillers and distributors were claiming non-availability of gas and they were not giving any confirmed delivery dates. The cost of refilling a 7-cubic-metres gas cylinder, which until recently was Rs 170, has shot up by three times to Rs 500. Industrialists are of the view that if the current situation prevails for the next two to three weeks, there will be a crisis in the engineering sector, as the furnace industry will not be able to produce raw material used by the micro, small and medium enterprises. Production of all the industries dependent on it will come to a halt. They are urging the government to take steps to ensure uninterrupted supply of gas in hospitals as well as industry. Dev Gupta, vice-president of the All India Induction Furnace Association, said, “Furnace and steel industry are heavily dependent on oxygen gas as multiple processes, like cutting and welding, cannot be completed without it. It is like a raw material for us and we need it on a daily basis. We are well aware of the ongoing crisis in which oxygen is needed in hospitals and our entire industry is also of the view that medical supply should be given first priority. However, adequate gas is being manufactured in the region for both medical and non-medical usage, but some elements are taking advantage of the rise in demand and creating an artificial scarcity for the industry to make huge profits.”KK Garg, president of Induction Furnace Association of North India, said, “We are thankful to the administration for allowing the use of oxygen gas for our industry, but there is an acute shortage in the market and our requests to dealers of neighbouring cities, too, are not yielding any result. In case the situation does not improve in the coming week, not only our industry, but all the other MSMEs, including those of bicycle, auto parts, hand tools, will also be hit. The government should take notice of this problem and ensure adequate supply in hospitals as well as factories.”According to Sandeep Jain, a furnace industrialist, “There has been a big rise in the gas rate for industries in the past three days. Earlier, the price was Rs 170 for 7 cubic metre gas, and it increased to Rs 255, then Rs 300 and now it is being quoted at Rs 500. What is even more shocking is no delivery date is being given by the suppliers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/furnaces-gasping-oxygen-not-available-rates-hiked/articleshow/82185528.cms||Mohit Behl

Advocates’ associations have already sent representations to Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami to limit hearing of cases to matters of urgency only. Recently, two employees of the high court had succumbed to Covid-19. Though the high court did not resume physical hearing of cases since the lockdown was imposed last year, it has scaled up operations through virtual proceedings. Post unlock guidelines, the high court started taking up regular matters for hearing apart from the matters that need urgent hearing. While the proceedings are being held in video conference mode, the high court employees had to attend to work for administrative work to enable the court to function. Advocates’ associations requested the chief justice to limit hearing of cases to urgent matter only as it was done during the lockdown period. They have also requested for extended summer vacation from May 1 to June 1, keeping in view of growing number of Covid-19 cases. Though regular matters are listed for hearing on Thursday, the Chief Justice is likely to take a decision over limiting the operation of the high court by taking stock of ground level situation and after discussing with other judges of the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/lawyers-associations-urge-high-court-to-limit-hearing-of-cases/articleshow/82185623.cms||---

The reduction in calls is, however, not owing to decreasing cases but lack of connectivity with its helpline as calls to the emergency services have increased by almost three times in the past 10 days.Sources in the emergency services said that the helpline is overloaded with hundreds of calls from cities like Rajkot, Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, while many callers from other cities are not able to contact immediately. “We had a problem a couple of days back when our calls had increased to 25,000 due to which some calls may have been missed. But now we have increased our facilities and will not miss any calls,” said a GVK-EMRI official. He further said that there is also a possibility that owing to lack of communication a few patients may have had to be brought to hospitals in private vehicles or ambulances. Earlier this week deputy chief minister Nitin Patel too had said that 108 services’ burden has doubled and despite increasing the number of lines these stay permanently busy. This month, the emergency services had shifted the highest number (367) of Covid-19 patients on April 10. Since then, the number of Covid-19 patients being transferred to hospital by the emergency services has consistently decreased. On April 19, 204 patients were transferred to hospital in 108 ambulances. In all 5,122 Covid-19 patients were taken to hospital by 108 GVK-EMRI services between April 1 and April 19. On the other hand, the number of patients being hospitalized has not reduced. “Daily, around 100 to 120 Covid-19 patients are being hospitalized here and there is no decline,” said a doctor from SMIMER Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/patients-kin-prefer-not-to-wait-for-108-ambulances/articleshow/82185051.cms||---

The reason behind this is that the area is situated on a height.Badri Prasad Sharma, a resident, said, “When Bisalpur pipeline was laid down, water was supplied in sufficient quantity, but as the population of the area grew, water pressure started to decline and now-a-days it is almost negligible. We have to arrange water from tankers or boring in parks.”The situation in the area is serious and there are complaints of people using illegal motor pumps to divert water pressure to one house that further slows down the pressure. People have to ring up the local councilllor for getting government water tankers.Another resident Arun Sharma said, tankers are not a permanent solution and the government should start the process of getting water lines fixed. He said that the problem increases during summers.“There were two tube-wells in the area, one of which dried up. The pressure of water is really low. We are receiving water only for 15 to 20 minutes and have complained to the authorities many a times, but no one listens to us. I hope some solution is found sooner,” Sharma said.Councillor of ward 54, Anshu Sharma said that the problem is not only because of low pressure, but also due to hostels in the area. “Many people have opened hostels and have dug up water lines for connection across the area. This has further lowered the water pressure. The department should curb such illegal connections and find some solution to the problem,” said Anshu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sultan-nagar-residents-demand-water-supply/articleshow/82186438.cms||---

The industry is once again staring at possible job losses of up to 80% in both Telugu states this year. It may be recalled that the tourism industry in Andhra Pradesh lost over Rs 3,500 crore in revenue as a result of the pandemic last year. Close to 60% in the travel industry lost their jobs and many travel agents have already shut down businesses. The industry had started losing money as early as January 2020 as a result of cancellations which came around the same time when the virus was starting to spread in countries such as Thailand and Japan among others. Globally, it was the travel industry which had ground to a halt much earlier than other industries, according to AP Air Travellers Association representative, O Naresh Kumar. According to travel agents, the industry is likely to suffer a severe jolt as net revenue loss is expected to be around 90% and with no revenues most businesses have run out of working capital. Most are now unable to pay staff salaries, advance tax, provident funds, ESIs, and GST besides EMIs. Currently, around 6,000 employees are working under 1,000 travel agents, including individual agents in Andhra Pradesh while Telangana has over 1,500 travel agents, employing around seven to eight thousand employees. Some travel agents are fearful that by the end of May, over 80% employees may lose their jobs. Airlines too have been a bad condition, especially in the December to March period compared to the same in the previous year. Air Asia has already cancelled its Vizag-Bengaluru serivce till April 30 while other airlines are also said to be mulling following suit. Usually, around 60% business takes place between April and June every year due to summer holidays when most plan their travel. “People would travel in these months to the north-eastern states, Kashmir, and hill stations across the country along with pilgrim destinations. Delhi (till May 26), and Rajasthan (till May 3) have already officially closed all tourist destinations,” Tours & Travel Agents Association of AP president, K Vijaya Mohan said. Vijaya Mohan said that travel agents, including those selling holiday packages for inbound, outbound, domestic tours and adventure tour operators generally get their revenue between April and June — around 45% to 60% — and also in the months of October and December — around 25% in a year. However, the travel industry got only 5% of expected revenue in January and 1% in February in the previous year. Till November, revenues earned by the travel industry had almost sunk to naught and rose to around 2% of expected revenue in November and December. This January and February gave some hope to the industry but the recent surge in infections has once again made industry wary. The industry had been recovering, seeing around 25% of normal business in the first two three months but the second wave of Covid-19 has dampened the hopes of the travel industry, said Vijay Mohan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/travel-industry-likely-to-face-more-losses-amid-2nd-wave/articleshow/82185574.cms||Siva G

The state earlier installed 29.3 Lakh LED street lights. The LED street lighting program is estimated to save 133 MU electricity per annum in urban areas and around 260 MU in the rural areas. This would reduce the Co2 emissions to the tune of about 0.33 million tons. Executive vice-chairman, EESL, Saurabh Kumar has requested AP energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli to participate in a national webinar on de-carbonization and energy transition, which would be conducted on the occasion of 51st Earth Day on Thursday. Saurabh Kumar, in a communique on the national webinar, said EESL has identified several major states like AP, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar, Rajasthan, Kerala, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, etc. for their best performance on the energy efficiency front. “Now, EESL has decided to implement another energy efficiency program to benefit the rural households in Andhra Pradesh,” he said. Till date, EESL has installed over 1.14 crore LED street lights in the urban local bodies and gram panchayats across India. This has resulted in an estimated energy savings of 7.72 billion kWh per year and avoided peak demand of 1,286 MW. This has also led to greenhouse gas emission reduction of 5.32 million tonnes per year, and estimated annual monetary savings of Rs 5,395 crore in electricity bills of municipalities. Under the street lighting national programme, 1576 urban local bodies have been enrolled. Out of these ULBs, work has been completed in 1,060 ULBs in the country. The executive vice-chairman has requested the executives of the state governments and in particular pro-active states like Andhra Pradesh to play a pivotal role in de-carbonization to mitigate the ill effects of climate change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/eesl-to-implement-energy-efficiency-drive-for-rural-ap/articleshow/82185764.cms||---

Minister Sriranganatha Raju has donated Rs 1 crore for the construction of the canteen in the GGH and promised to take care of the entire cost of providing food to the poor. He decided to set up a special canteen after seeing the plight of family members and attendants of the patients admitted to GGH in getting food. Although the government is providing free food to in-patients and one attendant, many people coming from distant places cannot afford to buy food. The minister appointed district Red Cross vice-chairman and industrialist Penmatsa Ramachandra Raju as coordinator to oversee the construction of the canteen works. “We will provide sumptuous food to all the poor.

He asked district collector KVN Chakradhar Babu to depute additional teams to all Covid-19 hospitals both in government and private to monitor relief measures. Expressing anguish about the situation in the district, former minister and TDP politburo member Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy on Wednesday wrote to chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to intervene and set things right to tackle the Covid-19 situation. Somireddy said that 1,347 people tested positive out of 3,325 tests conducted on Tuesday which amounts to 40 percent positivity rate. Chandramohan requested the CM to depute a delegation headed by the health minister to review the situation in Nellore district as hundreds of people were rushing to Chennai for better treatment in the absence of proper facilities. Within an hour, deputy chief minister Alla Nani swung into action and took stock of the situation in the district by conducting a review with the district collector and DMHO. Speaking to media, Nani said that 12 government hospitals and eight private hospitals were extending services to Covid-19 patients. He said that 3,097 cases were active in the district from which 561 people were admitted to GGH, Nellore, for treatment. He said that infrastructure was fully ready to tackle the situation and there was nothing to worry about the facilities. “We have directed the district collector to appoint special nodal officers to each and every hospital to take care of the treatment needs of the patients,” said Nani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/nellore-steps-up-containment-efforts/articleshow/82185650.cms||Samdani MN

It seems that the state government is more forthcoming when it comes to admitting the number of persons who die due to Covid-19. For quite some time now, the government medical bulletin has been declaring higher number of victims as compared to the authorities in Vadodara. It has come to light that for over a week now, the number of Covid-19 victims for the Vadodara city and district are two to four times higher in the state medical bulletin as compared to the VMC bulletin. When it comes to total number of Covid-19 deaths too, the government dashboard pegs the figure at 351 while the progressive total of the bulletin prepared VMC stands at 291. In the past, it had also come to light that there was a difference in the number of positive corona cases. There is a mismatch in the number that was reported by ToI earlier. The overall difference in the positive cases since the pandemic began is, however, not known as neither the state bulletin nor the dashboard give the data. Sources said that the difference had been discussed earlier too, but the mismatch in numbers could not be resolved. Official said difference could be due to a possible difference in the reporting system of VMC and the state government. “We have observed this for about a week and are looking into it.

On a tip-off, they arrested the two from their respective homes. They reportedly swindled over Rs 20 lakh so far. The accused — Md Haji Ahmed, 38, and Md Layeeq, 42, sanitary field assistants of GHMC — were arrested by police on Wednesday. Police seized five duplicate thumb impressions, two fingerprint scanners and two cell phones from the accused. According to police, the accused have been working as sanitary field assistants since 12 years, supervising the duties of sweepers by taking attendance through GPS-enabled fingerprint scanners. “The accused created five duplicate thumb impressions of their family members using wax, Fevicol and enrolled them as sweepers in their teams.

---||Jaipur||Energy firm cuts trees in Jaisalmer, collector seeks report||Jaisalmer: A private renewable energy company, that is setting up a solar power plant at Dawara village in Fatehgarh sub-division in Jaisalmer district, has allegedly cut over a hundred rare trees using JCB machines and burnt 51 trees overnight, which has led to resentment among the villagers. The district collector has sought a report in this regard from the SDO. The local patwari has confirmed the cutting of trees and has submitted his report to senior officers.According to the information, a company has taken land in Fatehgarh sub-division for setting up a solar plant. The company representatives allegedly cut the trees, including very old ones, at Davada village despite the local villagers objecting to it. The villagers later complained about it and Moolana patwari reached the spot and prepared a report after inspecting the area. As per the report by the patwari, 52 trees were cut and 51 trees were burnt. The trees were 60 Kumut, 10 state tree Khejari, 3 Rohida, 25 Kair, 10 Jal and 3 Bordi, while the ones burnt were 7 Kumut, 41 Ker and 3 Bordi trees. Degrai pasture land representative and environmentalist Sumer Singh Bhati said that many companies are setting up solar energy projects in the district. These companies are recklessly cutting the years-old trees in and near the pasture land without any fear. The companies are chopping off even the rare trees including the state tree Khejari. The forest department and other authorities are not taking any action. The villagers are thus enraged over this, he said. He said that with the cutting trees in such numbers will endanger the desert wildlife, especially the ones that have their habitat linked to these trees. Many species of snakes, lizards, the Great Indian Bustard and many rare birds, will be badly affected. He said many species of trees like Rohina, Bordi, Aak, Kheep, Sania, Boor, Nagphani, etc. and Sewan, Dhaman grass are found in and near the pasture lands. These pasture lands are habitat for many birds and animals and if these pastures are destroyed, then where will these birds and animals go? Another environmentalist Parth Jagani expressing anger said that trees are being recklessly cut and pits are being dug with JCB machines. If pasture lands are not saved then what will happen to sheep and camel herders and what will they feed to their livestock, he asked. Environment expert and Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University assistant professor Dr Sumit Dukia said that pasture lands should not be disturbed and in the name of development of green energy, there should be no compromise with pasture lands. These lands are very helpful in saving the environment and maintaining balance. District collector Ashish Modi said that he has received information about it and has asked SDO Fatehgarh to submit a report in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/energy-firm-cuts-trees-in-jaisalmer-collector-seeks-report/articleshow/82186454.cms||---

The fleeing of the prisoners, who were lodged in the jail under different cases, in a four-wheeler parked at a little distance from the prison indicates that the escape was planned.The escaped inmates include — Suresh Kumar, Salim Khan and Mandeep Singh from Hanumangarh, Ratna Singh from Bikaner and Anil Pandit from Haryana. The incident came to light at 4.30am during the routine round of the prison cells. By 5am, the jail authorities alerted all police stations in Bikaner. Till the last report came in, none of the inmates was nabbed by police.Local police recreated the escape scene stating that they first broke the window in a cell, came out on the porch from where they climbed the wall using blankets given to the inmates in the cell. “Prima facie, it appears to be a planned escape since breaking of window cannot be done in a day and they might be doing it for days, else it would have created loud noise,” said a junior police officer requesting anonymity.It has raised questions on the jail authorities for not keeping an eye on the windows in the cell which had loosened over the years. “The prison doesn’t have CCTV in the area used by prisoners to escape. The outer wall of the prison is barely 7-feet high with the one-foot-high iron pointed wall giving no difficulty in climbing the wall,” police said.Officials said that jail staff comprises of 14 people, including 13 guards. Police have kept the jail authorities under scanner and are investigating their role in the prisoners’ escape which looks like a cakewalk. Officials are suspecting that prisoners might have successfully sneaked outside Bikaner district since police came into action only after three hours. Police are scanning CCTVs footage of the entire area, including toll plazas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/5-inmates-escape-from-nokha-prison/articleshow/82186446.cms||---
---||Mumbai||200 more ICU beds; no jabs, beds back at Mulund facility in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Even as various state government agencies are gearing to set up jumbo Covid centres, the BMC will be adding 200 ICU beds in the next two to three days to tackle the acute shortage. It has also been decided to shut the Mulund jumbo centre for vaccination so that it can accommodate beds for patients. The BMC is planning to add around 50 more ICU beds at Seven Hills Hospital, Cooper Hospital, Jogeshwari’s Trauma Care Hospital and Mulund octroi naka by end of this week. “We are going to add around 200 ICU beds at various existing locations and at the Mulund octroi naka. These beds will be equipped with paramonitors, ventilators and other medical equipment,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health). A senior official said this would help tackle the case load till the new jumbo centres are ready. The state government recently gave approval to construct four jumbo Covid centres in the city which will add over 6,000 more beds, including 800 ICU beds. The Mulund jumbo centre set up at the Richardson and Crudas facility has a capacity of 1,680 beds. Vaccination was being carried out in a space occupied by 250 beds. The plan is to move the vaccination out of the jumbo centre and bring back the beds. Officials said this will not impact vaccination in the area as they plan to split the load between two centres. “We have already started a centre at PK Road municipal school last week and identified another municipal school,” Kishore Gandhi, assistant municipal commissioner of T ward said. Currently, apart from the jumbo centre, vaccination in Mulund was being carried out at MT Agrawal Hospital, Swatantryaveer VD Sawarkar Hospital and at Mithaghar school, said MP Manoj Kotak. However Kotak has suggested that the BMC set up two centres per corporator ward now that vaccination is being opened up to everyone above the age of 18 years. Dr Pradeep Angre, dean of Mulund Covid Centre, said the decision to close the vaccination centre was taken to augment the facility, besides the forthcoming monsoons and need for urgent repairs. “The patient load at Mulund Covid centre has been very high. Some of the hangars need repair and refurbishment as they are not permanent structures,” said Angre, adding the vaccination centre had a footfall between 1,200-1,800 daily.—Chaitanya Marpakwar, Richa Pinto & Sumitra Deb Roy||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/200-more-icu-beds-no-jabs-beds-back-at-mulund-facility-in-mumbai/articleshow/82188655.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Apart from demolishing the heritage building, influential developers have also encroached upon the government land. If demolition of heritage structures continues at this pace, the Shekhawati havelis will soon be history.”In April 2015, the divisional commissioner of Jaipur had directed the collectors of Sikar and Jhunjhunu districts to prohibit the sale of havelis in the Shekhawati region and prevent construction or repair that may damage the heritage look of the structures. But the ‘6 Haveli’ was brought down and promoters are willing to raze five more havelis in the area.In absence of rules to conserve and preserve private heritage buildings, the municipal council officials expressed helplessness on the issue. A source said, “The orders also remain on papers as many havelis of heritage value are being pulled down. The department sought a report on the issue after public protest, but has not framed a concrete policy.”The municipal council officials also claimed that there is no regulation on sale and purchase of private havelis. Anita Khichar, commissioner, municipal council, said, “As the haveli had a private ownership, the council could not intervene.”Sources said the proposal to constitute a heritage development council (HDC) also remains a distant dream. The state local self-government department was to constitute the HDC to preserve and restore ancient havelis in the Shekhawati region. The council was to identify and prepare a databank of heritage assets in the region, and make recommendations to the state government on declaring heritage assets as protected and regulated under relevant rules. The council would also be authorised to acquire rights in heritage assets by way of purchase, lease, gift or bequest for the purpose of conservation. But the council has not been constituted so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/heritage-havelis-being-pulled-down-to-make-way-for-modern-structures-in-shekhawati/articleshow/82186449.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Bombay High Court restores 110MT/day O2 supply from Bhilai to state||NAGPUR: Peeved over shortage of oxygen supply to the hospitals in the city treating Covid-19 patients, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday condemned the Union ministry for health and family welfare and quashed its decision to reduce the oxygen supply from Bhilai Steel Plant. In yet another historic hearing of the suo motu PIL based on TOI reports, that stretched till 10pm only for the second time in HC’s history, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak directed the plant authorities to restore 110MT/day supply to Maharashtra that was reduced by the ministry to 60MT/day through April 18 order. “The decision to cut supply had hit the state like a bolt from the blue. In such emergency situation in Maharashtra that accounts for over 40% of Covid cases, the ministry should have increased the oxygen quota to 200-300MT/day. Unfortunately, reverse has happened and it has adversely hit the patients in Maharashtra in general and Vidarbha in particular,” the bench said, adding that the plant would continue to supply 110MT per day of oxygen till further orders. Earlier, amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar assisted by Sejal Lakhani along with interveners M Anil Kumar and Tushar Mandlekar assisted by Rohan Malviya pointed out that the respondent authorities have failed to comply with HC’s orders to supply 10,000 Remdesvir vials to Nagpur district and also to ensure oxygen supply to the Covid hospitals. The judges then directed assistant solicitor general Ulhas Aurangabadkar and government pleader Ketki Joshi to seek instruction in this regard from the Centre and state. They also slammed the state for not complying with their orders of supplying 10,000 Remdesivir vials to Nagpur by Tuesday evening. “Today’s directives would start providing some relief to distressed patients from Thursday, but certainly it would take time. Therefore, something for the present is required to be done if we have to perform our duty to protect citizens’ lives as per Article 21,” they said. “We would emphasise that Nagpur Covid-19 Committee must make efforts to procure Remdesivir vials today itself in sufficient quantity and also augment supply of oxygen to Covid hospitals. For this purpose, the committee will have to have a meeting with the managers of depots of the seven manufacturing companies, their clearing and forwarding agents and all stockists and distributors,” the judges said. Expedite jumbo hosp work in Wardha, says HCThe HC bench directed divisional commissioner to expedite process of setting up a jumbo Covid hospital at Uttam Galva steel plant near Wardha. Earlier, the commissioner informed that the architect and designer would decide on how much beds could be accommodated at the facility they had inspected. He said modalities are being worked out and efforts are being made to set up 1,000 beds there. The commissioner assured that the administration would try to start the facility within 20 days. However, the bench told him to expedite work and start it within 15 days. Give 100 Remdesivir vials to GMCH by midnightExpressing concern over short supply of Remdesvir to GMCH, the HC ordered FDA joint commissioner to supply 100 vials by midnight and submit a report. The directives came after GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta informed the bench that they hadn’t received even a single dose on Wednesday for its 900 Covid patients. “We have received specific information from different quarters, but we don’t want to reveal our source. Many stockists had hoarded the Remdesivir stocks in their depots in violation of law. We direct the FDA joint commissioner to take action against them. We also direct the GMCH dean to send SMS to the registrar judicial after getting 100 vials,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-restores-110mt/day-o2-supply-from-bhilai-to-state/articleshow/82187413.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Present vaccination stock to last till Friday: Pune health department officials||PUNE: The 1.10 lakh Covishield doses allotted to the district on Tuesday evening will be enough to carry out vaccination till Friday, health department officials said. Another consignment of the stock is likely to be received by Friday, the officials added. After Wednesday’s vaccination, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) was left with around 16,000 Covishield doses, and around 17,300 doses of Covaxin, which is to be used strictly for second dose of vaccination for benefeciaries. Pune rural was left with around 25,000 Covishield doses, the district health officials said. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) was left with around 15,830 Covishield doses and 11,750 Covaxin doses. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that the current stock should last at the most till Friday. “If we get consignment of fresh stock by Friday, it will help to continue the vaccination hassle-free on Saturday, or else there will be some issues,” he said. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, as many as 58,904 beneficiaries were vaccinated, including general citizens (above the age of 45 years), healthcare workers, and frontline workers in Pune district. The Pune rural recorded the highest turnout of the day with 30,300 beneficiaries getting vaccinated, followed by vaccination in PMC limits (20,431 shots) and in PCMC limits (8,173 shots). Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), Pune Zilla Parishad, said that the vaccination was underway with full enthusiasm in rural areas, resulting in higher turnout of beneficiaries. Giving an example of the benefits of the vaccination, Prasad said that residents of an old age home in the Velhe taluka, where 47 senior citizens reside, were given Covishield jabs around a month back. “When a few days back many of them contracted the infection, most of them recovered without any serious health issues,” he said. Vishal Shinde, block development officer, Velhe taluka, confirmed the same, saying that some people had to be shifted to Wipro centre in Hinjewadi for treatment, but they were on their way to recovery. The situation had turned grim last Friday when PMC was left with just half a day's Covishield stock, with minimal doses left at the municipal corporation's Narayan Peth vaccine store. The total vaccine balance in Pune district was 1.24 lakh doses (Covishield and Covaxin) by April 15 night, while the district needed over 4 lakh doses over the next five days, health department’s official data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/present-vaccination-stock-to-last-till-friday-health-dept-officials/articleshow/82187388.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Even in the case of the non-bailable charge, we brought to the court’s notice that there was no evidence against our client. The court upheld our view.” Kakade, a real estate developer-turned-politician, was elected to the Rajya Sabha as an independent candidate and he later joined the BJP. Marne has seven criminal cases which are at different stages of trial. It is the police’s case that the rally was part of a ploy to terrorise witnesses and victims in the pending cases and send a signal to rival gangs about Marne’s clout and influence. The rally created a furore in Pune. For a week after the rally, video clips with messages glorifying Marne circulated on social media platforms, prompting the police to register an FIR. Earlier on Wednesday, the city crime branch had summoned him for questioning in connection with the rally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-ex-mp-kakade-arrested-for-aiding-rally-of-gangster/articleshow/82188740.cms||---

---||Delhi||In bid to check exodus, hundreds of migrants provided food at shelters||New Delhi: Hundreds of migrant workers were offered food at over 200 shelter homes of Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) on Wednesday in a bid to check their exodus. The government has started providing food to all those in need so that migrant workers and daily wagers do not feel left out and rush to their native villages in desperation. Many of them have lost their livelihood options during the weeklong lockdown. The crowd of migrant workers, however, was very thin at all the shelter homes. “Unlike the 2020 lockdown, not a huge rush of migrant labourers is being reported at the shelter homes this time because buses and trains are running,” said an official. Bipin Rai of DUSIB said that the shelter homes were providing two meals a day and soon they would also provide breakfast. “Those who want to stay in the shelter homes can stay,” said Rai. DUSIB shelters currently have 10,000 people, a majority of them homeless persons, who have been shifted to the shelter homes from streets due to the rapid rise in coronavirus transmission. To stop the migrant workers, who are storming railway stations and bus terminals to leave for their hometowns, the government has come out with a plan to provide them all required relief. In keeping with demands, more stalls for food would be opened for them. The government’s announcement to provide Rs 5,000 one-time financial compensation to the registered construction workers is also likely to work in checking the exodus of migrant workers many of whom are engaged in construction activities. Delhi currently has 1.7 lakh registered construction workers. A proposal for providing the financial assistance will be prepared and sent to the cabinet for approval. After the cabinet’s approval, the money will be disbursed to the account of the construction workers. Registration and renewal of construction workers have been kept open and the newly registered workers will also be provided the financial assistance. An official said all major construction sites would be attached with dispensaries to provide regular medical facility to the workers. Many daily wagers engaged in non-construction activities near major construction sites can also avail the facilities. A 24x7 functional helpline number is being set up to address the grievances of migrant workers. Delhi government has also formed a seven-member committee consisting of senior government officers to ensure welfare of daily wagers, migrants workers, labourers and construction workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-bid-to-check-exodus-hundreds-of-migrants-provided-food-at-shelters/articleshow/82187419.cms||AlokKNMishra

Eleven of the deceased were on ventilator support and the remaining 11 on oxygen support. All 22 were aged between 33 and 75. The hospital is a dedicated Covid treatment facility and had 157 patients admitted, 131 of them on oxygen support. The condition of 63 patients was critical when the leak occurred. Fifteen of these patients were on ventilator support. As white fumes engulfed the area, the hospital staff and relatives rushed in oxygen cylinders to save a majority of the other patients. The hospital’s medical officer, Manoj Kankariya, said five patients were shifted to other city hospitals after the supply was disrupted. “We did our best to save the lives of as many patients as possible,” he added. Till late on Wednesday night, no FIR had been registered in connection with the incident. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced a high-level probe and said anyone found responsible for negligence would not be spared. The government announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh to the kin of each deceased. NMC fire brigade chief Sanjay Bairagi said four tenders were rushed to the hospital within five minutes of receiving a call from the hospital. “There were white thick fumes in the area where the oxygen tank is located. Our firemen faced problems venturing to the tank since visibility was virtually zero. They managed to plug the leak within 15-20 minutes,” he said. Bairagi said a liquid oxygen tanker was stationed near the oxygen tank to refill it. “The leak was at the outlet of the tank which is connected to the hospital oxygen pipe,” he added. The hospital is among the two big civic-run hospitals in Nashik city and has been treating severe and critical patients due to its steady supply of oxygen. The hospital operationalised the oxygen tank with a capacity of 13,000 litres of liquid oxygen on March 31 this year. The NMC finalized a Pune-based private company, an Indian subsidiary of a Japanese firm, through a tender process for providing large tanks on rental basis along with assured supply of oxygen for a period of 10 years. Despite repeated efforts, the private company could not be reached for its comment till the time of going to print.According to the civic authorities, the leak was noticed around 12.30pm. “The fire brigade was called and repairs to the tank were immediately undertaken. Oxygen supply from the tank resumed sometime around 1.30pm to 1.40pm. The civic body arranged oxygen cylinders for patients in the meantime,” a civic official said. State health minister Rajesh Tope, who visited the hospital in the evening, said Nashik divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game will head a team to probe the incident. “The team will ascertain whether it was a human or technical fault. The team, which will submit a report within a week, will also come out with standard operating procedure to prevent such incidents in future. There has to be some mechanism which can remotely monitor the pressure gauges of the tank,” he said. Nashik district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal said, “It seems that the death of these patients was due to the disruption in oxygen supply following the leak in the oxygen tank. A three-member team will investigate the incident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/22-covid-patients-die-after-oxygen-tank-leak-disrupts-supply-at-nashik-hospital/articleshow/82185622.cms||Tushar Pawar

He joined another chamber after a dispute with the owners of the brick kiln over wages. Manonmani alleged that her husband went to the kiln to settle the wage issue around 3 am on April 17. But, later she heard that that her husband committed suicide at the kiln. She alleged that the brick kiln owners and a few others had hatched a conspiracy and lured him to the brick kiln and beat him to death before hanging him. Following the request of family members to inquire the mystery behind the death, Mayiladuthurai collector R Lalitha passed orders and a committee of three doctors performed postmortem on Tuesday in the presence of the revenue divisional officer (RDO), Sirkazhi. But, the family continued its protest and denied to take the body as they pressed for booking the accused for murder. Executive director of Evidence, an NGO, A Kathir, also intervened in the issue and demanded to charge it as a murder case. “It is a mystery as to why police are refusing to alter the case,” said Kathir on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/unexplained-death-of-dalit-man-sparks-series-of-protests/articleshow/82186471.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||‘No work, no money’: Migrant workers continue homeward march from Delhi-NCR||NEW DELHI: For the third consecutive day, migrant workers thronged the bus terminals and railway stations in an effort to find transport back to their home villages. Despite assurances and appeals by Delhi government, the labourers said their employers had told them that factories would be shut down.  “I worked at an iron factory, but there is no work anymore. No work means no money, so we are heading home,” shrugged a worker even as Anand Vihar bus terminal officials held a meeting with authorities of the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand bus systems to prevent the sort of chaos seen after the lockdown last year. On Wednesday, when TOI visited the bus terminal and railway station at Anand Vihar, there were arrangements to ensure orderly movement of travellers, overseen by Delhi Police and Civil Defence Volunteers. Around 150 metres ahead of a police barricade, 23-year-old Asad Alam, who hails from Auraiya in Bihar, said, “I was employed as a labourer with a construction firm in Noida. The owner said there was no work as all economic activities had been put on hold.” Alam had taken an autorickshaw from Noida and alighted nearby before walking towards the station. He wondered how they would earn money in such circumstances. “In an identical situation last year, many promises were made, but nothing happened,” he alleged. “I will go back to my village and do a bit of farming on my land so that we have something to eat and earn something too.” Like Alam, Sunil Kumar and his two friends were also very keen to find a bus to take them home to Sitapur in Lucknow. “I worked at an iron factory in Brijwasan, but the management told us that the unit was being closed due to the lockdown,” said Kumar. “Last year, I remember walking for kilometres to get a ride back home. This time I don’t want to waste time, but return at this point only.” To facilitate the movement of people like them and to ensure their journeys are smooth, a task force was constituted by Delhi government on Wednesday. As per the order, K Brownson Dahiya, special commissioner of transport, is the nodal officer tasked with making all necessary arrangements while maintaining close contacts with the transport authorities of the neighbouring states, particularly of UP and Uttarakhand. The order said, “The task force will render necessary assistance to any person wishing to undertake interstate travel and for that purpose adequate number of help desks will also be set up at ISBT. Enforcement teams will be in place wherever required.” The lockdown last year and the subsequent closure of factories, construction work and informal sector units had forced many migrants rendered jobless to swarm the city’s bus terminals and railway stations. There naturally was a huge danger of the coronavirus spreading in the confusion, not to diminish the human tragedy of thousands of people, hungry and desperate, cramming into whatever transport was available — or even walking thousands of kilometres to reach home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-work-no-money-many-continue-homeward-march/articleshow/82187450.cms||---

Rise in number of Covid-19 cases across the city restricted temples from holding large gatherings and rallies. Every year, a huge Ram Navami Shobha Yatra is taken out from Dhoolpet, where thousands of people participate. However, this year, the city wore a deserted look as organisers decided to give up on the procession. “The number of Covid-19 cases are only on the rise. Keeping in view safety of all the devotees, we had decided to call off the procession even this year,” said T Raja Singh, Goshamahal MLA who convenes the yatra ever year. Several temples such as Sri Sitarama temple on Road No. 18, Jubilee Hills, Ram temple in Nampally, Sri Sita Ramanjaneya Swamy temple on Road No. 10, Banjara Hills, Golconda Ram temple among others performed pujas and Kalyanam (celestial wedding of Ram and Sita) within the temple premises. Devotees were allowed in limited numbers at several temples. “At different temples, Kalyanam was held following, which prasadam was distributed among devotees. All the devotees were being allowed in batches of 20-25 to follow all Covid-19 protocols,” said Bhagwant Rao, convenor of Bhagyalakshmi Temple Protection Committee. Iskon temple in Attapur provided free food to the poor from donations made by devotees on the occassion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ram-navami-celebrations-remain-low-key-for-2nd-year/articleshow/82187441.cms||---

The students have stated that many of them rely on public transport to reach the college, and fear they could infect their families too. In their letter submitted on Wednesday, they stated that they were given barely 24 hours notice of the exams, which started on Wednesday. “...With the steep rise in cases and currently high positivity rate, we feel like it would be immensely reckless and a blatant disregard of our health and that of our family members if offline exams were to be held. With the current situation going from bad to worse, it is rather concerning that the college has decided to hold offline exams, and that we were given barely 24 hours notice of the same,” the students wrote. “It is fairly easy to say examinations will be held with proper SOPs in place, but many of us travel by public transport, having to take up to three buses one-way, and are concerned about the rising cases and the lack of precautionary methods taken on public transport,” they added. They also stated that their issues, when expressed to their faculty, were met with insensitivity and unprofessionalism. They stated that they’re not trying to avoid exams, but want them moved online or postponed due to the current situation They also submitted statistics of the daily Covid infections and mortalities over the past few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/students-of-art-college-urge-varsity-to-postpone-exams/articleshow/82187432.cms||---

In several areas across the city, it has been observed that the garbage from households of Covid-19 infected patients is either not being collected or is being disposed off without any segregation. “Several people in our colony have tested positive in the last few weeks. Despite that, the garbage is not being collected on a regular basis. This is increasing the risk of infection to the other family members who are staying in the same house or the apartment complex,” said Shanti Kumar, secretary, Navodhaya Resident Welfare Association, Habsiguda. “Even on days when they come to collect the garbage, it is not segregated. This poses risk of infection to waste-pickers as well as other citizens,” said Kumar. A patient who stays alone in Charminar area and is under home isolation had a similar experience. “The door-to-door garbage collectors stopped visiting our house after they were informed that I tested positive. When I complained, they came and asked to empty the trash directly in the auto tipper,” said Rameez (name changed), a patient from Charminar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lack-of-knowledge-on-covid-waste-disposal-causes-concern/articleshow/82187431.cms||Moulika.KV

The district presently has 5,112 patients undergoing treatment in various facilities. The Covid-19 toll, meanwhile, went up by one to 709. The victim was a 55-year-old diabetic man, who died of bilateral bronchopneumonia four days after testing positive for the virus.The infection rate at Thudiyalur and Sulur seems to have increased exponentially. As per the block-wise breakup, the two places account for 17% of the total cases the district had recorded over the past seven days.Dr G Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of public health, said, “Both the blocks have dense residential areas as they share a border with the city corporation. There are also lots of industries and hence many people travel in and out for work.”Pointing to the massive CRPF camp at Thudiyalur, another health department official said many people at the camp have been testing positive for the virus.In a bid to control the spike in fresh cases, officials have begun insisting on testing at least 500 people for the virus from each of the two blocks. “Increasing the testing capacity through fever camps will help us identify asymptomatic patients, who could be isolated before they transmit the virus to others. This will help us reduce fresh cases,” an official said.Meanwhile, the district received 46,000 doses of Covishield on Thursday. With this the district presently has 67,320 vaccine doses now. While the officials said the hospitals already had a combined stock of 13,670 doses of Covishield and 7,380 doses on the day, hardly 3,051 people were inoculated on Wednesday.

---||Goa||Goa: Khaunte, Jayesh file police plaint against PWD, MVR for damaging water pipelines||PANAJI: With parts of Porvorim facing a severe water shortage problem for over five days, a complaint was filed against PWD officers and national highway contractor M Venkata Rao (MVR) Infra Project Pvt Ltd for damaging water pipelines. Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte and Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar along with zilla panchayat member Kavita Gupesh Naik filed the complaint with Goa Police and have sought action against MVR “for breaking water pipelines”. “Investigate the matter and initiate strict and immediate action against such illegalities and register a FIR against the erring officers and Venkata Rao Infra Projects Pvt Ltd (MVR) for damaging public property and causing loss and damages and violating right to life and liberty of the citizen of our constituencies, in accordance with law,” Khaunte said. Local residents had marched to the PWD office a few days earlier and had demanded that water supply be restored immediately. MVR Infra Projects, which is widening the national highways, damaged water pipelines and power lines a few days earlier, leaving parts of North Goa without water and power supply. Salgaonkar has blamed the “lethargic and malafide” PWD officers and contractors for carrying out “substandard and unprofessional work” while shifting the water pipelines. PWD had announced a two-day planned shutdown for water supply from April 15 onwards so that existing water pipelines could be shifted. Locals of Porvorim and Saligao constituency say that till date there is no water supply in many areas. Locals have also said that water tankers are not deployed in time time, despite specific requests, and no alternative arrangements are made for providing required water for domestic consumption. At the same time, locals have claimed that the water tankers and water supply is being supplied to hotels and certain residential properties. MVR Infra Projects has damaged water pipelines at Bambolim, Merces, Panaji and other places in previous years. In the first week of April, the firm also damaged the Karaswada main electrical supply line which connects to the Saligao sub-station. “No action has been taken on such issues till date, which clearly displays the connivance between the departmental officials and the contractors. Sadly, it is the local residents of the area who are at the receiving end of this issue,” Salgaonkar said. “Strict action ought to be initiated against the said contractor and the officers involved in grant of such contract, supervision, monitoring and inspection of the work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/khaunte-jayesh-file-police-plaint-against-pwd-mvr-for-damaging-water-pipelines/articleshow/82187445.cms||---

They will, however, continue their strike by keeping their vehicles off road indefinitely. “We were given permission for the past ten to 12 days to protest at Azad Maidan, but with the rising number of cases, we are concerned for our lives and that of our families. Though some operators turned up at Azad Maidan on Wednesday, we decided it’s best to send everyone home. The vehicles will, however, continue to be off road until GoaMiles is scrapped,” one of the taxi union leaders, Laximan ‘Bappa’ Korgaonkar said. A delegation of the taxi operators met with minister for transport, Mauvin Godinho at the secretariat in Porvorim on Tuesday to have a dialogue on the taxi issue. The minister asked for a month’s time to come up with a solution and requested the protesting tourist taxi operators to call off their strike. “The minister can take as long as he likes to decide, but even the taxis will be off the roads until then. The government will be answerable for the same,” Korgaongar said. He also said that the rising number of cases is also acting as a deterrent for them. “We cannot afford to come in contact with people for we have to go back to our families at the end of the day. We cannot risk infecting them. Our taxi brethren will not take law in their hands by protesting, instead, we want everyone to stay safe and protest peacefully by staying at home,” another operator said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabbies-suspend-panaji-protest-in-view-of-covid/articleshow/82187465.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||TNSTC sees major drop in passengers||Coimbatore: A day after the state government introduced night curfew to contain spread of Covid-19, the number of people using public transportation has come down.Footfall in state-run buses in the district has dropped to 60% since Tuesday from 80% in the previous weeks. It is expected to come down further.The government implemented night curfew between 10pm and 4am on Tuesday and announced total lockdown on Sundays with only essential service allowed in the state. Subsequently, Tamil Nadu state transport corporation (TNSTC) reduced the number of trips and retained most of the buses to ensure uninterrupted service.“Compared to the 675 town buses that were operated before the night curfew, we now operate 642. Trips were reduced slightly so that they would reach the depot before 10pm instead of 11.30pm,” a TNSTC official said. “We are operating all the 337 mofussil buses. To ensure that mofussil buses reach the depot before the curfew, we have reduced the number of trips by half. For instance, buses to districts like Tirunelveli, Rameswaram, Pudukottai and Tiruvannamalai that are more than 250km from Coimbatore, conduct one trip instead of two. Buses to Madurai and Trichy that are operated thrice a day are now operated twice a day.”Town buses usually travel about 2.25 lakh kilometres and mofussil buses about 1.81 lakh kilometres, the official said. “To make sure buses are not on the road during the curfew period, the distance travelled by town buses is reduced by 15,000km and mofussil buses by 62,000km.” The revenue has also come down, the official said. “Before the lockdown, TNSTC used to earn Rs 27 to Rs 28 per kilometre. In the last few months, it remained at Rs 22. Since Tuesday morning, it started to drop and as on Wednesday morning, it is just Rs 18. During the non-peak hours, it goes down to Rs 10 to Rs 12. The footfall has dropped to 60% and we are expecting it to drop further as the Covid-19 cases are rising.”M Velankanni Raj, general secretary of Coimbatore unit of CITU, agreed. “Some of the buses are operated with three to four passengers. The situation is worse in rural areas. On Tuesday and Wednesday, bus stands and buses were deserted around 7pm itself. Passengers want to avoid crowds.

Panic has set in since most of the villagers frequently travel to Goa and Maharashtra and return home without any stringent health checks at the border. On Tuesday, some villagers visited a government health centre in the village complaining of mild fever and body ache. Following this, health officers conducted the contact-tracing exercise and tested most villagers only to find 144 of them positive. Sources said 144 villagers from Aabanali, which has a population of 300, took rapid antigen tests on Tuesday and their results came positive. Most of them worked as daily-wage labourers in Maharashtra and returned home after the neighbouring state imposed tough restrictions to stem the rising tide of fresh infections there. District health officer Shashikanth Muniyal said confirmatory RT-PCR tests will be conducted and said they have sealed the village as of now. He said the villagers may have picked up the infection in Maharashtra. Marithi, a villager, told TOI that it all started on April 10 when three people got themselves tested in the village.

Villagers, instead of isolating themselves at home, allegedly roamed about the village before a large number started complaining of Covid-like symptoms. Mass testing was conducted after as many as 23 people visited the village health centre saying they were running a temperature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/virus-surge-in-belagavi-alarms-goa/articleshow/82187453.cms||Shreyas HS

---||Delhi||Delhi govt must increase ICU & oxygen beds: BJP||New Delhi: Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Wednesday said Delhi government should have put in place a concrete plan in advance for dealing with the current Covid crisis. “Delhi government has increased the number of Covid beds in hospitals, but the adequate effort has not been made to augment ICU beds or beds with oxygen supply,” the BJP legislator said, referring to the difficulty critical Covid patients are facing in getting admitted to hospitals. Out of around 80,000 active patients, around 40,000 are getting treated at home, said Bidhuri. “Government must focus on increasing ICU bed capacity in different hospitals.” The government also needs to formulate a policy on how to vaccinate people of 18 years and above from May 1. “Uttar Pradesh and Assam governments have already declared that they will provide free vaccination to all citizens and these states are already negotiating with the pharma companies for the supply of vaccines,” Bidhuri said, adding that Delhi government has not yet shared its plan of action. The system of information on vacant beds needs to be upgraded too, he said. “Delhi Corona app shows vacant beds; but when patients reach these hospitals, they are informed that no bed is available.” The government should take action against the hospitals giving wrong information, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-must-increase-icu-oxygen-beds-bjp/articleshow/82187474.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On coming to know about the incident, local DMK functionaries and leaders of allies gathered there and complained to the police and district collector. Later, the police detained three individuals who said that they were taking footages of the college for an advertisement.EVMs pertaining to Nagapattinam, Kilvelur and Vedaranyam assembly segments have been kept at the counting centre at the EGS Pillay (autonomous) engineering college with full security since April 6 when the polling took place. Representatives of opposition parties said they informed the security personnel at the centre about a drone flying around. As they attempted to bring it down, the drone fell within the premises of the college. Soon, DMK functionary Gauthaman and other district level leaders of opposition parties came together and raised slogans alleging there smelt something fishy. They also petitioned district collector Praveen P Nair. A police team headed by deputy superintendent of police Saravanan and later and revenue officials arrived and inspected the drone. They found that three people from Chennai had operated the drone to take footages of the college premises from above. They were identified as Kumar, Sureshkumar and Balaji, revenue officials told reporters. Officials seized the drone and further investigations were on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/camera-fitted-drone-flying-over-counting-centre-creates-flutter/articleshow/82186494.cms||---

In fact, the number of samples pending for the Covid-19 test is the highest in Dehradun. The hill state, on Wednesday, had 36,992 samples pending to be tested. Out of which, the maximum of 9,684 samples was from Dehradun. The officials of government labs in Dehradun say that they are testing at half their capacities as they can't go for pool testing of samples when the test positivity rate is already 24%. "We have a testing capacity of 2,300 samples per day if we do pool testing of samples. However, the current positivity rate is too high and we are testing individual samples. So, our testing capacity is 1,200 samples per day," said a senior virologist from Government Doon Medical College and Hospital. At AIIMS Rishikesh, the authorities claim to be testing around 2,000 samples per day in two of its labs using the pool testing method. However, if one batch of Covid-19 samples comes out positive, the lab technicians are forced to check each sample of the batch. “We are getting the testing kits from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and are trying to conduct tests to the best of our capacity but the backlog is increasing every day,” said Harish Thapliyal, PRO, AIIMS. On the other hand, a leading private lab in Dehradun said that they are finding it difficult to conduct Covid-19 tests for Rs 500, the price cap fixed by the government for non-government testing facilities. Dr Alok Ahuja, who runs the private lab, said, “We don't go to homes to collect samples anymore as half of our staff is busy with Covid-19 testing in the Kumbh Mela area. Also, it is not financially viable to go to homes to collect samples as the government has capped the price of RT-PCR testing at Rs 500 for private facilities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/even-as-uttarakhand-records-its-highest-single-day-covid-case-tally-doon-residents-face-a-tough-time-in-getting-themselves-tested/articleshow/82185648.cms||Ishita Mishra

A tigress was found dead at Seemarkuli Odai near Aachakarai on November 20. Though foresters did not suspect any foul play initially, tissue samples sent to three different labs for examination showed poisoning as cause of death. A special intelligence team conducted a meeting with cattle owners and herders in the area and found that four people were involved in the poisoning. A Ahamed Kabir, 26, and P Karian, 25, both from villages hamlet near Masinagudi, were nabbed and remanded in judicial custody. A search is on for the other two. “Three of the accused reared cattle and the fourth grazed the cattle in the forest.

They were soon joined by a few walkers in plain clothes, cyclists, environmentalists, DMK members from Singanallur, members of Tamil Mandram, Congress candidate from Coimbatore South Mayura Jayakumar and MNM candidate from Singanallur Dr V Mahendran.There has been a growing clamour against the model road work, which the local residents said involved cutting and uprooting of trees and erecting many steel and concrete structures. The main bone of contention was that the plan was executed without consulting the residents, who said they were not informed about the project.The city corporation had, however, clarified on Tuesday that the plans were shared with the Race Course walkers’ and residents’ associations and refuted the allegations that trees were chopped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/race-course-residents-slam-road-project/articleshow/82186501.cms||---

In 2019, he had written twice to the church management seeking details about the PF fund. As he had not received any response, he had visited the PF office only to know that the church management had started depositing employees’ PF amount to the government only from August 2019,” a police officer said.Meanwhile, the church management has provided a new UAN number of its employees around the same time and the pastor was shocked to find only Rs 45,000 in his PF account, the official said. When he confronted the management, he had not received any satisfactory response and it, in turn, had strengthened his suspicion. Subsequently, he filed a complaint with the city crime branch on Tuesday alleging that the church management has misappropriated the employees’ PF amount without depositing it to the government, he added.Based on his complaint, police booked an FIR under sections 420, 120 B and 408 of the Indian Penal code and further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/4-including-csi-bishop-booked-for-misappropriating-pf-funds/articleshow/82186502.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot demands free vaccination for all||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday demanded free vaccination for all. He said while the state government gives free vaccine to people above 45 years, charging the young population will be discriminatory. In a series of tweets, the chief minister said after continuous demands by the Congress and the states, the central government has decided to vaccinate people above the age of 18 years, which we welcome. The central government should also announce the roll out of free vaccine to youth above 18 years of age. If there is no free vaccine, there will be resentment among the youth towards the central government. He added, “In the states, the same machinery (medical staff) will be providing vaccination facilty to all age groups. It will not be appropriate to charge the youth and the rest be given free vaccine.” He said the central government should adopt the same policy for vaccination for all age groups (above 60 years, above 45 years and now above 18 years). He added the deadly Covid virus was now spreading rapidly and the death rate was also very high. In such a situation, the central government should not burden the youth with costly vaccination, but provide it free of cost at the earliest. He added in this crisis, putting additional burden on the states, the common people will face problems and development work will come to a standstill in the states. Allowing the private sector to vaccinate is a welcome step. This will enable those who can afford to purchase the vaccine and reduce the burden on the government. The Centre had announed vaccination to people above 18 years from May 1, but said they had to pay for the vaccine. CM appeal to PMChief minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cancel his election campaigns in Bengal and focus on Covid management. “I again appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that things are getting worse. In view of the horrors of Covid, concentrate on correcting the medical arrangements, leaving rallies in Bengal,” he said in a series of tweets. “India is one of the largest producers of medical and industrial oxygen, medicines and vaccines . Deaths due to lack of oxygen and medicines are unfortunate. There have never been deaths due to this in other countries of the world,” he said. The sooner we fix our arrangements, more the lives can be saved. The central government should make available life saving medicines and oxygen to patients and complete the vaccination quickly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-demands-free-vaccination-for-all/articleshow/82186507.cms||---
---||Kochi||Covid-19: Rise in infection among healthcare workers in Ernakulam||KOCHI: As Covid cases in Ernakulam is spiralling out of control with each passing day, infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) is also increasing. As many as 248 HCWs, including Asha workers, nurses and doctors, tested positive for coronavirus in the first 20 days of April. Of them, 21 turned positive on April 19 alone. However, sources associated with hospitals said they have not started feeling the pressure of HCWs testing positive. “Currently, we face no threat. As most of the HCWs have already been vaccinated, only lesser number of them are tested Covid positive during the second wave. Besides hospitals and doctors are quite confident to deal with Covid cases, as against first wave last year. Unlike last year, there is no panic situation as caseload is less since category A patients are not coming to hospitals now,” said Kerala private hospitals association secretary Dr Benevan Joseph. Still infection among HCWs raises concern in the health sector. The department officials call each HCW who tested positive and enquire about their vaccination status. “On April 18, as many as 18 HCWs tested positive. 248 in 20 days is a big number. As per our initial analysis, many of them had not received second dose. Our concern is that more HCWs will test positive if cases rise again. We are also looking into whether they contract the infection from Covid blocks or outside. We feel those who work in Covid blocks take more care than the ones outside,” said a health department official. More than 600 people, who got vaccinated, tested positive for coronavirus so far in the district. Officials feel that people who got vaccinated lower their guard. Though the authorities earlier felt that district would record 20,000 to 30,000 new cases in next two weeks, they expect it would touch 40,000 going by the current pace. Though the vaccine efficiency is only 70%, it helps prevent mortality among infected individuals, says health workers urging more people to get vaccinated. Driving test postponedFitness testing of vehicles and driving tests, scheduled to be held on Thursday, Friday and Saturday under Ernakulam RTO limit has been postponed in view of rising Covid cases. New dates will be announced later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rise-in-infection-among-hcws-in-ekm/articleshow/82185663.cms||T C Sreemol

The order with regard to uploading basic information and negative RTPCR reports on the government portal has been issued by the state’s information technology department. The order stated that it would be mandatory for those coming to the state to upload all information sought on the web portal http://emitra.rajasthan.gov.in before starting the journey. According to state’s IT commissioner Virendra Singh, the emitra, a self-registration portal, is meant for those who wish to upload their details on their own. “Apart from this, those who do not upload their details on the portal, the data of these people are being collected at the district check-posts set up by the district administrations. So, both the options are available,” said Singh. “For those who do not upload their details on the portal, a separate provision has been made for them by district administration. The administration collects details of these people by filling up separate forms and sends the data to the IT department for collation,” he added. Travellers coming from outside must compulsorily upload the RT-PCR negative test report conducted 72 hours before starting the journey. This would help local administration and officials to access information regarding people coming to their districts and take appropriate action and help if required, the order stated.

---||Patna||Two priests beheaded in Madhubani||PATNA: Two priests of a temple were killed at Khirhar village under the same police station area in Madhubani district late Tuesday night. Police said the incident took place around midnight when the victims, identified as Heera Das (70) and Anand Mishra (50), were fast asleep on the Dharohar Nath Mahadev temple premises. Though Heera of Siriyapur village and Anand of Bhagwanpur were not regular priests of the temple, they used to stay there to take part in the rituals. Chief priest Narayan Das, an eyewitness to the incident, told police that one Dilip Choudhary of Harlakhi village attacked the two priests with a spade and slit their throats. He dumped the beheaded bodies under haystack. Das informed the Khirhar police station about the incident after Choudhary left the scene of crime. Police later recovered the bloodstained spade from Choudhary’s house. “While the bodies were recovered and sent for postmortem, the severed heads were found close to the boundary wall of the temple,” police said. SHO Anjesh Kumar said the accused was absconding after the incident. Das said Choudhary used to attend the morning and evening prayers at the temple. However, the number of devotees had reduced drastically due to restrictions on religious places these days. Das also said he did not muster courage to intervene for fear of his life. “I watched the entire incident from a room in which I was sleeping,” he told the investigating officer. Some locals said Choudhary is mentally unstable. Circle inspector Rajesh Kumar said raids were on to arrest the culprit. Unconfirmed reports said police nabbed the accused in Basopatti village.

---||Jaipur||Limited oxygen supply leaves patients gasping in Udaipur||UDAIPUR: Infections are increasing in Udaipur district with every passing day, but patients are facing problems in getting treatment due to shortage of oxygen and remdesivir injection.On Tuesday, the number of positive cases was 932, while on Wednesday it increased with as many as 1,101 testing positive. According to official data, presently 611 patients require oxygen while 92 are on ventilators. Though Covid helpline desks have been set up to make sure patients do not have to suffer, however, many are being turned back at private hospitals for a shortage of oxygen supply. On Wednesday, a patient complaining of severe breathing problem in Sajjangarh area was taken to a private medical college on Nathdwara road, however, the management refused to admit him as they did not have ample oxygen supply. The relatives tried calling another private medical college, but in vain. Finally the patient received treatment at Government MB hospital, though, there too oxygen is being given to patients in a limited manner, the companions said. Ventilator beds are a major problem with the increasing number of patients as there is already a shortage of ventilator beds in hospitals across the city. Meanwhile, looking at the alarming situation, a meeting of stakeholders, including representatives from private and government hospitals and medical colleges, was held at the zila parishad conference hall on Wednesday. Udaipur collector Chetan Ram Deora said, presently around 3,200 to 3,500 oxygen cylinders are being consumed daily in the district. Udaipur is receiving oxygen supply from Hindustan Zinc, two local gas plants which are taking supply from Bhiwadi and Jamnagar. Also, oxygen supply has been sought from Rajsamand, Chittorgarh and Pali districts. Considering the situation, the need for a strategy for effective management of beds and optimal usage of oxygen are being strongly felt. It is necessary so that maximum patients can get access to the life-saving gas. A committee headed by UIT secretary Arun Kumar Hasija has been constituted to monitor bed management in hospitals. Those patients whose condition is found to be stable would be shifted from the ICUs and ventilators so that other serious patients could be treated. Deora said the district has got some supply of remidesivir which has been allotted to the hospitals and more stock is expected to arrive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/limited-oxygen-supply-leaves-patients-gasping-in-udaipur/articleshow/82186541.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Over 700 Hyderabad cops affected in Covid second wave||HYDERABAD: Covid-19 second wave has also hit police personnel badly. Over 700 policemen in the three city commissionerates have contracted the virus and are in home isolation. Currently, 480 police personnel in Hyderabad have tested positive for Covid-19 and in the two other city commissionerates, over 260 cops are under isolation after testing positive for the coronavirus. However, senior officials said that most cops who had tested positive were in home quarantine as they have mild symptoms and the vaccination percentage has reached 78-92% in the three commissionerates, providing additional protection to the frontline warriors. Speaking at a commemoration meeting organised in the city in December 2020 in honour of 34 police personnel who had lost their lives while performing duties during lockdown and its aftermath, Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar had lauded the personnel as national heroes. Subsequently, six more cops, including two cops this week, lost their lives in the commissionerate to Covid-19. The vaccination percentage was lowest in Hyderabad among the three city commissionerates at around 60% till 10 days ago as many had not taken the jab due to certain medical conditions and hesitancy. Recently, director-general of police (DGP) M Mahendar Reddy asked all unit officers to ensure vaccination level reaches 95% in the department. On Wednesday, of the 12,000 staff of police department in Hyderabad, so far 79% have taken the vaccine and commissioner Anjani Kumar said that in the coming few days the numbers would improve. “The vaccination is going on as per schedule. Only police personnel with certain medical conditions have not taken the vaccine on medical advice. Lactating mothers, ASIs in their late 50s with co-morbidities, those who are taking blood thinners have not taken the vaccine,” Anjani Kumar said. In Cyberabad and Rachakonda, over 260 cops were under isolation after they had contracted Covid-19. “Majority of our Covid-19 affected staff have mild symptoms. They are returning to work after the negative test,” commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-700-city-cops-affected-in-covid-second-wave/articleshow/82187550.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Kolkata||No-refusal policy back for Cov patients||Malda: The state on Wednesday reintroduced its no-refusal policy for Covid patients, with chief minister Mamata Banerjee announcing that hospitals have to see that no patients go back without treatment. “If any hospital has no bed, it is the responsibility of the hospital to arrange for a bed in a nearby facility,” the CM said at a press conference in Malda. She described the pandemic as a big tempest that will be over after a point. On the ground, however, the situation remains grim. With healthcare facilities running out of beds, they are unable to take in positive patients who go to hospitals directly. Most hospitals are being flooded with calls. They are contacting the patients once a bed is free. “We are increasing beds. But these are taken up within hours,” said a private hospital CEO. The CM, however, made it clear that all Covid-positive patients need not be hospitalized. Most are asymptomatic of ‘A’ category. They must stay in home isolation. The mild-symptomatic patients in category ‘B’ can go to ‘safe homes’ and only serious patients in category ‘C’ should be taken to hospitals. Even as the state has centralized the admission procedure of Covid patients through the health department helpline number, many patients complained of delay in response. “I told the state helpline number that my oxygen saturation was falling below 94%. But they told me they would get back to me within 24 hours,” said a resident of Phoolbagan. According to the chief minister, 51,593 people are currently in home isolation and 6,793 are in hospitals — 3,888 in government and 2,905 in private hospitals. Eighty hospitals have 7,328 oxygen beds. The state right now has 70 Covid hospitals. The state now has 200 safe homes with11,000 beds, which will be augmented to 13,000 in the next two days. “There is a shortage of oxygen. I will personally keep a watch on this. The health department and police must ensure that oxygen cylinders don’t get diverted,” she said. Banerjee warned against hoarding of oxygen cylinders. If a hoarder is found, he will face exemplary punishment. “Don’t get panicky. Extend hand to a person or a neighbour in need. If people don’t stand by people in crisis, what is the point of this life? There is no point in imposing lockdown to increase the distress of common people. But of course, people need to be cautious and careful. They must wear masks, maintain safe distance and sanitize hands,” the CM added. Banerjee added that many Covid patients either in home isolation, safe homes or in hospitals want to cast their votes. “The EC must organise postal ballot for them,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-refusal-policy-back-for-cov-patients/articleshow/82185748.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Jaipur||Families should take care of kids as they are getting infected||JAIPUR: The second wave seems to have been more damaging as children are getting infected with Covid much more than the first wave.According to the health department, 3 per cent of all the infected people are in the under-10 category. While children are being infected, the role of parents have become much more challenging. Doctors have advised that infected children should be kept in a well-ventilated room, they need to be well hydrated and a dedicated caregiver, mother or father, should take care of the kid, while taking care of his/her own precautions. “Few children are coming with gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrohea and pain in stomach are testing positive. They get the treatment under home isolation, but need specialised care from any caregiver - mother or father,” said Dr Ashok Gupta, senior professor (paediatrics), JK Lon Hospital, Jaipur. Most of the times, a child contracts the virus from his family members, who bring infection from outside. Gupta said that virus shedding is more from adults in comparison to children. “If an adult in a family is infected, he should ensure that the children in the family should not get infection by taking precautions. In case a child gets the infection, his un-infected caregivers should use all protective measures such as masks, hand gloves, washing the hands regularly as a child cannot be left alone,” said Dr Gupta. Paediatricians are witnessing more children coming for Covid treatment in the second wave compared to the first wave. “In the last 15 days, we have seen that children aged one month, two months and grown up children in more numbers being affected by Covid than in the first wave because of the casual approach of the elders or adult family members, who are not following Covid guidelines. But, the good thing is that most of the children do not get severely ill. It is time for us to take care of chidren properly,” said Dr Munish Kumar Kakkar, head of the department, paediatrics. Doctors say it is the responsibility of elders to ensure that children follow precautionary measures. “Encourage your child to wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Proper technique of wearing mask is important along with social distancing. Regular physical activity and a positive environment are key to success,” said Dr Dhanraj Bagri, assistant professor, JK Lon Hospital, Jaipur. Virus affecting whole familyJAIPUR: Doctors have seen a trend that in second wave, all family members are getting infected from the virus, even children. A family of four from Mansarovar, including a 6-year-old child, got admitted to a private hospital for Covid treatment. Manish Jain (name changed) said, “Before I came to know that I was positive, it was already too late. My son also developed coughing. He also tested positive. Now, we all have admitted here for treatment.”Take careChildren with heart, chronic lung disease, metabolic disease, genetic and neurological disorders should take extra careChildren going out of houses should use masksCaregivers of infected child should wear good quality masks properly covering nose and mouthClean house using bleach or 1% hypochlorite||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/families-should-take-care-of-kids-as-they-are-getting-infected/articleshow/82186555.cms||---

For the first time in Chandrapur, rescue teams used a catch pole which helped to safely lift the cub out of the well. The matter came to light after a farmer heard hooting of monkeys close to the farm well. He went to check the place and found the cub perched on an outcrop deep into the well. The farmer immediately called the forest officers. “The cub might have fallen into the well while its mother was moving around the place during the early hours. The well though has a parapet wall, it is at the surface level on two sides from where the cub might have fallen,” said RFO, Chichpalli, Vaibhav Rajurkar. By the time foresters reached the spot, a large crowd had gathered at the spot. Rajurkar said that first a net was lowered into the well to ensure cub remains safe even if it falls down during the operation. “Later, shooter Ajay Marathe used the catch pole to noose the cub and it was immediately lifted up,” he said. CCF NR Pravin said that a catch pole has a very soft rope having a noose at one end and mechanism to tighten it at other end. “Marathe lowered the pole and put the noose around cub’s neck,” said Pravin and claimed that the cub being young and light was easy to rescue with the help of a catch pole. Veterinary doctor (wildlife), Dr Ravikant Khobragade and transit treatment centre (TTC) in-charge Dr Kundan Podchelwar were present to take care of any emergency. Forest officials had to summon cops from Chiroli police station to deal with the mob. The rescued cub was immediately shifted to TTC at Chandrapur, where in-charge veterinary doctor Dr Kunadan Podchelwar found it fit for release back in the jungle. Pravin claimed that the mother tigress belongs to adjacent FDCM range. The cub was reunited with its mother in an operation carried out under Podchelwar. The rescued cub was taken to a spot near the well in a cage and released when the tigress came there with two more cubs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/6-month-old-tiger-cub-rescued-from-well-reunited-with-mom/articleshow/82186576.cms||Mazhar Ali

The arrested persons were identified as Sivakumar, 51, of Tamil Nadu and Ashok Kumar, 51, of Kachani. According to police, they posed as central government employees and swindled money out of youths promising them job in public relations and vigilance departments. They ran a centre called SS verification service in a hotel room at Enchakkal. They took money from job aspirants and even conducted fake interviews. Sivakumar introduced himself as verification officer of the central government and took an initial sum of Rs 5,530 as registration fee. Later he collected photos, documents and conducted interviews. He would issue them a receipt and demanded another Rs 50,000 at the time of appointment. Around 23 youths were cheated using this modus operandi. One of the youths Anand, a resident of Muttathara, grew suspicious and registered a complaint with the police. The investigation revealed the fraud. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/two-arrested-for-job-fraud/articleshow/82185742.cms||---

Besides, four of it’s seven staffers are also down with Covid. Two inmates, who were above 70 years of age and were residing at the old age home since 1995 and 2008, respectively, died of the disease on April 17. Of the 58 infected, 16 inmates have been admitted to MGM hospital in Kamothe while the others are being treated in isolation at the old age home. Panvel municipal commissioner Sudhakar Deshmukh said, “After two senior citizens at Paramshantidam Vrudhasharam died due to Covid infection on April 17, the management of the home informed us that many inmates were having fever and hence suspected Covid infection. A PCMC team was immediately rushed to the old age home and we conducted RT-PCR tests on all the senior citizens there and also the seven staffers. Of the four working as housing keeping staff and drivers, two were senior citizens. 16 Covid positive patients had to be shifted to MGM hospital, Kamothe, as their oxygen levels were depleting.” Some of the inmates at the old age home have been taken care of by the management for the past two decades, said Deshmukh. “While some are homeless or without any family members, others do not have Aadhaar cards. There even those who are unable to recall their identity. Therefore, the PCMC has ensured that these senior citizens receive proper medical care either in isolation at the old age home or at MGM hospital, where ICU beds and ventilators are available for critical covid patients,” said Deshmukh. “The ‘maharaj’ governing the old age home had ensured Covid SOPs were stringently followed, and because of this the inmates were not infected last year. But the second wave has infected several inmates and staffers,” he added.

Beds in government-run dedicated Covid RUHS and Jaipuria hospitals are almost full. Patients were hoping for ESI hospital to function with 126 beds having oxygen supply. But, due to unavailability of oxygen, the health department failed to start the facility. “Without oxygen, the Covid treatment facility cannot run. We deployed our staff, made medicines available and other arrangements were made but did not get oxygen, due to which we did not convert it as a dedicated facility. Once we get oxygen supply, we will start it,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). As the government-run dedicated Covid hospitals are getting fully occupied, the health department issued orders on Wednesday to private hospitals having 60 bed to 100 beds to reserve 40% in wards and in ICUsfor Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dedicated-covid-esi-hosp-fails-to-admit-patients-due-unavailability-of-oxygen/articleshow/82186551.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Goa & Karnataka block remdesivir supply to Rajasthan: Minister||JAIPUR: The state government on Wednesday alleged that Goa and Karnataka governments have interrupted supply of 5,000 remdisivir vials that were to be supplied to Rajasthan. With the demand and supply chain badly affected in the state, attendants of patients have been running from pillar to post for the injections, an antiviral drug useful in Covid treatment. Such is the shortage of the drug that patient parties are ready to pay any amount for the drug. Cashing in on the rising demand and limited availability, attendants of patients are being forced to buy the injection at almost five times of the cost. Shortage of another drug tocilizumab is also becoming a headache for attendants of patients. In the last two weeks, the state government received only 17,770 vials of remdesivir against the demand of 1.5 lakh. “Goa government interfered and stopped supply of 2,000 vials of remdesivir to be supplied to Rajasthan by Cipla, while Karnataka government interfered and stopped suppy of 3,000 vials to be supplied by Mylan Pharmaceuticals. The state is now facing serious crisis of remdesivir. If the situation persists, the situation will turn worse,” said Raghu Sharma, health minister. Rajasthan has an agreement with Cipla, Mylan and Cadila for remdesivir. The state places orders to the companies, but the state government alleged that they are not getting the full supply which they had demanded. Former health minister Kalicharan Saraf said the state government had failed to control the situation. “Now they are accusing the Centre for everything. The state government has failed to prevent blackmarketing of remdesivir injections. The state government has no shortage of remdesivir injection. In some specific private hospitals and in market, blackmarketing of remdesivir is prevalent,” Saraf said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/goa-karnataka-block-remdesivir-supply-to-rajasthan-minister/articleshow/82186558.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||As cases surge, experts call for ‘empowered home care’||Thiruvananthapuram: With nearly 80% active cases under home care in the state capital and significant number of patients opting for home care in other districts and breathlessness emerging as a chronic manifestation in the second wave, the authorities are exploring ways of implementing what is being mooted as ‘empowered home care’. Unlike the first wave when majority of asymptomatic patients were referred to home care and monitoring was entrusted with ward-level committees and through daily calls, the sheer increase in number of active cases, coupled with increased manifestation of shortness of breath have necessitated enhanced self-monitoring for dip in oxygen saturation and possible ways of accessing lab facility, officials point out. The cases have grown exponentially in the district in the past one week. The authorities are working out ways to create awareness among patients in home care to monitor oxygen saturation levels using pulse oximeter. Walk test for six minutes within the room as part of exertion test also needs to be encouraged among patients under home care and if there is a drop by 3% from the prescribed saturation levels, the patient should seek emergency medical care, an official associated with Covid-19 management points out. Lab facility which is inaccessible for Covid patients under home care also needs to be made available without compromising on existing protocol by proper and scientific use of lab network in each region. The officials said that there is a need to facilitate CRP and D-dimer tests for Covid patients under home care in case serious rise in patients overwhelm the hospital capacity. D-dimer test is a blood test used to rule out the presence of a serious blood clot. In the treatment of Covid-19, high D-dimer levels indicate severity of disease and could be a cause of mortality. A D-dimer test detects various kinds of blood clotting disorders like Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), Pulmonary embolism (PE) and Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). C-reactive protein tests are done to check the levels of inflammation in a Covid patient. A sudden rise in CRP levels within the first few days of confirmation of Covid 19 indicates respiratory deterioration and if CRP levels are not alarming, patient’s condition remains stable. “The challenge is to facilitate a testing environment for patients under home care by eliminating all kinds of risk elements. If patient load in hospital increases beyond the capacity, home care would be crucial and lab access has to be ensured under empowered home care. Given the present situation, the present SoP for home care requires a revision anticipating possibilities of more patients being referred to home care,” an official said. The SoP for home care issued in 2020 gives special emphasis on self-monitoring of oxygen saturation using pulse oximeter. This has to be done twice daily and a diary shall be maintained by the patient on which symptoms and oxygen saturation levels shall be recorded. Psychological stability of the patient is also being considered for home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/as-cases-surge-experts-call-for-empowered-home-care/articleshow/82185761.cms||Aswin J Kumar

From September 2020, when Delhi Metro operations resumed after being closed for 169 days, DMRC deployed flying squads and the teams penalised 5,180 passengers for not wearing face masks properly or not following social distancing. The figure reached 5,645 in October but dipped to 3,174 in November and 2,257 in December as compliance increased, DMRC said. The figure rose to 3,131 in January again, but dipped to 2,805 last month. This month, however, has seen 3,373 challans being issued till Thursday as the drives have been intensified. Dayal said the number of flying squads and frequency of drives have been further increased to ensure Covid-safety protocol was strictly adhered to and offenders were penalised on the spot. He said entry at stations would be regulated based on social distancing, especially at stations, like Rajiv Chowk, Barakhamba Road, Central Secretariat, Patel Chowk, ITO. “Due to strict reinforcement of social distancing norms, passengers are advised to plan their journey in advance and keep additional time of 20-30 minutes for their commute,” he said. “According to the existing protocol, it is mandatory for all the passengers to enter stations after thermal screening, hand sanitisation, face properly covered with a mask and following social distancing throughout their journey in a Metro train,” Dayal said. While waiting in the queue, passengers will be strictly required to wait on the marked social distancing circles, he said. “If it is found that distancing is not being followed at the stations, entry gates will be closed till the distancing is ensured by the commuters,” he said. He said that DMRC is also writing to the district administration to facilitate necessary assistance in ensuring social distancing and maintaining law and order outside Metro stations as there might be a spike in passengers waiting outside the stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dmrc-cracks-whip-be-on-your-best-behaviour-when-travelling/articleshow/81696318.cms||Sidharatha Roy

He was 58. He was son of Saeed Sabri (86) and brother of Amin Sabri (57). During the Nineties, the trio had given superhit qawwalis in Hindi films. “People who knew Farid and their house at Chaar Darwaja were aware that among the trio, he was the only one who was clear on what they wanted to do. “Humne sangeet ko jiya par shohrat Nahin khareed paaye (We lived music but failed to purchase our name),” Farid had told TOI in 2012. “Amin Sabri, while talking about the health of his elder brother Farid said, “He was diabetic and also had some problem in the kidney. Some days ago he was diagnosed with pneumonia.” “His condition deteriorated on Tuesday night. Everything happened so quickly. We will take his body to our ancestral place Mathura Walon Ki Haveli,” he added. According to a doctor, his kidneys were not functioning properly because of diabetes, which had an effect on his kidneys and lungs. Farid was buried at the Miskin Shah cemetery. “We appealed the public not to get much involved in the funeral,” he Amin said. Sabri brothers got their first break through Kapoor family when music director Ravindra Jain composed ‘Der Na Ho Jaaye Kahin Der Na Ho Jaaye’ in 1991. Their qawwali in the movie Sir Tum (1999) ‘Ek Mulaqat Zaroori hai Sanam’ was also a hit. During an interview earlier, Fareed had said, “People who decide fate of artistes want us to go and perform freely for them which we can’t. All the awards should be decided and given on merits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/qawwali-singer-farid-dies-at-58/articleshow/82186562.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Mumbai||Relief for doctor couple, MahaRERA asks builder to hand over flat in 1 mth||MUMBAI: MahaRERA has directed L&T Parel Project (LLP) to pay interest and hand over within a month actual possession of a 72.5 sqm flat along with two car parks in its Crescent Bay project to a doctor couple. According to the complainants, Dr Mahesh Goel, who works as a surgeon at Tata Memorial Hospital, and Dr Vijayalaxmi Goel, they had booked a flat on December 6, 2019 and entered into a registered agreement for sale (AFS) on January 23, 2020. They paid the entire sum of over Rs 3 crore. Possession was to be handed over by February 29, 2020. The complainants, represented by advocate Anand Kandoi, claimed that on March 9, 2020, the promoter issued only a fit-out possession letter. Subsequently, the promoter also wanted a draft rectification deed to be executed with the buyers. The promoter, represented by advocate Nilesh Gala, contended the project was complete and had an occupancy certificate on March 12, 2019. The promoter further claimed the complainants had taken possession of the flat. The promoter also alleged that the complainants had taken advantage of a typographical error in the AFS to claim two parking spaces. However, MahaRERA member Vijay Satbir Singh observed the possession letter is for fit-out possession and there is no provision of fit-out possession under RERA. He stated the obligations of the promoter towards the allottee continue till full possession is offered and don’t end merely because OC had been obtained before execution of agreement for sale. MahaRERA also observed that the communications sent by the promoter clearly show that final possession was not given. It said merely showing the electricity meter in the name of the complainants does not prove they have got final possession of their flat and have moved in. Singh also rejected the promoter’s claim that the two car parks mentioned in the AFS was inadvertent and a typographical error. In the order on April 5, the promoter was directed to pay interest on the amount paid by the complainants at highest marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) of SBI plus 2% from the agreed date of possession mentioned in the AFS till the date of actual possession of the flat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-relief-for-doc-couple-maharera-asks-bldr-to-hand-over-flat-in-1-mth/articleshow/82188989.cms||Sanjeev Devasia

---||Agra||UP’s oxygen supply dips to less than half of demand||AGRA: Notices have been going up across UP hospitals asking people to take patients elsewhere as supply of medical oxygen dropped dangerously below demand on Wednesday. There was a deficit of 55% by Thursday evening, with most hospitals either running out or teetering on the edge of doing so. “The daily demand of medical oxygen has reached 700 metric tonnes because of a surge in critically ill patients. The state is getting only 300 metric tonnes a day,” UP’s nodal officer of oxygen supply and distribution Naresh Mohan Deepak said. Before the pandemic hit, demand for oxygen from medical institutions was an average of 165 metric tonnes a day. Even at the peak of Covid-19 outbreak, he added, demand had risen to 275 metric tonnes a day. But this month, there has been an “exponential” increase, especially over the past week. Two private hospitals in Lucknow, Mayo Medical Centre and Make Well Hospital and Trauma Centre, put up notices saying they have not been able to get enough oxygen supply “after repeated request(s) to the UP CM/central govt” and asked those arriving at the hospitals to “take their patients to higher centre for further management.” In Aligarh, the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College had also posted a notice on Tuesday: “Oxygen backup is for two hours up to 2.30pm today. It is requested to take urgent steps for the care of patients.” Medical superintendent of the hospital, Prof Haris M Khan, told TOI that the problem had been resolved after the district magistrate intervened. “But anything can happen now because demand is higher than supply." "Of three blocks in the hospital, one block depends on oxygen cylinders. About 20-25 would be used in a day before Covid hit. Now, the demand is 100 cylinders a day,” Khan added. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said the problem was not UP’s alone. “Oxygen shortage is being seen across the country. The government of India is coordinating with all states to resolve the problem,” he added. About notices of shortage going up in hospitals, he said the problem “had been resolved” but did not share details. On an average day, UP gets 264 metric tonnes of medical grade liquid oxygen — 109 metric tonnes from Modinagar in Ghaziabad, 20 metric tonnes from India Glycols Limited in Uttarakhand’s Kashipur, 35 tonnes from a plant at INOX Noida, 60 tonnes from Goyal Gases in Ghaziabad and 40 tonnes from Bokaro. “Earlier, there would be medical oxygen left over because we did not need as much. Supplies would then be diverted to industries,” an official said. “In fact, even the 200-metric tonne quota of industrial oxygen from Roorkee and Panipat plants has been cut to 15 tonnes because the Centre is distributing it to other oxygen-deficient states.” Deepak said the situation should be better by Friday. “We are trying to streamline supplies,” he added. “Medical oxygen will soon be brought to the state from (the steel cities of) Rourkela, Durgapur and Bhilai. The state government, with assistance from the Centre, is also bringing supplies by trains.” The state has over 9.4 lakh Covid-19 cases, having added over 33,000 cases on Wednesday, with an active ratio (number of active cases compared to total number of cases) of 25.7%. Over 10,300 have died in the state of the virus so far, of which 187 have been over the past 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ups-oxygen-supply-dips-to-less-than-half-of-demand/articleshow/82185773.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

According to agency reports quoting an RTI reply by the Centre, Tamil Nadu reported vaccine wastage at 12.10%, followed by Haryana (9.74%), Punjab (8.12%), Manipur (7.80%) and Telangana (7.55%). According to the data of the state directorate of public health, which despatches vaccine and oversees utilization, vaccine wastage in Tamil Nadu is up to 13% for Covaxin and 9% for Covishield. As per state figures, 7.14 lakh doses of Covaxin and 44.80 lakh doses of Covishield were sent to drug stores between January 16 and April 17. Once opened, a vial — stored at a temperature between 2 degrees Celsius and 8 degrees Celsius — has to be used within four hours. By April 17, the state had used 47.05 lakh doses, including 40.5 lakh of Covishield. “The remaining doses stored as unusable vials are wasted doses,” said health minister C Vijayabaskar. “In the initial days, there was a lot of avoidance and hesitancy. There was pressure on health workers to vaccinate as many people as possible. So, they opened vials of 20 and 10 doses even if there were not enough people. Now, with increase in cases and stock, we will be able to increase vaccinations. When that happens, the wastage will come down,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/13-covaxin-9-covishield-doses-wasted-in-tn/articleshow/82185772.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||ULB polls likely to be held on schedule||Cleared: Arun Hyderabad: Elections to the two municipal corporations, five municipalities and nine other wards in various civic bodies are likely to be held as per schedule on April 30. Sources said the state government has taken an in-principle decision to go ahead with the elections despite a surge in Covid-19 cases and the same has been informed to the State Election Commission (SEC) too. As per the Municipal Act, the SEC has to consult the government on finalising or postponing the poll dates. The SEC is likely to issue formal orders on Thursday on going ahead with urban local bodies elections as per the notification issued by it on April 16. The SEC is expected to also list stricter Covid-19 guidelines, precautions and measures to be followed during campaigning, polling and counting of votes. Sources said the state government was of the view that only six days of actual campaign was left for the municipal polls and that the crucial exercise of filing of nominations has already been completed. After the last date of withdrawal of nominations on Thursday, campaigning will continue only up to April 28. Polling will be held on April 30 and counting of votes on May 3. All this could be done following Covid-19 guidelines, top government officials said. The SEC on Tuesday wrote a letter to the government to reconsider holding the polls in the wake of the high court directions and a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases all over the state. In view of the night curfew imposed by the government, the SEC also issued revised orders on permitting loudspeakers. Officials said the loud speakers will be allowed at public meetings and roadshows only between 6 am and 8 pm for campaigning. Prior to the night curfew orders, the election authorities had given permission for loud speakers usage between 6 am and 10 pm. Meanwhile, leaders of Congress, Telangana Jana Samithi and CPI have urged state election commissioner C Partha Sarathi to defer the municipal polls until the Covid-19 intensity comes down. In letters written to Sarathi, G Niranjan of Congress, M Kodandaram of the TJS and Chada Venkat Reddy of the CPI said going ahead with the elections to seven ULBs was fraught with danger. They said it would be putting the lives of 15 lakh population, political leaders, election staff, police personnel and family members to grave risk. “The SEC should realise that elections should not be conducted during a pandemic. We request the election commission not to play with the lives of the people by going ahead with the polls,” Niranjan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ulb-polls-likely-to-be-held-on-schedule/articleshow/82186602.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Dehradun||With migrants returning from Delhi & other states, hill districts step up Covid testing facilities at key entry points||DEHRADUN/ALMORA/PITHORAGARH: As migrant workers have once again started returning to Uttarakhand from Delhi and other states in the wake of a fresh wave of Covid-19, the local authorities in nine hill districts of the Himalayan state have stepped up the preparations to keep the spread of the virus in check. Besides arranging for health check-up centres at the key entry points, officials said that gram pradhans and ASHA workers are being roped in to compile the data of the returnees and their health status. Chamoli district administration has set up security barriers at Gauchar and Gairsain to ensure returning migrants are thoroughly checked. “At times, some people manage to enter the district without being inspected. Therefore, the district administration has asked gram pradhans and ASHA workers to help in compiling the data of those returning from other states,” Swati Bhadauria, district magistrate, Chamoli, told TOI. At Gauchar and Gairsain checkpoints, the health department teams are examining the migrants and those found unwell are being shifted to district and other hospitals. “People coming to the district without negative RT-PCR reports are being tested for Covid-19. While home isolation is mandatory for all, the ones displaying serious symptoms are being sent to hospitals,” the DM said. She added that several migrant workers from Delhi and Jharkhand have returned in the past few days. In Pithoragarh, the district administration has set up an RT-PCR test and health check-up facility at Aincholi which is on the outskirts of the main city area. A routine inspection of all migrants returning to the district is conducted and all those displaying coronavirus-like symptoms are made to undergo an RT-PCR test,” DM Pithoragarh Anand Swaroop said. Meanwhile, in Almora, the number of returning migrant workers went up after the announcement of a six-day lockdown in Delhi last week. Dr Savita Hayanki, Almora CMO, said that check barriers have been set up at different places and migrants are being checked. “Our teams are also in touch with those under home isolation,” said Dr Hayanki.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-migrants-returning-from-delhi-other-states-hill-districts-step-up-covid-testing-facilities-at-key-entry-points/articleshow/82184868.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Just 1 sewage point into choe uncapped: NGT report||CHANDIGARH: Monitoring by National Green Tribunal or a tribunal-appointed committee cannot be a permanent feature. With these words, the NGT disposed of the case it had been monitoring and inspecting for last few years. That is of stopping the flow of sewage into N-choe and Sukhna choe and improving and upgrading sewage treatment plants (STPs). The tribunal did say in its report that except one sewage point into the choes, all others were capped. The report, however, revealed anomalies in the case of STPs and untreated water in the choes. The NGT asked the UT administration to monitor all these issues timely and at the highest level. “Monitoring is only the last resort for some period. It is finally for states to take ownership and employ stern measures and evolve an effective mechanism to remedy the situation….this in order to give effect to its constitutional obligation to provide clean environment to citizens and protect natural and scarce environmental resources like water, air and soil for current and future generations,” the tribunal said. The report said all 11 sewage outlets into Sukhna choe had been plugged except one near Raipur Khurd and all eight outlets into N-choe were sealed. Moreover, there is no gap in treatment capacity. Analysis results of water quality of the two choes and Ghaggar river indicated that the values of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and F.coli were higher than permissible limits, the report said, adding it indicated that some outlets were carrying untreated sewage of Chandigarh. The tribunal recommended Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) make a detailed survey within a month and ensure no outlet carrying untreated sewage was discharged into the choes. On the STPs, the tribunal recommended, “The upgradation work of the five STPs, 3 BRD having a capacity of 49.5 MLD; Raipur Kalan having a capacity of 22.5 MLD; Diggian having a capacity of 135 MLD; Raipur Khurd having a capacity of 5.63 MLD and Dhanas having a capacity of 7.5 MLD should be completed by June 2021.” Commenting on the data monitoring of groundwater quality, the tribunal said groundwater sources at some locations in the catchment area of Sukhna choe and N-choe have been found containing higher values of parameters of calcium and TDS. The executing committee suggested CPCC in association with officers of the municipal corporation identify such groundwater sources, seal the points and hang boards mentioning “Ground water is not fit for drinking.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/just-1-sewage-point-into-choe-uncapped-ngt-report/articleshow/82185775.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Goa||Party hub in North Goa beach belt biggest Covid hotspot: Goa Medical College study||PANAJI: North Goa’s coastal belt has emerged as the state’s main Covid-19 hotspot, with Baga and Calangute being classified as “very high risk areas” in a study conducted by Goa Medical College’s (GMC) department of preventive and social medicine. The study on Covid-19 cases and emerging patterns show that Covid-19 hotspots shot up from 130 to 179 locations in a single day, predominantly along the beach belt in Bardez where “partying and tourism is going on”. Sharing the findings of the report, health minister Vishwajit Rane said that the “very high-risk and high risk areas need immediate scrutiny”. The study is based on composite data obtained from confirmed Covid-19 cases, probable cases who have come for testing, and suspect cases based on those who updated their symptoms on the Aarogya Setu app. “We are sharing this information to inform the people that the situation in Goa is very scary at the moment,” Rane said. “This is a very infective strain. Doctors are also under a lot of pressure, and there is a large demand for beds. As we speak, we have created two more wards for Covid. We are doing all we can as a team to see that every citizen of Goa is taken very good care of. We are taking all precautions possible to keep Goa safe in terms of medical care.” He also said that the directorate of health services is taking all steps to ensure that we are not complacent and caught on the wrong foot. “I am also following up on the genome sequencing machine, to get it at the earliest,” he said. Head of department for preventive and social medicine, Dr Jagadish Cacodcar, along with Dr Nitin Dhupdale and Dr Dhanya Jose prepared the Arogya Setu analysis surveillance report and analysed the data, which was then submitted to the state government. The report, said Rane, is used to create a prediction model for emerging hotspots in the state, so that adequate measures can be taken and to also aid the decision-making process. GMC’s report shows that Bardez, Salcete, Tiswadi and Ponda talukas account for 80% of Goa’s Covid-19 cases. The top five hotspots in North Goa are Baga, Calangute, Anjuna, Alto-Porvorim and St Inez. On Wednesday’s edition, TOI reported that late night parties and clubs continue to flout social distancing norms. In South Goa, Fatorda, Vasco da Gama, Gogol, Ponda and Aquem account for the most cases. “Bardez is completely affected, particularly the coastal belt. If we need to have an impact, there needs to be micro-containment zones in these areas. The health official will know the areas where the cases are, and these have to be contained,” said a health department official, commenting on the steps announced by chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday. The officer said that the impact of the micro-containment or partial curfew will only be seen after four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/party-hub-in-n-goa-beach-belt-biggest-covid-hotspot-gmc-study/articleshow/82187666.cms||---

---||Ajmer||Oxygen crisis deepens, Rajasthan demands more from Centre||JAIPUR: With more than 96,000 active Covid-19 cases and growing demand for medical oxygen, the state is facing an acute shortage of oxygen. While the daily requirement has rose to 250 metric tonnes, the state is only receiving 160 metric tonnes per day. Following this, the government has sought the help of 25 Lok Sabha members and 10 Rajya Sabha members to get more oxygen from the Centre. According to health department officials, over 4,000 patients in the state are currently on oxygen support. The beds in all major hospitals are also fully occupied and patients are finding it difficult to find one for treatment. On Wednesday, 62 persons died of Covid, while 14,622 others tested positive in the state, bringing the overall tally to 4,53,407. With 62 more deaths, the state’s toll rose to 3,330. The number of active cases, both those undergoing treatment at hospitals or under home quarantine, rose to 96,366 for a jump of 12.6% in 24 hours. As active cases keep on increasing, the need for oxygen will rise to 325 metric tonnes by the end of the month. The health department has asked the government for an immediate supply of 120 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen to meet the growing demand. Tankers with a capacity of carrying 100 and 200 metric tonnes have also been sought to transport oxygen. “As per our analysis of the past five days, the requirement for oxygen is growing by 10-12 metric tonnes daily with the increase in active cases. But in the national oxygen plan, the state has been allocated only 160 metric tonnes daily of liquid medical oxygen. This is not sufficient viewing the increasing number of patients,” said health minister Raghu Sharma. Sharma also alleged that Inox oxygen plant, situated in Bhiwadi, was supplying oxygen in violation of the national oxygen plan tp other state. Currently, the plant is expected to supply 65 metric tonnes to Rajasthan, 40 to MP and 15 to Delhi. But he alleged that the company has supplied 25.57 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen to Haryana violating the national plan, and Delhi 22.86 metric tonnes against the quota of 15 metric tonnes. The minister has written to 25 LS members and 10 RS members to demand more oxygen from the Centre. Meanwhile, 18 persons died in Jodhpur on Thursday, taking its toll to 413, while eight died in Udaipur that took its toll to 198. Jaipur reported five deaths, taking its toll to 581, while Kota too saw five deaths that too its toll to 227.

But Kalpesh Vaghela, a consultant, lost gold ornaments worth Rs 1.24 lakh that were stolen from under his pillow. Vaghela and his mother Shakuntala developed symptoms of Covid-19 and they went to Tricolour Hospital on March 22. The medicos asked Shakuntala to undergo a CT scan which required her to remove her ornaments including a gold chain, bangles and ear rings. She kept them in a bag and later handed it over to her son.  Kalpesh told the Gorwa police that he kept the bag under his pillow and slept off. When he woke up some hours later, he looked for the bag but it was missing. Kalpesh and his mother inquired with the hospital staff but didn’t get any clues about it. After being discharged on March 27, he called up the police to complain about the theft.  But Kalpesh was under home quarantine and hence filed a complaint on April 20. The investigators will scan the hospital’s CCTV footage to trace the thief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ncov-patients-gold-worth-rs-1-2l-stolen/articleshow/82184923.cms||---
---||Goa||Now, state set to use Goa Medical College’s new super-specialty block for Covid||PANAJI: The new super-specialty block at Goa Medical College, Bambolim, will be operationalised as a Covid hospital by May 10, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday. The unit will have 200 beds. The decision was taken as public and private hosptials have been running full for days now. That the superspecialty hospital at Bambolim be commissioned as a Covid hospital has been the demand of the opposition for the past two weeks. Sawant also said that three IAS officers would be appointed as nodal officers to oversee the strengthening of healthcare services, and will monitor bed capacity and facilities available on a daily basis, under the supervision of the health secretary. “PRO helplines will also be made available and their phone numbers will be publicised,” he said. “They will work 24x7 to inform citizens about bed availability and the condition of patients from their family.” This is among several issues highlighted by TOI over the past few days. The state’s target is to test 5,000 persons a day, he said. “The number of mobile RT-PCR vans will be increased. We have crossed 4,000 tests a day, which is helping show an increased Covid-positive number in the state. Our target is to test upto 5,000 a day,” said Sawant. Sawant also said that the home isolation system will be strengthened in collaboration with a taluka-level setup by the Indian Medical Association (IMA). IMA doctors will offer telephonic consultation to patients, he said. “Even if you have tested yourself, it is important to isolate yourself at home till you get the results,” Sawant said. “Lately, we have been seeing that entire families are turning positive, which was not the case earlier. Those who test positive should immediately contact medical officers for their home-isolation kits and start medication as soon as possible. It is seen that there are more cases of lung infection in the second wave.” He also said the state has sufficient Remdesivir in stock. “We have sufficient stock of Remdesivir. Within the next four days, we will have 10,000 vials of Remdesivir available with us. Even private hospitals that require it can contact the GMC dean to procure it. The government will provide ventilators and Remdesivir on loan basis to private hospitals,” the CM said. Sawant claimed that oxygen supply is sufficient at the moment, but that efforts are being made along with the Centre for additional regular allocation of liquid medical Oxygen in case of increased requirement, Sawant said. “See that you do not spread any rumours,” he said. “There is sufficient oxygen supply available in Goa.” He said that the state would also be purchasing additional Covishield vaccines in addition to the quota allotted to it by the Centre so far. “I have appealed to MLAs to help us motivate citizens to take the vaccine,” Sawant said. “In some cases, doctors are directing patients from North Goa to go to the South Goa hospital. The decision is taken by doctors based on the severity of the case. I seek cooperation on this front from the people. Not everyone can get a bed at GMC,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-state-set-to-use-gmcs-new-super-specialty-block-for-covid/articleshow/82187674.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bond service: Less than 50% MBBS grads apply, deadline extended in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Less than 50% or 1, 048 of 2,500 MBBS graduates who were eligible for the mandatory bond service this year applied for it till Wednesday evening – the last date for application. The Directorate of Health Services had issued a circular last week making bond service mandatory for graduates, who completed their internship by March 31. Several graduates, however, are yet to complete their internship as many usually extend it to prepare for NEET-PG. The entrance test has been postponed this year due to the Covid case spike. Dr TP Lahane, director, DMER, said the deadline will be extended till April 30 for those who are yet to complete internships. He added the portal will be opened again for these candidates from May 1 to 5. Parents and candidates, however, claimed there was lack of clarity still. “Many students take a two-month break from internships to prepare for NEET-PG. The circular for bond came after the NEET-PG was postponed. Students will not get enough time to wrap up their internships by month end,” said Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bond-service-less-than-50-mbbs-grads-apply-deadline-extended-in-mumbai/articleshow/82189041.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Dehradun||'Those who left Kumbh early cannot take last shahi snan'||Seers of the Bairagi sect said on Wednesday that the akhadas that left their camps at the Kumbh Mela last week following PM Modi’s appeal to observe the rest of Kunbh “in a symbolic manner” will not be allowed to participate in the last shahi snan on April 27. The seers said they had conveyed their decision to the mela administration and Kumbh police. As reported by TOI, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 17 had requested seers to help in the fight against the pandemic and keep the rest of the Kumbh symbolic. Following this, the prominent Shaivite or sanyasi akhadas like Juna, Atal, Agni, Ahavan, Niranjani and Anand had left the mela premises. The Vaishnavite or Bairagi akhadas had opposed the move as for them, the Ram Navami snan on Wednesday and the last shahi snan are significant unlike the Shaivite akhadas, for whom the third shahi snan on April 14 was the high point of Kumbh. Nirmohi akhada head Mahant Rajendra Das and secretary of Nirvani akhada Mahant Gauri, both of whom are Bairagi seers, said, “There is no need for those who have left to take part in the snan. These akhadas have already completed immersion of their respective deities which is the concluding ritual for an akhada at the Kumbh. Therefore for them, the Kumbh is over, and there is no need for them to come for the snan again.” The Bairagi akhadas reiterated that the schedule of a Kumbh is decided based on planetary alignments and concluding it early was “a disservice to an age-old tradition.” Meanwhile, the ghats at Kumbh wore a deserted look on Ram Navami snan on Wednesday as only a handful of people turned up to take the holy dip. The mela administration said that it had stationed teams at various checkpoints across the district but not many people came from outside the state. “We believe that because of lockdown in neighbouring states like Delhi, the number of pilgrims is going to be low from now on,” a mela official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bairagi-seers-say-akhadas-who-left-kumbh-early-wont-be-allowed-at-last-shahi-snan/articleshow/82184891.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Goa||No lockdown, but curfew in Goa from 10pm to 6am till April 30||PANAJI: On a day Goa reported its highest-ever tally of fresh Covid-19 infections, chief minister Pramod Sawant announced a night curfew from 10pm to 6am till April 30. He also postponed the Class X and Class XII public exams, and said that the new schedule would be announced 15 days prior to their commencement. “There will be no lockdown imposed, even later, and no assumptions should be made about this,” Sawant said. “People should not panic and start hoarding. Grocery stores and malls will all be open. The night curfew has been imposed only for a short period of time.” The curfew, which started on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, will be reviewed after April 30. The scheduled municipal elections on Friday will take place as planned, he said. “Municipal elections will take place with all necessary restrictions,” he said. “We have informed the state election commissioner to put all precautions in place. Restrictions will also be imposed on the day of results, and large gatherings will not be permitted.” Sawant said that schools, colleges, educational and coaching institutions will remain shut for students till April 30, and a decision on whether teachers will report to work has been left up to the directorate of education. The online exams of colleges will be held as planned, he said. Swimming pools, too, will remain shut. “Additional KTC (Kadamba) buses will be deployed to avoid inconvenience to the public,” Sawant said. Establishments which will be allowed to run at 50% capacity are casinos, bars and restaurants, river cruises/water and entertainment parks, gymnasiums, spas, massage parlours, cinema halls/ theatres/multiplexes and buses used for public transport. All religious places of worship have to ensure that no mass-gatherings are held, he said. “I request temples to carry out zatra with only rituals, without any mass gatherings. I request churches and mosques to carry out their prayer services online, or to ask the faithful to pray at home. We have asked deputy collectors and mamlatdars to keep watch that these restrictions are followed,” he said. Weddings with a maximum limit of 50 persons can take place with prior permission from the collector, and funerals can be held with up to 20 persons, and no prior permission will be required. “All sports clubs/associations are appealed to cancel their tournaments in public interest to help curtail the pandemic. Section 144 will be imposed in the state to ensure that not more than five persons gather at a time in public places, even on beaches. There will be strict reinforcement from Thursday,” Sawant said. Sawant also said that all private establishments are advised to actively promote work from home for employees. “No restrictions have been imposed on the functioning of any industries. We do not want any impact on the economy. Restaurants will also be open. I want to request people not to come out of their home unless it is absolutely essential, not just senior citizens but even youngsters,” Sawant said. He said that weekly markets will take place but social distancing will be enforced. “Yesterday, 26 persons died, and today, another 17. I was pained to know that some were as young as 20-22. Only the person who loses a family member understands the pain. I join my hands and request you not to come out of your homes unnecessarily. Yesterday, 10-12 people died at GMC despite doctors doing their best. Citizens should understand that this is not the time to fool around. There are more cases now in the 30-45 age group.” “We do not want to impose a lockdown or scare people to stay indoors. We want to request and keep people indoors,” he said. Sawant said that areas with concentration of Covid-19 positive cases would be declared micro-containment zones. A decision will be taken by the deputy collector in consultation with the district collector. Even in these zones, all grocery stores and essentials will be operational, he said. He said that currently, there is a concentration of cases in Mapusa, Panaji, Candolim, Porvorim, Margao, Vasco, Ponda, and the coastal belt. “GMC’s department of preventive and social medicine is monitoring emerging hotspots in Goa. According to them, the coastal belt is emerging as a hotspot. We will declare micro-containment zones in the coastal belt with consultation with epidemiologists and the district collector,” he said. Sawant stressed that even during the night curfew — after 10pm — services like pharmacies, petrol pumps and other emergency services will be operational. No goods from transportation to Goa from other states will be restricted during the night curfew as the state receives many essential supplies from other states, the CM said. “Entry to casinos will shut at 10pm. The only aim of the night curfew is to ensure that the public does not come out to public places in large numbers, and casinos will also have to follow this. We are not concerned with any activity that goes on inside, but there should be no people seen on the road,” said Sawant. The curbs were announced after the CM held a meeting with health minister Vishwajit Rane, revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate, chief secretary Parimal Rai, GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar, director of health services Dr Jose D’Sa, state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, private hospitals in-charge Dr Shekhar Salkar, IMA and others officers and secretaries concerned. “I also held a virtual meeting with all 40 MLAs and took their suggestions,” Sawant said. “Many a time, they complain about not being taken into confidence, but I have spoken to them and told them to convey their suggestions to us. Instead of criticising publicly, we should come together to defeat Covid. This is not the time to play politics.” All cultural, sports and political congregations have been banned from Thursday, he said. District collectors will be responsible for enforcing the curbs, Sawant said. Meanwhile, Sawant said that public information officers will be deputed at each Covid hospital for the general public to get information about occupancy of beds, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-lockdown-but-curfew-in-goa-from-10pm-to-6am-till-april-30/articleshow/82187705.cms||---

The BJP asked the governor to use her special powers and advise the SEC to postpone the election in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases. “The BJP strongly believes that this is the time for all of us to set our priorities right. Elections for local bodies are important, but more important is the lives of people. Elections ought to happen in a free atmosphere but not in a situation when every individual is skeptical of another for fear of catching infection. Under the circumstances, electioneering process would expose the parties, workers and people at large to greater risk,” the memorandum said The BJP alleged that the government has not applied its mind in announcing the poll on April 16.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: With deadline approaching, parties busy cajoling rebels||HYDERABAD: With just a day left for withdrawal of nominations for civic polls in Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC), Khammam corporation and five other municipalities, major parties have not announced their candidate list to prevent rebel candidates either contesting as independents or shift loyalties to other parties. Though the nomination process ended four days ago, the last day for withdrawal of nominations is April 22 and before that the parties should give B-forms to their official candidates. For instance, of 66 divisions in GWMC, TRS has announced first list with 18 candidates, while BJP released its first list with 27 candidates and second list with 25 names late on Wednesday night. Congress has not announced any candidates. Similarly, for Khammam municipal corporation, the pink party has not released its list, but indicated some selected candidates to go ahead with the campaign in their respective divisions. BJP and Jana Sena announced their pact in the election, but have not released candidates and Congress too is waiting for other parties to release their list. The parties are expected to announce their complete list either on Wednesday night or Thursday morning. The major reason for parties holding back official list could be numerous candidates aspiring for party tickets in each division, especially for the ruling party. According to official sources, for 66 divisions in GWMC, as many as 688 candidates are in the fray on behalf of TRS, 286 from BJP and 240 from Congress. In Khammam too for 60 divisions, 101 candidates had filed nominations, claiming to be TRS candidates, 69 as BJP candidates, 108 on Congress name, 31 CPM, nine CPI and 14 candidates as TDP. They would be declared as party candidates by the election authorities if the parties give declaration as the party official candidates before April 22 afternoon. With parties set to release the final list, party leaders have been speaking to candidates who may not be given tickets in the elections by assuring them other posts. Ministers E Dayakar Rao, Satyavathi Rathod and planning commission vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar were individually talking to candidates in divisions where highest number of candidates have filed their nominations.  In BJP too, party leaders have been calling up candidates whose names were not cleared by the screening committee and convincing them to withdraw from the fray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-deadline-approaching-parties-busy-cajoling-rebels/articleshow/82186676.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Mumbai||Police to escort oxygen tankers across Maharashtra||MUMBAI: An oxygen tanker headed for a hospital in Dhule district was forcibly diverted two days ago, prompting the state police to decide on escorting such vehicles. The police have also started a crackdown on Remdesivir black marketers, registering 18 cases across the state in five days. “We were informed about the Dhule incident through unverified sources and are ascertaining the facts. People are reacting in panic due to a shortage of oxygen. Since the last two days, we have piloted vehicles transporting oxygen cylinders or gas tankers from their points of origin to destinations across the state to avoid any untoward incidents,” said acting DGP Sanjay Pandey. He said police are coordinating with district collectors on the vehicles’ collection points and destinations and accordingly the respective district police are arranging escorts in their jurisdictions. An officer said oxygen vehicles are at risk because of increasing unrest among people due to shortage of oxygen supply, especially in hospitals and nursing homes, some of which have had to deny emergency admission to patients. Late on Tuesday, people barged into the storeroom of a hospital in Madhya Pradesh and looted oxygen cylinders. Since April 16, the police have also registered 18 cases in which 32 persons have been booked for the black-marketing of Remdesivir. The individuals include a doctor, a medicine shop owner and a pharmaceuticals distributor. Four of the cases were registered in Pune, followed by three in Nagpur, two in Mira-Bhayander and one each in Aurangabad, Nandurbar, Nanded, Bhandara, Latur, Pune Rural, Kolhapur, Parbhani and Ahmednagar. All police stations in the state have been asked to coordinate with Food and Drug Administration officials to act against those involved in black marketing or hoarding of Remdesivir, said Pandey. Oxygen is crucial for Covid-19 patients whose condition deteriorate. The government has prohibited manufacturers from supplying oxygen for industrial purposes, with exceptions, after hospital demand surged in recent days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-police-to-escort-oxygen-tankers-across-the-state/articleshow/82187750.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Nagpur||Tiger saunters onto road near Tadoba, people watch it from distance||NAGPUR: The restrictions on people’s movements seem to have encouraged tigers to come out of the forests and onto the roads. On Tuesday, a tiger on the Agarzari-Mohurli road near Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) caused a flutter among passers-by. The animal did not harm anyone even though curious people got down from their vehicles for a closer look at the animal. Tadoba’s wildlife biologist Prajakta Hushangabadkar, who was returning from work to reach Mohurli, said, “The tiger was sighted at 5 pm. The animal suddenly came out of the woods near Kalapani nullah ahead of Navargaon chowki and walked a few metres before squatting on the road. Around 25 people on two-wheelers and four-wheelers were at hand to catch a glimpse of it.” “Though it was wrong on the part of the people to come out of their vehicles, the tiger did not harm anyone nor was it pestered. Studying factors that mitigate conflict and encourage coexistence are key steps to maintain a healthy relationship between humans and wildlife,” said Hushangabadkar. The tiger is said to a male sub-adult cub of Chhoti Madhuri, a resident tigress of Agarzari forest. “The situation would not have been similar had the tiger been sighted in the territorial forest area. Tadoba tigers have regular interface with tourists and villagers and have understood that humans are not their food nor threat,” said TATR deputy director (core) Nandkishore Kale. The tiger must have come out of the forest owing to sparse traffic on the road which, otherwise, is busy when tourism is open. Tigers and other wild animals have been sighted frequently on the forested Padmapur-Mohurli road and there has been no record of a tiger attacking any passer-by. The pictures of the tiger went viral on social media with thousands of comments and likes on Twitter. “This is the best example of coexistence. The tiger did not attack anyone despite being so close. It also sends a message that the big cats will never attack any human deliberately. However, these carnivores have been dubbed as villains following series of attacks on humans in Chandrapur, where most of the attacks occur when people come in their critical distance while collecting forest produce in the jungles,” said state wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre. In 2020, 88 people were killed in Maharashtra in wild animal attacks. Out of this, 35 were in Chandrapur district alone. Even in the last three months of 2021, 13 villages have died in the district alone. All the victims had ventured into the forest for collection of non-timber forest produce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiger-saunters-onto-road-near-tadoba-people-watch-it-from-distance/articleshow/82186681.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Ahmedabad||Ailing system: Denied ventilator, Gujarat doctor dies gasping||AHMEDABAD: In Palanpur town of Banaskantha district, Dr Naresh Shah’s patients needed no address. “Dr Naresh ki gali” was known to not only his patients in the area but also to those from the neighbouring Rajasthan. Ever since he started practising in 1968, Dr Shah attended to patients regardless of the weather or his personal convenience. In fact, he treated 100-150 patients daily till about ten days ago. So the people he tended to and his family were inconsolable when he succumbed to coronavirus early on April 18. He was 79. The grief of Dr Shah’s son is deepened by the fact that his father could not find a BiPAP machine or a ventilator for intensive treatment despite exhaustive and exhausting search. Dr Shah’s family had pleaded with hospitals and even government officials for help. “If a doctor can’t get a BiPAP machine or a ventilator to save his life, imagine what would be the condition of a common man struggling to get intensive care,” wrote Dr Shah’s son, Dr Darshan. The pathos-filled thought was made in a post on the demise of his father. Dr Darshan told TOI that his father was treated at a private hospital after he tested positive for Covid-19 but soon he developed breathing problems. “When we admitted him, his oxygen requirement was 2 litres per hour which rapidly increased to 50 litres per hour,” Dr Darshan said. “We needed a BiPAP machine or a ventilator to provide him breathing support.” The family said that Civil Hospital in Palanpur is overloaded and there is a severe scarcity of oxygen and ventilatory support. “When we could not find a ventilator bed at Civil Hospital, we contacted a local multi-specialty hospital which has multiple ICU beds with ventilators,” Dr Darshan said. “But to our shock and horror, the hospital authorities refused to admit him saying that theirs was a non-Covid hospital. Moreover, they also refused to give a ventilator to extend a lifeline to the senior doctor.” Dr Shah was finally brought to an Ahmedabad hospital where he died within two hours of admission. “We put in all our might but we could not save your Dr Nareshkaka…I am not finding faults with anybody…this is the season… but I rue the fact that no hospital could spare a ventilator for Dr Naresh Shah who spent 50 years treating patients,” his son wrote. “The journey of struggle with Covid-19 is a long one. Please ensure what happened to my father is not repeated with another patient.” Dr Darshan said: “I feel the time has come for the government to use the sweeping powers granted by the Epidemic Diseases Act and requisition life-saving devices like BiPAP machines and ventilators which are lying spare in non-Covid hospitals.” He said such machines must be used to save Covid-19 patients. Dr Jitendra Modi, a dermatologist in Palanpur, said that Dr Shah’s demise and the struggle the family had faced in getting critical care for him should serve as a wake-up call. Dr Modi said Covid-19 patients should get priority treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ailing-system-denied-ventilator-doc-dies-gasping/articleshow/82186703.cms||Radha Sharma
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Indrani Mukerjea among 39 woman prisoners to test Covid +ve||MUMBAI: Amid rising cases of Covid among prisoners across state, thirty-nine woman prisoners, including Sheena Bora murder case accused Indrani Mukerjea, have also tested positive for Covid. All 39 women at the Byculla Women’s Prison have been shifted to the ES Patanwala Urdu School at Byculla, a temporary prison set up for treating jail patients, said a senior prison officer. The first positive case was reported from the women’s prison in May last year. “All positive inmates have been moved to temporary prison and treatment is on,” said Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of police, Prisons. The Byculla jail premises has two prisons; one for men and the other for women. While it has an official capacity to accommodate 262 women, it houses more than 300. A woman inmate was found Covid positive and sent to JJ Hospital last week. However, due to shortage of beds she could not be admitted and was later sent to St George’s Hospital. The authorities took note of this situation and on Sunday carried out the Rapid Antigen Test on 225 inmates and 60 jail officials. “Thirty-nine women tested positive,” said the officer. Mukerjea, ex-CEO of INX Media, is lodged at the Byculla jail since August 2015, when she was sent to judicial custody in connection with her role in the murder of her daughter, Sheena Bora. Incidentally, Elgar Parishad case accused Shoma Sen and Sudha Bhardwaj who are lodged in the same jail have tested negative. “Sen’s husband Tushar Bhattacharya said he received her call at 2.50pm on April 19. She and later Sudha had mild symptoms after taking vaccine. But they have tested negative,” said a lawyer. However, Jyoti Jagtap, the 6th accused arrested by the NIA in the same case, is Covid positive.

A large number of candidates have filed nominations from various wards in seven urban local bodies and nine wards in other civic bodies, expecting the B-form. Telangana Congress leadership has decided to give B-forms directly to the election authorities on Thursday (April 22), the last date for withdrawal of nominations. Telangana Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said the party’s election committees will finalise the candidates and give B-forms directly to the election officials. He appealed to all the remaining candidates from the party to withdraw from the electoral fray and work for the victory of party-finalised candidates.  The task of ensuring withdrawal of party candidates is easier said than done. The TRS, BJP and Congress, all three main parties are staring at rebels’ threat with a large number of candidates from these parties having filed their nominations expecting B-form.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/suspense-over-b-form-in-congress/articleshow/82186698.cms||Roushan Ali

The micro-containment zones include buildings, apartments and smaller areas as hotspots, which officials say will be kept under strict control and contact tracing. According to the strategy devised by the Centre, all households and close contacts of confirmed and suspect cases are to be home quarantined for minimum of 14 days. Experts say that in the absence of the lockdown during the second wave of Covid- 19 cases, micro-containment zones are important. “The onus should also be on the citizens and community in the micro containment zones. They should take responsibility and support the government in the Covid mitigation activities as and when people recover. These zones can be made Covid-free and will be easier to manage as compared to large containment zones,” Dr Subodh Kandamuthan, professor, and director centre for health care management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) said. In the current scenario, a population of more than 50,000 will be covered under the micro-containment zone. The number of micro-containment zones went up by 128 in just 24 hours of state government mapping the first set of micro-containment zones. After the state government informed the high court it will implement a micro-containment zone strategy, 363 zones were identified with Hyderabad having 52 of them. “Within 24 hours the numbers increased, indicating the seriousness of infection spread not only in the GHMC area also but under remote districts where fewer cases were being reported,” a senior health department official said. Last year, the government went for big containment zones but this year its planned micro containment to try and control the spread without affecting economic activities. “The Centre has given the freedom to define containment zones to states from time to time. In the initial days of the pandemic each house with a positive case was considered a containment zone but later the definition kept changing,” said the official. At present, the state is identifying micro-containment zones based on positivity rate in areas where primary health care centres are located.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-draws-up-micro-containment-zones-to-counter-covid-surge/articleshow/82186682.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Stringent curbs put on travel within Maharashtra, weddings pruned||MUMBAI: The state government reacted on Wednesday to the continuing surge in Covid-19 cases with additional restrictions on travel within the state and the city, and a further reduction in attendance in government offices and such private offices that fall under the essential or exempted category. These curbs will kick in at 8pm Thursday and be in force till 7am on May 1. Metro, mono and local train travel will be restricted to government employees, medical personnel, and persons who are specially abled or in need of medical treatment. Attendance at all government offices, except those involved in Covid-19 management, has been reduced from 50% to 15%. Establishments allowed to function under the essential services category, like pet shops, data centres, cargo offices and petrol pumps, should work at 50% capacity. Exempted establishments like banks, insurance offices and advocates’ offices shall function at 15% of their workforce or five persons, whichever is more. Domestic help may continue to work as they do now. Public and private buses will continue to ply, but with 50% capacity. Stringent rules have been imposed on inter-city and even inter-district travel. Private vehicles will be allowed at 50% capacity within the city in case of emergency or for essential services. Inter-city or inter-district travel is allowed only for essential services, medical emergencies or attending events like a funeral. Violation of these rules will attract a penalty of Rs 10,000. Conditions have been laid down for inter-district and inter-city travel in private buses as well as long distance trains and public transport buses. The private bus operator should limit stops to a maximum of two in a city and the schedule should be made available to the local disaster management authority. All passengers alighting from trains, public buses and private buses should be stamped for 14-day home quarantine by the operator or local body staff. Local authorities may conduct antigen tests of passengers and may ask the passenger to foot the bill. Depending on local conditions, the state has given local bodies the freedom to decide on doing away with the home quarantine stamping rule for passengers arriving from certain origins. “The idea is to deter people from stepping out and travelling unnecessarily. We have not shut down private and public transport completely to avoid panic,” an official said. Weddings have been restricted to just one ceremony to be completed within two hours at a hall with not more than 25 people in attendance. The penalty for violations has been increased from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000. All ground-level staff engaged in delivery of essential items should be minimised, but may continue at 100% capacity if required. These new rules came a day after the cabinet had demanded a strict lockdown in the state to control the Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/stringent-curbs-put-on-travel-within-maharashtra-weddings-pruned/articleshow/82189421.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Aurangabad||Latur facing remdesivir shortageamid plaints of black marketing||Aurangabad: Latur is among many districts in the state which is facing an acute shortage of remdesivir, as complaints have been pouring in about its unavailability and the drug being sold in the black market at exorbitant prices. As per official data, the district administration could supply only 490 remdesivir injections against 953 patients, who are either on a ventilator or in ICUs across 62 private hospitals in Latur district. Another 1,883 patients who are in hospital, including those on oxygen support, are not considered for remdesivir as of now due to the huge mismatch between demand and supply of the drug. An IT professional, who is currently staying at Latur, said he purchased two vials of remdesivir at Rs Rs 40,000 for his uncle, who had tested positive.“The ratio between demand and supply of remdesivir injection has become so skewed in Latur that we are feeling utterly helpless. The availability of the drug in the black market is more frustrating, which nobody can digest, ” said the 38-year-old requesting anonymity. Latur district, which has reported 988 Covid deaths since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, has 16,200 active patients, including 1,468, who are on oxygen support, as per the official data. When contacted, Latur district collector Prithviraj B P admitted that the district was facing a shortage of remdesivir injections. “We have set up a central system to channelise whatever stock of remdesivir injections we get on a routine basis for further distribution to hospitals. Also, the use of anti-viral drugs is found much more rampant than anticipated, leading to overhyped demand,” he said. Speaking on black marketing or over-pricing issues, the collector said citizens should make a written complaint against this. “We promise stringent action against anyone found indulging in unethical practices involving sale or distribution of remdesivir injections,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/latur-facing-remdesivir-shortageamid-plaints-of-black-marketing/articleshow/82184951.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Hyderabad||‘Happy hypoxia’ among youngsters new threat||HYDERABAD: While an increasing number of youngsters are being admitted in hospitals with moderate to severe symptoms of Covid-19 during the current wave, doctors sounded an alert about ‘happy hypoxia’ among youngsters. Happy hypoxia refers to the condition where the patient has low oxygen saturation, but does not feel any symptoms of low saturation. As a result, they do not get alarmed until the disease has progressed and there is severe damage to the lungs. “Younger patients often experience ‘happy hypoxia’ in which they do not feel any breathlessness or related symptoms till oxygen saturation levels fall below 80. Usually symptoms like breathlessness and discomfort in the chest are experienced when oxygen levels fall below 90 saturation. But in cases of happy hypoxia patients get alarmed late. We are getting a lot of cases of youngsters coming with happy hypoxia. They suddenly deteriorate and often there is little time for treatment,” said Dr Rahul Agarwal, consultant, internal medicine, Medicover Hospitals. Explaining, Dr Kiran Madala, in-charge, head of department of critical care, Nizamabad Medical College, said, “The phenomenon is particularly seen in younger people because their immunity is high, because of which they can withstand some amount of hypoxia. They are comfortable even at 81 saturation level, whereas in older people symptoms appear at 92 saturation too. This is a reason for late admissions.” Madala added that young adults are also exposed to the virus more, as they are economically active. “All of these factor add to the risk of severe infection among younger patients. However, the most vulnerable continue to be the elderly and immunocompromised people,” he said. The fact that more younger patients are getting affected and seek medical help late also means more deaths among youngsters. Doctors are now suggesting for ‘alerts on symptoms’ at various stages of the disease. “Covid can be mild in 85%, moderate in 15% and 2% cases can be fatal. Alert signs are needed for the patients going from mild to moderate to critical. The government should form a scientific committee of doctors from govt and private hospitals to issue detailed daily alerts of symptoms to look out for to the public. There are newer symptoms like rash, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, joint pains, but these are not mentioned in state or central protocol for RT-PCR testing. Further, many cases RT-PCR results are coming negative due to mutant variant. Including these alerts in daily medical bulletin can cut down cases of sudden deterioration and deaths,” said Dr M Karuna, a paediatrician treating Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/happy-hypoxia-among-youngsters-new-threat/articleshow/82186705.cms||Amrita Didyala

Some youths have started Facebook and WhatsApp groups where one can send requests for necessities while hotels are offering to deliver home-cooked meals to doorsteps of infected families. Members of one such group in Doon called “Mahakal ke Deewane” say they have are helping people get oxygen cylinders as well as blood plasma. “We created this group last year but back then, the focus mainly was on providing food to migrants and sanitising some spots. However, this year, the pandemic seems to be more deadly and most of the requests have been for plasma and oxygen. After we receive alerts on social media groups, we coordinate with hospital authorities, private labs and government offices to arrange the supply,” said Roshan Rana, a member of the group. Rana added that his group had organised five blood donation camps till now and collected plasma from over 80 people. Meanwhile, Doon-based hotel Four Points by Sheraton has been delivering free home-cooked meals to Covid-19 patients. Neeraj Bajpai, the general manager of the hotel, told TOI they had delivered 130 meals in the last 36 hours. “To avail of the service, a copy of the Covid report has to be sent to us. We have received several requests from families where the parents have tested positive (for Covid-19), have children at home and are unable to cook,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/as-cases-grow-good-samaritans-chip-in-with-oxygen-plasma-food/articleshow/82184992.cms||Prashant Jha

Shelke, a Neral resident, said that he was not sure of the amount promised by way of reward. “But I’ve learnt that the economic condition of the boy’s family is not good,” he told TOI on Wednesday. The same day, he said he was buoyed over a phone call he had received from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray praise for saving the life of a child, praising him for his daredevilry and selflessness. Shelke, a graduate, whose job is to check railway signals along tracks, had rescued the 6-year-old boy fallen on the tracks even as a train was trundling along the same track, towards the boy. His mother, who is visually challenged, stood on the platform, screaming out for help. Shelke rushed towards the boy and pulled him out of harm’s way in the nick of time. While railway minister Piyush Goyal had declared a reward of Rs 50,000 for Shelke, Asian Institute of Transport Development also announced a reward of Rs 50,000. “Whatever the amount that comes my way, I have decided to utilise 50% of it the boy’s education.” Sources said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his 45-second telephonic conversation with Shelketold him that he had watched the video of the act showing Shelke risking his life to save the little boy’s. “The chief minister said he could not express his feelings in words,” said a source. “But he told Shelke that he had earned the blessings of a mother by saving the life of her child...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rly-saviour-will-give-50-reward-for-boys-studies/articleshow/82187900.cms||Manthan K Mehta
---||Delhi||Beg, borrow or steal, but provide oxygen: Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court slammed the central government on Wednesday over its handling of the medical-use oxygen crisis and directed it to ensure the supply of the gas to all hospitals in the city. While informing the court that it had allocated 480 metric tonnes of oxygen for Delhi to help hospitals left with a few hours’ stock of the gas, the Centre also assured of police protection to oxygen tankers bringing the precious cargo to Delhi. The court conducted an extraordinary hearing at 8pm on a distress plea made by Max Group of Hospitals, stating that if the supply of oxygen was not replenished immediately, the lives of the patients who were critical and on oxygen support would be endangered. “An emergency of such a nature. That means human lives don’t matter for the government,” an angry bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said. While the hearing continued late into the night, supplier Inox managed to replenish the depleted stocks at Max’s Patparganj and Shalimar Bagh hospitals. The court told the Centre, “We cannot let people die due to lack of oxygen...you beg, borrow or steal but provide oxygen. You can’t claim this is all we have and can’t give more, let the people die.” It continued, “Why is the Centre not waking up to the gravity of the situation? We are shocked and dismayed that hospitals are running out of oxygen but steel plants are still operating.” The high court pointed out that “the heavens are not going to fall if the industries, including steel and petroleum, run on lower capacity till oxygen is imported”. Instead, all hell will break loose with the stoppage of medical oxygen for hospitals, it said. The court was clear that the responsibility of ensuring oxygen supply lay squarely on the central government and if necessary, the entire supply of oxygen to industries should be diverted for medical usage. “The steel and petrochemical industries are oxygen guzzlers and diverting oxygen from there can meet the requirement of hospitals,” the bench said. In its strong observations, the court noted, “If Tatas can divert oxygen they are generating for their steel plants to medical use, why can’t others? This is the height of greed. Is there no sense of humanity left?” It said the Centre should consider ways and means to transport oxygen to hospitals, either by creating a dedicated corridor or airlifting the gas. The bench said, “We are constrained to direct the Centre to forthwith implement this order and take over supply of oxygen from steel plants and, if necessary, also from the petroleum plants to supply it to hospitals.” It added that such industries would have to stop their productions till the situation in hospitals improved. It directed them to increase the oxygen generated by them and give it to the Centre for onward supply to the states for medical use. On the request of additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma, the high court agreed to continue the hearing again at 9.20pm. The bench then reiterated, “Our concern is not just for Delhi, we want to know what the central government is doing with regard to oxygen supply across India... If this is the situation in Delhi, we are sure it is the same in other states.” The court then adjourned the case for Thursday after the Centre informed the bench that it had allocated 480 metric tonnes of oxygen to Delhi, and some of the Max hospitals had reported receiving new stocks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-beg-borrow-or-steal-but-provide-o2/articleshow/82187816.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Pune||Oxygen deficit adds up to big hospitals' woes||Pune: The city's healthcare infrastructure has come under unprecedented stress after small Covid-19 hospitals, mainly working on the fringes, have started shifting their admitted patients and referring others to big health hubs for want of uninterrupted supply of liquid medical oxygen. The situation arose after the daily requirement of the district's Covid health units has shot up to 386 metric tonnes as against the capacity of 350 tonnes. Physician Aniket Joshi, who is attached with 10 small and medium-sized Covid-109 hospitals in the city, said, "Small and medium-sized hospitals are primarily dependent on the supply of jumbo cylinders from distributors on a regular basis. In the current situation, they are finding it extremely difficult to admit new patients needing oxygen support. Most of them have stopped new admissions and started referring such patients to big hospitals with oxygen plants on-premises." “I had to shift 15 patients, including 10 who were on ventilator support, to Columbia Asia hospital and Pune Municipal Corporation's Jumbo facility on Tuesday. I swung into action after my jumbo cylinder distributor informed me early in the day that he would be able to give just 30 cylinders as against my need of 70,” said senior surgeon Shrihari Dhorepatil, owner and medical director of the Shree hospital, a 60-bed Covid facility, in Kharadi.” “The authorities facilitated shifting some of our ICU patients to the Jumbo facility. They also made provision of jumbo cylinders for remaining patients. I approached them as I realized that borrowing cylinders from known sources alone won’t help the patients,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/oxygen-deficit-adds-up-to-big-hospitals-woes/articleshow/82186795.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Though the standard treatment of providing oxygen and prone position therapies still continue and is unrelated to the drug supply, there is no other option other than some strong steroids which may or may not be effective. These are re-purpose drugs, mainly meant for rheumatic arthritis. According to the sources, the PGI authorities had apprised the suppliers a month ago of some of the drugs which are yet to be provided. Sources said city hospitals, including PGI and GMCH-32, have some 400 Remdesivir injections while Tocilizumab will be available only after April 25. “Tocilizumab is an investigational drug which is still not proven, but people are using it as a compassionate medicine. But it has to be used under proper supervision after excusing contraindication, as it can be harmful leading to complications,” said Prof G D Puri, dean academics and head of the department of anaesthesia and intensive care at PGI. Doctors at the PGI feel that some of private doctors are prescribing Remdesivir indiscriminately and people out of fear are hoarding oxygen cylinders and Remdesivir at home, when it is for hospital stay only. People are getting Tocilizumab from Jalandhar and other districts of Punjab with great difficulty.  “It will be imported soon. Once it arrives in India on April 25, the city will receive its consignment,” said BJP’s medical cell convener, Prince Bhadula. Presently, there are some patients who are in dire need of the drug, but it is not available anywhere in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-life-saving-drugs-worry-pgi-docs/articleshow/82185883.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Besides the salary issues, a section of teachers willing to do partial withdrawal of their provident fund (PF) said they were unable to complete the necessary formalities. Kailas Gaikwad, the Aurangabad district secretary of Association of Primary Teachers, said the salary release for March could take at least eight to 10 days as informed by the government authorities. “We were told that salaries for March will be delayed due to database related issues associated with the end of the financial year 2020-21. Such inordinate delay in the release of salary for the second consecutive month has affected the teachers and their families in a very bad way,” he said. As regards to the partial withdrawal of PF, affected teachers said they cannot use their own hard-earned money during the time of crisis. “The applications for PF withdrawal have been pending for the last three months. The authorities have told the affected teachers that technical issues related to the central server were responsible for the delay, which is beyond comprehension,” Gaikwad said. When contacted, local education department authorities refused to comment maintaining that the issues come under the purview of the state-level authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/salary-delays-pf-withdrawal-issues-hit-teachers/articleshow/82185004.cms||---

While ICMR did not reveal any data pertaining to the study, it said that ICMR-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) was recently successful in isolating and culturing the double mutant strain B.1.617 SARS-CoV-2 and Covaxin was found to effectively neutralise the double mutant strain as well. The ICMR tweet came a day after, Bharat Biotech’s chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella said that data on efficacy of vaccine against new double mutant was expected to be available next week. In its tweet the apex biomedical research body also said that ICMR-NIV had successfully isolated and cultured multiple variants of concern like the UK variant B.1.1.7, Brazil variant B.1.1.28 as well as B.1.351 the South African variant and demonstrated the neutralisation potential of Covaxin against UK variant and Brazil variant. Experts said in neutralising antibody study, sera drawn from vaccine recipients (in this case Covaxin) is added to the virus strains cultured in the lab and if it is successful in countering the virus, the vaccine is considered to be successful in producing antibodies that can neutralise the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-can-neutralise-double-mutant/articleshow/82186708.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Nagpur||1.24Lakh active cases projected for district by May 2||NAGPUR: Covid-19 active positive cases are likely to surge to a new high of 1,23,680 in next 11 days in Nagpur district as per the state government’s projection. The government has calculated district will be short of 45,305 beds as per projected cases and directed the authorities to ramp up the infrastructure. Active cases were 71,557 in the district on Wednesday. It means an increase of 52,123 by May 2 as per the projection. It also means the current surge continuing. The district is already having a severe shortage of oxygen beds. Situation of beds in ICU and with ventilators is even worse. As per government’s projection, the district will be short of 10,476 beds with oxygen, 1,945 ICU beds and 520 beds with ventilators. Remaining shortage of 32,364 beds is in isolation facilities or Covid Care Centres (CCCs). Since beginning of second wave, less than 1% of active patients have been in CCCs. The government had time and again directed the authorities to ensure 40% of patients are kept in CCCs for containing the spread and preventing deaths. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), district administration and Zilla Parishad (ZP) failed to comply with the directives saying patients were not ready to move into CCCs. As against norm of having no more than 20% active patients in home isolation, the district has around 80%. Guardian minister Nitin Raut told TOI, “We are making all efforts to increase the beds with oxygen supply. Two Jumbo Covid Hospitals with 1,600 beds and new Covid Hospitals are proposed.” Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “Access to medical care is very necessary to control deaths. District should have been equipped with necessary number of beds by now as the second wave has lasted 12 weeks in other countries. We are witnessing second wave for last nine weeks and it is likely to go on until end of May. Vaccination and full lockdown are not likely to work as district is facing community spread. Need is to develop makeshift facilities where people can get oxygen, CT scan, diagnosis and treatment on time.” Except Amravati, all districts of Vidarbha are likely to face severe shortage of beds as per projected active cases. Active cases in the district on April 19 (76,961) were 354% more than highest number in first wave (21,746). Among 35 districts in the state, Nagpur is at fourth place after Pune, Mumbai and Thane. Two districts of Vidarbha- Bhandara and Chandrapur— are on top as far as weekly growth rate of the cases is concerned. Weekly growth rate of Bhandara is 3.63% and Chandrapur’s 3.48%. For Nagpur it is 2.24%, probably due to high number of cases in last month. Except Yavatmal, Akola and Amravati, all districts of Vidarbha are in the red category in weekly growth rate. Nagpur district (3,22,091) is second after Mumbai (4,11,998) in testing per million population. Bhandara (2,02,934) is fifth and Wardha (1,86,022) sixth. Remaining eight districts are in the red category due to less testing. Three Vidarbha districts Nagpur (35.02%), Gadchiroli (34.3%) and Gondia (33.23%) are in red category as far as weekly test positivity rate is concerned.

---||Hyderabad||Andhra Pradesh Lokayukta cracks whip on coop bank loan mafia||HYDERABAD: Shocked at the impunity of loan sharks by walking away free after swallowing crores of rupees of farmers’ money, Andhra Pradesh Lokayukta Justice P Lakshman Reddy ordered a crackdown on loan mafia operating in cooperative banks all over the state. The Lokayukta asked the chief secretary to collect reports from district collectors as well as bankers, collate them and furnish them to the Lokayukta court to understand the magnitude of the scam. The enormity of cooperative loan scam has already crossed Rs 2,000 crore in states like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh and police are investigating a similar scam in Telangana’s Peddapalli. The collectors, upon instructions from the Lokayukta, unearthed how Rs 30 crore was swallowed by perpetrators of loan fraud in Guntur and East Godavari districts recently. The Guntur district collector, in his report, recommended criminal action against 30 individuals who took loans with fake passbooks and also 10 revenue officials for conniving with the accused. Asking the officials to devise ways to plug loopholes in the way the loans are extended, Justice Lakshmana Reddy said: “There is a need to bring in a foolproof mechanism to ensure that money meant for farmers does not slip into wrong hands.” While the Lokayukta is looking at finding a lasting solution to put an end to fake loan menace, bankers are saying that they do not have the necessary wherewithal to verify whether a particular passbook is genuine or fake. On the other hand, revenue officials are saying how will they know if someone chooses to go to a bank with fake title deeds and avail loans. The Lokayukta is also planning to ask the state government to act fast against the scamsters. The modus operandi is simple. Middlemen enter as farmers and take huge farm loans from the cooperative banks. In some instances, farmers are not even aware of the loans taken n their names. In some cases, the loans are raised by mortgaging land plots that had never existed in the first place. What is intriguing is the fact that pattadar passbooks which are shown as proof for taking the farm loans turn out be fake ones created exclusively for the purpose of generating these loans. Officials said AP is in the forefront of distributing monetary benefits to the farmers directly and existence of bogus pattadar passbooks could defeat the very objective of such schemes. In Telangana, farmers are also facing glitches in uploading their passbook details on Dharani portal as they are being shown as defaulters of loans that they have never taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ap-lokayukta-cracks-whip-on-coop-bank-loan-mafia/articleshow/82186711.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Ahmedabad||At Civil, treatment begins right from queue||Ahmedabad: The Civil Hospital from Wednesday started treating patients right from the time the joined the queue for admission at the MediCity hospital. Termed ‘Treatment on Wheels,’ the initiative has a team of doctors who assess the patient’s vitals and administer oxygen to antibiotics right on the spot. Officials close to the development said that the initiative is aimed at reducing the treatment time and providing much-needed life support to critical patients before they could be assessed and allocated beds. Nursing, paramedical and medical staff is deployed outside the hospital, said officials. Dr Yogesh Mori, member of Junior Doctor Association, said that majority of the patients arrive with oxygen requirement. “They are provided oxygen support through cylinders if they are not on oxygen in the ambulance already. They are also provided other medication if required,” he said. Daily, over 30-40 ambulances queue up outside the 1,200-bed hospital where doctors in triage assess the severity and allocate the patients oxygen, BiPAP or ventilator beds. “Our efforts are aimed at reducing the waiting period for patients,” said Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital. Sources close to the development said that patients often spend over two-three hours in queue. Some had also turned critical by the time they reached the triage. The current effort may stabilize such patients, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/at-civil-treatment-begins-right-from-queue/articleshow/82186728.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hospitals give vax priority to those who take first dose with them, residents in fix||Hyderabad: While there is no rule that a person has to take both doses of Covid-19 vaccine from the same hospital, many centres in the city are said to be administering the second dose to only those who received the first dose from them. “My wife and I are both senior citizens and took the first dose of Covishield in March. As we have completed over 40 days of taking the vaccine, we wanted to get the second dose, but the hospital from where we took the first dose did not have the vaccine available. We tried in other hospitals, but they said that vaccine will be administered only if we have taken the first dose from them,” said JS Sharma, a retired employee. A Srinivas (49) faced the same situation as he too could not get the second dose of vaccine despite making multiple attempts. “Looks like the hospitals are making their own rules. Why are they not giving the second dose of vaccine to those who did not take the first dose from them? What are we supposed to do when the hospital where we took the first dose ran out of vaccines,” he questioned. While residents assumed hospitals would have enough stock to administer a second dose, that has not been the case for many. Now, they say that they are scared they might not get access to the second dose on time making the entire process futile. “We had taken our first dose from a private hospital in Secunderabad. When we tried to book an appointment for the second dose a couple of days ago, they told us that there is a shortage of vaccines. We tried at least four hospitals, but they said that priority is being given those who got the first dose at their hospitals,” said a 64-year-old retired employee. He said that both his wife and he were worried that the vaccine won’t be effective if they failed to get one soon. Doctors, meanwhile, said that people need not panic if there is a slight delay in getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. “There won’t be any change in the efficacy of vaccine if the second dose is delayed by few days,” said Mahaboob Khan, superintendent, Government General and Chest Hospital, adding that the second dose of Covaxin should be taken after four weeks, and for Covishield there is more time as second does can be taken between six and eight weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hospitals-give-vax-priority-to-those-who-take-first-dose-with-them-residents-in-fix/articleshow/82186718.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Delhi||Delhi: Several hospitals send out SOS as oxygen supply yet to reach them||NEW DELHI: Even though the central government announced the enhancement of Delhi’s oxygen quota, the actual supply of medical oxygen on Wednesday was much lower, leading to a rush of distress messages from Covid-designated hospitals in the city. Claiming availability of only a few hours of the gas for oxygen-dependent Covid patients, hospitals approached the courts while some put out SOS messages. Max Healthcare, which is treating 1,400 patients in its NCR hospitals, reported oxygen shortage across the units. “For the last few days, the hospital has been facing serious difficulties in procuring adequate and regular supplies of oxygen. Various branches in the network had 2-18 hours of oxygen left at 6pm on Wednesday, with Max in Shalimar Bagh and Patparganj barely left with 2-3 hours of stock,” said an official of Max Healthcare. The two hospitals received their supply later at night. At Sir Gangaram Hospital, the alarm bells went off when the oxygen stock plummeted to five hours’ worth on Wednesday. While a private supplier delivered 45 cylinders, each of 7,000 litres oxygen, the anxiety wasn’t over. A hospital official said the gas supply crisis was an everyday happening. “While the hospital received around 10,000 cubic metres of oxygen, the demand is over 11,000 cubic metres, the official said. “We have calculated that the current reserve will last for another 12 hours and we will require a refill before 9am on Thursday.” Hospital sources said that they have received assurance from the government, while private vendor, Indian Oxygen Limited, has promised refills. Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals too was in dire straits. P Shivakumar, managing director, said in a statement that the hospital had been receiving many queries about the availability of medical oxygen supply for patients. “In this regard the hospital would like to highlight that it currently has only 10-12 hours of oxygen supply available for all its patients with no alternatives. This level is dangerously low with supply chain disruptions and delays being witnessed over the past week,” Shivakumar said. The hospital strongly urged the various state governments and the Centre to assist the medical facilities in getting uninterrupted supply of the gas “to avert any catastrophic patient-related incidents”. Some institutions have alleged that though private sellers are keen on restoring supplies, neighbouring states are creating obstructions. An official from Manipal Hospital, where 230 Covid patients are receiving treatment and which claimed just 12 hours of stocks left, alleged that Haryana officials took control of the private oxygen company that supplied to the Dwarka hospital and were not allowing replenishment. Anil Vinayak, COO, Fortis Healthcare, pointed out that in terms of oxygen and bed availability, different parts of the country were in different stages of the curve. Delhi was suffering the maximum stress right now, he said. “Mumbai peaked about three weeks ago. Bengaluru and Kolkata show signs of reaching a similar stage as Delhi in some time,” Vinayak said, adding that the high absolute numbers and relatively more serious patients coming to hospitals, most requiring oxygen support, made Delhi’s current burden more stressful. Smaller hospitals and nursing homes handling Covid patients also sent SOS messages. Dr Pankaj Solanki, who runs a private hospital in Rohini, expressed the anguish of hospitals which are now also being forced to deal with the oxygen crisis while managing an unprecedented health crisis. “I have never felt so disappointed. The oxygen crisis is worse than anything we have faced and it is adding to the mental pressure on functioning. No one is able to help and at least 100 calls are made daily for oxygen,” he tweeted. Around 8pm, Rathi Hospital in Najafgarh, which has 78 Covid patients, put out a statement saying that the hospital was left with no oxygen supply. “We have 78 patients, and no helpline number is taking our calls. They are, in fact, ignoring and cutting our calls,” the hospital statement said. While the increased quota of oxygen from sources in West Bengal and Orissa will take another 72 hours to arrive in Delhi, the city is gasping.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/several-hospitals-send-out-sos-as-oxygen-supply-yet-to-reach-them/articleshow/82187859.cms||---
---||Pune||Oxygen supply depletes, hospital owners seek police protection||Pune: The Pimpri Chinchwad Hospital Owners’ Association has sought police protection fearing backlash from the relatives of Covid-19 patients, if the supply of oxygen gets exhausted. Association members said many small private hospitals had a close call on Tuesday night when they were left with just a few hours of oxygen supply left, and the situation did not improve even on Wednesday. “We have contacted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) for oxygen supply. But the situation has so not improved. We are taking follow-up from every hospital that is treating Covid-19 patients. In the PCMC limits, there are over 80 private hospitals that are treating Covid patients,” said Dr Pramod Kubade, secretary, Pimpri Chinchwad Hospital Owners’ Association. Additional commissioner of police (Pimpri Chinchwad) Ramnath Pokale said, “Our teams have been visiting the hospitals since Tuesday afternoon and taking information. We have also told our night duty officers to visit the hospitals. We are monotoring the situation and bandobast will be made if needed.” Municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil admitted that the oxygen supply has been an issue and the civic administration was working closely with the FDA, Pune divisional commissioner and the state authorities to improve the supply. On Wednesday, the civic body formed an oxygen monitoring team and said in a statement that there was no casualty due to the unavailability of the gas. The PCMC stated that it received 22 tonnes of oxygen in the early hours of Wednesday. Officials at the Annasaheb Magar stadium jumbo hospital said they too were a worried lot due to the oxygen supply issue. “We have over 700 patients, who are on direct oxygen supply. The supply needs to be streamlined,” said an official. BJP leader of house in PCMC Namdev Dhake said, “We met the divisional commissioner and urged him to ensure seamless oxygen supply in the twin towns.” (With inputs from Mihir Tanksale)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/oxygen-supply-depletes-hospital-owners-seek-police-protection/articleshow/82186738.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Delhi||Bed, oxygen shortage hit Delhi hard; 249 die due to Covid in 24 hours||NEW DELHI: Acute shortage of critical care facilities continues in Delhi. As of 11pm on Wednesday, there were only five ventilator beds available for Covid-19 patients across the capital — three at AIIMS Trauma Centre and two at Lady Hardinge Medical College. The number of vacant Covid ICU beds without a ventilator beds stood at 11, all of them at a private hospital for children. General beds were available in several government and private facilities, but people continued to face problems getting their family members admitted. Meanwhile, the city reported 24,368 fresh cases of Covid-19 and 249 deaths due to the disease. The fresh cases, which were significantly lower than Tuesday’s 28,395, were reported from 78,768 tests. Of the total tests, only 45,088 were RT-PCR tests. The positivity rate was still 31.28%, which is very high. In the last few days, RT-PCR testing has reduced significantly. Due to this, doctors say, many positive cases may be missed. Delhi conducted 73,915 RT-PCR tests on April 14, 59,401 on April 15, 64,939 on April 16, 69,206 on April 17, 56,015 on April 18, 68,778 on April 19, 56,274 on April 20 and 45,088 on April 21. The death toll may go up further in the coming days if the issue of shortage of ICU beds isn’t tackled effectively. “All ICU beds are occupied in the hospital. Above that, there are patients waiting outside in ambulances for admission,” said a senior doctor at one of the top private hospitals. “We have over 300 patients on oxygen support. They cannot survive long without the critical support. Any delay in supply puts their life at risk and we are also terrified about it. The government must do something about it soon,” the doctor added. “We have oxygen available only till about 1 am. But the supplier is saying the delivery may take longer. How are we going to manage the Covid-19 patients like this,” said a doctor at a private hospital in south Delhi, where nearly 200 patients are admitted requiring oxygen and ventilator support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bed-oxygen-shortage-hit-delhi-hard-249-die-due-to-covid-in-24-hrs/articleshow/82187886.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Away from family in Singapore, she had to turn to those giving psychological first aid to cope with her loss. That is when she realised how important it was to have someone to share your emotions with. TimesviewThe coronavirus outbreak has impacted the mental health of millions globally. Many are suffering from bouts of anxiety or periods of depression. It is good news that both experts and volunteers are using social media and other forums to help those in need. Authorities too must see where they can value-add to such public-spirited efforts.In the past few days, she has seen many deaths and has been talking and providing counsel to citizens, being a professional in the field. “My mother and brother were infected last year and felt helpless since I wasn’t with them. Then in the current wave, I lost my aunt, who I considered one of the strongest women around,” recalled Khare, founder-director, Sanrakshan Pte Ltd, Singapore. “I had to approach my fellow psychological first aiders and asked them to help me manage my emotions. I am trained to provide psychological first aid, so am doing what I can to ease the pain of Delhiites even from this distance.” Human Kind Global, a voluntary citizens’ initiative, too has begun its “Be a buddy volunteer” platform with a similar objective. The project’s Mahika Nagraj said, “We are not professionals. It’s about somebody needing a shoulder to lean on and another one providing that shoulder. It is largely collaborative and is helping a lot of people.” Human Global has launched a helpline plus a Google sheet on which individuals can share their details. “A lot of the people have reached out to us saying that the entire family has tested positive for Covid. So, they want to talk to people who have gone through the same ordeal,” said Nagraj. “There are others who are lonely while in isolation so just being able to converse peps them up.” Ankit Gupta has been helping those in need connect with the professionals. “We mostly assist people who cannot afford to pay for professional help and have been able to arrange such sessions for over 300 people,” added the 28-year-old. Khare receives queries on subjects ranging from panic and confusion to fear, anxiousness, helplessness, burnout and paranoia. “Most questions are from the caregivers, and they often want someone to understand their situation,” Khare said. “Many respondents are exhausted and burned out. Most are anxiety-ridden about providing their loved ones with proper care and often express their frustration and helplessness.” Khare also said there were cases of husbands and wives being separated and unable to see each other for long periods, while students are uncertain about attaining their dreams and goals. “Another set of queries are from people who have migrated to different countries and have elderly, ailing parents in India. Also, those who migrated from India just before the pandemic and now are stuck alone in another country,” said Khare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bogged-down-by-pandemic-buddies-out-there-to-help/articleshow/82187892.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Hyderabad||Experts warn against steroid abuse in Covid-19 patients||HYDERABAD: Pulmonologists have warned against the abuse of steroids in the first week of treatment of Covid-19 infected patients. They say steroids should be used only after the first week, that too if oxygen saturation levels fall. If used immediately, steroids lead to the suppression of immunity, experts say. Associated illness like fungal, bacterial infections and Mucormycosis have also been observed. Dr Vishwanath Gella, consultant clinical and interventional pulmonologist, AIG Hospitals, said, “Within the first week to 10 days of the virus attacking the human body, the innate immune mechanism acts and fights the virus to decrease the viral load. Steroids should be given only if C Reactive Protein levels increase above 50 to 60 or oxygen levels fall.” Agreeing, Dr Dinesh Kumar Chirla, director, intensive care services, Rainbow Children's Group of Hospitals, said, “Steroids should be strictly avoided in asymptomatic patients, patients with mild symptoms of less than a week, patients with a CT score of less than eight with disease duration less than five to seven days, and those in the viremia phase (high fever with normal CRP and CT).” He recommended use in moderate and severe cases where patients with oxygen saturation of less than 94. In the UK, some of the largest recovery trials have shown steroids decreased mortality. For instance, Dexamethasone use has benefited patients on a ventilator more than oxygen. “Steroids are being used as prophylactic, from day one of admission, in some cases. This is resulting in patients developing respiratory issues which forces them to go for assisted ventilation,” said Gella. He added, “Use of steroids at the right time is important. Steroid use can cause increase in sugar levels and an increase in acid content. There are more than 20 complications, including tuberculosis and avascular necrosis of bones that can occur. In one case, we removed the eye of a woman after she developed a serious case of mucormycosis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/experts-warn-against-steroid-abuse-in-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82186731.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Tiwari received a tip off that a website called ‘Patanjali’ reportedly “assured” Covid-19 patients to provide beds in hospitals close to their residence. An advertisement on the website mentioned that it will charge Rs2,000 per day for providing bed and asked interested people to deposit a minimum Rs30,000 towards 15 days of ‘hospitalization’. The mayor contacted the website and sought details over WhatsApp. Mayor too shared the details and sought a bed near his house in central Nagpur. Despite Daga Hospital being a non-Covid facility, the website informed Tiwari about availability of beds there. It also sought Rs30,000 from him. When the mayor pointed out that Daga Hospital is a non-Covid one, the impersonator suggested another non-Covid hospital. Later, the mayor through another person submitted a requisition for a hospital bed with Remdesivir vials. Soon, the person received a call from an unidentified number asking him to deposit Rs90,000 in a bank account. The mayor then realized that unidentified impersonators were duping gullible citizens and subsequently issued orders for stern action against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mayor-busts-fake-website-offering-beds-to-covid-patients/articleshow/82186724.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

I rushed to the doctors and nurses, but they were busy attending to other patients. I was helpless. When I returned to my grandmother’s bedside moments later, I found her motionless,” he said, adding that oxygen supply at the hospital had been problematic for quite some time. Several distraught relatives, who could only watch as their loved ones died after struggling to breathe following the oxygen tank leak at the hospital on Wednesday, vented their anger at the doctors and nurses. Patients’ relatives are usually not allowed inside the Covid hospital. However, during the commotion following the leak, many relatives entered the wards. A desperate scramble began for oxygen cylinders as soon as the leak started. According to eyewitness accounts, doctors and nurses were running from patient to patient to save as many as they could. “We immediately shifted five patients to other city hospitals. We also managed to bring in some oxygen cylinders from outside locations and kept up supply to patients till lines from the tank were restored,” Manoj Kankriya, the hospital's medical officer, said. Relatives of patients described chaotic scenes. Many were seen bringing in oxygen cylinders on scooters. A woman who lost her 23-year-old son squarely blamed the hospital doctors and staff. “I want my son back and I won’t spare the doctors. I will sue them all. I had not brought my son here to die. The doctors killed him,” she said, adding she had seen other patients too dying before her eyes due to lack of oxygen. The woman’s husband, Kirsing Mahale, who was also breathing laboriously, said their son’s name was Pravin and that they were residents of Shivajnagar, Satpur. Pravin had been admitted to the hospital about nine days ago. “He was doing well earlier in the day. There was no sign to suggest he could die a couple of hours later. My wife and other family members entered the ward during the confusion following the leak,” Mahale said. Parikshit Waliker, whose 44-year-old brother Pramod succumbed, said his sibling had been admitted around 12 days ago. “He was critical and was put on a ventilator, but his oxygen level had improved since. On Wednesday, doctors had expressed satisfaction over his condition. They had told me he would be shifted to the general ward and would get discharged in the next 2-3 days,” he said. “I was happy. But all of a sudden, tragedy struck. I was on the hospital premises when the incident occurred. I lost my brother due to the negligence of the hospital management,” he said. Waiker’s mother too was admitted to hospital and was on oxygen last week. She was shifted to the general ward on Tuesday. Santosh Wagh, whose 46-year-old sister was on ventilator, said she had been admitted four days ago. “Her health was improving. On Wednesday morning, her oxygen level was at 92 and she was showing signs of recovery. This incident took her life,” said Wagh, who was not at his sister’s side when the incident took place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-kin-watched-helplessly-as-nashik-horror-unfolded/articleshow/82187934.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Officials of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation said they also plan to use the KMC-owned ceremony houses depending on the bookings in the coming months However, private hospitals said their first priority was augmenting the capacity in-house by increasing the number of beds, adding medical staffers and increasing the supply of oxygen. Last month, the state had suggested private hospitals shift their OPD facilities to banquet halls, so entire hospitals could be dedicated to Covid patients. The authorities of several private hospitals TOI spoke to said they were in the process of augmenting in-house facilities for Covid patients. “It is a good idea, but, at present, our focus is on enhancing the capacity inside the hospital by adding beds, increasing supply of oxygen and adding manpower. If we set up OPDs in a third-party facility, we might struggle to provide manpower,” said a senior official of a private hospital. President of Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) Sudesh Poddar said the association is open to the idea of hotel banquets being used as OPDs. “We shall write to the state offering our banquets. We have organized over 500 rooms for satellite centres as well,” he said. The association has over 800 members in West Bengal and has 60,000 beds under its members. The owner of a private hotel in Chandni that has a banquet hall with a capacity of 150 people said, “This is an emergency situation and we are willing to help the government and hospitals in every way. Till now, nobody has approached us. But if it is needed, we will let them set up a facility in our banquet hall.”  “We are going to review the status of the bookings for our ceremony halls because there are weddings scheduled this season. If bookings get cancelled or there is a slot available, we can think of letting hospitals use the facilities,” said a KMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/banquet-halls-ready-for-opd-but-pvt-hosps-wait-watch/articleshow/82185893.cms||Saikat Ray

Let the doctors decide who should be given the injections, said AHNA president Bharat Gadhvi on Wednesday. “We have been treating Covid patients for past one year, and we have got adequate insight to make the judicious decision on whether the patient requires the drug,” said Dr Gadhvi, adding that the decision to discontinue remdesivir for home care patients would only burden already stressed hospitals. The issue, which was reportedly brushed under the carpet by AMC officials during their meeting with AHNA on Tuesday, escalated to the degree that AHNA secretary Viren Shah, who was entrusted with distribution of remdesivir to hospitals, tendered his resignation soon after the meet. AHNA was earlier entrusted with the task of distributing the injections, but AMC discontinued the supply after a few days. AHNA officials also raised the issue of oxygen supply. For a ward with 10 patients, it takes over two bottles of oxygen (1,000 MT cumulatively) right from the time they arrive in the medical setting. The exponential rise in cases has kept the hospitals constantly on tenterhooks,” said a hospital administrator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/let-docs-say-who-gets-remdesivir/articleshow/82186747.cms||---
---||Nagpur||All eyes on 'Indian Variant' in Vidarbha 'that led to 2nd wave'||NAGPUR: The second wave of Covid-19 is now well underway in almost all parts of the country. While it’s still to come ‘officially’ from Indian authorities, global attention is focusing on a new variant — B.1.617 — that appears significantly more infectious in India. There is a theory that this variant emerged in Amravati, and caused the huge surge in cases in nearby districts in February. International researchers believe that this variant is typically of Indian origin. As a result, researchers and media houses from across the globe are now focusing on Vidarbha; and some of them even visited Nagpur while tracing the new ‘Indian variant’. “It’s different than the UK, or Africa or Brazil variant, which have been discussed at the start of this wave,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, who has been receiving inquiries from many international researchers and journalists about the second wave in India. “Many countries have imposed travel ban to India. UK has added India into ‘red list’ of restricted destination. This is because specific variant of the virus – B.1.617 – is becoming increasingly common,” said Dr Shinde. He believes the Amravati surge was also due to this variant, though it needs to be confirmed with more research. As per the data shared by Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GSAID), B.1.617 was first found in samples collected in December 2020 in India. They have data of genome sequencing of Indian samples up to April 3, 2021. Until then, this variant was visible in 29% of the samples in India. According to doctors, it is responsible for the second wave and is now spreading across the country. GSAID is recognized for its importance to global health by G20 health ministers. In 2020, WHO called this data-science initiative ‘a game changer’ in Covid-19. Dr Atul Gawande, who hails from Umarkhed in Yavatmal district of Vidarbha, and is currently a member of Covid-19 control advisory team of US President Joe Biden, has also expressed his concerns about this variant while calling it as ‘extremely frightening’. “I am seeing this variant go through entire households of my family in India. Whether it is more lethal, and whether vaccines work well against it, remains unclear,” he said. As noted by Dr Gawande, it has been observed especially in Vidarbha that this variant is infecting entire families, unlike its predecessors in September 2020 wave. This means, the virus is significantly more infectious. But whether it is lethal or not is still to be studied. At present, the variant is “under investigation”. It is still not designated a ‘variant of concern’ but scientists have recognized it as ‘variant of interest’. According to an initial study by Virology researcher Grace Roberts from Queen’s University, Belfast, this variant is estimated to be around 20% more transmissible than the earlier form of the coronavirus circulating during the first wave. However, officials in the ministry of health said that the rise in cases is not linked to the variant, as B.1.617 hasn’t been detected in high enough quantities to determine whether it is directly responsible. However, experts think that this may be due to lack of data, and many have stressed the importance of increasing virus sequencing to get a better picture. The Indian Variant Covid-19 cases have risen sharply in India as new variant called B.1.617 has emerged B.1.617 is becoming increasingly common in India’s cases, detected in second wave Amravati, and West Vidarbha, followed by Nagpur are identified as epicentre of B.1.617 Due to this, global researchers have focused their attention on Vidarbha B.1.617 variant is more contagious, unlocks our cells, and skips pre-existing antibodies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/is-indian-covid-variant-behind-second-wave-that-started-from-vidarbha/articleshow/82187901.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Kolkata||Outpatient footfall dips by 15%-30% across city||Kolkata: Private Hospitals across the city have been witnessing a gradual decline in OPD footfall since the end of March. With an exponential rise in positive cases across the state — with Kolkata being the epicentre — the OPD footfall could see a further decline in the next two weeks. The dip, at present, is between 15% and 30%. “The number of patients turning up at the OPD has gone down by about 25%,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO, Peerless Hospital. At Medica Superspecialty Hospital, which has hiked up its Covid bed count to 211, there is a 20% drop in the number of patients coming to the OPD. “The decline in OPD footfall started towards the end of March. There has been dip of 10%-15% over the last three-four weeks at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east), Narayana Health. The fall has so far been gradual. But now, with the government asking hospitals to augment Covid beds, shift out OPDs to make place for Covid patients and defer elective surgeries, hospitals expect a massive drop in the number of non-Covid and non-emergency patients soon. “Now the fear of the raging infection rate seems to have affected the people. If this decline continues, we will be in a better position to earmark more beds for Covid care,” said an official of a hospital off EM Bypass. The daily case surge in the city crossed the 10,000 mark on Wednesday when 10,784 cases were reported across the state. Kolkata recorded the highest number of fresh cases at 2,568 with 13 deaths. “There is definitely a drop in non-Covid patient count. We currently have 110 Covid beds and hope to add 25 more soon,” said Richa Deb Gupta, senior vice-president, Fortis Hospital. AMRI group of hospitals started informing patients about deferring planned surgeries from Tuesday itself. A majority of the hospitals started cancelling elective surgeries from Wednesday, restricting the number to patients who had undergone certain investigative tests for the surgery. “We could start seeing sharper decline in the number of OPD and non-Covid patients from this weekend. We will, however, continue to see patients if they come to us with any problem,” said a CEO of a private hospital. Many doctors with single chambers, too, have started resorting to online consultations instead of making physical appointments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/outpatient-footfall-dips-by-15-30-across-city/articleshow/82185898.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Hyderabad||Hospitals tie up with Hyderabad hotels for quarantine facilities||HYDERABAD: With hospitals falling short of space, some have now tied up with city hotels to make quarantine facilities available for Covid patients — either asymptomatic or displaying mild symptoms. The move, they say, is intended at helping hospitals offload some of their burden and keep beds within their facilities available for critical patients or those who need oxygen, mechanical ventilator support or any other emergency medical intervention. “We have tied up with a city hotel where we have made 100 beds available for isolation for those who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms,” said Tejesvi Veerepalli, chief operating officer, Apollo Hospital, Jubilee Hills. While a few hotels have already started offering the service, some others are in the process of doing so. “We have tied up with a couple of hospitals so help people isolate themselves under medical supervision.  Last year too, we were among the first ones to support the government to convert our hotel into an isolation facility. The packages, number of beds and other details will be chalked out in the next few days,” said Pavan Kumar, general manager, Radisson Hotels. These isolation facilities are also emerging as an alternative for the hospitality industry to overcome the loss being suffered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hospitals-tie-up-with-hotels-for-quarantine-facilities/articleshow/82186749.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: At Shaheen Bagh, these good samaritans are welding link between O2 demand and supply||NEW DELHI: For almost three days, Sharib Hasan’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing. The reason: oxygen cylinders are available in southeast Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh and can also be refilled at a few places and Hasan is coordinating this with people from across Delhi. Several welding shops here use oxygen cylinders, usually sourced from outside Delhi. But with the surge in Covid-19, the area has become a hub for oxygen cylinder distribution and refilling to help patients and their desperate relatives. Most shop owners are getting hundreds of calls daily, but despite their best efforts are unable to help all. Hasan, who is a member of an NGO, said, “Many are coming for cylinders while some want a refill. We managed to get 200 cylinders from Mohan Industrial Estate on Tuesday night, but they were exhausted by Wednesday morning. We distributed the gas for free to individuals and private hospitals. Now we are refilling cylinders either without charge or accepting Rs 130 for a 15-litre cylinder and Rs 200 for a 30-litre one.” Many of those extending a helping hand are giving the gas for free or against a nominal fee. But many of them are also complaining that people have started hoarding cylinders at home, causing a price surge. “We are getting people from all over Delhi, many of whom have never been to Shaheen Bagh and have travelled long distances to get a gas cylinder,” said Waseem Malik. “We got some oxygen after much difficulty and have resumed distribution from Wednesday morning. These are 10-litre cylinders that have suddenly become expensive. Some suppliers are even asking for Rs 20,000 for a small cylinder that actually costs Rs 7,000.” Malik added that during the first lockdown, he gave the needy the whole kit — cylinder, mask and other items — for just Rs 6,500. Only refills are provided now. “We got the oxygen from a south Delhi plant, but it wasn’t sufficient as those in home quarantine also need it.” Archana Rao, who stays in Dwarka, reached Shaheen Bagh on Wednesday when a cylinder she had got in Moti Nagar on Tuesday got over. “It should have ideally lasted two days, but obviously wasn’t fully filled despite my paying Rs 12,000 for it,” said Rao. “My parents are Covid-positive and have comorbidities.” The freelance copywriter added, “Many volunteers and NGOs are helping people like us.” One such organisation is old Delhi-based Be Human. Mohammad Farman, its chairman, said he had received hundreds of calls because Delhiites know the locality has a large number of welding shops. “We are distributing them to everyone possible and also trying our best to get more oxygen. We charge Rs 50 to remunerate our volunteers,” Farman said. Many desperate people are paying over Rs 32,000 to buy an oxygen concentrator. “These are machines for home use and produce on-site oxygen,” explained Ashok Sharma at a medical equipment store. But even that’s not available. “We did not anticipate this demand for these machines that we usually import from the US and China,” Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-shaheen-bagh-these-good-samaritans-are-welding-link-between-o2-demand-and-supply/articleshow/82187905.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

As per the official data, Latur zone has reported 5 MSEDCL staff deaths, followed by the Aurangabad zone where three deaths took place. Two more deaths took place in the Nanded zone. Sunil Jadhav, the MSEDCL’s deputy chief public relations for Aurangabad division, on Wednesday said that the deceased employees of the state power utility include permanent as well as contract workers. “The MSEDCL employees and workers have been discharging their services all through the pandemic over the past year and 10 of them laid down their lives in line of duty due to Covid. A sizable number of staffers has defeated Covid-19 after contracting the infection, whereas many employees and workers are currently active patients,” he said. The MSEDCL has already initiated the formalities of offering ex gratia to eligible workforce who have succumbed to the infection. Jadhav said the workforce of the state power utility falls in the frontline worker category and are undergoing mass immunization as a preventive measure.The MSEDCL has a workforce of around 10,011 across eight districts of Marathwada, including 2,246 staffers above the age of 45 years. The remaining 7,765 are aged below 45 years. “The Covid vaccination drive has been evoking a good response. Around 1,024 employees and workers got the necessary jab on Tuesday. The MSEDCL top-brass wants vaccination coverage for all eligible employees as soon as possible,” Jadhav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/10-state-power-utility-staffers-in-mwada-died-of-ncov-in-a-year/articleshow/82185038.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Agra||Agra to get 10 tonne of oxygen supply from Jamshedpur, new plant under development||AGRA: The state government has directed the district administration to start its work on the urgent development of a new oxygen production plant. Besides, a 10 tonne capacity oxygen tank will be reaching Agra by Wednesday night. It will provide immediate relief to hospitals. The new plant will start operating by Thursday afternoon. Local administration has tasked officials to ensure the oxygen used by industries is diverted to hospitals. The latest development comes following a TOI report highlighting acute shortage of oxygen in Agra. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “We are ensuring that no critical patient admitted in hospital suffers. Oxygen cylinders are being supplied as per the control room's demands. Health department is working in coordination with the IMA. Vehicle with 10 tonne oxygen will be arriving from Jamshedpur. It will provide immediate relief to hospitals. A new oxygen plant will start operating from Thursday onward. Our aim is to ensure a minimum 36 hours of oxygen availability in all Covid hospitals." A senior doctor of the SN Medical College said, “Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and ventilators cannot be operated with oxygen cylinders. These machines need high pressure supply of oxygen and can stop working any moment. The oxygen tank is almost empty. State authorities have been informed.” Senior member of IMA Agra unit, Dr Ravi Mohan Pachori, said, “In wake of the Covid surge, the demand for medical oxygen has increased multiple times since the past week. Majority of the hospitals involved in treatment of Covid-19 patients are in need of oxygen supply. We have updated the district administration. Hospitals have been asked to ensure minimum usage of oxygen and extensive use of oxygen concentrator.” Chief medical officer of Agra district, Dr RC Pandey, said, “We are putting our best effort to ensure hospitals do not suffer any shortage of oxygen. Supply did not stop, but is much less as compared to the high demand. Local administration has ordered that hospitals get the supply in a time-bound manner. Over 10 teams are working to close the gap between demand and supply."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-to-get-10-tonne-of-oxygen-supply-fromjamshedpur-new-plant-under-development/articleshow/82185903.cms||---
---||Kolkata||87-year-old dies trying to escape isolation in Kolkata||KOLKATA: An 87-year-old man in home isolation died after he fell 40ft below while attempting to climb down from the balcony of his third-floor Hazra Road apartment on Wednesday morning. The rest of the family also had Covid symptoms, which made them stay in home isolation. But the elderly man apparently didn’t want to stay in confinement and tried to escape the captivity by climbing down the balcony. The incident took place around 9.30am at the G+5 Siddharth Apartment where Nagindas Zavery lived with his son and his family in a 1,600 sq ft flat on the third floor. Witnesses said the elderly man had thrown cushions, mats and mattresses on the ground from above, which were removed by employees of a car showroom who thought the man had thrown the stuff in a fit of rage. Some time later, the man made a rope out of clothes and bedsheets and tried to climb down the balcony. He lost his grip and landed on a car before he fell on the ground and smashed his head. He was taken to a local hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. Speaking to TOI over phone, the man’s son said his father never wanted to stay in isolation and always looked for opportunities to head out, which they had stopped allowing since the son became Covid positive. “We had asked him not to head out for his own safety as well as the safety of others. I didn’t even think he could attempt something like climbing down,” said the son, a businessman at Burrabazar. The building’s security guard, Sheikh Farukh, said barely two hours before the incident, the elderly man had gone out of the building. “He said he was feeling claustrophobic at home and was heading to a salon for a haircut. He was back by 8.30am and was having difficulty even walking till the lift. I helped him till his flat,” said Farukh. Neighbours said by 9am, they heard some commotion from the flat. The elderly man was known for his short temper. Guards said he often used to pick up fights over trivial issues, seldom used to wear a mask and used to throw away sanitizers whenever guards insisted on applying it. As a result, when the man had thrown the mats and mattresses on the ground — presumably to make a cushion to support his fall — the employees of the car showroom removed them as it blocked their entrance. But with the entire family in quarantine, neither the son nor his wife could take him to the hospital. Locals, along with cops, took him to the hospital. Even cops couldn’t question the family properly to proceed with the investigation as they couldn’t risk entering the flat. The cops asked some questions from outside the flat and spoke in detail over the phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/87-yr-old-dies-trying-to-escape-isolation/articleshow/82185901.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Goa||Tired FC Goa keen to keep going||Margao: Even on debut, FC Goa are not in the high-profile AFC Champions League simply to make up the numbers. That’s what coach Juan Ferrando firmly believes. That’s what the team has shown in the first three group games at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda. With two points from their first three matches, Goa have taken plenty by surprise. It’s a welcome change from the pre-tournament murmur when, in the words of captain Edu Bedia, “everyone was talking about how many goals FC Goa would concede in each game.” The talk was so strong that even the players “came to think that we did not want to make a fool of ourselves.” Instead, Goa have impressed, earning praise from 1998 World Cup winner Laurent Blanc and former Barcelona assistant coach Henk ten Cate, both rival coaches here. The job, though, is far from done. Goa have three group games still left to be played, and the most difficult one will be the reverse clash against last year’s finalists Persepolis FC on Friday. Three days ago, Goa stunned the Iranian champions by taking an early lead. That the visitors hit back quickly with two goals to take all three points didn’t surprise anyone. “Happy to some extent, but not entirely because our mentality at the club and the dressing room is to win the games,” Ferrando told TOI on Thursday. “But we know we are in the Champions League and these are very difficult games. There were some good points, some good performances. Sometimes the timing of the press, timing of the positional attack was not good. In ACL, it’s important to control these details.” The high-intensity games and little recovery time is taking a toll on Goa with captain Edu – suspended for this game –injured and others fighting to get fit. “Some players are very, very tired,” said Ferrando, pointing to the likes of Ivan Gonzalez, Glan Martins, Jorge Ortiz and Brandon, all of whom were “low on battery” and needs time to be recharged. “We have to continue doing what we have done (since the start). We have three more games, all very important. It’s necessary to improve. We cannot afford to repeat the same mistakes. “Our target is to get the next nine points. We have great respect to these teams. They are very good, but that is our target,” said Ferrando. Except Persepolis, no team has managed to win all points in this group. The visitors have an all-win record and another win against Goa will take them closer to the knockout stage. “Maybe some people believe these victories are because this group is easy, but in reality, it’s not,” said coach Yahya Golmohammadi.” This is one of the most difficult group. Some people think Goa are not that strong, but you can see they have quality and good planning. They run a lot and the players play with their hearts.” ACTION TODAY Al Rayyan vs Al Wahda, 8pm; FC Goa vs Persepolis FC, 10.30pm, AFC Champions League, Nehru Stadium, Fatorda||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tired-fc-goa-keen-to-keep-going/articleshow/82203914.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Seconding this, health experts said that though half of the population of the city was infected with Covid-19, hopes of reaching herd immunity are still far away. Dr Mishra told TOI, “The entire population cannot be infected. So, vaccine coverage is the best option given the fact that every second person is already infected in the city. Another 50 per cent of vaccine coverage is required in the city to achieve herd immunity.” He said: “Considering that some of the infected population might have already received the vaccine, we need those who are not infected to be vaccinated to arrive at herd immunity.” Based on the seroprelavance surveys conducted some time back by the CCMB and the National Institute of Nutrition, experts said the city will continue to witness a spike in positive cases. These seroprevalence surveys use blood tests to identify people in a population who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. However, herd immunity does not necessarily mean a blanket security where there are zero cases and that no one is infected. “When herd immunity is achieved, there will be a stable situation unlike the ups and downs seen in the second wave. Also, it is tough to predict the virus behaviour as it can mutate and change into many variants,” Dr Mishra asserted. Hyderabad reported a high number of cases in the first wave of Covid-19 and the second wave is equally strong. “When a wave-like situation happens during a pandemic, the entire area will not have positive cases in the same manner. Certain areas may witness more number of cases in the initial months, while some areas may be spared. But, the areas which were spared in the first wave will report more cases in the next spike. That is how the virus spreads,” an expert said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/herd-immunity-still-far-cry-ccmb-chief/articleshow/82186786.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Kochi||Kerala: Man held for killing missing girl in Malappuram||KOZHIKODE: Police arrested Anvar (38) of Parambil house for the murder of Subeera Farhath (21), whose body was exhumed on Wednesday from a plot near her residence at Chottur near Valanchery in Malappuram.  Police said that Anvar, a neighbour of the deceased, confessed that he had killed her to rob her gold ornaments. Relatives identified her decomposed body from her clothes. Subeera, daughter of Keezhuparambatt Kabeer who was working at a dental clinic at Vettichira, was reported missing on March 10 soon after she left her home for work in the morning. Tirur deputy SP KA Suresh Babu, who led the investigation, said, “The accused confessed that he committed the murder to rob her gold ornaments and resolve his financial crisis. We are looking if he had other motives.” Police brought Anvar to the spot to collect evidence before the body was exhumed in the morning. Policemen said while the accused denied sexual assault, further forensic examination will be carried out to find the truth. Valanchery inspector of police, Shemeer PM said that the crime was pre-planned and Anvar had waited for her in a narrow bylane she frequented every day on her way to the bus stop in the morning. He snatched her ornaments and strangulated her. “The woman was wearing only three sovereigns of gold and he stole it. The accused then hid the body in a nearby bush and returned to the spot around noon with a sack, packed the body in it and took it to a plot situated 100m away and buried her,” he said. On Tuesday, Valanchery police had found a body suspected to be that of Farhath buried in a plot of land near a laterite quarry just 200m away from her home. Police had grown suspicious about the role of Anvar after they got information that he had engaged a JCB operator to put more soil over the spot where he had buried the body on March 14. “He had called a JCB operator later to move more earth over the place where he had buried the body and we got suspicious as the land did not belong to him,” Shemeer added. Babu said police had focused its search around her house as she had gone missing within a distance of 100m. While CCTV camera in a neighbouring house had visuals of her on the day she went missing around 9am, she was not caught in the CCTV camera located near the bus stop where she was headed. Also, her mobile tower location was last shown in the vicinity. He said police became suspicious of Anvar after he tried to mislead the investigation. Residents were shocked to know that Anvar was behind the murder as he has been at the forefront of the search launched to locate the missing woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/man-held-for-killing-missing-girl/articleshow/82185906.cms||---

Launched on April 17, the initiative aims to break the chain of viral misinformation and disinformation that has been infecting social media groups as rampantly as the virus is mutating in the real world. Under this campaign, readers send unverified or suspicious messages doing the rounds of social media to this paper on the WhatsApp number 9819432222 and our expert panel—comprising reporters, editors and representatives from the BMC and the government—tap into their sources to verify its credibility. Over the last four days since the campaign began, TOI received over 650 messages out of which nearly 100 turned out to be false. “This message is fake,” cried the bold red stamp sent by our panel in response to fake forwards including one about an IIT student’s helpline for ambulance and over 80 fake remdesivir injection providers’ numbers. In the wake of the second wave, even as the country grapples with a deadly contagion, help TOI vaccinate you with the truth.

The city’s prominent markets like Paltan Bazaar were choc-a-bloc with customers in the morning. After 2 pm, the traffic remained minimal. Owners of small business and cafés meanwhile said the new guidelines would hurt their business as it allows them to be open for a very short time. As an emergency measure against rising Covid-19 cases in the state, the Uttarakhand government on Tuesday had imposed a partial lockdown. All shops and shopping malls, barring those selling essentials, will now be closed at 2 pm. Also, the night curfew timings have been changed to 7 pm (from 9 pm earlier) to 5 am. Reacting to the partial lockdown, restaurant and café owners said that they would be adversely hit now. “Cafes and restaurants receive most of their footfall in the evening and at night. The partial lockdown means we will have to keep our establishments open and incur operational costs, while losing out on the most busy hours,” said a café owner in the city. Health watchers have welcomed the government’s decision as a much needed one. The hill state, which was recording a daily spike of around 2,000 coronavirus cases till Monday, crossed the 3,000 mark on Tuesday and the 4,000 mark on Wednesday. The positivity rate in districts like Dehradun (24%) and Nainital (48%) has moved way past the safe limit, which is considered to be 5%. Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the coronavirus situation in the state, said that the whole Covid management strategy has to be reviewed and restructured, with great sense of emergency, in view of the rising cases in the state. “The number of RT-PCR tests being done each day need to be scaled and people should opt for self-lockdown and avoid going out till the peak of the virus subsides,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/markets-see-morning-rush-on-1st-day-of-partial-lockdown/articleshow/82185064.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Register by May 15, plastic recyclers told||CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) has issued a public notice asking all producers, importers and brand owners, recyclers and manufacturer of plastic carry bags and allied items to fulfill extended producers responsibility (EPR) for plastic waste generated due to the products introduced by them in the market, and register by May 15 or face action. The notice, which was issued by CPCC member secretary, stated that those who have not applied should register themselves with Central Pollution Control Board CPCB (those operating in more than two states/UTs) and CPCC (those operating in one or two states/UTs including Chandigarh) latest by May 15. As per notice, action will be initiated against violators under environment protection act 1986, and defaulters will be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and fine which may extend to Rs 1 lakh or both. Recently, the central government had asked the administration to submit a report on plastic ban enforcement. The administration in 2019 had notified plastic ban in the city. Last year, on the demand of manufacturers the administration had even removed three plastic items from the list of banned plastic items. The administration had kept --plastic refill pouch having quantity less than 500ml; straws attached with tetra packs and multilayered packaging used for food/snacks packing----under extended producer responsibility (EPR) instead of the ban list. The administration in September 2019 had banned plastic plates, cups, party bloopers, plastic ribbons and many other single use plastic in the city. After getting approval of Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, the UT administration had issued the final notification to ban all one-time-use plastic products. In July 2019, the UT had issued draft notification and sought suggestions and objections from public within 60 days. The committee had received around 32 objections, including from different resident welfare associations, traders and industrialist organisations. The administration has taken the step after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed it to submit its action plan on systematic disposal of plastic waste. The NGT had ordered that any person found using, storing, purchasing, dealing with or distributing plastic bags, plastic plates or plastic glasses and such allied items shall be liable to pay environmental compensation at the rate of Rs 5,000 per event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/register-by-may-15-or-face-action-plastic-recyclers-told/articleshow/82184962.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Kolhapur||6-minute walk test for home isolated Covid patients||KOLHAPUR: Civic chief Kadambari Balkawade had made it compulsory for the patients in home isolation to undergo a ‘six-minute walk test’ twice a day as around 58% of patients are home quarantined. Balkawade said, “The home isolated patients have to strictly follow the guidelines. In the six-minute walk test, they have to measure oxygen saturation level with the help of oximeters and then walk in their room for six-minute. After which, they have to check the saturation level again. This has to be done twice a day and report to us. They have to approach our health staff if the oxygen saturation level drops by 3% immediately so that we can arrange to hospitalise them.” Balkawade said a team of doctors visit the home isolated patients regularly. She said if the teams found that the patients violate home isolation guidelines then he or she will be shifted to the Covid care centres. The health authorities have found that many patients approach at a later stage of their symptoms and thereby becomes more prone to death. Meanwhile, Balkawade has appealed to wealthy citizens, social organisations and individuals to donate Covid related materials like masks, oxygen pipes etc to Kolhapur Municipal Corporation, which are required in the Covid centres. Last year, many people cancelled their birthdays and other celebrations to donate Covid materials to the KMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/6-minute-walk-test-for-home-isolated-covid-patients/articleshow/82185077.cms||---
---||Pune||Air cargo, limited stock push concentrator prices north||Pune: Manufacturers, importers, and dealers of oxygen concentrators say the high cost of imports and fast exhausting stocks have often doubled the rates of buying or renting them, with long waiting periods as well. The oxygen concentrators have emerged as a key alternative to the gas in liquid form both in homes and hospitals, “The situation is such that even if my family requires an oxygen concentrator, I will not be able to provide it because all of my stocks are gone. We are expecting new consignments by air and sea at the end of April and around May 10,” said Alok Garg, managing director of Medequip, which imports oxygen concentrators manufactured at Shenyang in China. The lion’s share of oxygen concentrators in India are imported from overseas, from countries such as the US, and more recently, China as well. Both public and private hospitals are increasingly placing large orders for concentrators with dealers located across India, or even directly with the representative offices of large manufacturers. While these machines were generally available to end-users for around Rs20,000-Rs30,000, the sudden shooting up of demand has bottomed out the inventory of the products, especially of the five and 10 litre capacities and also doubled the prices because the importers are having to spend more on transportation. “These products were earlier imported by sea, as these machines are bulky and the consignments used to arrive from our plant in the United States on a monthly basis. But due to the demand now, we are compelled to use air cargo. This increases our transportation cost by about ten times. Our five litre portable concentrators are in high demand now, as many doctors are recommending oxygen at home after discharge for some patients. We have a four month waiting period for some products,” said Prashant Korachagaon, national sales manager for DeVilbiss, one of the largest manufacturers of concentrators in the world. Demand from patients, who have been recommended home care, are also renting these machines, which can deliver oxygen up to a purity of 95%. The difference in rents has been stark in about a month, having increased by about four to five times in a month, while the machines are in short supply. “I rented a 5 litre oxygen concentrator machine after getting discharged from the hospital. It helped regulating oxygen supply, especially in the night when breathing shallows. I paid Rs4,000 for a month. But now after enquiring with a few people who are in medical renting equipments, the rentals have skyrocketed to about Rs25,000 per month. Some are renting for two weeks too,” said Anand Kansal, a resident. Dar-E-Arqam Education Charitable Trust in Kondhwa has recently launched a free oxygen concentrator machine supply programme. The trust gives 5 litre oxygen concentrator machines to patient’s families for three days, free of cost. Qudratullah Baig, who runs the trust, said, “We have only five machines, whereas we receive around 70 to 90 calls a day from people needing it immediately. We have placed an order of five more machines. But the dealers are quoting a very high price. Ten days agi, we bought the 5 litre machine for Rs45,000. Now the price has shot up to Rs57,000. Prices of these machines are unregulated and distributors are saying that stock is not available till Saturday. We have also heard that the price per machine in the new stock may rise to Rs70,000.” (With inputs from Neha Madaan)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/air-cargo-limited-stock-push-concentrator-prices-north/articleshow/82186835.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Nagpur||CBSE 12th board exam 2021: Make Covid testing mandatory for students, demand teachers||NAGPUR: Many CBSE school teachers feel that RT-PCR tests must be made mandatory for students before restarting Std XII practicals as it’s suspected that many asymptomatic students had attended school. CBSE schools had started with their practical tests from April 1 onwards, but then put everything on hold as Nagpur went into a ‘strict restriction’ mode. Deepali Dably, president of CBSE Staff Welfare Association, said a letter demanding mandatory RT-PCR tests will be given to both the Nagpur Municipal Corporation and the district collectorate. “Both students and teachers can be asymptomatic and hence it’s a big health risk for all stakeholders. We all are aware that this virus strain is spreading at a very fast pace and is infecting people from all age groups. So it’s important that we take all the necessary precautions to safeguard our students and even teachers from the virus,” said Dably. A CBSE school teacher told TOI that some students did attend practicals even though they were positive. “We come to know these things through their classmates. These kids anyway live their life on social media and so they always share such information either in a small Whatsapp group or during their group video calls to each other. Some of them will write on Instagram about parents becoming positive or a sibling. There’s nothing private about their lives anymore. So I am not speculating that positive students attended practicals, rather, I know it for a fact,” said the teacher. But since this information came a few days after the tests, teachers say they were helpless. Another teacher said, “We have been telling our principals to make RT-PCR mandatory for all but they are more focussed on getting the practical exam over and done with. Now, these practical exams have been put on hold and I hope that the school management takes it seriously.” CBSE had earlier advised parents to take an “educated view” on the issue. Speaking to TOI on this issue earlier, CBSE’s controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said, “Parents must be open about these things and inform the school if their child is positive. CBSE will not let any child suffer academically due to Covid-19. A second chance will be given, so no need to panic.” Dably feels that voluntary disclosure won’t work. “There’s no guarantee that people will tell the truth. So our best option is to get a test done and only the local authorities can enforce that. We will strongly plead with authorities to implement this rule before the practical exams restart,” said Dably.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/make-covid-testing-mandatory-for-students-demand-cbse-teachers/articleshow/82193840.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

As the calendar changed date, Abhimanyu, who celebrates his birthday on April 8, received a call from his maternal uncle at Warangal. Before the uncle could wish him, Abhimanyu asked him if any hospital in Warangal would take his father, whose SPO2 had dipped to 71% while the HRCT scan score was 23. Within the next two hours, the Pagade family had left Nagpur for Warangal, where the ailing vegetable vendor beat Covid in four days and was discharged on April 14. On April 9, TOI had reported about Abhimanyu’s brave decision to move his father 460km away to neighbouring Telangana state in a basic life support ambulance. Abhimanyu and his parents are still in Warangal as they need to follow up treatment for some more days. His mother too tested positive there. His younger brother is under training in the Indian Army and was not in city at the time. Recalling the hardships the family faced, Abhimanyu said his father had fever on March 23. “We took him to a nearby doctor, who told us to get a test done. The swab was given on March 28 but result came on April 2. Till then, he had no symptoms. But he wasn’t eating and had weakness,” he said. On April 7, Pagade (50, and not 55 as reported earlier) suddenly became breathless. “His oxygen saturation level dipped to 71%. Doctors advised immediate hospitalization. The HRCT scan showed 23 score, meaning 85% lungs involvement with Covid pneumonia,” he said. Abhimanyu took his father to IGGMCH and a couple of private hospitals, but they refused to admit him realizing it was a case of respiratory failure. “When my uncle called, I told him if bed is arranged, we will bring dad there. Many hospitals had refused admission after seeing the reports. So I cross checked with Max Care Hospital and left for Warangal,” he said. Dr Abhijan MPS, pulmonologist at Max Care Hospitals, said the patient was in shock and not able to talk. “Our target was to improve him without ventilator. We have a good critical care team. Since he came from Nagpur, our responsibility was even greater. He had a very narrow chance. Probably, he is among the 30% patients who make it from such serious condition,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/shifted-to-warangal-with-spo2-at-71-ct-23-veggie-vendor-beats-covid/articleshow/82186837.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Goa||Adil is a leader, helps FC Goa a lot: Ferrando||Margao: FC Goa defender Adil Khan continues to enjoy the trust of coach Juan Ferrando despite being substituted after just 28 minutes in the previous game against Persepolis FC. With Alexander Romario suspended, Ferrando chose to start with Adil in midfield. It wasn’t his preferred position and the international struggled against the Iranians, prompting the coach to replace him with Amarjit Singh even before the half an hour mark. “It was a tactical decision,” Ferrando told reporters during the pre-match media interaction on Thursday. “We started with 4-3-3 with Adil as number six. After 2-1 when they scored, we had to make a change.” The Spanish coach said Adil had done enough since his loan move from Hyderabad FC in January to win his confidence. “Adil helps this team a lot. He is a leader, amazing player and great person. But in that moment, I had to make the change. It’s not normal (to change so early) but in minute 25, we were down by two goals. Our aim is to win. That’s why we made the substitution,” said Ferrando. Ferrando said he was being paid to take decisions that can help the team and that’s what he did against Persepolis when the team conceded two goals in six minutes. “Adil was here in January and he helped a lot. He played a lot of games, he was the leader in defence (in ISL) and helped the young players. “Our plan against Persepolis was not successful and it’s not because of Adil. No, not at all. With Adil there are more positive details. For me, it’s a pleasure to work with him. I continue to push him, I need him,” said Ferrando. Adil is on loan from Hyderabad till the end of season. Goa are keen to make his move permanent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/adil-is-a-leader-helps-fc-goa-a-lot-ferrando/articleshow/82203940.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Sajin Peter, Shaji’s brother who was taken into custody on Tuesday showed the police team the spot where the body was buried. He had concreted the pit and covered it with loose soil. Forensic experts and police officers were present during the exhumation at Bharatheepuram near Anchal. Police said it was on August 24, 2018 that Shaji (44) of Thottamukku in Pazhayerror under Eroor panchayat was killed and buried by Sajin in the presence of their mother. It was Onam Day and Sajin and his wife had come to Shaji’s home where he stayed with his mother. They feasted together but entered into an altercation after Shaji misbehaved with Sajin’s wife. In the fight that followed Sajin hit Shaji on his head with an iron rod and Shaji died on the spot.

---||Kolhapur||25 of 71 Kolhapur district Covid deaths in 3 days occurred at CPR||Kolhapur: In just three days, the Kolhapur district has reported 71 coronavirus-related deaths. Of them, 25 took place at the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) hospital that had been converted into a dedicated Covid hospital. After CPR hospital, the highest number of deaths were reported from the Indira Gandhi hospital in Ichalkaranji, which too is a public hospital.Officials at the hospital claim that though there have been issues related to supply of oxygen and vital medicines like remdesivir, the deaths took place due to the criticality of the patients. S S More, the dean of CPR hospital, said: “We have found that most of the patients admitted to CPR have advanced-stage infection and most require ventilators. The recent deaths have been due to the advanced infection and not because of any shortage of critical medicine or oxygen.”The doctors here said that early detection and hospitalisation are key to avoid mortality. They even said many elderly citizens, with other severe comorbid conditions, got cured as they were admitted in very early stages of Covid infection. Minister of state for health Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar has ordered a death audit to look into the fatalities in the district over the past few days. “There has been an increase in the daily death count in the district, which is worrying. We need to investigate the cause of the deaths so that a course-correction can be done with respect to management as well as treatment. A death audit has been ordered and the district task force will carry it out.”The district has been witnessing a high number of deaths in public hospitals that are claimed to be well-equipped. The public hospitals are given priority over the private hospitals with respect to supply of oxygen and remdesivir injections too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/25-of-71-kolhapur-district-covid-deaths-in-3-days-occurred-at-cpr/articleshow/82185074.cms||---
---||Meerut||Industrial use of oxygen banned in Bijnor for supply to hospitals for Covid patients||BIJNOR: Owing to the acute shortage of oxygen in hospitals, the district administration has banned the industrial use of oxygen in Bijnor. Around 6,000 cylinders being used by industrial units in Bijnor are now available for supply to the hospitals, according to officials. Notably, in the past week, many Covid-19 patients had died due to the non-availability of oxygen at hospitals in different parts of the country. According to a Bijnor-based oxygen dealer, who wished not to be named, they procure medical oxygen from Bareilly, Moradabad and Meerut, but after the rising number of Covid patients, there is a shortage of oxygen. An oxygen cylinder that normally costs Rs 400 is now being sold for Rs 1,000, said the dealer, who supplies medical oxygen to private hospitals and patients being home quarantined. Besides, the rent of oxygen-generating electric machine has also increased from Rs 200 to Rs 500 per day. Mani Khanna, a factory owner, said, “We have stopped using oxygen cylinder for industrial purpose. We are now using electricity for welding. We have appealed to industrialists and factory owners to follow the guidelines to save lives.” Confirming that the commercial use of oxygen in Bijnor has been banned, drugs inspector Ashutosh Kumar, who has been deputed to oversee the availability of medical oxygen, said, “We have enough oxygen in our hospitals, and to maintain the availability, we have written to higher authorities to provide medical liquid oxygen to Bijnor district so that our oxygen refilling units could work.” In Bijnor, a 90-bed L2 hospital is running on just 60 oxygen cylinders and the hospital authorities have demanded more cylinders to deal with the crisis. There is also a shortage of technicians, at present. As many as 10 ventilators, which the hospital had received, are yet to be unpacked in the absence of technicians. As a result, critical patients are being referred to Moradabad and Meerut districts. The situation is the same in Amroha, too. A 250-bed L2 hospital here is running on just 58 oxygen cylinders and the hospital authorities have sought 200 more cylinders. Besides, there is also a shortage of doctors operating ventilators as a result, out of 11 ventilators available here, four are still packed. Officials said they had demanded technicians to operate the ventilator. According to the health department, 324 patients tested positive for Covid-19 in Bijnor district on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/industrial-use-of-oxygen-banned-in-bijnor-for-supply-to-hospitals-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82184369.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Delhi||Green routes to be created for O2 tankers||New Delhi: With most city hospitals still facing an oxygen crisis, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday asked Delhi Police to provide a green corridor for all oxygen tankers from the point of entry to the destination when they arrive from other states. It also deputed senior officers for controlling, coordinating and facilitating the supply of oxygen to healthcare establishments. DDMA asked the administration to establish a 24x7 control room manned by a subdivisonal magistrate-level officer for grievance redressal and ordered all hospitals to appoint an oxygen audit committee for supervising and rationalising the use of medical oxygen. Delhi has no oxygen plant and fully depends on other states for its supply. The allocation and supply of oxygen to all hospitals in the capital will be strictly regulated as per the Centre’s allocation orders and supervised by IAS officer Ashish Verma, the officer on special duty in the health department. He will be assisted by two senior officers. DDMA ordered that IAS officer Udit Prakash Rai would be responsible for ensuring smooth and seamless movement of tankers till the borders of Delhi and would sort out and redress all issues regarding suppliers, and the state and central governments. The AAP government has claimed that other states are stopping the supply from their oxygen plants to Delhi. Another IAS officer, Vijay Bidhuri, has been made responsible for controlling, coordinating and facilitating the supply of oxygen to the hospitals. The 24x7 control room, which will function under him, will operate a helpdesk manned by an SDM-level officer and eight others for redressing all grievances and complaints received from the central, Delhi and private hospitals within half an hour of their receipt. Otherwise, it will be the “responsibility of Vijay Bidhuri to look into the said complaints/grievances and resolve the same”, DDMA stated. Delhi Police will keep a record of entry and exit of tankers through various check posts and the same will be conveyed to the control room immediately. A green corridor will be provided to all tankers from this point. Special commissioner of police Muktesh Chander has been appointed the nodal officer and will provide all help and security logistics for movement of all tankers from the production sites to hospitals. The hospital oxygen audit committee will collect data on the usage and stock of oxygen and furnish daily data and information as required by the government from time to time, DDMA ordered. The hospitals will appoint nodal officers who will be available round the clock for any matter relating to the coordination and redressal of grievances regarding supply of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-routes-to-be-created-for-o2-tankers/articleshow/82203951.cms||AlokKNMishra

The PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI that initially they would set up one makeshift facility at either of the venues and take a call on the other facility after the next 15 days. The tendering process would start soon, he said. According to the PCMC’s bed management report on Wednesday, out of the 4,330 beds incuding the oxygen-supported beds and ICU beds (with and without ventilators) in the PCMC limits, 4,023 were occupied. “The proposed facilities will play an important role in at least temporarily resolving the bed crisis in Pimpri Chinchwad. The said facility will take at least two weeks to be set up and start functioning and there are various aspects involved in it. But until then, we are also working on ramping up the existing bed capacity in the civic medical facilities,” he said. Patil added that they would be adding at least 500 oxygen-supported beds to the existing 3,000 beds, in the four civic facilities within the coming week. “Akurdi Hospital, Jijamata hospital, and New Bhosari hospital, among others are the ones that will get at least 100 oxygen-supported beds within next week,” he added. To ease the burden on the existing facilities treating critical patients, the civic body has implemented a ‘step-down’ plan in which the patients, who no longer need oxygen support and are on the way to recovery, will be shifted to the Covid care centre in Balewadi, which has the bed capacity to accomodate 150 patients. “With the step-down plan, the bed availability issue will ease,” Patil said. Namdev Dhake, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s leader of house in PCMC, said the focus was currently on capacity building of the existing facilities. The proposed facilities too would be useful for easing the burden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-proposes-to-set-up-two-mini-jumbo-facilities/articleshow/82186847.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Ahmedabad||In Gujarat’s capital, with 2 CNG-fired furnaces not working, pyres set up at dumping ground||GANDHINAGAR: The Sector 30 crematorium in Gandhinagar had to extend outwards and set up wood pyres in an area adjoining a garbage dumping ground on the bank of the Sabarmati, due to the continuous influx of dead bodies because of the high number of Covid-19 deaths. The Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation-run crematorium had to place pyres adjoining a dumping ground mainly because its two CNG-fired furnaces have not been functioning for the past few days.  Moreover, cremations on wood pyres take little longer, leaving the otherwise spacious crematorium overcrowded. Despite there being 11 wood pyres alight simultaneously, there were eight more bodies in queue for cremation on Wednesday afternoon. Jilubha Dhadhal, who is on the committee that manages the crematorium, said there has been a rush of 75-80 dead every day for the past few days. “About 25% are non-Covid bodies. We do not have the option to keep them segregated and cremation of the bodies take place simultaneously. Moreover, the other cremation ground at Sargasan does not cremate bodies of Covid patients. This may be because local residents are opposing it and there is a shortage of staff,” Dhadhal explained. Dhadhal also admitted that the queue for cremation is due to the under-maintenance CNG furnaces. “We were expecting the CNG furnaces to get repaired soon, but we encountered a bigger fault and it will take longer to get them operating again,” he added. The committee, which manages crematorium voluntarily, is also trying hard to get more hands to meet the present rush, but is finding none. “We are ready to pay Rs 1,000 a day, but people are not ready to do this work. They cannot be blamed because everybody is afraid nowadays. Those who come to deliver the wood and other supplies also do not enter the premises,” Dhadhal said. Bakul Sutaria, whose father had died of Covid, said, “We had to wait for about four hours till a pyre slot was free. After the wood was laid, we had to place the body ourselves as no helpers were available. It is a shame that we have to do this in the dumpyard, despite being in our state’s capital.” Dilip Patel, whose 63-year-old father, Rasik Patel, died of Covid, said, “We brought the body here from Uvarsad and had to wait three hours for our turn.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pyres-burn-beside-municipal-dumpyard/articleshow/82186865.cms||Yogesh Chawda
---||Meerut||UP: Trial in killing of 72 Muslims in Meerut stuck in local court for 34 years||MEERUT: The Allahabad high court has asked the Uttar Pradesh government to file its reply on a writ petition seeking re-investigation into the alleged killing of 72 Muslims in Meerut’s Malyana village on May 23, 1987. A division bench of acting chief justice Sanjay Yadav and justice Prakash Padia has now directed the state government to file a counter-affidavit in the case which has been going on in a trial court in Meerut for 34 years. According to the petitioners, more than 800 dates have been given since proceedings began. The last hearing took place four years ago. Separated by just 2km, Meerut’s Hashmipura and Malyana villages saw unprecedented killings in the summer of 1987 as communal riots ravaged the region. The clashes in Meerut were allegedly triggered in April, 1987 when an inebriated policeman opened fire at two Muslims after being hit by a firecracker. Both of them were killed on the spot. While at least 42 people from the minority community were picked up from Hashmipura on May 22 and killed in Ghaziabad, another 72 were killed in Malyana a day later. It has been alleged that PAC personnel abetted the crime in Malyana, too, but there was no mention of it in the FIR. Thirty-one years after that, in October 2018, the Delhi high court sentenced 16 policemen for their role in Hashimpura killings. But the Malyana case is still stuck in a maze of files in a trial court in Meerut. All the key documents, even the original FIR, have gone missing in the last three decades, said Qurban Ali, a senior Delhi-based journalist and one of the petitioners. A retired director general-rank police officer, Vibhuti Narain Rai, Mohammad Ismail, now 61, who lost 11 family members in the massacre, and Rashid, a lawyer who pursued the case in the trial court, are the other petitioners in the case. Retired IPS officer Rai was superintendent of police of Ghaziabad when 42 people from Hashimpura were brought to the district in a PAC truck, shot dead and thrown into the Ganga canal on the outskirts of Delhi. Rai had ensured that the culprits were brought to book in the parallel Hashimpura massacre. Though the state counsel in Malyana case argued that it was a very old matter and there was no merit in it, the Allahabad HC said the state should file a counter-affidavit before the next hearing on May 24. “In 34 years, more than 800 dates have been fixed for hearings. But only three of the 35 prosecution witnesses have been examined by the Meerut court. The laxity of the prosecution can be gauged from the fact that the main FIR, the basis of the entire case against 95 rioters, suddenly ‘disappeared’ in 2010. The local court refused to go ahead with the trial without a copy of the FIR and a ‘search’ for the FIR copy is still on,” said petitioner Ali. Co-petitioner Rai added: “The Allahabad HC order is a positive development. 16 PAC men were convicted for killing 42 Muslims in Ghaziabad. It all happened because a strong case was built against them. Had they been killed in Meerut, it would have met the same fate as Malyana.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/trial-in-killing-of-72-muslims-in-meerut-stuck-in-local-court-for-34-yrs-hc-seeks-up-reply/articleshow/82184374.cms||Sandeep Rai

Humax India Pvt Ltd, a manufacturer and supplier of LED lamps and other lighting solutions, has filed a complaint with Nadakkavu police stating that there has been a vicious campaign against the firm on social media by giving a communal colour to writing the company name in Arabic along with English in advertisements. “Soon after the social media messages, as many as seven billboards of the firm installed in the bus waiting bays of Kozhikode Corporation were destroyed by anti-socials,” said Shamsu Moidheen, managing director of Humax India Pvt. Ltd. He said that the firm has also been facing a cyber-attack on social media with certain vested interests spreading defamatory messages for writing the company name in Arabic language. Moidheen said that the firm had been writing company name in the advertisement boards in both English and Arabic as part of its branding strategy. There had been a fake social media campaign over the billboards put up the company with some persons putting up posts saying that that they belonged to KSEB and that the state’s public power utility had put up the boards in Arabic as part of ‘appeasement’. KSEB had publically denied the campaign and said that it had not put up boards in Arabic anywhere in state and that it didn't have any connection with the LED lamp manufacturer who had installed the boards. When asked about the use the logo of KSEB in the firm’s advertisement, Moidheen said that the firm had been using the line ‘Save on Electricity- KSEB’ as KSEB has been running a campaign ‘Filament Free Kerala’ and the firm was also engaged in supply of LED lamps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ad-boards-featuring-name-of-firm-in-arabic-destroyed/articleshow/82185922.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Corporators flooded with calls for help but lack the clout needed||NAGPUR: Being the most easily accessible public representative, corporators are getting swamped with calls for hospital beds, oxygen and even life saving drugs that are in short supply. But these ‘first line of defence’ in democracy, don’t always have the clout of a MLA or MP to make things happen for their constituents. Dilip Dive, corporator of prabhag number 37, said, “From 6am, my phone starts ringing and does not stop till 2 in the night. It’s impossible to help everyone because there is indeed a short supply of everything. In the meantime, we are focusing on providing some services like food, raw foodgrains etc. Today I also started a vaccination centre and over a hundred people took the jab.” Sneha Vivek Nikose, corporator of prabhag number nine, said, “We have become helpless because this time the situation is really grim. There are constant calls from people seeking some sort of relief. My own relative passed away as there were no beds available. My entire family was positive, yet we continued to do as much as possible over the phone for people.” Pragati Patil, corporator of prabhag number 14, said “This is a really tough time for all of us as most callers end up being disappointed because it’s impossible to find beds anywhere in Nagpur. Apart from that, there are senior citizens living in isolation who need to be taken care of. I had given a proposal to NMC for allotting special funds to corporators to enable us to help our constituents.” Bunty Shelke, corporator of prabhag number 18, said it was heartening to hear the callers plea for help. “My team attends over 5,000 calls per day, of which 200 are answered directly by me, asking for beds. Minimum five members of my team are present at Mayo Hospital 24x7 to help people out. We also have a WhatsApp group of private hospital doctors and volunteers to better coordinate for available resources, ” he said. Chetna Tank, corporator of prabhag no 24, said the scene is heart wrenching. “I am constantly on the phone with hospitals taking updates on bed position and medicine availability. But frankly, many times we feel helpless because there is so much shortage of everything that people are disappointed,” said Tank. A city corporator, who did not wish to be named, said this may have a negative impact on the next civic polls. “We are able to help just 1%-2% of our constituents currently. Many may feel we did not perform to their expectations. So yes, it does weigh on the mind that the perception of corporators might change even though every single one of them is working very hard,” said the corporator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/corporators-flooded-with-calls-for-help-but-lack-the-clout-needed/articleshow/82186851.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Prasad is serving jail time after being convicted by a special CBI court in connection to a fodder scam case related to fraudulent withdrawal from the Dumka treasury. Last Saturday, the Jharkhand high court granted him bail in the case. Prasad has already got bail in fodder scam cases related to Deoghar and Chaibasa treasuries. While granting the bail, the high court had ordered Prasad to furnish two sureties of rupees one lakh each and also pay half of the fine imposed on him by the CBI court. The process has not been completed because soon after the judgement, the Jharkhand State Bar Council (JSBC) issued a directive to all district bar associations asking lawyers to stay away from work till April 25. Prasad’s lawyer Anant Kumar said, “We have not furnished the bail bonds and the fine owing to the JSBC order. The work would be completed only after the JSBC allows us to attend court.” The JSBC will meet again on April 26 to take a decision on rejoining court work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lalu-release-delayed-as-lawyers-skip-work-amid-covid-surge/articleshow/82186579.cms||---

In a high-level meeting with Army personnel at his residence, the CM requested that common people be also treated in Army hospitals located in Namkum and Ramgarh. The CM said that if the Union government allowed the use of the military hospitals, the state government would set up additional oxygen-attached beds and ventilators in those facilities. He said the experience of military doctors and para-medical staffs would ensure better treatment of Covid patients. Soren said that at least six districts including Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Dhanbad are registering high growth of cases and the Army facilities would help in lessening the burden on hospitals in the state capital. He said that Ranchi itself was the worst-affected district in the state going by the patient count, and added that the flow of patients from other districts was putting the health infrastructure in the state capital under tremendous strain. The CM also sought the Army’s help in setting up a 1,000-bed isolation centre for Covid patients. The Army officials said that the defence ministry was mulling over the letter sent by the CM to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard, adding that they would take further steps depending on the ministry’s direction. The officers said that the Army hospital in Ranchi has 400 beds, out of which 200 have been reserved for Covid patients. The hospital in Ramgarh has 120 beds. Senior government officials including chief secretary Sukhdeo Singh and Army officers like brigadier Sanjay Katiyar, brigadier Rajat Shukla and colonel K Vivek were present in the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-seeks-army-resources-in-managing-pandemic/articleshow/82186303.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A division bench of the high court comprising Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad while hearing a petition last week ordered the government to inform what steps have been taken to improve the supply of the medicines said to be crucial for the treatment of patients found positive. The bench was also peeved with the information provided by the drug controller before the judges that the Remdesivir and Favipiravir have been made available to top medical shops in the capital. The court queried from the drug controller as to what is the criteria of ‘top medical shops’ and which are the shops that have been provided with the medicines. The drug controller also allegedly tried to mislead the bench into believing that orders for the supply of the two medicines have been placed by the state before the Centre. However, the counsel for the Union government informed the court that no such order for supply of the medicines has been made by the state government. The bench has sought a detailed affidavit from the drug controller and the principal secretary for health on the action taken by the government to ensure adequate supply of the medicines required for the treatment of the virus. The court had taken up the matter pursuant to frequent reports in the media about the shortage of the medicines and its black marketeering in the state. The case will again be posted for hearing on April 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hearing-in-hc-over-cov-med-shortage-today/articleshow/82186390.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The service will also facilitate doctors’ visits to patients on request. Launching the portal (www.mdoc.in), Ranchi DC Chhavi Ranjan on Wednesday urged people in home isolation to make use of the services provided by the application-based service. Ranjan said, “Around 50% of all Covid patients in Ranchi are in home isolation and we have collaborated with a mobile application-based for online consultation for free medical consultation. Patients can also download the mDoc app and connect to doctors for any assistance.” mDoc is a Jharkhand-based online platform that provides all kinds of medical services -- from doctor’s appointment to medical consultation -- to its customers. The application also provides pathological as well as physiotherapy services through its application which has over 700 doctors registered on it. mDoc founder Navin Prakash said: “The patient has to download the application or log in to our website. The patient has to click on Covid-19 services section and they can request for free consultation on a phone call or video call. If one wants to get a doctor visit or require nursing staff, there will be minimal charges and we will get a doctor’s visit arranged.” Several other medical organizations also stepped up for providing similar services to people in isolation in Ranchi. A group of 16 doctors of various specialities under the aegis of National Medicos Organisation (NMO) is also providing free medical consultations between 11am to 1pm on a daily basis. “Our team of doctors have come together to assist people in providing free consultation to patients who are in home isolation. We are also helping many such patients in admission and other assistance as and when required,” said Amiya Mrinal Prachar Pramukh of NMO Jharkhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/free-e-consultation-for-ranchi-covid-patients-in-home-isolation/articleshow/82186270.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Keep oxygen cylinders at home in case of emergency: Health experts||JAMSHEDPUR: As healthcare facilities in the Steel City struggle to meet the rising demand for oxygen from Covid-19 patients, Tata Steel’s advisor of medical services Dr Rajan Chaudhry on Wednesday urged everyone to keep an oxygen cylinder at home as a precautionary measure. “Breathlessness is one of the tell-tale signs that a person is infected with coronavirus and keeping an oxygen cylinder at home will save time and possibly your life,” he said. The second wave of the pandemic has triggered a spurt in the need for oxygen, with healthcare facilities crumbling under the weight of the steep demand while the common people run from pillar to post trying to arrange a cylinder for their infected family members. Till date, the district has reported 25,730 cases, 20,518 recoveries, 467 deaths while the active caseload is 4,745. “The peculiarity of the mutant variant is such that the oxygen level of the infected person is severely affected. The patient cannot be discharged from the hospital until his oxygen level normalises, which is a time-consuming process. Besides, it is taking longer for the infected persons to test negative for Covid-19, resulting in the hospital beds being occupied for a long period of time, which wasn’t the case during the first wave last year,” additional chief medical officer Sahir Pall said, adding, “All these factors are cumulatively affecting the recovery rate.” Indian Medical Association’s secretary (Jamshedpur unit) Dr Mrityunjay Kumar said, “Hospital admissions are growing in comparison to the recoveries on a daily basis, due to which the availability of vacant beds is falling short which, in turn, is affecting the recovery rate.” In the past 10 days, the recovery rate went down by 10% in East Singhbhum. According to district’s data on Covid-19, the recovery rate recorded a fall from 92.15% to 81.95% between April 11 and April 20. On April 12, the recovery rate was 91.19% and it was 90.34% on April 13. On April 14 and April 15, the recovery rate was 89.25% and 88.96%, respectively, while it was 87.77% on April 16 and 86.47% on April 17. It dropped further in the next two days with the rate hitting 84.72% on April 18 and 83.10% on April 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/keep-oxygen-cylinders-at-home-in-case-of-emergency-health-experts/articleshow/82186793.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||BJP attacks state over Covid crisis, PM address forces it on back foot||RANCHI: Opposition BJP on Thursday launched a scathing attack on the mahagathbandhan government over the spiralling rate of Covid deaths in Ranchi and other parts of the state. “The way patients are struggling to get beds, oxygen, medicines and the deceased are being cremated is a testimony that the government and the administrative machinery in this state are now on deathbed,” state BJP president and Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash said. “Everyday, media persons are reporting how people are dying owing to the lack of timely treatment. Even black marketeering of medicines is going unabated. Not that the government is not aware of the problems, but it is doing precious little,” said Prakash, asking the chief minister to visit any hospital without any prior announcement to experience the problems faced by people. “We have been hearing horror stories and seeing them from the ground daily, but this government has become deaf,” Prakash added. The saffron party also mocked the week-long Swastha Suraksha Saptah announced by the state government. “According to the Hemant Soren-led government, drinking liquor is a way to stay healthy. That is why, they have decided to keep wine shops open during the health safety week,” he said. Notably, BJP demanded lockdown in the state in the wake of spiralling Covid-19 cases. Party leader Babulal Marandi, too, pressed for a lockdown and even called up Soren demanding the same. But following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to all states to refrain from enforcing lockdown, the BJP state unit has now found itself in an uncomfortable situation. However, none wished to speak openly about it. The ruling alliance partners — JMM and Congress — strongly hit back at BJP for its ‘dual stand’. JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharjee said, “During the all-party meet two days ago, BJP said that it will rise above political opportunism to collectively fight the pandemic in the state, but it is back to square one today. BJP must seek answers from its supreme leader and PM on why he failed the nation in containing Covid-19. BJP leaders must also ask Modi-ji and his government why medicines, oxygen, vaccines and the likes have not been provided to the states. The central leadership has exposed itself by pushing the country into crisis.” Congress spokespersons Alok Dubey and Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo dared BJP leaders in the state to explain their stand over lockdown. “Until recently, the BJP leadership here was accusing the state government of running away from imposing complete lockdown. But the PM has asked states to refrain from lockdown in the interest of economic activities. They should question the PM now?” the duo said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-attacks-state-over-cov-crisis-pm-address-forces-it-on-back-foot/articleshow/82186658.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Even though the state government last week has cancelled all exams in the wake of the surge in Covid-19 cases, Rims is planning to conduct the exams from May 2-21 and is asking the students to appear for them as the state-run hospital wants to deploy them as interns for Covid duty. The students have said that they are ready to join as interns and contribute their services as the hospital requires extra hands to manage the high patient load. They have submitted a memorandum to Rims director, asking him to postpone the exams and promote them as interns and avail their services by deploying in the Covid ward. Besides them being infected, several students are busy taking care of their family members as many of them have tested positive for Covid-19. “My grandfather is critical while my uncle has just recovered from Covid. Every day, I am running from medical shops to hospitals, trying to arrange medicines and beds for my family. I don’t know how the hospital expects me to appear for exams in this situation,” a final-year MBBS student preferring anonymity said. Another student said, “Three persons, including me, are Covid positive and my house has been declared as a micro-containment zone. I have been told by my batch-mates that the college wants to conduct the examination despite the government cancelling all kinds of exams.” Ranchi University, which provides degrees to Rims students, has already issued a notification earlier this week, stating that all examinations stand cancelled in the light of the government’s directive. Upon contact, the dean of academics at Rims, Dr Satish Chandra, did not receive TOI’s calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rims-students-fume-over-exam-plan/articleshow/82186649.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Bokaro civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak said: “We are advising private hospitals to devise ways to keep their frontline workers motivated. This is the time when everyone has to rise above their potential to combat the virus.” There are around 70 private hospitals and nursing homes in the district, but not many were earlier interested in treating Covid patients. Some of the private hospitals have started treating Covid patients only after the state government made it mandatory for all private hospitals to reserve 50% of their beds for Covid patients. Till now, 42 hospitals have submitted details of their beds to the district administration. The general manager of K M Memorial Hospital, B M Banerjee, said, “Everybody is under stress and many of our health workers went on leave soon after we began treating Covid-19 patients. A few of them said that they were ready to sacrifice their jobs rather than join work owing to the fear of the virus.” A similar situation prevailed at the Devansh Hospital. Faguni Chatterji of Muskan Hospital said: “Many staff have stopped coming to work. We are providing treatment with very limited resources.” Till Tuesday afternoon, Bokaro district recorded 8,700 cases, of which 1,159 were active.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/staff-crunch-at-pvt-hosps-as-cov-fears-keep-medicos-away/articleshow/82186733.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The theme this year is ‘restore our earth’. While globally Earth Day celebrations commenced only in 1970, in Goa, mother earth has been worshipped by locals down the ages. Goddesses Sateri, Bhumka, Mauli, Shantadurga represent nature, motherhood, fertility, creation and destruction, embodying the bounty of nature. Goan tribals and non-tribals worship the anthill as the goddess Santer. Termites transform leaf litter into the soil that helps in the formation of the anthill. “The anthill is a symbolic representation of mother earth. Our forefathers have been worshipping Santer, who is responsible for enriching their cultural life by protecting the sacred groves and water sources,” Kanta Gaude, a prominent folk artist from Veling Priol, said. Subodh Naik, secretary of Vivekanand Environment Awareness Brigade, Keri said, “In Goa, entire communities were once involved in protection and conservation of our natural resources through the tradition of sacred groves, sacred trees and sacred water bodies. Most of these practices, however, are on the verge of extinction and need to be revived to promote environment, ecology.” Gautam Jalmi, who cycles twice in a week from Honda to Panaji to work, said, “We have to minimise our wants that are consuming a lot of energy resources and follow green technology as far as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/timeless-practice-of-honouring-earth/articleshow/82187121.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Goa||Goa: Fierce battle on cards for Margao polls||MARGAO: With campaigning for the April 23 polls for Margao Municipal Council (MMC) having ended on Wednesday, it’s a fierce battle on play between BJP and Congress-Goa Forward Party (GFP) alliance to hold sway over the municipality. Stakes are high for both Congress and BJP, as also for GFP, in the civic polls as its outcome is likely to set the stage for the 2022 assembly elections scheduled to be held hardly a few months from now. If leader of opposition and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat crisscrossed the town during the campaign in favour of the 11 candidates fielded by him under Margao Model panel, GFP president Vijai Sardesai almost single-handedly led the campaign for all his 13 candidates fielded under the Fatorda Forward panel. As for BJP, chief minister Pramod Sawant descended on Margao for a whirlwind campaign during the last leg of electioneering. BJP has fielded candidates in all 25 wards of the city on its Vibrant Margao panel. As in the 2015 Margao civic polls, Sardesai and Kamat have forged an alliance this time too. In the last elections, six candidates were elected from Kamat’s panel - ‘Model Margao’ - for the 25-member council, while 11 candidates owing allegiance to Sardesai had emerged victorious. The power sharing formula between GFP and Congress had resulted in Sardesai-backed Babita Angle Prabhudesai getting elected as chairperson, and Kamat-backed Dorris Texiera as her deputy. However, following a change in political equations after GFP joined the BJP-led government in 2017, GFP’s Tito Cardozo replaced Texiera as the vice-chairperson, allowing Sardesai to have a complete dominion over the Margao municipality. Sardesai managed to assert his supremacy over the council throughout the term despite his ouster from the BJP-led government in July 2019. BJP, which was confined to the opposition benches in the MMC during the last three terms, is pulling out all stops to gain control over the Margao civic body this time. Shadow Council for Margao has also fielded candidates in eight wards on its Citizens Choice panel. In all, there are 98 candidates in the fray, including independents. Among the closely watched contests will be in ward 12 between senior BJP functionary Sharmad Raiturkar of Vibrant Margao and Sagun (Dada) Naik of Model Margao, and in ward 12 between Vibrant Margao’s Ronita Azgaonkar, niece of deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar, and Kamat-backed Sulaksha Jamuni of Model Margao. However, much will depend on the voter turnout during the polls which takes place under the grim second wave of the pandemic that has gripped the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fierce-battle-on-cards-for-margao-polls/articleshow/82187131.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Outgoing chairperson of Quepem Municipal Council Dayesh Naik is facing a three-cornered contest in ward 7 while outgoing vice-chairperson Chetan Haldankar, is locked in a four-cornered battle in ward 1. Both are backed by deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar. What’s significant is that both were headed for an unopposed win last month before the court intervention over the reservation issue led to rescheduling of the polls to April 23. Altogether 55 candidates are in the fray for the election to the 13-member Quepem municipality. For election to the 10-member Sanguem Municipal Council, altogether 43 candidates are in fray, including five outgoing councillors. Among the most closely watched contests will be in ward 6 where Sanjay (Abuli) Raikar who is contesting for the eighth consecutive term and is pitted against outgoing councillor Fouzia Shaikh. Shaikh had moved the court over the reservation issue after this ward was reserved for OBC. As the polls were rescheduled, the ward was kept open for general category. Rosa Maria Fernandes, Sandesh Kossambe and Queiroz Cruz are the other outgoing councillors who are contesting for the second term. Outcome of the polls for both Sanguem and Quepem municipal councils is politically significant as it is likely to set the pitch for the larger battle for the 2022 assembly elections. While Kavlekar and his wife Savitri had contested against the BJP in the 2017 polls, Sanguem MLA independent Prasad Gaonkar who initially backed the BJP-led government withdrew support mid-way and is now in the enemy camp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/keen-contest-on-anvil-in-quepem-sanguem-polls/articleshow/82187176.cms||---
---||Goa||Congress files plaint of cheating & forgery against rebel MLAs||PANAJI: The Congress party filed a police complaint against 10 of its former legislators for forging documents and allegedly lying about a merger of the state Congress unit with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In the complaint filed with the Panaji police station, Congress claimed that the 10 rebel MLAs had “conspired together and created a false document” to justify their merger with BJP before Goa assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar. The party has sought action against these MLAs, including deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar. As the opposition leader in July 2019, Kavlekar had joined BJP along with nine other Congress MLAs. State Congress unit president Girish Chodankar filed the police complaint and sought action against all those named for alleged forgery, cheating and creating false evidence to misguide the assembly speaker. Chodankar said that the resolution produced by Kavlekar and the other MLAs to show that the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee met on July 10, 2019 to pass a resolution to merge with the BJP is false. “No such meeting of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee was called for or took place on July 10, 2019 and therefore question of passing of any resolution as claimed in the said documents does not even arise,” said Chodankar. The development comes just a day after Patnekar dismissed disqualification petitions moved by Congress and MGP against 12 BJP MLAs. The Congress party has alleged that its former legislators forged document to produce before Patnekar to deceive him for which they should be booked and punished under Section 415 and Section 420. Chodankar also alleged that a counterfeit letterhead and seal was used to forge the documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-files-plaint-of-cheating-forgery-against-rebel-mlas/articleshow/82187198.cms||---

He alleged that BJP has continued the grants to English medium primary schools by disregarding the universal principle that recommends mother tongue as ideal for elementary education.

That's what the family of a 55-year-old man realised after they were asked to pay Rs 60,000 by an ambulance driver to preserve his body in a freezer for a night and later organise the funeral. His daughter was on the verge of pledging her gold chain to give him a dignified farewell when police intervened to resolve the issue. RV Prasad, former Bosch employee and resident of Mathikere, fell ill and submitted his swab sample at the primary health centre on Sunday. His nephew Amit said they began checking for hospitals. "Someone said there was a vacant bed in Kanakapura and we took him there, but in vain. On Monday, we got the BBMP report and BU number too. When we contacted the BBMP helpline to arrange a bed, we were told to wait for some time and they would call back." Amit added: "We went through a directory of hospitals to find a bed. Around 5.45pm Tuesday, he fell unconscious. We approached a private operator for an ambulance. For three hours, we tried to get him admitted but failed. By then, he had died and had no other option but to return." Asked for Rs 6,000, family assumed it was Rs 60,000: Ambulance driver Around 10.30pm, the family gave up and decided to preserve the body for the night and hold the cremation on Wednesday. Ambulance driver Hanumantha offered them a ‘package’ to preserve the body in a freezer and for the cremation the next day. “He demanded Rs 60,000 and we tried to negotiate — all this on the service road under the flyover in Hebbal. When we requested him to reduce the price, Hanumantha rudely asked us to unload the body. With no option, we paid an advance of Rs 3,000 and asked him to keep the body in the freezer,” Amit said. On Wednesday, Prasad’s daughter Bhavya rushed to Peenya crematorium where Hanumantha had brought the body and paid him Rs 10,000. When she said she was unable to raise the remaining amount, Hanumantha said he would either drop the body at their doorstep or on the road and leave. Bhavya said, “We decided to pledge my gold. By then, police officials infor med about it came to our rescue and made the ambulance driver see reason.” Amit said they eventually paid Rs 13,000 for the ambulance service. Amit and Bhavya were at Peenya crematorium around 6pm Wednesday. Six hours had elapsed in the queue and Prasad’s body was sixth in line. Hanumantha said he asked for Rs 6,000 and the family assumed it was Rs 60,000. “As I was wearing a mask, they may have misheard. I asked for Rs 6,000 to ferry the body for five hours,” he said. A person working with an NGO ferrying patients to hospitals and bodies to crematoria said black marketeers are charging Rs 35,000 to transport a body from the hospital, provide a freezer for a night and take care of the last rites in the crematorium. Given the surge in Covid cases and deaths, the demand for ambulances has increased. Some ambulance drivers double as representatives for both crematorium workers and freezer providers and try to make a quick buck, the volunteer said on condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-ambulance-driver-asks-rs-60000-to-ferry-covid-body/articleshow/82189816.cms||Kiran Parashar

It has also shown 100% efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease, its developers Bharat Biotech and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Wednesday. “The second interim analysis is based on accruing more than 87 symptomatic cases of Covid-19. Due to the recent surge in cases, 127 symptomatic cases were recorded, resulting in a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 78% against mild, moderate, and severe Covid-19 disease,” they said in a joint statement. Read AlsoSerum Institute wants to sell Covishield for Rs 400 to states, Rs 600 to private hospitalsSerum Institute of India is seeking to fix Rs 400 per dose as the price for its Covid-19 vaccine Covishield for all future orders — nearly 2.7 times the earlier-negotiated price of around Rs 150 per dose for its current contract with the Centre. The move came as it announced its decision to fix a“The efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease was 100%, with an impact on reduction in hospitalisations. The efficacy against asymptomatic Covid-19 infection was 70%, suggesting decreased transmission in Covaxin recipients,” they added. Though the second interim analysis was planned to be conducted once 87 participants got infected, a higher number – 127 cases – was recorded among the Covaxin trial participants due to the surge in cases because of the second wave and the interim efficacy data was calculated on this basis. The final analysis of the safety and efficacy results will be available in June after which the final report will be submitted to a peer-reviewed publication, they added. Prof Balram Bhargava, secretary of the department of health research and director general of ICMR, said the 78% efficacy in the second interim analysis as well as the findings that Covaxin works well against most variants of SARS-CoV-2 consolidates the position of the indigenous vaccine in the global vaccine landscape.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Terming Covaxin as a global innovator vaccine derived from R&D conducted in India, Bharat Biotech chairman & managing director Dr Krishna Ella said Covaxin had demonstrated an excellent safety record in human clinical trials and during emergency use. “The efficacy data against severe Covid-19 and asymptomatic infections is highly significant as this helps reduce hospitalisation and disease transmission, respectively,” he said.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); The developers of the desi vaccine also said that following the achievement of the success criteria, those who received placebo shots during the trial have now become eligible to receive two doses of Covaxin.

---||Delhi||Delhi oxygen quota hiked, but situation still critical||NEW DELHI: The unprecedented crisis of hospitals in Delhi running out of oxygen continued for the second day with many of them, which have hundreds of critical Covid patients on oxygen support, sending out distress calls that they had just enough stocks for a few hours. It was touchand-go whether they would get oxygen replenished quickly enough to avoid a catastrophe. After Delhi government persisted with its demand from the Centre for enhancing the oxygen supply, the Centre increased Delhi’s quota from 378 metric tonnes to 480 metric tonnes. The government has, however, written to the Centre for 700 metric tonnes. While the increased amount will take some time to reach Delhi, suppliers were reported to be facing obstruction from district authorities of Haryana and UP. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said a Haryana government official stopped the oxygen supply earmarked for Delhi from a Faridabad, causing many several hospitals to run out of the gas. Don’t block our oxygen supply, govt urges statesSisodia urged the Centre to ensure that states do not stop the oxygen supply from reaching the state they are earmarked for because a joint effort is needed to fight Covid. The increased quota will come from states like Odisha, West Bengal, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. Delhi government sources pointed it out as “a matter of grave concern” that of the 480 metric tonnes, 100 metric tonnes that will come from Odisha (70 metric tonnes) and West Bengal (30 metric tonnes) will take almost 72 hours to reach Delhi. “Our citizens, our hospitals, our city are running out of time. Meanwhile, the 140 metric tonnes, which Haryana has to supply, is yet to leave for Delhi,” said a source. On Monday and Tuesday, around 240 metric tonnes and 365 metric tonnes of oxygen had been supplied to the capital against a daily requirement of 700 metric tonnes. Since Delhi does not have its own source of oxygen, its supplies come from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Despite health being a state subject, the power related to oxygen supply lies with the central government, which decides which state will get how much oxygen. Given the new, far more virulent wave of Covid-19, Delhi has seen a huge rise in demand for oxygen. Among them are many patients from other states who have come to Delhi to get treated. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had recently drawn the attention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the gravity of the situation. Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals claimed that it had only 10-12 hours of oxygen supply available while Manipal Hospital, too, expressed concern that they had a back-up of merely 12 hours. Max Hospital, Patparganj, which has around 262 Covid patients, said it had enough for about three hours while Max Shalimar Bagh, with 285 Covid patients, had oxygen backup for only about two hours, according to a government report. Hospitals should ideally have about three days’ stock with them. The Max hospitals got their supplies later at night even as Delhi High Court was conducting a hearing on the matter. The situation remained grim at Delhi government hospitals too. Last night, GTB Hospital just about managed to avert a mass tragedy when it received an emergency supply of oxygen for over 500 patients admitted there. “It is indeed unfortunate that states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are curtailing the supply of live-saving oxygen to Delhi. Just like the Haryana government, the Uttar Pradesh government, too, has illegally captured the oxygen production plants, depriving Delhi of oxygen. What’s worse is that they’re indulging in this insensitive act despite clear orders from the high court,” said a Delhi government source. Earlier in the day, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had thanked the central government for incresaing the oxygen supply. “We are grateful to the Centre for this,” he said. Addressing a presser, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said: “This morning, several hospitals ran out of oxygen because the supply which was supposed to come from a plant in Faridabad did not arrive. A district official reached the plant and stopped the life-saving oxygen vehicles from going to Delhi. When the Centre decides on the issue of oxygen, no state government should have the authority to stop the supply of oxygen.” Sisodia said the way Covid cases have increased exponentially in Delhi and many patients from other states have come to Delhi to get treated, there was a greater need for more and more oxygen supply in Delhi. “The reason for limited supply of oxygen in many hospitals in Delhi today is that oxygen that was earmarked for Delhi from a plant in Faridabad was directed towards Haryana by an official of the Haryana government. A similar thing had happened on Tuesday at a plant near Modi Nagar when we had to call a union minister. It was only after his help that the oxygen supply reached Delhi,” Sisodia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-oxygen-quota-hiked-but-situation-still-critical/articleshow/82189827.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Goa||Goa: Staggered timings, 50% staff at governnment offices till April 30||PANAJI: Due to an unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases, government offices will function with restricted staff. Fifty percent of group ‘C’ employees will work in staggered timings and department heads will divide them into three batches, a state government order issued by the secretary for general administration stated. These instructions will be in force till April 30. Police, home guards, civil defence, fire and emergency services, disaster management, prison, treasury, district administration, forest department and municipal services will function as usual. But all other state government departments, semi-government organisations, autonomous bodies and aided institutions of the Goa government will work with restricted staff. “Group ‘A’ and ‘B’ officers shall attend. Group ‘C’ and level below that may attend up to 50% of strength, as per requirement to ensure social distancing. However, delivery of public services shall be ensured, and necessary staff will be deployed for such purpose,” the order by secretary Ravi Dhavan stated. “Remaining shall work from home on alternate day basis (absolutely essential staff may attend on a daily basis). It is suggested that the working hours for all employees who attend the office on a particular day should also be staggered,” Dhavan said. Three groups of employees may be formed to work from 9am to 4pm, 9.30am to 5pm and 10am to 5.30pm. Those who are working from home should be available over the phone and other means of electronic communication at all times and should also attend office if called and if there is any exigency of work, the order stated. “The departments are requested not to convene meetings unless it is essential and avoid asking field functionaries to come to the head office in a routine manner. Further, visitors should be avoided to visit the office. Effort should be made to do the work through video conferencing, etc, instead of regular meetings,” Dhavan stated. It has also been advised to instruct staff to remain at home if they have symptoms like cough, cold, fever, or if they are short of breath, etc. “The doctor’s advice and prescription be made available to the head of department digitally for information,” the order stated. All employees have also been advised to get themselves vaccinated. “Crowding of lifts, staircases, corridors, common areas, including refreshment kiosk and parking areas, is to be strictly avoided and proper cleaning and frequent sanitisation of workplace, particularly of frequently touched surfaces may be ensured. All heads of departments shall ensure that employees maintain proper social distancing in the office and the use of masks, sanitisers and frequent hand washing be encouraged,” the secretary’s order read. Those assigned duties to control spread of Covid-19 will continue to work, the order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/staggered-timings-50-staff-at-govt-offices-till-april-30/articleshow/82187336.cms||---

Sources said 144 villagers from Aabanali, which has a population of 300, took rapid antigen test on Tuesday and their results turned out to be positive. Most of them worked as daily-wage labourers in Maharashtra and returned home after the neighbouring state imposed tough Covid-19 restrictions to stem the rising tide of fresh infections there. Panic has set in since most of the villagers frequently travel to Goa and Maharashtra.Village sealed till tests are doneDistrict health officer Shashikanth Muniyal said confirmatory RT-PCR tests will be conducted and said they have sealed the village. He said the villagers may have picked up infection in Maharashtra. Panic has set in since most of the villagers frequently travel to Goa and Maharashtra and return home without any stringent health checks at the border. On Tuesday, some villagers visited a government health centre in the village complaining of mild fever and body ache. Following this, health officers conducted the contact-tracing exercise and tested most villagers only to find 144 of them turning positive. Marithi, a villager, said it all started on April 10 when three people got themselves tested in the village. He alleged that health workers did not conduct the tracing exercise immediately. Villagers, instead of isolating themselves at home, allegedly roamed about the village before a large number started complaining of Covid-like symptoms. Mass testing was conducted after 23 people visited the health centre saying they were running a temperature.

---||Surat||Doctors inject music into Covid workers, patients for spiritual uplift||Surat: Heenaben, admitted in Covid-19 hospital of New Civil Hospital (NCH), woke up to a musical morning when a motley group of doctors and nurses in the ward started belting out popular chart busters early on Wednesday morning. The magical mood caught on and Heenaben couldn’t resist the urge to inform them that it happened to be her birthday too. And there was no stopping the young spirits from wishing her many more happy returns with the hit from golden oldies, “Bar bar ye din aye...” The others in the ward too warmed up to the mood and clapped and wished the woman good health and happiness. In what was an attempt to bust overall stress in the over-worried campus, the singing arrangement by the team of doctors not only stopped with the enlivening of patients and health workers’ moods but even embraced anxious relatives waiting outside. Covid-19 patients are admitted at three different facilities in NCH depending upon their health conditions. Out of total 1500 beds nearly 200 are vacant. Two teams of doctors were formed, one to motivate the health workers and another of those who can sing or play music. Members of one team met the workers who keep the hospital clean and look after support services and motivated them. The health workers were awarded badges ‘Main Bhi Corona Warrior’ to put on their uniform. “We thanked the health workers and awarded them badges. While the patients and their relatives were entertained through singing to reduce their stress as well,” said Dr Kamlesh Dave of the psychiatry department. Senior doctors also joined the event and motivated the doctors and other health workers. A singing and dancing session was held with nursing students as well. “The healthcare workers are the backbone of the hospital since they are continuously doing duty without leaves. We clapped for them and thanked them for their efforts,” said Dr Mayur Jarag, in-charge of NCH blood bank. “We regularly counsel patients but the event today was on a bigger scale. We will continue these events to create positivity in patients and health workers,” said Dr Ritambhara Mehta, dean Government Medical College (GMC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/doctors-inject-music-into-covid-workers-patients-for-spiritual-uplift/articleshow/82185089.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: After oxygen crisis, state ropes in more suppliers||PANAJI: Since Sunday the government has been trying its level best to maintain the supply of medical oxygen to hospitals even as a similar shortage is being felt across the country. All government hospitals in the state until last week relied on a single supplier, who could not meet the exceptional rise in demand in the face of the surge in Covid-19 cases. The government’s sole dependence on Scoop Industries Pvt Ltd (Scoop Oxygen), a source said, has dissuaded other players from setting up manufacturing units. “The state would have been in a better position today if it had more than one company supplying oxygen to government hospitals,” the source said. Health minister Vishwajit Rane, however, said the state no longer relies on a single source and that the “government of India has identified a source” and that they “have been getting it from JSW and several other suppliers”. “The company (Scoop Oxygen) was appointed on a nomination basis last year to supply oxygen to Covid hospitals when the requirement was much less compared to this year,” Rane said. The health minister said, “We (the administration) are coordinating the supply of liquid oxygen. We want a supplier who can supply as well do the logistics.” On Sunday, the state’s supply of oxygen hit rock bottom and crisis was averted after Rane tapped his contacts to get the supply, including from Kerala. Scoop Oxygen has a long-term agreement with the government of Goa to supply medical oxygen to all government hospitals as well government-run health centres and community health centres with limited beds. Chairperson of Scoop Oxygen Sanjeev Naik said that until Covid happened the state’s daily requirement of medical oxygen was 500 cylinders, which has now gone up 4,000 to 5,000 per day. “My capacity is 2,500 cylinders per day. Already one tanker carrying liquid oxygen has reached Goa. Another is coming on Friday. It takes 22 to 24 hours for it to reach Goa by road,” Naik said. He said that if not for the intervention of the health minister things would have been difficult as he used his sources to ensure Goa receives oxygen. Govind Poy Oxygen Ltd, a South Goa-based manufacture and who was a major supplier of medical oxygen to government hospitals until a decade ago, shut two of its units after it lost its contract with the Goa government. “We now only supply to private hospitals and we were roped in only three days ago to supply oxygen to the South Goa district hospital,” said an official of Govind Poy Oxygen Ltd. The company has oxygen manufacturing units in other states, but not in Goa. The official said that they plan to activate their existing plant in the next two days with its existing resources, but subject to assistance from the government. “To start a new plant from a scratch it takes at least six months,” he said. Govind Poy Oxygen Ltd’s supply of liquid oxygen comes from Maharashtra, but the state has put a stop to export in view of its growing need for medical oxygen cylinders. The company official said they are now relying on the Goa government to intervene and help tide over the crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-oxygen-crisis-state-ropes-in-more-suppliers/articleshow/82187383.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Goa||South Goa hospital to scale up by 75 beds today||PANAJI: The South Goa district hospital had 53 admissions on Tuesday and is almost filled, with only around a dozen beds vacant. The hospital which has 318 beds commissioned is expected to scale up by another 75 beds on Thursday. Its liquid oxygen system has started functioning, in addition to the oxygen trolleys that it is dependent on. It required as many as 17 trolleys each with 48 cylinders, over the past 24 hours. “Police escort the oxygen trolleys from Verna to the hospital and back, round the clock,” an official said. After the hospital’s requirement for oxygen rose with the influx of patients, it has begun avoiding any wastages. There are staff monitoring patients who are not so serious and who just remove the oxygen mask without turning off the outlet while heading to the toilet or for a walk. “Oxygen is like a drug and is as important as Remdesivir. We are keeping a watchful eye on oxygen outlets. It’s not the people who are serious and on the bed who we are monitoring, but those who have moderate infection and who take a break and go for tea or for a walk by removing their mask with the oxygen on. We want to eliminate this wastage too,” a doctor said. The hospital’s nine-bed ICU and nine-bed ITU have no vacant beds. Patients who don’t require oxygen or injectables anymore are sent to the step-down ESI hospital at Margao or the Ponda sub-district hospital. When asked about the rise in Covid-19 mortalities, a health official attributed it to “high virulence, late presentation and bad comorbidities”. On Wednesday, the ESI hospital had 45 beds vacant, with 105 out of its 150 beds occupied. Its ICU and ITU are yet to become functional. The Ponda sub-district hospital, with a capacity of accommodating 63 Covid patients, began admitting mild to moderate ones referred from the South Goa district hospital on Tuesday. It presently has 10 patients, both male and female, with fever and other symptoms. The patients are referred from the South Goa district hospital after their scans are taken and assessed there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-goa-hospital-to-scale-up-by-75-beds-today/articleshow/82187410.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Goa: Government doctors await isolation facility as 11 test Covid positive||PANAJI: Despite 11 doctors of the Goa Medical College (GMC) and South Goa district hospital contracting Covid-19 over the last couple of days — test reports of five more were awaited as of Wednesday — the state government is yet to provide them with an isolation facility. Most of these are resident doctors who have been shouldering maximum responsibility in Covid wards. Some have even clocked 12 hours of work a day amid a spike in infections in the state. TOI had reported on April 20, 2021 that in the absence of a dedicated isolation facility, some of the doctors who had gotten infected were left with no choice but to arrange for their own quarantine accommodation at friends’ or colleagues’ residences. While health minister Vishwajit Rane had told reporters on Monday that arrangements for an isolation facility for doctors would be made, president of the Goa Association of Resident Doctors (GARD), Dr Pratik Sawant, told TOI that as of Wednesday evening, they were yet to hear from the government. Sawant said that since most resident doctors stay at the college hostel, a dedicated isolation facility for those testing positive was needed to prevent others in the hostel from being exposed to the virus. The problem, he said, has been accentuated as at least four to five doctors who have contracted Covid-19 are from outside Goa. “Goan doctors have gone to their home and isolated themselves, and others have been to forced to make their own arrangements,” he said. Another doctor from the GMC who did not want to be named, said that apart from work fatigue, they now have the additional worry of the lengths they might have to go to if they test positive. “Remaining on the hospital premises after testing positive is not an option. With such a huge growth in cases over the past few days, a new ward has to be opened everyday. If any resident doctor falls ill after contracting the virus, I worry if there will be a bed for him,” the doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-docs-await-isolation-facility-as-11-test-covidve/articleshow/82187424.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses grandma’s plea to take 4 kids to Afghanistan||MUMBAI: Refusing the plea of an Afghan national to take her four paternal grandchildren to Kabul, the Bombay high court has said they are better off in India than in war-torn Afghanistan. “It is also a matter of record that Afghanistan has been a war-torn country for the past few years, which has had its own impact on the socio-political conditions in the said country. In terms of such socio-political conditions, the situation in India is certainly different and better,” said Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale in their April 20 verdict on a habeas corpus petition filed by Pashton Dawlaty (79) and her daughter. They filed the plea to produce the grandchildren who are Afghan nationals. Dawlaty’s son who was studying in Mumbai fell in love with an Indian girl. They married in July 2010 and he took her to Kabul. But he was killed in May 2017, when government planes against terrorist forces bombarded the city. His wife returned to Kalyan in February 2018 with her children to live with her brother and parents. During her January 2020 visit, Dawlaty found them living in “poor condition in a one room house which is not good for the proper development of the children and they hardly have any opportunity to develop their personality”. She requested they come and live together in their spacious Kabul home. Her petition said her three sons in the US are also ready to help. But in her reply, the daughter-in-law said she earns a reasonable income and her brother looks after her and her children’s needs. She is apprehensive about returning to a country where violence and danger to life are constant companions. She said Dawlaty herself is dependent on others and none of her sons have supported the petition. “We are of the opinion that sending the children to Afghanistan has the likelihood of causing physical and psychological harm to them, which is a factor of great significance...,” said Justice Pitale. The judges said in their in-chambers interaction with the children, they all looked happy in the company of their siblings, were well-dressed and healthy. The judges said,“...on the test of best interest and welfare of the children, it would be appropriate that they continue in the custody of their mother” which, in any case, is neither illegal nor improper. The judges, however, allowed the petitioners visitation rights and audio/video calls on weekends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-refuses-grandmas-plea-to-take-4-kids-to-afghanistan/articleshow/82189825.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Loss after loss leaves families in deep shock||BENGALURU: A family from RT Nagar was at the Indian Christian Cemetery a few days ago to perform the last rites of their 70-year-old matriarch who died of Covid. Even as the grief-stricken relatives trailed out of the burial ground, they received a call that the woman’s daughter too had died of the infection. The second Covid surge appears to be more cruel than the first, with many families reporting the death of young people, mainly in their 30s, and two or three victims from the same family. Last Saturday, a 34-year-old man who worked at a car showroom in Gandhinagar died of Covid-19. “He was healthy and was living with his wife and mother... He and his colleagues tested positive and he remained in home isolation,” said a relative. He developed chest congestion on Saturday and was rushed to Sparsh Hospital in RR Nagar but he died soon after. His elderly mother, broken after his death, developed breathing difficulties and passed away less than 24 hours after her son’s last rites, a relative tearfully recalled. Then there’s hope against hope. A 31-year-old techie from Whitefield infected with Covid was showing signs of recovery and shifted out of the ICU of a private hospital. On Sunday, he developed complications and passed away. He is survived by his wife.

---||Noida||Noida: Hospital asks family to get oxygen for siblings, both die||GHAZIABAD/NOIDA: Hospitals in both cities have been complaining about acute shortage of oxygen supply for more than two days now, although the local administrations have claimed that the situation is under control. On Wednesday afternoon, an official at a prominent hospital in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram said they have oxygen for just six hours, and will have to start discharging Covid patients if the supply runs out. Few kilometers away in Noida’s Barola, two brothers admitted to a private Covid facility died within eight hours of each other earlier this week, even after their family members managed to arrange for oxygen cylinders on their own. Sunil Gehlot (43) and Natwar Gehlot (41) had complained about difficulty in breathing on April 17. Their oxygen levels had dropped below 90. But without a Covid test report, hospitals refused to take them in, the family members have said. Non-Covid facilities also turned them away as the siblings had Covid-like symptoms. The family finally managed to get them admitted at Navin Hospital, Alpha 2, on Sunday morning. “But the management asked us to arrange for oxygen for them. We got two 10kg cylinders and gave those to the hospital on Sunday evening,” said Nitin Kumar, Natwar’s brother-in-law. A hospital official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said there has been a shortage of oxygen for the past four days, and that they are focusing on those currently admitted and not taking any new patients. On Monday night, the condition of both brothers started deteriorating. Sunil died around 8pm that day and his younger brother at 4am on Tuesday on a ventilator bed. While Sunil ran a printing press, Natwar was an advocate. Both have two children. Their eldest sibling had Covid-like symptoms and he is recovering at home. His samples have been sent for tests. At least 12 hospitals in both cities reported oxygen shortage on Wednesday again. The situation was particularly worse at a government hospital in Sector 39 of Noida, which asked for the supply twice on Wednesday. Promhex and Sharma hospitals in Greater Noida and Bhardwaj Hospital in Noida’s Sector 29 have also reported a huge demand for oxygen. In Ghaziabad, a recently acquired Covid facility said on Wednesday afternoon that it had only six hours’ oxygen supply left. Despite repeatedly flagging the issue, the administration has not responded, officials at the hospital have said. The facility has 25 Covid patients. “We have been told by a reliable source at Shanti Gopal hospital that their oxygen stock is very less and since all 25 patients need oxygen support, the stock will last for about six hours,” said an attendant of a patient at the hospital. “The officials will have no other option but to discharging patients after that,” he added. While the demand remains high, factors like storage, transportation, availability of key components like pipes, nozzles and masks that are attached to cylinders, and other supporting infrastructure play an important role in ensuring a steady supply, an official said. Asked about the crisis, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said: “We are following up with senior officials in an attempt to augment the supply and have asked them to intervene in order to restore supply from Haryana. The oxygen plant in Surajpur has been asked to work in multiple shifts and an official there remains deputed at the plant through the day to coordinate with the plant staff members.” In Noida, family members of Preetam Dutta (41), who died recently, claimed that the hospital where he was admitted did not inform them about the death on time. The software engineer who stayed at Gaur City tested positive on April 13. “At that time, we did not have to struggle to get him admitted and he was allocated Sharda Hospital. But his condition kept deteriorating and we got no information from the hospital, despite giving two units of plasma for him. He died at 10.20pm on Tuesday but we were informed only at 7am the next day. Some of his belongings were missing from the hospital. When we asked for those, hospital management called in some bouncers to talk to us,” said Pratim, Preetam’s younger brother. Sharda Hospital spokesperson Ajeet Kumar said they are looking into the matter. “We regret the incident and are trying to verify the facts. Belongings of a patient are handed over to the family members and an inventory is prepared during the time of admission itself. We are looking at what led to the confusion in this case,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/hospital-asks-family-to-get-oxygen-for-siblings-both-die/articleshow/82189839.cms||Abhijay Jha

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Staff crunch sees Covid doctors do double shifts||BENGALURU: Their endurance stretched to near breaking point, a handful of doctors at Yelahanka General Hospital in Bengaluru have beseeched fellow medical experts working in NGOs for help as they battle to treat 33 Covid-19 patients, all with moderate to severe forms of the disease. The Covid-19 ward has only five doctors who work more than 12-hour shifts. Ideally the hospital should have had a minimum 12 doctors working in three-shifts. “We have been having a rough time,” admitted a duty doctor. “We not only must treat ill patients, but also diagnose walk-in patients. In between walk-ins and constantly checking parameters of in-patients, we must communicate with patients’ relatives — all this wearing PPE. It leaves us dehydrated within an hour, adding to the stress.” Each doctor wears three sets of PPE a day. The breaks between changing PPE is also used to complete paperwork and have meals. Six nurses share the Covid ward workload with the five doctors. A weekly off is a luxury, the staffers said. With about a dozen patients needing oxygen, hospital staff also must monitor oxygen stock. For the past three days, the hospital has been struggling to get oxygen cylinders, doctors said. Due to the acute shortage of key staff, the hospital’s five ICU beds are not functional. The hospital has an anaesthetist but given the doctor’s age and lack of other skilled human resources, the ICU has remained shut. The hospital sees a minimum 15 walk-ins a day, many of whom have severe symptoms. Some do not have Covid positive certificates or SRF IDs. “In such cases, we conduct a rapid antigen test to confirm infection. All such patients are first stabilised and since beds are full, we have to coordinate with 108 ambulance helpline and BBMP authorities to shift them to other hospitals,” said a doctor. The doctors also said patients rarely understand limitations like lack of beds and the non-functional ICU. “Patients’ families do not understand these realities. They only want the person to be admitted,” another doctor said. “For critical patients who need to be treated on a ventilator, we have to find beds in other hospitals. We are unable to treat such patients in our hospital. The lack of trust among the public in doctors is only adding to our stress.” Yelahanka General Hospital is the only government hospital in north Bengaluru treating Covid patients. When contacted, Dr Asma Tabassum, administrative medical officer of the hospital, said higher authorities have been informed of the staff crunch. “It has been tough for these doctors. We have sought help of the NGO, Doctors For You. They have agreed to depute two doctors soon,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-staff-crunch-sees-covid-doctors-do-double-shifts/articleshow/82189850.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The IAF did not disclose the number of aircraft that landed in India but people familiar with the development said four jets were part of the new batch. The IAF said mid-air refuelling to the fleet was provided by the air forces of France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). "After a direct ferry from #MerignacAirBase, France, the 5th batch of Rafales arrived in India on 21 Apr. The fighters flew a distance of almost 8,000 Kms with air-to-air refuelling support by @Armee_de_lair and UAE AF. IAF thanks both the Air Forces for their co-operation," it said in a tweet.

The IAF chief also visited a Rafale aircraft training centre on the third day of his five-day visit to the European country. "Air Chief Mshl RKS Bhadauria on an official tour to France lauds pilots & sees off the next batch of Rafales on a non stop flight to India with mid air refueling by French Air force & UAE. Thanks France esp FASF & French Industry for timely delivery & pilot training on schedule despite covid," the Indian embassy in France wrote on Twitter. In his brief remarks, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said some of the Rafale aircraft have been delivered a "little bit" ahead of time and it has contributed to the overall combat potential of the IAF. Ahead of his visit, military officials in Delhi said Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria's trip to France is expected to boost cooperation between the IAF and the French Air and Space Force (FASF). "This ferry, which is the fifth from here, marks the end of the third batch of our pilots and all our maintenance crew. The Rafale training centre has provided world-class training and it is because of the level and quality of training that we were able to operationalise the aircraft quickly," he said. The IAF chief also thanked the French government and the French air force for providing the required support for the training programme as well as for the ferrying of the aircraft to India. The arrival of the new batch of the aircraft will pave the way for the IAF to raise a second squadron of Rafale jets. The new squadron will be based at the Hasimara air base in West Bengal. The first Rafale squadron is based at the Ambala air force station. A squadron comprises around 18 aircraft. India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore. With the arrival of the new batch, the number of Rafale jets with the IAF has gone up to 18. The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29 last year. On Tuesday, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria held talks with General Philippe Lavigne, Chief of Staff of the FASF, on ways to further expand cooperation between the two sides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fifth-batch-of-rafale-fighter-aircrafts-arrive-in-india/articleshow/82189856.cms||---
---||Noida||Making hay in the black market: Remdesivir sold at Rs 40,000, oxygen cylinder at Rs 35,000||NOIDA: Doctors say it’s not a wonder drug and have cautioned against its indiscriminate usage, but in the black market, Remdesivir continues to thrive. The latest Remdesivir hoarder to be busted is a 31-year-old Delhi resident, who made a killing selling each injection for anywhere between Rs 15,000 and Rs 40,000 since March, finding most of his customers through WhatsApp groups, police said. Remdesivir is a drug only meant for hospital use and cannot be sold anywhere else. But Rachit Ghai found plenty of customers who would cough up many times the MRP – Remdesivir is sold under different brand names by companies and the price varies widely, beginning at just under Rs 1,000. Ghai had sourced the injections from an accomplice and had been selling them across Noida. The injections were procured from agents in Chandigarh and Delhi’s Dwarka, police said. Sources said the injections were pilfered from a company unit or a hospital. Ghai was in possession of 100 vials of the injection when he was arrested. At least five of those vials are Bangladesh-made. Ghai, who lives in Delhi’s Saraswati Vihar, had been active on certain WhatsApp groups that people dealing with medical emergencies joined, police sources said. “We got information that some persons had been selling Remdesivir to patients’ families for a high price. The accused was active on Facebook and other social media platforms from where the information was received and action taken. He sourced most of the vials from Chandigarh and some five-six vials from Delhi,” DCP (crime) Abhishek Singh told TOI. Singh added that Ghai initially sold the injections for a low margin but became greedy and jacked up his quote. Ghai worked at a cardboard factory in Delhi but shifted to Noida in March after it shut down. A police officer said Ghai has claimed to have sold around 150 injections since March. “But we think it is much more than that. He is associated with a bigger agent who has supplied the injections to him,” Singh said. Cops are looking for a Haryana-based man, who they believe is the main supplier. A police officer said since the injection was sourced by the accused in bulk, the batch numbers of the injections were being scanned to verify where they were manufactured. Ghai has been booked under IPC sections 420 (cheating) and various sections of the Drug and Cosmetics act, 1940. He has also been booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act. A Santro and Rs 1.54 lakh in cash was seized from the accused. Police are also investigating black-marketing of oxygen, for which there is huge demand. Several oxygen cylinder providers in Harola told TOI they had run out of supplies and didn’t know when they would be available. A youth, meanwhile, allegedly circulated advertisements stating oxygen cylinders were available for Rs 30,000 out of which Rs 5,000 would be refunded on the cylinder being returned. Monu, whose number was circulated on Twitter, had called patients to the Sector 62 metro station to sell the cylinders. Besides, some sellers are forcing people to buy an entire oxygen cylinder rather than give a refill, which costs Rs 500-600. A seller from Kalindi Kunj this correpsondent spoke to offered a cylinder for Rs 35,000 and promised to deliver it in Noida.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/making-hay-in-the-black-market-remdesivir-sold-at-rs-40000-oxygen-cylinder-at-rs-35000/articleshow/82187715.cms||Shikha Salaria

Currently PTE is focusing on PPE kits for 108 ambulance staff.  “108 service staff do get PPE kits and other protective gears, but we have designed and developed the protective gear that can be used multiple times after sanitizing. This will reduce the waste generation and improve its availability,” said Darshan Desai, volunteer of PTE. The kits were developed using locally available material and can be used for at least six months.“Safety of health workers is of paramount important in the current times and 108 staff is playing a key role in the entire health infrastructure,” said Dr Gunjan Puri, part of the team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/new-shields-frontline-warriors-get-better-protective-gear/articleshow/82185110.cms||---

Vikas is the brother of key accused Vinay Mishra, who is on the run. The CBI had recently quizzed Vikas in the presence of another key accused, Anup Majee. Kundu had pleaded that Vikas was suffering from liver ailments and should not be kept in CBI custody. He was released on a personal bond of Rs 5 lakh and is currently admitted to SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, the lawyer said. Earlier, Enforcement Directorate had arrested Vikas in Delhi, but a court there granted him interim bail last week on the basis of his medical records. The ED had mentioned in court that it took up the probe because “proceeds of the crime were parked outside the country” and for which a money laundering case had been started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/coal-scam-vikas-mishra-gets-bail-on-health-grounds/articleshow/82187622.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Kolkata||Vaccination for all in Bengal from May 5, Rs 100 crore set aside for purchase: CM Mamata Banerjee||MALDA/KOLKATA: Vaccination for all citizens above 18 years will kick off in Bengal on May 5, three days after the election results are declared, CM Mamata Banerjee announced on Wednesday. The Centre had on Monday announced the widening of the inoculation ambit to cover all adults from May 1. “Universal vaccination will start in the state from May 5 for those aged 18 years and above. We have allocated Rs 100 crore for the purchase of Covid vaccines from the market,” Banerjee announced during a media interaction in Malda. The amount allocated will allow the state to buy 25 lakh doses of Covishield at the price announced by the Serum Institute of India on Wednesday. While SII has fixed the sale price to state governments at Rs 400, private hospitals will have to purchase the vaccine at Rs 600 per dose. The CM questioned the difference in the price at which the Centre had purchased the vaccines — Rs 150 per dose — and the price that one of the manufacturers had quoted for sale to the states. Vaccines purchased by the Centre are being administered free at government-run vaccination centres and costs Rs 250 per dose in private hospitals. “There is a price anomaly. If the Centre gets a dose of the vaccine at Rs 150, why would the state pay Rs 400 for the same? Why is this discrimination? Don’t do business when people are facing a calamity. This is not acceptable. I will write to the PM for removal of such price anomaly,” the CM said. Till date all states have been getting their share of vaccines free from the pool procured directly by the central government. The Bengal CM had been asking the Centre to allow the state to procure the vaccines directly as it wants to vaccinate its entire population free of cost. “So far 93 lakh people in Bengal have been vaccinated. We immediately need 1 crore more vaccine doses from the Centre. We will buy some vaccines to plug the demand-supply gap,” the CM said. The state had scaled up its inoculation capacity to vaccinate over 4 lakh people a day on a number of occasions. The drive, however, has hit a bump in the past couple of weeks due to inadequate supply of vaccine, leading to the scaling down of the target. Private hospitals said on Wednesday they are awaiting further clarity on the issue before they go ahead with their procurement plans. “There is already a discussion among all the 28 Fortis hospitals across the country. But different state governments may have different guidelines or protocols. We need to wait for these,” said Richa Debgupta senior vice president Fortis Hospitals. Simmardeep Gill COO CK Birla Hospitals CMRI said that they will also wait for a more clarity on how to go about procuring the vials on their own. “We can start procuring our stock once we get a clear guideline from the authorities concerned,” said Alok Roy chairman Medica Group of Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-for-all-in-bengal-from-may-5-rs-100cr-set-aside-for-purchase-cm/articleshow/82188145.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Kolkata||Triple-mutant ‘Bengal strain’ a new worry in second wave||KOLKATA: The Covid-19 virus that is doing the rounds in Bengal is increasingly being found to be an indigenous triple-mutation (B.1.618), only the second one identified from India after the double mutant type (B.1.617) reported last month. The “Bengal strain”, as a scientist has dubbed it, might be more infective, and — something that experts find particularly worrying — may be capable of escaping a person’s immune surveillance, even if that person was earlier exposed to a virus without this mutation, and even if vaccinated. There has, however, been no research yet to either corroborate or dismiss the fears. “The proportion of B.1.618 has been growing significantly in recent months in Bengal,” said Vinod Scaria, who researches genome mutations at the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) on Twitter, adding, “along with B.1.617 it forms a major lineage in West Bengal”. The IGIB is part of the Indian SARS-Cov-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG), which was set up to monitor and study whether Indians were getting foreign variants through travellers. It was during these studies that the double mutant variant (containing the E484Q and L452R mutations) were identified, mainly from Maharashtra samples. The sequencing of the viral genomes collected from eastern India is carried out by the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG), Kalyani, around 50km from Kolkata. The institute houses one of 10 Indian labs working across the country on sequencing genomes from coronavirus patients. It was the NIBMG that first sequenced the Bengal strain from a patient on October 25 last year. By January this year, it was found to have proliferated in fairly large numbers. Data submitted from India to GISAID, a global science initiative and primary source established in 2008 that provides open-access to genomic data of influenza viruses, show B.1.618 is the third-most common variant sequenced in the last 60 days across the country, causing nearly 12% of the cases. The double-mutated B.1.617, at 28%, is the most common among sequences, followed by B.1.1.7 (the UK variant). What’s worrying to scientists is that the triple-mutated variant carries the E484K mutation, a characteristic of the South African and Brazilian variants. “E484K is known to be an immune escape variant, which means that previously raised antibodies against a virus without this mutation may be less effective in inhibiting the virus from infecting and causing disease in humans. This includes antibodies raised from vaccines,” said NIBMG associate professor Sreedhar Chinnaswamy. In other words, you may not be safe from this variant if you had previously been infected by another strain of the virus, or even if you have been vaccinated. “The Bengal strain (B.1.618)”, explained Chinnaswamy, “has four signature mutations that are distinct from the so-called ‘double mutant’ circulating in some parts of India in recent months,” adding, “It contains the now fixed D614G mutation, that can be called ‘the first variant’ to be identified from the virus that supposedly originated from Wuhan, China. It also has the E484K mutation.” A member of the team involved in the sequencing of the variant at the Kalyani-based institute, Chinnaswamy said the new variant has “deletions” in the spike protein. “These deletions are not in the region of the spike protein that contacts the human ACE2 receptor, and we don’t know what significance they may have in the viral infection cycle,” he said. Members of this Bengal lineage or variant have also been found in the US, Singapore, Switzerland and Finland. The variant was first found in a sample outside India on April 22, 2020. A majority of the cases in Maharashtra and Gujarat have been found to contain the double (E484Q and L452R) mutant variant, whereas Delhi and Punjab cases are mostly of the UK variant. No such pattern has yet been detected in south India. “This is yet another variant,” said immunologist Dipyaman Ganguly from CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata. “Interestingly, a lot of variants are coming up with similar mutations — E484K, also present in P.1 from Brazil, and 1.351 from South Africa — which is an immune escape variant. Perhaps these help the virus being more successful in infections and thus multiple variants are converging to similar mutations.” Watch Covid-19: Triple-mutant ‘Bengal strain’ is a new worry in second wave||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/triple-mutant-bengal-strain-a-new-worry-in-second-wave/articleshow/82188085.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Mamata: Covid second wave is a ‘Modi-made disaster’||Balurghat/Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday held Prime Minister Narendra Modi responsible for “this emergency”, alleging that the Covid second wave was a “Modi-made disaster” and not man-made disaster. “And now when corona is spiralling, he is putting the onus on people to control it. Why? Have you fled?” she said. “Modi should be held responsible for this emergency. He couldn’t arrange to vaccinate his own people but could export vaccines to other countries.” “Mere speeches,” she continued, “will not do. Provide vaccines or quit, control Covid or resign.” Banerjee further said: “Corona cases had reduced significantly. They have imported it again. This is only due to the total incompetency of the prime minister and the Union government. It is a monumental failure on their part. Now corona has resurfaced again. I would urge you to be cautions.” “We wanted elections to be completed in a day. Now, three phases (of polling) remain. We had repeatedly pleaded if two or three phases can be clubbed together. The Election Commission chose not to heed our plea. It is up to them,” she said. Continuing her tirade, Banerjee said: “A useless Central government did nothing for the last five to six months. The Union health minister said that we have put Covid behind; then how did it happen now? And now you have unleashed lakhs of outsiders to campaign in Bengal. Can you guarantee that they will not spread the disease?” She added that “65% of our vaccines have been sent to foreign countries. The country now has no vaccines, no oxygen. And now my workload has increased. I have to handle Covid (in Bengal) and do this too (election campaigning for her party)”. Underlining the complexity of the problem in poll-bound Bengal, the CM said: “Now central forces have arrived in Bengal, central observers too have arrived. We had to spare homes for them, we had to hand over stadiums. Due to this, we are having problems setting up safe houses.” “Despite the constraints,” she said, “we have taken over several places. We have identified 100 hospitals (in Bengal) for Covid treatment. Tele-counselling will also start. You can get treatment from home. But do not waste your vote, even if you are unwell.” Banerjee said: “You will remain in peace if TMC remains. We are the only party that has never created any animosity among faiths.” Referring to the Sitalkuchi deaths on April 10 polling day, she said: “We need to avenge bullets with ballots. We have started investigations.” She added: “We do not want communal riots. We want peace.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-covid-second-wave-is-a-modi-made-disaster/articleshow/82187469.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Kolkata||EC spurns Trinamool plea to club last three phases||Kolkata: The Election Commission on Wednesday turned down a Trinamool Congress plea to club the remaining phases of polls in Bengal, saying that notifications had been issued for phases 6, 7 and 8 in keeping with the norms that require a minimum gap of 14 days between the last date of withdrawal of nomination and polling. “Suggestion to club Phase 6, 7 and 8 is not feasible,” the EC wrote to Trinamool MP Derek O’Brien in response to his letter submitted through Bengal chief electoral officer Ariz Aftab on Tuesday, citing the current Covid situation. A senior EC official argued holding polls to the remaining seats on a single day would also lead to shortage of central forces. The Trinamool letter had said 52 days of campaigning had already been availed by political parties and candidates. The EC response said: “You are aware that scheduling for an election is an activity planned much in advance, taking (into consideration) complex interplay of a variety of factors ranging from optimal utilisation of resources, manpower and training...” It stated that the total duration of polls had been reduced to 66 days, 11 days less than the same in 2016. It further said that the silence period had been extended to 72 hours, and the chief secretary and DEOs had been asked to strictly follow Covid safety norms. Following the EC’s response, Trinamool leader Yashwant Sinha tweeted: “Mamata requested EC to merge phases 6, 7 & 8 to prevent Covid. The EC has rejected her request.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-spurns-trinamool-plea-to-club-last-three-phases/articleshow/82187470.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||BJP hits back at Didi’s pandemic situation jibe against PM Modi||Kolkata: Bengal BJP leaders took potshots at chief minister Mamata Banerjee over her attempt to “politicize” the Covid situation with the “sole aim of bringing down the voter turnout” in the last three phases of polling. State BJP vice-president Jayprakash Majumdar pointed to “incongruities” in the CM’s version over the last two days and said: “Yesterday, the CM said she had been writing in vain to the Centre for vaccine stocks for the last six months. Today, she said that 93 lakh people in Bengal have been vaccinated. From where did the stocks come? Did the state government produce vaccines?” BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya blamed Banerjee for trying to pass the buck on her own “lack of planning” on Covid management to the Centre. Responding to her “Modi-made disaster” jibe, the BJP leader pointed to lack of infrastructure in Bengal to treat Covid patients. “Who made the decision to decrease Covid beds in state hospitals? Medical experts in the state health panel have been emphasizing the need to set up safe homes with cooperation from private players, NGOs and clubs. Where are they? The CM didn’t take a single meeting on Covid for the last three months. She didn’t even attend the meetings the Prime Minister has been holding with CMs,” Bhattacharya said. He wondered if the CM had taken the jab. “Her taking the jab would have motivated people to take the vaccine when stocks were lying unused in Bengal,” Bhattacharya said. The BJP leader rubbished the Trinamool Congress charge that PM Narendra Modi had shipped out vaccine doses to other countries depriving states such as Maharashtra, Delhi, Rajasthan and Bengal. “A total 13 crore people have been vaccinated. Going by the CM’s own admission, 93 lakh people have already got the jab. The Centre has dispatched 3.5 crore vaccine doses to other countries. How was the state deprived?” Bhattacharya said. He added that the Centre was sending vaccines to states under guidelines of the Union health ministry and Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). “The Modi government has decided to give 50% of vaccines to states free of cost and has allowed state governments to buy the remaining 50% from open market. This is a demand the Bengal CM has been making since long. The state government can buy vaccines and distribute it according to its plan free of cost,” Bhattacharya said. Responding to the CM’s allegation about the difference in vaccine procurement price between the Centre and the state, the BJP spokesperson said: “Vaccine manufacturing companies decide the price. Governments procure and distribute them at rates fixed by them. The Centre is giving 50% of the state’s requirements free. States also have some responsibility because health is a state subject.” On Wednesday, BJP leaders made it clear that the Centre wanted “coordination” with states to combat the pandemic and urged the Bengal government to drop its “confrontationist” attitude.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-hits-back-at-didis-pandemic-situation-jibe-against-pm-modi/articleshow/82187523.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Smriti taunts TMC for sending out Ram Navami greetings||Asansol: Greetings sent out from Trinamool Congress’ official social media handle to people on the occasion of Ram Navami came in handy for Union minister Smriti Irani to take on chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “Those who got irritated hearing ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans are now sending Ram Navami greetings. Didi, you insulted Lord Ram. Now you are sending messages after your khela has ended in Nandigram. You are still saying khela hobe. We are saying padmer mela hobe (lotus will bloom in Bengal),” Irani said in Asansol South while campaigning for BJP candidate Agnimitra Paul on Wednesday. The Union minister took a dig at outgoing Trinamool minister Moloy Ghatak without naming him. “I have been to Asansol North before coming here. I don’t know what he has done for the constituency, being a minister for the last 10 years. He couldn’t even supply safe drinking water to households. I want to tell you that PM Modi has released Rs 900 crore to Bengal for piped water supply. Where has the money gone?” she said. Irani then took to the polarization narrative, talking of how the Trinamool government had prevented Durga idol immersion in 2017. “We never thought of seeking permission from Trinamool toughs over arranging Durga idol immersion. They prevented students from performing Saraswati Puja in schools. Those who fought against the insult with the Bhagwan’s name on their lips will now press the lotus button. Didi has realized it. That is why she was doing Chandipath in Nandigram,” the Union minister said. Irani reminded the gathering how Trinamool “took away” the rations the Centre had sent for the Bengal poor during the pandemic. “PM Modi sent rations for you. Trinamool goons took them away. Tell me, can the daughter of a family steal rice from her family stock?” she said, taking a dig at the Trinamool campaign slogan, Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chai (Bengal wants its own daughter).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/smriti-taunts-tmc-for-sending-out-ram-navami-greetings/articleshow/82187518.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Kolkata||Shankha Ghosh, last ‘Pandava’ of Bengali lit, succumbs to Covid||KOLKATA: Iconic poet and thinker Shankha Ghosh, 89, passed away at his home around 11.30am on Wednesday, seven days after testing Covid-positive. He was in home isolation as he did not want hospitalisation. With this, Covid has dealt another blow to the Bengali cultural world after snatching actor Soumitra Chattopadhyay last November. Among the most respected names in contemporary Bengali literature, Ghosh was one of the ‘Pancha Pandavas’ — along with Shakti Chattopadhyay, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Binoy Majumdar and Utpal Kumar Basu — who gave a new identity to the Bengali literary world in the post-Jibanananda era. An intensely private man in personal life, Ghosh was very much vocal on social issues. Not only did he clearly express his views in his works, he also came out on the street to protest social wrongs on several occasions. He had clear political views, but never aligned with any particular political party. That is why, on the rare occasions he spoke — whether on Nandigram or more recently, on the Citizenship Amendment Bill — the literary world listened to him with awe and respect. His strong rebuttal to NRC — through his poem ‘Mati’ — won critical acclaim. Ghosh won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1977 for his book ‘Babarer Prarthana’. In 2011, he was awarded Padma Bhushan and in 2016 he received the Jnanpith Award. He was also honoured with Desikottama by Visva-Bharati. Ghosh, however, never let fame come in the way of his humility and simple living. He shook the Bengali literary world with his works like ‘Dinguli Raatguli’, ‘Panjore Dnarer Shabdo’, ‘Murkho Boro, Samajik Noy’, ‘Adim Lata-Gulmomay’, Mukh Dheke Jay Biggapone’ and ‘Babarer Prarthana’. The world knew him as Shankha Ghosh, but his official first name was Chittapriya. Born in Chandpur (now in Bangladesh) on February 6, 1932, he did his BA in Bengali language and literature from erstwhile Presidency College and subsequently did his post-graduation from the University of Calcutta. As a teacher, he groomed generations of students at Bangabasi College, City College and Jadavpur University. In 1967, he participated in the International Writing Program’s Fall Residency at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. He also taught at Delhi University, the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla, and Visva-Bharati. "He was a poet’s poet so far as his linguistic style and unique experimentation with meter is concerned. Not too many poets will be able to bring to form a line as unique as Panjore Dnarer Shabdo or ‘I hear my ribs rowing’! And at the same time, he was the common man’s poet when he wrote ‘Jamunabati Saraswati’," said poet Subodh Sarkar. He was widely considered to be an authority on Rabindranath Tagore. ‘E Amir Abaran’ that deals with the philosophy behind Tagore songs, ‘Nirman O Srishti’ and ‘Ocampor Rabindranath’ are some of his best-known books on Tagore. "Reading and analysing Tagore was his passion and he could so lucidly explain his thoughts that it never seemed like a lecture," said writer Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay, who knew the poet for over six decades. Ghosh was an impassioned observer of the society and its changes, taking up his razor-sharp pen — quite unlike his soft-spoken nature ? to protest atrocities and wrongs. He did not shy away from writing against any political colour when he felt the need to protest. "It was not easy to stay steadfast in one’s opinion, ignoring what the consequences might be. It didn’t matter to him. He wrote what he thought he should in the face of a crisis," said poet Srijato. Ghosh also wrote both poetry and prose for young readers. ‘Sob Kichhutei Khelna Hoy’, ‘Sokalbelar Alo’, ‘Supuriboner Sari’, ‘Chhotto Ekta School’ and ‘Ichhamotir Mosha’ are some of his best-loved children’s books. He spent a lot of time with Bengali linguistics and the etymology of Bengali spellings. He often wrote under the pen name Kuntak for this genre of writing. An extremely shy person since his student days, stories of how he had refused to recite at the University Senate Hall and had to be literally hounded by another legendary poet Subhas Mukhopadhyay is now legendary. He even refused to receive the best alumnus award of the Presidency University Alumni Association, because he loved to stay away from the limelight, said the association vice-president Bivas Chowdhury. "He, however, ensured that the award went to Nabaneeta Dev Sen in the conclusion of our bicentennial in 2018," Chowdhury added. Ghosh remained an inseparable part of the association. "At the inaugural of our bi-centennial, he walked from Vivekananda’s house to College Street, singing with past students," said Chowdhury. The alumni association will organise a virtual global condolence soon. Celebrated director Kumar Shahani deeply mourned the demise of the poet. "It was during the making of Char Adhyay’ that I interacted with him," he said over a telephonic conversation from Delhi. "It has a non-linear narrative, so I was looking for a different kind of enunciation of Tagore from the declamatory one that was current then, on stage and elsewhere. Shankha-da had a soft-spoken manner that worked for me. The mantle of Tagore had fallen on him. At author Sibaji Bandopadhyay's suggestion, two lines of a Tagore poem were combined with two lines by Shankha-da. On my request, he recited those lines in the film which essentially is on the impact of politics on personal lives and questions both, blind nationalism and blind hero worshipping of a leader." The 1997 film in Hindi, produced by NFDC, had to face a court case prior to its release, "and again, Shankha-da had mediated with the person and convinced him to drop the case," the grateful director says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shankha-ghosh-last-pandava-of-bengali-lit-succumbs-to-covid/articleshow/82187938.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The Centre expressed concern over the surge, particularly in the 146 districts with high positivity rate, and said the health system was facing strain because of the steep increase in new cases. Though 308 districts have a positivity rate less than 5%, the national case positivity rate is currently 17.9%. Read AlsoGrim record: Over 3.16 lakh new Covid-19 cases in India, highest ever for any countryThe massive second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic barrelled past another grim milestone as India reported nearly 3.16 lakh fresh cases on Wednesday, the highest single-day count recorded in any country so far. Deaths from the virus climbed to another high of 2,102 in the past 24 hours.While the age profile of cases remains largely the same as during the first wave, data shows that the share of deaths due to Covid-19 has increased among the elderly.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); During the first wave of the disease, 19.9% of deaths was recorded among people aged between 70 and 80 while 7.8% was among those aged above 80. In the second wave, deaths in the 70-80 group increased to 22.1% and in those above 80 years to 9.8%. Besides, there is also a marginal increase in deaths is the 30-40 years group. During the first wave, 5.2% of people died in this age bracket, whereas 5.3% died in the second wave. On Tuesday, 2,95,041 new cases were reported. While over 76% of new cases was from 10 states, Maharashtra continues to account for the highest daily cases. Five states — Maharashtra, UP, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Kerala — have more than 1 lakh active cases each. The Centre said all energies were focused on tackling the situation and come out of the pandemic when asked if the government had “missed” the second wave by taking its eye off the ball. “We are in the midst of the second wave and there is a surge. We cannot say when numbers will come down,” Indian Council of Medical Research director Balram Bhargava said. More than 13 crore vaccine doses were given till 8 pm on Wednesday. While 87% of all healthcare workers have received the first dose of vaccine, 80% have taken the second dose too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/positivity-rate-over-15-in-146-districts-5-15-in-274-others/articleshow/82189870.cms||Sushmi Dey

---||India||Maharashtra, UP, Gujarat to get most Remdesivir for 10 days||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday made an interim allocation of Remdesivir for 19 states and UTs till April 30. This was done to address reports of shortages of Remdesivir in certain regions of the country and to facilitate smooth inter-state supply. Live updates: Coronavirus“Remdesivir being an investigational therapy drug given in acute and severe versions of Covid-19 where oxygen support is a must, this allocation pertains to 14 states to which medical oxygen is allocated and five other states where the high volume of supplies are being observed,” the health ministry said in an official statement. Maximum allocation has been made for Maharashtra followed by UP, Gujarat, MP, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh. The allocation includes bulk purchases made by the states as well as supplies through private distribution channels. The initial allocation is dynamic and will be reviewed constantly in consultation with the states, to ensure all needs can be met within the available supplies.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); The health ministry said the escalation of serious Covid patients in hospitals for effective clinical management has also resulted in an increase in demand for Remdesivir. “While states have been advised to promote judicious use of the drug which is listed as an investigational therapy by the ministry, they have also been advised to take action against possible hoarding and black marketing,” the government said. The ministry said all states not covered by the above-mentioned allocation will be considered when their supply orders are placed with manufacturers. The government has also advised manufacturers to consider supply orders already made to them, proximity with a state and terms of supply, and give inputs for mapping of manufacturers to states for the allocated volumes. They have been directed to manufacture and dispatch the supplies as per the agreed state allocation and mapping. They have also been asked to balance supplies to the government and distribution channel. IAF deploys transport fleet to airlift meds, staffThe IAF has deployed its transport aircraft fleet of C-130J Super Hercules and AN-32s to airlift medical personnel, medicines and critical equipment in the fight against the raging pandemic. “The airlift is underway for Covid hospitals and facilities across the country.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Many turned away, centres shut, but officials say no vaccine shortage||CHENNAI: The state on Wednesday vaccinated 55,830 people even as several vaccine centres, including ones in Chennai, turned people away citing inadequate stock. This uncertainty has led beneficiaries to ask the government to display vaccine availability on the state webpage. After administering more than two lakh doses a day during the vaccine fest on April 15 and 16, Tamil Nadu is now recording a dip in daily vaccinations. Meanwhile, between Monday and Wednesday this week, the state has administered less than two lakh shots in total. Some UPHCs and hospitals said they neither had Covaxin or Covishield. Many other centres did not have Covaxin. People who took the first dose more than a month ago were advised to return in a day or two. “I went for the second dose of Covaxin, but I was asked to come back tomorrow. But, they are not sure if the stock will be available even tomorrow,” said 76-year-old R Thyagarajan, who went to a PHC in Virugambakkam. “I wish we have information about where vaccines are available every day so we can go accordingly.” Many centres in districts such as Madurai, Coimbatore and Trichy were closed on Wednesday. However, the directorate of public health said it dispatched 6 lakh doses of Covishield from the state vaccine store to all centres on Tuesday. Health minister C Vijayabaskar said there was no shortage in the state. “We have received 6 lakh doses of Covishield and have asked for another five lakh doses Covaxin, which is expected soon,” he said. As of 8am on Wednesday, the state had 8.48 lakh doses of vaccinesAbout 7,520 doses of Covaxin and 2.29 doses of Covishield were still in transit till afternoon for most parts of the districts. Coimbatore officials said they received 46,000 doses of Covishield vaccine, taking itsthe total stock to 67,320. On Wednesday morning, Coimbatore had nearly 21,000 doses, but hardly 3,051 people took the jab. “While there are complaints about centres being closed, many centres that are open did not see much crowd,” an official said. The number of recipients have been low since Saturday, the official added. In the last 87 days, the state has administered 49.23 lakh doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-many-turned-away-centres-shut-but-officials-say-no-vaccine-shortage/articleshow/82189940.cms||---
---||Raipur||Madhya Pradesh ex-deputy CM’s son held for brother, family’s murder||RAIPUR: The son, daughter-in-law and five-year-old granddaughter of former deputy CM of undivided Madhya Pradesh, Pyarelal Kanwar, were murdered in their home in Chhattisgarh’s Korba district in the early hours of Wednesday. The bodies of Harish Kanwar, his wife Sumitra and little Aashi were found with their throats slit and cuts on their bodies. The savagery of the attack indicated that someone close was involved. Police arrested Harish’s elder brother Harbhajan, his wife, brother-in-law and two aides. Killer may have also been hurt, says Korba SPThe knives used in the killings were recovered from a pond, and the bloodstained clothes of the accused, which they had tried to burn, have also been seized, say cops. Pyarelal Kanwar was deputy CM in the Digvijaya Singh government from 1993 to 1998. He died in 2011, and his family lives in Korba. Harish, who was the more politically influential member of the family, controlled financial and other key decisions, which often led to friction among his kin, say police. Korba SP Abhishek Meena said it was evident from the brutality of murder that the killer was either drunk or someone carrying a deep rage against the family. Signs of struggle indicated that the killers might have also got hurt. “CCTV footage showed Harish’s elder brother Harbhajan, his wife and two daughters going out for a walk at 4.15am. Within 3-4 minutes, two unidentified persons are seen entering the house with their faces covered. The attackers killed the three persons but didn’t hurt their (Harish and Harbhajan’s) mother who tried to intervene, pushed her aside. It was evident that the conspiracy was hatched by someone close,” he said. Police learned that Harbhajan’s brother-in-law Parmeshwar was admitted to hospital the same morning with injuries. “He said he was injured in an accident. His cellphone was registered in his minor niece’s name and messages were exchanged during the morning hours, one of which said, ‘Gate khula hai’,” Meena said. Police said Parmeshwar and an aide Ramprasad were waiting near the house since 2am. At 4am, after the message, they went in, murdered the three and fled. Within hours, police began rounding up Harbhajan, his wife, Parmeshwar, Ramprasad and a minor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/mp-ex-dy-cms-son-held-for-bro-familys-murder/articleshow/82189928.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||No vax stock, Centre to send 4L today: Pb min||Chandigarh: Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said on Wednesday that the state government has exhausted its stock of Covishield and Covaxin, but the central government has assured supply of four lakh vaccines on Thursday. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has also written to the Union health and family welfare minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, seeking uninterrupted oxygen supply from the Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) suppliers, with at least 120 MT daily allocation for the state, excluding (22 MT) of Punjab quota in supply to PGIMER, Chandigarh. He has reiterated his request for urgent steps for setting up two pending pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants approved by it two months ago. Sidhu said, “We need 15 lakh vaccines at a time from the central government to achieve our target of vaccinating 3 lakh persons in a day.” Criticising the Centre for its poor strategy in distribution of vaccines, he said either it is a case of bias against some states or there is a shortage due to less production, but proper monitoring is the Centre’s responsibility. With the central government firming up a new strategy for distribution of Covid-19 vaccines to states, factoring their requirement and wastage, Sidhu conceded that initially some vials had got wasted due to fear in people’s mind and misinformation spread by opposition parties in Punjab about the vaccines, but the wastage has now come down drastically. He added that the state government is fully prepared to handle the second Covid wave and has nearly 999 ventilators in various hospitals. There were 48 patients on ventilators in the state on Tuesday. On the issue of oxygen, the health minister said the government has sought release of more supply in the light of the increasing daily cases. He said Faridkot and Jalandhar have oxygen plants, but the central government is yet to sanction the oxygen plants at Patiala and Amritsar. He, however, said that only 480 patients were on oxygen support as on Tuesday. In his letter to Vardhan, Amarinder said since the main requirement of the state is fulfilled from outside, adherence of supply as per the allocation made by the Centre for all states, including Punjab, is critical to be able to meet the daily requirement. While the capacity for storage of medical oxygen for all healthcare facilities in the state is around 300 MT, daily consumption as per the present case load in Punjab is around 105-110 MT, the CM pointed out, adding that this was expected to further rise to around 150-170 MT in the next two weeks as per the projections of increase in hospital admissions. He said the Central Control Group on Oxygen had reduced allocation to 82 MT from the week of April 25, which would be grossly insufficient. Moreover, the clubbing of Punjab’s allocation with Chandigarh (22MT) further reduces its supply. The CM said the biggest constraint is that supply to the manufacturers/distributors and refillers for liquid oxygen is fulfilled by manufacturers from outside the state (Inox, Baddi, HP; Air Liquide Panipat & Roorkee; and Linde, Selaqui, Dehradun) as there is no LMO plant within the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-vax-stock-centre-to-send-4l-today-pb-min/articleshow/82187252.cms||---

Amidst huge shortages and rising infections, the government recently fast tracked access to vaccines by allowing foreign-manufactured jabs to be imported, by doing away with bridging trial studies prior to regulatory approval. Vaccines approved by Western regulators including the USFDA, UK’s MHRA & WHO will be granted emergency authorisation in India, with the company conducting post-approval parallel bridging studies in place of local clinical trials. Read AlsoOnly 2-4 infections per 10k found in those vaccinated with two doses: ICMRIn a strong validation of the utility of vaccines in combating Covid 19, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Wednesday said only 2-4 per 10,000 “breakthrough” infections were noted in people who were vaccinated against the disease. ICMR director Balram Bhargava underlined the importanceWith the Covid-19 scenario becoming serious in India, private hospitals are getting frantic calls from the well-heeled. Large hospitals chain like Apollo are figuring out the process after they received several inquiries on both Pfizer and Moderna jabs. “We are in talks internally, and are working out the modalities. The process could take a few months”, a senior company official told TOI. Enquiries particularly for the Pfizer vaccine have gone up since the government relaxation, Joy Chakraborty COO of Mumbai-based PD Hinduja Hospital said, “we are looking for vaccines of the Western world, which can complement indigenous vaccines”. The vaccines can be imported in ready-to-use vials or in a fill-and-use form, according to the government. Further, private hospitals have started talks with companies including Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Dr Reddy’s to place orders for vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-private-hospital-chains-in-talks-to-offer-imported-vaccines/articleshow/82189929.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

---||India||Covid-19: Govt to monitor prices of vaccines in open market||NEW DELHI: The government is working out a mechanism to monitor the prices of anti-Covid vaccines in the open market once the jabs are available for people above 18 years of age from May 1. While vaccine companies are free to price the vaccines supplied in the open market, hospitals and other vaccine providers are likely to charge an additional fee over it. The government plans to come out with a mechanism to keep a check on these prices even as prices will be initially governed by market dynamics, officials said. From May 1, as the new Covid-19 vaccination policy gets rolled out, private hospitals, states and corporate houses will be able to procure directly from manufacturers at a pre-fixed price for vaccination of those above 18 outside the central programme. However, vaccination will continue to be given free of cost to health and frontline workers and those above 45 years of age at government vaccination centres. Meanwhile, Biological E has completed phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for its locally developed Covid-19 vaccine candidate and is likely to start phase 3 very soon. The vaccine is expected to enter the market by August.

The condition that tourists from seven worst-hit states must carry a Covid negative report not older than 72 hours has caused more than 50,000 cancellations, 25,000 in just Manali. The four-month summer from March 15 to July 25 accounts for 65% of the state’s total annual revenue. Shimla Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association president M K Seth said tourists from Maharashtra and Gujarat were the biggest hotel clients in March and April and since 100% of their advance bookings were cancelled, the hotels have little operational money left after seven to eight months of complete closure last year. He said: “The report requirement has deterred even the business travellers.” In Manali, many hotels will pack up before the peak tourist season. Some have sent their staff home. Normally, this is the time of renovation, recruitment, bookings, and queries. May and June, the rooms run out and tourists have to spend nights in cars. Before curfew and curbs, their count between April and June used to be 15 lakh. Occupancy dipped below 10%, hotelier Chaman Kapoor has relieved half his staff. He said: “The next 10 days will decide if the hotel has to be closed.” A few days from closure, hotelier Budhi Parkash said: “I have zero bookings for days. Staying open means paying salaries and bills. With the hotels’ huge debt and overdue instalments, anyway the bank will come over and take the keys.” Kullu-Manali’s 3,500 hotels, guesthouses, and homestays are the state’s largest tourism hub and 75% of these properties run on seasonal business from mid-April to mid-July. Hoteliers had expected a gradual rise of footfall but it declined sharply. “It is heart-breaking,” said hotelier Vimpy Bakshi, “Our rooms are empty. How will we survive, pay salaries and bills, and get rid of bank liabilities? It’s curfew-like situation.” Manali hoteliers’ association president Anup Ram Thakur said: “To woo tourists, we offer extra hygiene, discounts, and assurance of personal care in case of a problem. The government has also said there’s no formality but some restrictions for the states where the cases have spiked have discouraged visitors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/second-wave-rocks-hp-hotel-industrys-boat/articleshow/82187435.cms||Suresh Sharma

And cumulatively, 1.2% of the population in these states have been fully inoculated with two doses, according to an analysis of data from the Union health ministry as of 7am on April 21. In absolute numbers, that works out to more than 10 crore people in these states put together receiving the first jab, and of them, 1.6 crore getting the full two doses. Nationally, 8.4% of India’s population have received the first dose, while 1.4% have been fully inoculated. As India gears up to allow vaccination for all those above 18 years, experts point to production and supply capacities and say focus must remain on priority populations. The health ministry data shows wide variations in the vaccination coverage among the 19 states. While two states have achieved over 15% coverage for the first dose, 10 states lag behind the national average; three, including Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, have not managed to cover even 5% of their population.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); JNCASR faculty: Only another 18 cr may be vaccinated by JulySantosh Ansumali and Meher K Prakash, faculty at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, say the massive effort is appreciable but point out that going by the present and projected supply capacity of vaccine-makers, India will only be able to vaccinate another 18 crore people by the end of July. A recent report by Lancet Covid Commission-India Task Force reads: “Today Indian manufacturers are producing approximately 7-8 crore doses per month. Even if 100% of this supply was for domestic use, at a target of 50 lakh doses a day, the monthly supplies would fall short by half.” Ansumali and Prakash point out that even the third entry into the market — Sputnik V — says the numbers will be low in May, June, and may be in July beyond which production may ramp up from 5-10 crore doses depending on how their partnerships work.

That is about 18 crore doses. Even if there is a stockpile of another 18 crore doses, the JNCASR faculty said, it will be possible to vaccinate 18-20 crore more people between now and July, given that they will need two doses. “From a national perspective, all people are equal, and everyone deserves a vaccine. But from a public health point of view, not everyone is at the same risk. Risks may be higher with variants in the second wave, but hopefully it will not be drastically different. Compared to seniors, younger age groups of 25 and below have a much lower mortality risk — 15 to 100 times lower — based on different estimates,” says Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-8-states-have-given-1st-dose-to-10-of-people-national-average-is-8-4/articleshow/82190010.cms||Chethan Kumar

From 2,973 active cases on April 1, the figure rose to 5,223 active cases and 1,102 deaths on April 10 and further to 10,027 active cases and 1,206 deaths on April 20. While there is no shortage of beds or oxygen in the hill state so far as 95% Covid patients are in home isolation, realising the gravity of the situation, the state government has increased the strength of beds in hospitals. From the existing 1,650 dedicated beds for Coronavirus patients, the authorities have arranged 2,000 and have plans to further that the bed strength to 3,000 by month-end. The Himachal Pradesh Cabinet will meet in Shimla on Thursday to discuss the situation arising out of the situation. Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur had recently informed that over 90% Covid-19 patients are under home isolation in the state, so the emphasis is on strengthening the mechanism of home isolation. He had directed the doctors to ensure proper treatment and regular monitoring of patients under home isolation and asked the health department to ensure regular monitoring of the health parameters of Covid patients in home isolation. The state government is also requesting the elected representatives of panchayati raj institutions to play a role in keeping a watch on the health condition of those under home isolation. AICC secretary and former minister Sudhir Sharma said that the state government should work on war footing to deal with the second wave and the only effective way to do so is through timely vaccination. Urging the government to undertake door-to-door administering of the vaccine, he said the state has required infrastructure for this. He said all the primary health centres have ice and refrigerators while the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries have refrigerators along with vaccine carriers that could be used to strengthen and maintain the cold chain to ensure the door-to-door vaccination drive. After considering the current situation, the state executive committee-disaster management cell on Tuesday ordered new restrictions. From April 23, there will be total ban on the entry of general public at large in the places of religious worship while all markets, shops except those selling milk, bread, medicine, fruits and vegetables, commercial establishments, including malls, gyms, sports complex and swimming pools, will also remain on Saturdays and Sundays till May 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-hosp-bed-crunch-in-hp-as-95-patients-under-home-monitoring/articleshow/82187624.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Bed availability in hospitals be made public daily: Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Stepping up measures to provide relief to people struck by the lethal run of the Covid second wave, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday directed officials to ensure bed availability in hospitals be made public on a day-to-day basis. Yogi took the decision while holding a review meeting through video conferencing from his official residence. The CM said, the initiative may be implemented through Integrated Control and Command Centres, which act as an interface between patients and hospitals. The move comes a day after Yogi directed officials to double the number of beds in various hospitals catering to Covid patients. He reiterated the decision to raise number of beds in all districts be implemented at the earliest. CM pitches for oxygen supply audit in hospsYogi asked health department to ensure that a minimum of 200 beds are increased in every district. The CM directed the health department to collate data on ICUs and isolation wards in hospitals for swift treatment of patients. Yogi said, beds should also be increased at Era, TS Mishra, Integral, Hind, Prasad, Saxena and Mayo Medical College and sought appointment of nodal officers in these hospitals. The state government has already decided to convert KGMU and Balrampur Hospital into dedicated Covid hospitals. The CM categorically stressed on special attention towards Lucknow and Prayagraj. He said, beds in Prayagraj’s Swaroop Rani, United Medical College and Career hospital should be increased. Maintaining there was no oxygen shortage, Yogi pitched for audit of medical oxygen supplied to hospitals and sought a swift crackdown on those engaged in black marketing. Yogi said, barring critical patients, oxygen supplied be made institutional. He asked officials to ensure that oxygen allocated by the Centre is made available as soon as possible. The CM said, testing of samples be expedited with the help of government as well as private laboratories. Stressing on deployment of officials at oxygen refill centres, Yogi said, distribution should be done in a transparent manner. For this, the health, MSME, industry and home departments should coordinate with each other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bed-availability-in-hospitals-be-made-public-daily-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/82190104.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||India||Scientists sound alarm over triple-mutant ‘Bengal strain’||KOLKATA: The Covid-19 virus that is doing the rounds in Bengal is increasingly being found to be an indigenous triple-mutation (B.1.618), only the second one identified from India after the double mutant type (B.1.617) reported last month, reports Subhro Niyogi. The “Bengal strain”, as a scientist has dubbed it, might be more infective, and — something that experts find particularly worrying — may be capable of escaping a person’s immune surveillance, even if that person was earlier exposed to a virus without this mutation, and even if vaccinated. There has, however, been no scientific research yet to either corroborate or dismiss the fears. ‘Triple-mutant is immune escape variant’ The proportion of B.1.618 has been growing significantly in recent months in Bengal,” said Vinod Scaria, who researches genome mutations at the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology on Twitter, adding, “along with B.1.617 it forms a major lineage in Bengal”. The IGIB is part of the Indian SARS-Cov-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG), which was set up to monitor and study whether Indians were getting foreign variants through travellers. It was during these studies that the double mutant variant (containing the E484Q and L452R mutations) was identified, mainly from Maharashtra samples. What’s worrying scientists is that the triple-mutated variant carries the E484K mutation, a characteristic of the South African and Brazilian variants, which is known to be an immune escape variant. “In other words, you may not be safe from this variant even if you had previously been infected by another strain, or even if you have been vaccinated,” said Sreedhar Chinnaswamy of the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/scientists-sound-alarm-over-triple-mutant-bengal-strain/articleshow/82190016.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Chandigarh||Himachal Pradesh govt deducts salary of its staff to upgrade health infra||SHIMLA: To deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, the Himachal Pradesh government has once again decided to deduct the salaries of its employees. According to an order issued by secretary (health), class I and II employees’ salary for two days would be deducted, while the deduction would be of a day for class III and IV employees. The BJP government’s decision has invited criticism from opposition Congress, whose state president Kuldeep Singh Rathore described the move as “anti-people and anti-employee”. Himachal Pradesh government has around 1.8 lakh regular employees and 25,779 contractual employees. Last year too, the government deducted one day’s salary of employees. In an order issued on April 17, secretary (health) Amitabh Awasthi cited the second wave of Covid-19. He said despite several social welfare measures undertaken by the state government during the pandemic, hardships might still be faced by people, particularly poor and marginalized sections of society. “It is, therefore, felt that concerted and coordinated efforts on part of state government, civil society and all citizens are required to strengthen healthcare infrastructure in the state in this hour of need, for which funds are required,” said the order. Rathore said if the state government did not have funds to fight Covid pandemic, then why did it take a new helicopter on lease. He said it would have been better had the government reduced its unwanted expenditure. Through the order, secretary (health) has directed all drawing and disbursing officers in various departments, public sector undertakings and autonomous bodies under state government to deduct two days’ salary of class I and II employees, except healthcare workers working on regular and contract basis from whom one day’s salary would be deducted. The deducted amount will be deposited in the Himachal Pradesh Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund. The state government has also appealed to well-off families to contribute and donate generously to this fund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/himachal-govt-deducts-salary-of-its-staff-to-upgrade-health-infra-for-covid-fight/articleshow/82187806.cms||---

---||India||India should be a ‘country of particular concern’ for religious freedom: USCIRF||WASHINGTON: A US Congress-constituted quasi-judicial body on Wednesday asked the Biden administration to designate four nations, including India, as “countries of particular concern”, alleging that religious freedom conditions there in 2020 continued their negative trajectory. The annual report of the US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) recommended the US state department to redesignate 10 nations as “countries of particular concern”. These are Myanmar, China, Eritrea, Iran, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. USCIRF in its non-binding report also recommended the department add three more countries to the list: Russia, Syria and Vietnam. “Designate India as a ‘country of particular concern’, for engaging in and tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations, as defined by the International Religious Freedom Act,” USCIRF said. India has in the past said that the American body on international religious freedom has chosen to be guided only by its biases on a matter on which it has no locus standi. “Our position remains that we see no locus standi for a foreign entity to pronounce on the state of our citizens’ constitutionally protected rights,” India’s ministry of external affairs had said last year. The USCIRF report urges the state department to impose sanctions on individuals and entities in India responsible for violations of religious freedom. However, the recommendations weren’t unanimous. USCIRF commissioner Johnnie Moore has officially registered his dissent. “Of all the countries in the world, India should not be a ‘country of particular concern’. It is governed by a pristine constitution,” Moore said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-should-be-a-country-of-particular-concern-for-religious-freedom-uscirf/articleshow/82190227.cms||---
